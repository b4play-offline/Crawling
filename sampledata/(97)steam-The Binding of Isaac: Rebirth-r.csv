0,its a very simple and fun game with a lot of diffrent items that keeps the game fresh.
1,"I have spent over 1000 hours playing this game. It's safe to say that i enjoy it and would recommend it to others, however it will cause a lot of frustration to those unused to roguelikes and a high chance of dying early on in the game if you are like me and not perhaps the best skilled at playing video games. That said, the controls are easy to pick up and master and once you can remember enemy plans and movements you should be set for an entertaining game or two. Items can also synergise and stack in some bafflingly amazing combinations so keep trying out all the weird items you get and see what fits your playstyle. All DLCs are highly recommended as well."
2,"SUPER FUN! no matter how much you've played it, you will always have different experience"
3,Nope. The newest expansion was an example of people butt plugging each other in the office and shitting out the worst fucking ideas. I think I'm officially done playing this.
4,funni cri man

63,What a good game
64,this games a shit of piece
65,best indie game
66,"This game has cost me many many hours, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. The elements of perma-death per run and the sometimes hilariously overpowered synergies make for memorable runs and there's a very clever and ingenious story to this game too, with many easter-eggs and inside-jokes. The fact I can start, pause, and end a game without needing to wait for other online players is very appealing to me personally.
This game has endless replayability, with does also make it quite risky in terms of addiction and marathon-runs.

9.7/10: Amazing, will steal your life, and I'm still not over that one run I ruined with a single item."

83,"Bruh, just play this game. You're literally missing out on replayability the game."
84,best game of my life
85,"poop, flys, buttholes, corn poop, satan. perfect game."
86,"Addicting top down shooter with heavy roguelike mechanics. The game feels smooth to play and the enemies are very diverse. All the characters feel unique, some feel like slight variations of the default character, while some play very differently, it works with what it's trying to do.

Items play a major part on the game, a lot of the items are interesting and can improve your run. There are some duds here and there, but most of them aren't bad. Some could even make a run better in a strange way. Unfortunately, this means the game is quite a bit luck based, but there's more than enough good items to make runs drift towards success rather than failure.

There's tons of unlocks and content that'll last you for a long time, and if that isn't enough the game has official mod support via the Steam Workshop. The DLC also adds onto the game quite well.

Overall, I recommend The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth for people who like top down roguelite shooters. The devs put so much love in this game and I'm still going for unlocks after more than 200 hours of playtime."
87,"Good game, played it for a little bit"

106,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.

122,"very cool and fun game
[spoiler] except delirium of course. [/spoiler]"
123,"The Binding Of Isaac is a game about a little boy trying to escape the world around him through the use of his very vivid imagination, gameplay wise theres always something to unlock and new enemies to slay, so if youre into Arcade shooters with a lively world and lore together with a addon system where powerups keeps changeing how your character looks while also buffs or slows down your character depending on what you pick, all in all i cant do anything but recommend this game!"

159,cool game
160,"Due to religious elements this game may not be for everyone. It's never short on things to do, unlock, and discover. It's hard to play which can be extremely frustrating at times. I've had this game for several years now and I still haven't unlocked everything. I'm not super skilled or anything so it could just be that I suck at it lol. This is hands down one of my favorite games to play."
161,I don't why but i think i became Isaac playing this game!
162,Played it a bit and it became quite addictive. The best part is every run is different

177,w game w story  w isaac  w game play
178,"One of my all time favorite games.  I've sunk more hours into this than any other game on steam, and there's a good reason for it.  Its an addictive game that is just plain fun to play.  Its definitely a time sink, but worth it.  Progressing deeper and deeper into the game, unlocking new items, characters, game modes, *winning*, then playing around at getting different item synergies, breaking the game, trying new strategies.

Also, it very fun to explain what the game is about.  Highly recommend."
179,big fun
180,yes
181,"This game was already great, but Repentance really put the last needed nail in the coffin. The gameplay is great, the sprites are top notch, and the countless item synergies make every run feel fun and different. Is what I would say if the game didn't have some of the most chaotic RNG that can either give you 3 god runs in a row or make you hold down your R key for 40 minutes trying to get a half decent start. If you don't like the base game, try one of the hundreds of mods the community makes. There's plenty of amazing ones ranging from new characters to entire game overhauls. I would definitely give this game a shot if you enjoy dungeon crawling and Rouge-Like elements."

247,i hate dingle
248,"There is always a new combination for this game to try out and it's awesome! This is the best rouge-like game I've played so far and enjoy playing it hours at a time. Learning the new items is daunting but there is no rush, however i enjoy unlocking new items and learning how to get to each boss. I haven't unlocked tainted characters but I've seen game play and i love the concept behind a few of them. All in all, this is a great game to buy!"

the weird gore-y items and gameplay just goes so well u can just hop into the game with no experience and have fun and if u want to get good at the game u can learn more with every run i recommend u buy the entire dlc pack if its on a sale but if u just want to get started and dont want to mess around with mods the normal rebirth version of the game is still fun"
275,"Don't play this unless you're a masochist. but if you are, THIS GAME IS AMAZING. 1000/10. Would die again"

282,All of my friends had this game when it first came out and I never saw the appeal. After buying it I have no doubt in my mind hundreds of hours will go into this game. The game play is very addictive and never repetitive which allows for your play style to become more creative the more hours you put in. 10/10

Add in the mods, and you've got yourself a whole universe to fiddle around for years to come, challenges to frustrate you into breaking your keyboard."

333,it gud
334,One of the best games ever made.
335,yes
336,cool game with better mods
337,nice cpool
338,Has a wide variety of ways to beat the game. Really great DLCs which make it 100% worth buying them. 9/10
339,I can finally shoot babys without the cops showing up
340,Amazing game with almost infinite hours of content for players that want a challenge. 10/10
341,wait huh?
342,"It's a pretty challenging game, but it's also really fun too. Sometimes you have to look up what each item does, but there's a wiki for the game so they aren't hard to find. Overall 9/10."
343,"Overall a great, funny and challenging game, with really amazing mechanics"
344,"It's pretty good, though I don't see myself putting in more than 4 hours maybe"
345,"I cry, I enjoy"
346,WENO
347,how play?
348,"Might be the best ""bang for the buck"" game I've ever purchased. This game has soooooo much content - hundreds of hours worth in the base game alone, with each DLC (especially Repentance) adding much more. Most of that content is in the form of unlockable items which appear in future runs (as in, HUNDREDS of unlockable items), and this leads to a rogue-lite that keeps expanding as you play it (for dozens and dozens of hours)."
349,"It's good. Lots of things you can do, including gambling. 10/10"
350,.
351,Great game
352,good game if you hate yourself or god
353,"very gamer swag, im twerking as im writing this because it is nae nae wild crazy moment. poggers1!11!!1!!"
354,Permeated the roguelike genre with it's novelty like a wet fart
355,"It is not often that I say I like game that pisses me off this much, but The Binding of Isaac is a unique breed of infuriating. 

Isaac doesn't ask for frame-perfect execution, or million-to-one odds. It asks for consistency, and critical thinking. Can you use the Keys, Bombs and Coins you found to their full potential. Can you tell whether any two items will help or hinder each other? Is it *really* worth doing that challenge room? Not always. Not even 400 hours in. But that is what make it so compelling.

The Binding of Isaac is a game whose difficulty unifies its community. It often feels like the game is out to get you, refusing to give you healing items for what feels like an eternity, giving you the worst room layouts imaginable, and hiding almost all of the good items behind herculean tasks like doing anything as Jacob And Esau. This makes many victory feel like you got away with something you shouldn't have; like you beat the developers at their own game. 

Now, this all probably sounds quite intimidating. more than a thousand items, a hundred or so bosses, thirty four characters, and almost 700 achievements? Sounds like you'd need a doctorate just to make it past the menu. Luckily, people new to the game can look to the library's worth of valuable information that fans have compiled. Of course, knowledge isn't all this fanbase shares. Bosses like Delirium being unforgiving and occasionally unfair brings the whole community, pros and newbies, together in their unanimous contempt.

Speaking of the community, Isaac might just have the best modding scene of any game I've played. There are mods that will tailor the game in any way you desire. Whether you're sick of enemies that hide in shells, want more bosses to fight, or just want to stop checking the wiki for every new item you find, it is all easy to find, and easy to install. 

Top it off with a sparse, but effective story about substance abuse, religious dogma, and the crippling loneliness living in a neglectful household, and you have a game that will keep you coming back for years to come."
356,Super fun roguelite. Really great game play and the replay-ability is damn near unparalleled.
357,fun
358,"""""It's good"""""
359,"This is by far one of the most addicting games I have ever played. I love how each run is slightly different, and is dependent upon other things that have been previously unlocked, items that have been upgraded, etc. It's always a surprise and nothing has gotten boring or repetitive! The storyline is also super interesting. 11/10"
360,"I liek dis one.
"
361,not a game for me but i cant refund :(
362,Just buy the game
363,isaac is a very cool guy!!!!

376,BIND FO ISAC
377,epic game full of awesome items for you to unlock
378,yes
379,absolutely love the game played this for as long as the game has been out im so excited to see what come out next ill will  grab that too
380,"This game is super fun and then turns into a mega grind to get all the achievements, the items that are super fun to use become super hard to find and you most likely will get the worst items ever forcing you to restart 20 minutes into a run because there is no possible way to kill a check-mark boss because of lacking stats, and again, mediocre items that have terrible effects. I can't stress enough the amount of time wasted because this game will never give me a single damage up item which means I will spend up to 10 minutes on a boss which is not fun and is very tedious. Even more so due to the fact that there are literally 20+ other characters you have to do the same thing for. The challenges are also unbelievably annoying and tedious as some of them force you into using these terrible terrible items basically bashing your head into a wall until you are lucky enough to complete it. The game could be really good if it had like 300 items either completely changed or removed otherwise its an annoying grind that eats at your time, it is super addicting because it can be really really fun but only when the game allows it. At some points past the 400 hr mark I stopped completing the first 3 floors and opt'd to just restarting until I get a decent item and move forward from there, that is not how the game should be played but I feel like I am funneled into it because of the overwhelming amount of garbage the game just gives you as rewards and how frequently you are given bad items at the start of runs. It isn't too much of a problem but as you continue to complete more and more check-marks you start to understand what I mean. I would rather play a game like Elden Ring fist only level one than continue to play this game for how unbelievably annoying this game can be. Good luck ever finding your favorite items because they are quite impossible to find. 

Some positives about the game after that rant are the enemies are abundant and really interesting, the bosses are very creative and give the theme of the game more impact as you discover more about the game itself, most of the characters are quite enjoyable although some of them are bland, The good items make the game very very enjoyable and worthwhile which you get a lot when you first start the game with little achievements, greed mode offers a variation to the base game which is a nice refresher, and finally the challenges although some are just atrocious, aren't terrible they just need item tweaks.

this is a solid game, I believe it needs a small push or two to get to be the best game ever."
381,cool game
382,fun.
383,fuck this game too much RNG. Never gonna play again shit game
384,this game sucks
385,This game truly is a masterpiece as it showed me just how much of a MASOCHIST i am.

408,Poopy game tbh
409,very cool 👍
410,This game is so addictive and vast. I wholeheartedly enjoy the theme and environment it depicts. If you like original and unique ideas get this game. It is simple game play and comforting with the outline and goal of the characters. About 60 hours of game play and I doubt it will stay that way.

461,Good game. Sucks you in.
462,"Ok so, here is the rundown. Basic Rebirth is great and you should buy it if you like games like this. Afterbirth was even better and should be bought instandly. Afterbirth + was bad and should never have existed. Repentance is were over 200 h of my playtime comes from. Amazing mod support, great endgame stuff and this only bad shit in it is the stuff that are leftovers from Afterbirth+. Can be very confusing for newcomers tho, i'd advice to get an external item description mod. Just shows you what every item does. (otherwise you just have to memorise over....I dunno? 900 things?

488,"I played this game when it was still only on Newgrounds and I loved it back then. Now with Repentance instead of loving the game's ending, I cried during the true ending. In my heart it will always be a 10/10, but with the cow on a trash farm McMillen nerfing what becomes meta, I still have the same joy playing this game now compared to back then when I first found the game. Overall the game is a 9.5/10"
489,Honestly one of the greatest games ever made on any console and with it being amplified by the workshop it makes it so enjoyable to play and 100%
490,"theres nothing i can say about this game that hasnt already been said. the content, the countless hours of replay, the collecting- and thats not even including the mods. truly this is one of the pinnacles of all gaming, and has my sincere respect"

501,"The only way I manage to keep playing this game is that I've already degraded myself through other unforgiving ""rage"" genre games (not rage games as in getting over it, rather games with high difficulty and skill ceilings), which has numbed me to the pain that is death and its consequences.
If you are a casual gamer and call people out for ""hax"" in skywars, this game is not for you. Otherwise, have fun dying over and over as you spend 400 hours finally being able to consistently no-hit most room layouts"

With the number of items and unique synergies that they can create when put together you find yourself discovering new things even after you think you've learned and seen all that there could possibly be to discover.

Thank you shithead friends for recommending and fueling (not to forget the funding) my addiction for this game.

554,"Basic review: Stupid enemies and some stupid bosses bad music and everything else is 10/10 and the way the game is structured means there is infinite replayability. Each character is good at different thing with only about 3 being bad/unfun. Super easy to pick up and easy to get good at, althougth definetly install the external item descriptions mod for lots of ease during gameplay. 9/10"
555,"i hate this dumbass game

i play it anyway"
556,"I would honestly say this is one of the best roguelites ever made. There are almost endless item synergies, tons of unlockable characters, multiple endings, different game-modes, and even Steam Workshop support for modding.

574,"This game is honestly pretty good and people should give it some consideration, especially if you really hate yourself and want a little bit of masochism to spice up your life. 

With all due seriousness, this game just has so much content and I'm genuinely impressed at how far it has come and the sheer variety of characters to pick from. 

[spoiler] Please just fucking fix Delirium for the love of god, it's been FIVE GODDAMN YEARS! and this thing is still blatantly unfair and disgusting.   [/spoiler]"
575,"Honest review : this is the best game of its kind, so many mechanics that easy to master. A lot of times and trinkets. Not a lot of tinted rocks but that’s a good thing. You need to look at your surroundings all the time. Different item pools that encourages you to go into curse rooms or secret rooms. Angel or devil, you decide. There’s no run that can’t be the same as the old one, literally new game. A lot of different characters that you can unlock and find the best of your play style. But each character has it’s unlocks, encouraging you to play it, sometimes forces you. There’s times where the game gets boring and sometimes makes you rage but hey, that’s almost every game.
Personally, I will love this forever and would like to recommend it to people. Thank you for your time to read this, thank you Isaac team for making this, thank you. ( Edmund can I leave the basement now? )"

[b] my favorite roguelike game, insane replay value and amazing unique lore/aesthetics [/b] 

[h1] what i love about this game: [/h1]
[list]
[*] [b] lore: [/b]
 + the subtle story telling and mystery of it peaks my curiosity and is what keeps me so interested
[*] [b] aesthetic: [/b]
 + definitely the most unique game i've ever experienced with its grotesque, religious themes and such
[*] [b] music: [/b]
 + really good! it's very fitting, i also listen to it when im not even playing the game lol
[*] [b] enemy variety: [/b]
 + both melee and projectile, it can be bullet hellish sometimes, but most enemies have distinct patterns of attack you can learn (not all of them just swarm you as soon as you enter a room or even directly try to harm you)
[*] [b] content & replay value: [/b]
 + randomly generated dungeon crawler with lots of different environments and visually interesting enemies. the amount of content in this game is actually insane
[*] [b] difficulty: [/b]
 + from my experience, there's a decent learning curve here, and a lot of times it's up to rng whether or not you'll have a ""good run"" (finding good items/upgrades) (imo it's impossible to win without good items and such) but even the ""bad"" runs are still a fun challenge, and a lot of the replay value comes from bad runs, so it's a good thing that good runs are more rare.
[*]  [b] quest for unlocking some characters:  [/b]
 + for some characters there aren't any written objectives (you'll have to look them up) , for these characters there's a unique journey you must take to unlock them, very fun going on these alt missions
[/list]

[h1] cons: [/h1] 
the only real con for me is how heavily RNG based this game is, which is the best and worst feature, because sometimes you just get completely fucked by bad items/enemy spawns, meaning your ""skill"" is just kinda thrown out the window at that point.

[b] enter the gungeon comparison: [/b]

i hated isaac when i first played it, coming from having played etg first, i thought etg was so much superior... i was wrong.
this game just appeals to my aesthetic more. sure the actual gameplay of etg is a little better, but the overall themes/lore/art of isaac is just way more unique and likeable for me. with etg, aside from the whole ""everything is a gun"" thing, it kinda lacks personality imo..."

578,"""You need to repent, you need to confess your sins and become saved! LET HIS LIGHT INSIDE YOU""

In all honesty, I was going to leave a joke review here, but it would be far too much of an injustice to do so. I started playing Isaac because i was bored on a school holiday, and saw it in a Foekoe video, where it looked interesting. Seeing as it was on sale and I had money to burn, I thought ""why not?"" and bought all the DLC for it. Prior to this the closest thing to Isaac I had played was a few Zelda games on the DS, and I enjoyed the experience of other hard games, so I had a good idea that i would enjoy it. HOLY SHIT do I enjoy it. Countless hours I've spent on this game, trying run after run of unlocking each ending and boss and completion mark. Nothing I have ever played has come close to the insanity that is the Binding of Isaac. The story, the art, the chaotic bosses and the pure rush of running into a boss battle at a half heart and dodging each attack and laying into him with a barrage of bloody lasers. If you were on the fence about trying the game, do it. Repentance is the best addition to any game that I have ever played, and I will keep playing (live on my twitch occasionally at twitch.tv/smujlive ) until I get Dead God, and then some. This is genuinely the most fun I have had in any singleplayer game ever (there's multiplayer but it's a death sentence for your friendship). Also, the steam workshop is filled with one of the most creative and stupid mod creating fanbase of any game. You get mods like EID which are practically essential to any new player, and then things like Saul Hearts. I love this game with all my heart."

591,"this game shouldn't have done as well as it did, it was clearly designed to push again modern mainstream gaming troupes, released over a decade ago and it is still thriving and is one of if not the most celebrated rogue like of all time, but what makes this game so popular? the replay-ability, the art style, endless set of challenges for you to overcome? in short, its all of those things and so much more. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BINDING OF ISAAC:

in long, Edmund Mcmillians first game, super meat boy, was a smash indie hit and left the studio and Edmund swimming in cash, so obviously whats the first thing Edmund Mcmillian decides to do? Make a game true to him, true to his experiences, without fear of failing, without the worry of money and make it as disgusting, controversial and as out of the norm as he wanted. So thats exactly what he did, games like Spleunky and Zelda formed the basis of the gameplay, but what formed the idea was Edmund's traumatic childhood experiences, growing up in a abusive household with addict parents who later found god and hyperchristianised themselves, Edmund found inspiration to create the religious themes of the game and frankly the whole story of the game from this. Actual development started when Edmund approached Florian, a game dev he had worked with previously and they worked to together to complete the original flash port of the binding of isaac in only 3 months. The game was then slapped on steam for 3 pounds and by then edmund was moving onto the next project, however months after release sales climbed rapidly, primarily due to youtube and media online. Which then lead to the first expansion which basically doubled its size, Wrath of the lamb, while i do not have alot to say about wrath of the lamb, what i can say is that this update lead to the engine change of the binding of isaac as nicalis approached Edmund about a console port which Edmund somehow turned into Nicalis completely recoding the game and overhauling it, every asset was remade, new content, new items, new bosses, new characters. when this update was complete it was called The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth. 

Rebirth: (to be completed in the future)

636,"I highly recommend this game. It a lot of fun to just half my screen and then throw up netflix or something and just chill out and play. However, I would not recommend buying the new dlc that came out which completely changes the game. I read reviews when it first had come out and saw that others said similar things. I only bought the dlc in the last few months and i regret it. It feels like it completely changes the gameplay for the worst and since then i have significantly cut back the amount of time i put into it."
637,"The Binding of Isaac was one of my favourites for years and rebirth has totally brought back my adoration for this gory, wacky, dark, hilarious, and utterly unique story. Rebirth is perfect for long time Isaac players who are bored of the OG game. Adds new bosses, levels, items, and hundreds of achievements for all the completionists out there to grind for.
Mods: works beautiful with just about very mod out there. If anitbirth is too much for you, rebirth will hit the spot. I also highly recommend the DLCs if you're able to get them, def worth the money, same with browsing steam workshop for mods as there are many helpful HUDs you can add as well as cool enemies and bosses that were cut from other games/DLCs.
All in all 10/10 game, truly can't think of a single negative thing."

Protect me from violence

688,aaaauuuugh
689,At writing this I have put in 662 hours into the Binding of Issac. I bought this game during Afterbirth+ and had an absolute blast. As 1 review put it this game wants to be broken and break I did smiling like an idiot the whole time. During Afterbirth+ words like item bloat were tossed around and I had to agree there were to many items but most of the time you could make something work. I had FUN. When Repentance was announced I was so excited for the new possibilities. I bought the DLC at launch day and couldn't wait to play it. So many new thing to do and new items to find. However I now see the developer really likes the smell of their own brand. The item bloat is REAL 700 items and most feel like cheap trash. Once great items have been nerfed into near uselessness I can't even say I am having fun anymore it has become a chore of pure habit of once loving this game. Will I continue to play it on occasion sure but I just find myself playing a game that once brought me joy now leave me feeling empty and sad at what it's become.

720,game is ok
721,Yes I recommend it because you will have bitches and huge penis after playing it.
722,"The Best Part:
This game is a zelda-inspired dungeon crawler rougelike game where you play as a bald baby fighting some pretty disgusting monsters, angels, satan, himself, some more pretty disgusting monsters, satan but mega, his mom, his mom but disgusting and buff version, his moms heart in his moms womb, himself as a fetus in his moms womb, some white skull thingy that shapeshifts into other bosses and finally, christian tv show coming out of their family tv, along with his mom but extra buff with 3 eyes and some horns. WITH HIS TEARS while going deeper and deeper with an excavation project under their home. Pretty much explains for itself.

The Worst Part:
I think the worst part about this game is that it's mostly luck-based rather than skill. The room drops are extremely unfair, if you dont have flight and are playing on hard mode (which is basically the normal isaac experience) most of the times you arent even getting that drop. The mother boss requires those pickups and if you dont get them in the required floors, you arent going to mother. Fine, you can just go to the other final boss, mega stanley, but that requires angel rooms and angel chance is stupid in this game. First you have to get a devil deal on the second floor, then 36% chance on the third, 67% on the fourth and 100% on the fifth. so chances are (IF YOU DONT TAKE RED HEART DAMAGE AT ALL) you will probably get your angel room on the fourth or the fifth floor and thats only 1 stanley door key. for the second key you need to get another angel room (which your angel chance is like 20%) and you are on your last floor before womb. The thing is if the angel door spawns on top of the mines door or whatever you arent even getting that 100% angel which is pretty funny considering how hard it is to get only one angel room. Also yeah if you leave the boss room and come back the angel room has a pretty high chance to dissapear. Anyways lets assume that you got the 2 stanley key pieces, you go to mega stan and you kill the guy, you have a 50% chance to spawn the portal to the actual ""final"" boss of the game, crazy white skull thingy. Now i like this game, a lot. I think what makes this game are the incredibly trash items and tear effects that have almost no chance of actually appearing when you need them stacking and synergizing with each other. but after 150 hours i really feel like you rely on good luck to get actually good runs. That was my first impression to the game, that it was too hard and unfair and relied on luck most of the time. But after my first 5 hours i really got into the game and after defeating most of the main bosses with non-tainted characters i think that its really boring to go through like 6 stages of unfair mess that the game keeps throwing at you and sometimes its not even a skill issue that you couldnt dodge that tear its probably because you had very low speed and maybe because you didnt get a protection item. I think that the challenge shouldnt be having good luck or not, i think it should be about actual skill and experience. For example to support all this rant: once i had a run where i had a really good start, got lucky with the items and was planning on going mother since that was the only completion mark left on that character. But of course, isaac being isaac, i didnt get a key drop in the first 2 floors, and had to restart. Sometimes with characters like the lost since they nerfed the holy mantle with repentance, one brimstone beam is more than enough to end your run if you think you can get away from being inside that beam in 1 second. Good luck with 0.85 speed there buddy. Dont get me wrong, i like this game. Just before you buy it, know that its not perfect."

Though, the difficulty maaaay increase as you go further into the dungeon, increasing the likelihood of suffering, fueling Edmund Mcmillen-- that stupid sucker-- that COW ON A TRASH FARM's evil intentions!

This game unleashed the 11 year old inside of me that loved doodling crazy torture chamber... maybe I needed therapy... 10/10 would laugh at death again.

But for real, amazing $5 game if you like puzzle games and organized chaos. Beyond worth the price.

It is a good game but you can play an online game for free this only offers slightly better game play
and graphics. Find some here: http://www.kongregate.com/ragdoll-games
They are almost as good, paying 4 pounds/5dollars is to much in my opinion. Instead wait for a sale and buy gmod.This game need a lot of updates to be worth it.

762,Very interesting learnig curve and difficulty options.
763,rngesus aproves
764,games meh at the very least
765,"The art design, music, and mechanics of this game aren't commonplace at all. This game makes you hate it most of the time, because of how unforgiving it is. But that makes the good moments all that sweeter!"

772,It's all fun and games untill you realise the true lore of this game... Still very fun.
773,im gonna look back at this review in a few months and see how mny hours i have
774,good.
775,Its alright
776,"40M. Married for nearly 14 years. The novelty of sex has worn off now that I can have it whenever I want. Sure, every now and then sex is fun, but I no longer want it every day or every few days.

I recently discovered tboi and started playing daily. I've become obsessed, and I play at least 15-20 runs before bed each and every day. It satisfies me mentally in a way that nothing else ever has, and now there are times my wife has wanted to have sex but I just want to keep playing tboi.

tboi has replaced mating, and I'm okay with it."
777,"This is my favorite game of all time. I have sunk more time in this game than any other game I have ever played, across many platforms. I recently achieved Dead God on the switch version of the game. After all this time I still can't put this game down."
778,is good game yes
779,"Great rogue like game with many horror and grotesque elements. If you are squeamish please exercise caution. If you are sensitive to religious elements do be aware that it makes up majority of the game's plot and items.

 Nonetheless, the game is very replayable and infuriating at times. Would recommend!"
780,great game. can be hard sometimes. entertained me for days. would recomend. my dad got almost more into it than me after hesitating to buy it for me lol
781,"God is wonderful, and just when you think that he's done something horrible you realize it's all for a purpose."
782,this game is too rng dependent
783,"Great game, absolutely recommend to anyone"
784,"Honestly, one of the best games I've played. The Binding of Isaac has been one of my favorite games for the past 4 yrs. The simple game play has kept me coming back time and time again. Although sometimes i find the games ""Troll Engine"" a bit mentally taxing at times."
785,I think this is game is alright.

797,love it!!
798,just found my parents divorce papers (tears up!)

826,"Do I like it? Yes. Do I recommend it? Yes***.  Get it on sale though.  The rage this game can induce will make you wanna break you keyboard or controller so you'll need to save some money for a replacement.

***Yes, BUT. (SPOILERS) In the one DLC, the ""alternate path"" (sewer and mines) you have to take to fight ""Mother"" is total BS. Collecting the knife pieces is a pain in the arse and then fighting something on normal that makes Hard Delirium look easy...""what if we made this game fun and then didn't."" Jeez-us-cry-st on a bicycle. Even on ""normal"" the only hope I have is to use the mod that removes Item pools and weighs every item to 1 (essentially a perma Chaos Star) and hope I get a game breaking item set before I get there (great mod, BTW, breathes life back into what would otherwise be equivalent to bashing your head with a brick for hours on end)...could have at least given the late game bosses a health bar so I'd know if I was even remotely close to winning. As is, it's borderline PTSD inducing to get so far and just die because the game decided you shouldn't win (anyone who plays this will know what I'm talking about)."

The Updates are still frequent in this summer end of 2022 and the modding community is vibrant and relentless in forever improving this game I like to call a masterpiece.

861,"Binding of Isaac Rebirth is probably my favorite rogue-like ever. Just the way you can have so many build options while still making the game challenging. Once you get the hang of the game you can do some crazy stuff and sometimes it will get so crazy, the game will just straight up crash. 

10/10 would shoot tears at shit again"

929,"This game was good with afterbirth, was decently balanced, had a decent chance at good items, and over all had decent mechanics when it came to angel/devil room chance, tolerable bosses, and plenty of good quality time spent. with repentance, early game is garbage. Trash items with buffed enemies, unbalanced bullet hell moments in bosses in the first few floors, and new mechanics that CAN be good but aren't tweaked, I really cant reccommend this game for someone just picking it up, try a different game like hades or something, better made at least."

932,this is one of the best dungeon like games i've played so far. It has so much content in it that it may take 3 years to 100% this game.

934,I love playing with naked children!
935,Bad game. 10/10 best game
936,"very good game, only problem is the difficulty"
937,Has been one of my favourite games for a good 7 years. You are doing yourself a disservice if you do not download and play this.
938,"Why I loved (but no longer do love) Binding of Isaac

Binding of Isaac is a game about poop, blood and tears. All 3 of which contain traces of matter that hold information that let you identify who produced them. I enjoy all 3 but with a very high chance for a level to contain poop, it was hard for me to contain my excitemennt.

I was disappointed to find that only on screen characters produce blood and tears. There is little to no mystery. It is obvious who is producing them and why they are being produced. Sadness is everywhere and it's a very cliche and obvious expression of blood and tear production. There is no mystery for the game to be based around. No secrets to unlock. No power to be gained. This is why it's ultimately dissatisfying to play if these aspects are why it's entertaininng to you because this river is very shallow and goes nowhere.

The best aspect of the game is the poop. I believe this is why the game achieved such popularity. Poop is the best. The smell, the texture, the taste, the way it makes my skin feel when I rub it on me. There is barely a use for poop I haven't experienced and love. Walking into a new room and finding poop is the best. There can be many things inside the poop and it's your job to explore it. Poop can contain riches in the form of coins and power ups and even if it doesn't, you still had the fun of exploring poop. This is why I loved the game. Poop was plentiful and I was free to do what I wanted with the poop and the poops contents. Getting the power up that lets you fill the room with poop is euphoric. On first use there has been no game that made me feel as good as the way I felt on that fateful day.

Where the game falls apart is the history of the poop. There is no mechanic that allows you to find who or why the poop was produced. I want to know who put it there so I can inquire as to why, how, and what they ate to give it the texture, taste and smell that it has. I was hoping that a DLC would give me the option to explore these dreams but the developers have said they have finished adding content to the game without adding the mechanics I crave.

Fuck them. Fuck Isaac. Fuck everything about it. Uninstalled."
939,Very cool. Are people still simping for syren? I hope not.
940,"im failing my finals and i blame this god's forbidden game

10/10"
941,Good game
942,"Possibly the best roguelike of all time.  The original Binding of Isaac was one of the first roguelikes I played and nothing else has really topped it when it comes to certain aspects of the gameplay.  In particular, it handles a thousand different weapon combinations in a way that is super interesting and still baffles me. 

That is the best thing about this game in my opinion.  I could talk about a bunch of things that make it a great game -- the difficulty, characters, story, world, bosses, enemies, variation, unlockables -- but nothing is more impressive to me than the way it handles all the different items combining into one character.

You can essentially unlock hundreds of different items slowly over each run, all unlocked with some assortment of triggers that're never really fully explained.  These all affect the way your character moves, attacks, or interacts with the world.  There are so many creative ideas implemented in these items, and the brilliant programming somehow melds the dozens of them you get together into a unique feeling character that makes every run feel different.  

And unlike a lot of other games that pretend to have a ton of items but lack the sort of depth that Binding of Isaac has, these are not just passive stat adjustments.  Many of them are, but there are enough weird items mixed in there that completely mess with how you attack or move that the combinations truly do feel unique.  There are a lot of lesser roguelikes that essentially give you an assortment of static weapons and stat boosts that modify how well they work, but with Isaac you sort of build your own weapon and character in a way that feels way more impactful.

I have spent 362.2 hours of my life trying to beat this game and have barely touched half of it.  If you don't spoil how to unlock things, I can guarantee you will be playing this for a very very long time.  You can probably get hundreds of hours out of it even with a guide, there's just so much to find and build around that it never really gets old, and the challenge is real."

Recently it's been uninstalled every day. The other day I uninstalled it twice.

One big con: unfortunately, seems like Isaac 2 is not in design (or I'm unaware of), and I feel sad that step by step the achievements get achieved and the characters and secrets are revealed and the game is finite in general, however big it seemed in the start. I envy people which are yet to play the game."

1021,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.

Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

1024,"I still suck at this game, but I must say its solid. It has a colossal amount of unlocks, the most of any game I've seen, so you certainly will be hard-pressed to run out of stuff to unlock. I must say though this game generally is difficult and at times REDONKULOUSLY difficult if you go out of your way to find and do certain challenges/characters. So in a nutshell, if you don't like difficult games, this may not be for you. Other than the difficulty though I personally don't really have anything big to knock this game for, and have enjoyed it for many reasons, difficult or not, because I firstly like difficulty in games and secondly theres lossa gud content."

1095,"[b]TL;DR + didn't ask + ratio at the end[/b]


I have played this game for long enough that I feel like I can make a review on it's quality, and boy oh boy you should buckle up because I have things to say.

This game was my entry point to rougelikes, and frankly when I played it when it was only Rebirth/Afterbirth, I enjoyed it. But it is only now that I start to see the true colors. 

I recommend this game to anyone that craves rougelikes, but the game has some upstanding issues that make me go ""God I wanna end myself"":


[h1][b]""Game, PLEASE, give me a fucking dmg up it's DEPTHS FUCKING II""[/b][/h1]

Let's cut right to the chase: this game is VERY rng based. Now that alone isn't bad, because games like these have potentially unlimited replay value: every run is different. And I'll give it to the game, I never felt bored from the monotony of your regular run, because of the item combinations and synergies. However, the RNG in TBoI is WAY too controlling of your enjoyment of the game. I'm sure that this happened to all of us: a run that gave absolutely zero dps items and caused the fights to elongate to infinity. Hence why a good amount of players hold the R button until they get a good item in the first floor because they do not want to endure the potential cbt no damage ups run. Having the RNGesus decide whether you win or not is a very red flag, this is even worse when there are items or item combinations which can win you the game outright, like Dr. Fetus/Kamikaze/Ipecac + Pyromaniac, Brimstone + Homing, C Section + literally anything, the list goes on.
But your items isn't the only thing that is decided by RNG, the enemies are controlled by it as well. For example, enemies firing high speed tears in random directions without any telegraph whatsoever, a boss that can charge at you without warning, moving fast enough to go across the entire boss arena in less than a second or even a boss that can straight up teleport on you, the fact that the game can either spawn a Fistula-tier boss or one of the more complex regular bosses in Chapter 4, the list goes on. I cannot state how many times I felt like the game cucked me over. When you receive damage it is supposed to be your fault, not the game's but I feel like 35% of the times I received damage it was because I got bad RNG.

This is by far my biggest problem with the game and it is quite massive. Many other problems are slight and listing them will iterally take ages, so I'll pick some of them:

-Edmund still didn't fix Hush's bug where the delay between attacks below 40% is increased dramatically (after supposedly it being a bug)
-The existence of: Lumps, Walking Hosts, Willo (flies that circle around you), every single spider enemy (except the Trite), The Bloat, Mask + Heart enemy, Mask of Infamy, Imps, Bulbs, all Clotty variants, Camilo Jr., Needle and it's Ashpit variant, Rag Mega, Triple Grimace, Blue Champion Gurdy Jr., The Pile, Mama Gurdy, Mr. Fred, The Scourge, Delirium, Super and Ultra Pride

Ommiting that, the game has some good points, that being that it is quite enjoyable when you get a good roll, and having a good amount of challenge characters allows veterans of the game to not get bored. 

Overall it's a 7/10

TL;DR
i recommend, has an infinite amount of replay value, but it's heavy dependance on RNG brings it down by a bunch"
1096,I cried on some poop in a sewer and it gave me a nickle. 10/10
1097,"Great story telling, very challenging, and Playable for hours and hours. If you are having trouble, watch a Youtuber play it (Like Hutts), or get  a slower computer. The slower your computer, the easier the game is. :)
Expect to die to each new boss at least once before figuring out how to fight them"

1102,"I've wish I had never found this game, but now that I have I can't go back"
1103,Awesome card game that has debt no doubt
1104,fuck this game
1105,"This is a really fun roguelike game, and probably my favorite one of all time. Every new run you load up is randomized, with different items, bosses, and stages each run, and many different characters to pick from, with different stats, so that it doesn't feel repetitive. However, newcomers may find the game difficult at first, so I suggest familiarizing yourself with the game's mechanics before you tackle most of the final bosses."

1112,"Don't play this if you're a completionist, you'll suffer for as long as I have. 10/10"
1113,"Amazing game! The Binding of Isaac (TBoI) is a game that, once you know what you're doing, I just keep coming back to, there's always a new goal or new challenge, something to work towards; that being said, if you don't know what to look for, it can be nearly impossible to actually ""progress"" in the sense of finding new bosses, new maps, etc. TboI is a game that you pretty much NEED the wiki guide to if you want to get the full experience, whilst this may not be desirable for everyone, I personally think it adds a lot more depth and removes the repetitive nature of many rogue-likes. Would definitely recommend <3"
1114,rage
1115,Fun christian game
1116,dont play (too much time!) booya!
1117,SO FAR THE GAME IS AMAZING  the binding of issac is an adventure and a half the game offers a wide vareity of play styles and tons of diffrent builds depending on the iteams you pick up so far the game has offered everything ive looked for and i cant wait to unlock more stuff in the future

1133,"Finally beat the final boss, oh wait..."
1134,"People claim The Binding of Isaac is Satanic. In my opinion, The BoI is a lot less Satanic than ziocuck evangelical ""christian"" boomers who want to build the 3rd temple and annihilate humanity so they don't have to die and get sucked into space to live forever with space Jesus. None of that schizo stuff is in the bible tho and these ""christians"" tolerate all this lgbtqP and child genital removal happening to their children in public schools. Basically the game is about boomer evangelicals posing as Christians and summoning the Devil and you get to poop on the Devil until he is dead. Based and Christpilled!"
1135,This game is seriously so fun to play when you have free time. The bosses and retro style just add so much extra spice to this game. I would recommend 10/10

1138,"I used to be married. I had a lovely wife, two kids, a dog. I then played The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. 1000+ hours later, my wife has left me. She took the kids. She took the dog. My poor dog. I miss him. I don't care about the wife or kids, I just care about the dog. Was it worth it? No... no it wasn't... The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is awful and I don't recommend it. It is impossible to get into without the three DLCs and multiple mods that provide quality of life features that should be in the game. Speaking of mods, the modding API is awful and it is honestly sad that the developers charge people to use it. I want to cry."
1139,"One of the best rogue-likes ever made is made anew in this enhanced edition that features greater procedural generation, new bosses and chambers and a treasure trove of unlockable items and characters."

1149,"After playing cautiously and losing 40 some odd times in a row I decided to throw caution to the wind and sold all my health to the devil, took every ""bad"" item that came my way and became unstoppable. Even after 600+ hours I still find item combos and have that ""how is this gonna work??"" moments.  The randomness of the items and their synergies make Isaac super frustrating and super fun."

Isaac was simple. And they were both Isaac. That was, until the Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac... ""YOUR ISAAC HAS BECOME ISAAC BY ISAAC, HE NEEDS TO BE ISAAC."" ""I will do my best to save Isaac, my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called to Isaac. ""ISAAC'S ISAAC IS STILL ISAAC. HE NEEDS TO BE CUT OFF FROM ALL THAT IS ISAAC IN THIS ISAAC, AND CONFESS HIS ISAAC."" ""I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac... ""YOU'VE DONE AS I ASKED... BUT I STILL QUESTION YOUR ISAAC TO ISAAC. TO PROVE YOUR ISAAC, I WILL ASK ONE MORE ISAAC OF ISAAC."" ""Yes, Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac begged. ""TO PROVE YOUR ISAAC AND ISSAC, I REQUIRE ISAAC. YOUR ISAAC WILL BE THE ISAAC. GO INTO HIS ISAAC, AND END HIS ISAAC AS AN ISAAC TO ISAAC, TO PROVE YOU ISAAC ME ABOVE ALL ISAAC."" ""Yes, Isaac."" She replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac.

1193,"After having played the game pre-Repentance on console and enjoying it, the current experience with Repentance is amazing. If you are a fan of roguelikes or just like a solid sense of progression, this game is for you. Some people may be turned off by the grim aesthetics, but I would recommend it even if you aren't a huge fan of the subject matter or gore. The gameplay is too stellar for anyone not to experience."

1246,I have put over 300 hours into Xbox and decided to do it again on Steam. I love how every run is different and is challenging. Top 3 game I have ever played.
1247,"First of all, beware : This game is an addicting drug.
It's one of the best, if not the best roguelike game there is on the market. 
There are many, many secrets to unlock, giving you access to even more items, characters and challenges to play with. 
It's hard, challenging and unforgiving toward those unskilled, but it rewards efforts and skills. Killing one of the final bosses is very rewarding, and sometimes the rng god blesses you and you get a ridiculous, amazingly enjoyable build allowing you to breeze through everything.
For about 30-45e you'll enjoy hundreds if not thousands hours of playtime. 

I can't recommand Isaac enough. Thank you, Edmund."

1251,"This game was bought for me as a Christmas present last year. As of right now, it is one of my most consistently played games in my library. 

When writing serious reviews, I would normally consider a game's pro's and cons. What I liked about it, loved about it, disliked about it, absolutely hated, and what I'd do better/do differently. With Binding of Isaac, I cannot do this. Considering the scope of what it sets out to do, I...... actually can't find anything to fault it on. 

Gameplay wise, you have a very simple concept. A roguelike dungeon crawler inspired by retro Zelda, with elements of bullet hell. All your levels, while following a mostly sequential theme will offer you a true RNG experience like no other game can. No two maps are ever the same, offering you a vast range of layouts, secrets, enemy deployment, and even bosses. And that's not even touching the upgrades and power ups. There are hundreds. Quite literally hundreds of these things, ranging from completely useless to completely game breaking. Throughout all my playtime, I've only unlocked half of what's available. And even once you discover them all, then you get to learn about what synergizes with what for optimal runs. And all of this is just your vanilla game without mods! 

Story and artstyle have an instant appeal as well. Outwardly, its cartoonish, and even a tad silly. This however, hides some dark undertones. Things such as, religious fanaticism. neglect. Child abuse. Gender identity, and other such touchy topics that very few games even dare to touch, much less are able to do in a way that isn't blatantly preachy or condescending. 

And even the story of the game's development is a fascinating one. After Super Meat Boy, Edmund McMillen had intended Isaac to just be a throwaway project. Only for it to become not only his magnum opus, but one of those quintessential games of the past 10 years. 

Nothing more to say here. Just grab it, man. Or I'll send Detective Sargeant Matthew McQueen to come and 'trip over your dog'!"
1252,it is a good game

30 hours in and i'm liking it. The many achievements and the many hours it would take to complete it is pretty exciting. So much value for a game. It's a real: One more round, game."

1279,"this game is amazing but just one problem
the achievements/secrets its almost like you can only get those secrets from one save file so delevopers can you make your game that when you reset your save file you can achieve the secrets agian if you still dont understand what im saying then here


problem:
1: you get all the secrets 
2: you reset
3: you complete the first ending
4: you dont get the secrets to progress through the game
solution:
 try to code the game when you get 1 secret you can get the secret agian when you reset or switch save game
if your already working on the problem thank you
if not then please try to fix the problem"

1307,"Twice the day i bought it the game crashed at random forcing me to restart runs, attempted to verify files and nothing changed, after spending over an hour attempting to even beat the first big boss (Mom) just to have the game crash. Although i won't deny the game is fun, i don't find it worth the price of everything together when it has issues like this. It will likely be quite some time before i even consider suggesting this game to any friends."

1319,"incredibly well made, but like, the game is a bloody toddler dying in a chest while in a internal struggle to figure out whether or not he believes in Jesus Christ due to his mother having abused him and his father having left. I feel bad playing this game as I believe the only logical option of faith IS Christianity due to the obvious man made attributes tied to pretty much every other religion. (Atheism is just depressing as I don't know what it feels like to not exist so I don't feel it really is valid as a religion as much as a rejection of it by those who feel it has harmed them but take it the ""wrong"" way. Islam is based upon Christianity and Judaism [Gabriel tells Muhammad what to do in a cave, also in the beginning Muhammad is stated as having OWNED a Bible.], Hinduism is a bunch of dudes writing fan-fics that is taken as fact [there's over two-hundred of them they would never stop bickering on the distribution of power to make a world anyways since they just act how any averagely corrupt man would], Buddhism is about a man with a good philosophy that still died, so there's no way he could have been able to alter reality or how would he had even lost that power if a greater force than him wasn't implied? but I digress) I cannot recommend this game in good conscience, but I can wish for Edmund to find God, but for real this time. No malice, no ritual, but only the ""love of the lord"" no matter how cheesy it may sound to you."

One more run before I get in the car I tell myself. The local police come by my house as my family calls for me to be a missing person. I don't know what day it is, I just need to unlock more items, more trinkets, more tainted characters. Some of my furniture is missing and I can't find my wife. Maybe she went down the basement to kill mom. One more run before I look for her can't hurt right?

1340,This game single handedly gave me depression and cured it. 10/10 i love edmund xoxo
1341,"This one is nearly a genre defining title, save for minor issues that are unrelated to game play. I really don't have to think twice about recommending this title but for those that don't like satanic imagery and depraved story telling, maybe you should pass on this one. I however do not have any such hangups. This game draws you deeper and deeper with every play through. It has all of the right ingredients of a good rogue-like to give us that “one more time” desire, that is like quicksand. The base game is pretty cheap but with all the DLC you are looking at around $50 without a sale. I would definitely wait for a sale on this one just due to the poor pricing model the developers have presented. I’ll do the formula on the price paid for the full game with all DLC, coming in around $50. 

My formula to answer the the ""Do you recommend this game?"" question:
Hours played divided by price payed Or Price paid divided by hours played

49/50= 0.98 (rounded)

That means i got almost 1 hour of enjoyment per dollar. That is pretty good for a game with this shotty sales model.

Or

50/49=1.02 (rounded)

It cost me close to $1 per hour for enjoyable entertainment with this title. While i did enjoy the game as much if not more than many lager titles, better value most certainly be found with titles that are more transparent with their content/sales model. 

TLDR: recommended but wait for a sale

Tons of content which is mostly unlockable in whatever order you want, every character is fun to play, the dependence on RNG is surprisingly low for a roguelike, it's just a really damn good game. Even if you haven't played vanilla Rebirth before, you can start Repentance from a completely new save file and it feels like it was this way since the very beginning. It's very easy to learn but takes time to master.

Overall, it good."

I've never had a game ever suck me in so deeply for so long, to the point where after the 570 hours it took me to 100% it and all the stress that came along with it, I went and jumped straight into grinding out the 2nd save file with all my new knowledge and ability. When people say Isaac is the type of game you could play endlessly, it's beyond true.

I could not recommend this game more highly, even if you do not have the dedication to obtain all 637 achievements and more as I plan to do, it is something that will stick with me for a very long time."
1352,It's decent game
1353,It's a crush play this good game
1354,very good
1355,Best Roguelike game ever
1356,"This game is highly inappropriate, as the main character is only 5 years old, yet he does not wear any clothes"
1357,this game sucks ass
1358,2/2 very good
1359,"Only 90's kids remember mom chasing you in the basement because of God's voice in her head. 

Great fun."
1360,cring
1361,What can I say Isaac is much like Obsession (the book) giving so many turns that no one could expect and as  Fannie ones said {She just knows stuff}
1362,"its the bane of my existence, you should get it"
1363,Sure
1364,the bible is the lore
1365,Just as good as ppl say
1366,"I've never wanted to punch my monitor more in my life

good game though"
1367,"The replayability of this game is the best I have found bar none. I have sunk 139 hours in this game and it feels like I have barely gotten started into the treasure trove that it has to offer. The game can be difficult, but never in a way that truly feels like it was the game's fault rather than your own (except losing to delirium, telefragging be darned). I would highly recommend giving this game the chance it deserves, and enjoy the ride it will take you on!"
1368,Very good n' very nice gamer time game.
1369,Chad Game 10/10
1370,amogus
1371,this game made having naked kids crying in the basement cool
1372,"very very good game been playing for like 1-2 years now possibly the most addictive game ever
gonna get repentance soon on pc
been playing on xbox"
1373,poopoo is in game
1374,"Edmund is an evil man, just when you think your 100%'d game is safe he comes back years later and releases content to un100% it."

1376,"I have now gotten 100% completion of Rebirth and all DLCS (up to Repentance). This may be one of my favorite games of all time. Insanely infuriating and tough to learn, but I still had fun the whole time. Cannot recommend this game enough. BUT IF YOU ARE GETTING THIS GAME GET ALL THE DLCS. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE UNFINISHED MESS THAT IS AFTERBIRTH+ IF YOU AREN'T ALSO GETTING REPENTANCE."
1377,"its ok i guess i might play it a little bit definitely wouldn't ever complete it tho, for sure, definitely, 100%, promise...................................my family miss me.....................what does grass feel like.......................please help."

1379,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

1381,good game
1382,"I love this game, but I also hate it. 426 hours of my life devoted to this game and it still never ceases to surprise me and throw me curve balls. 

Some runs are amazing, some suck, but it's honestly one of the best games i've ever played."

1387,Absolutely Fantastic Game. Highly Recommend it!
1388,i havent bought it yet
1389,do not buy
1390,"Very heavy on the RNG, but that's what I enjoy most.  yeah there's a lot of different items and enemies to memorize but its fun nonetheless. Haven't gotten tired of it yet and been playing 4-5 years so far on pc and console"
1391,Kid goes insane and thinks about killing his Mum
1392,great game
1393,"While I got this game recently based on a friends review of it, yet I find myself coming back so often to play it. This game is addictive as all hell. The what feels like endless gameplay and combinations of powers and items and even characters with different abilities that make the game harder or easier depending. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes ""bullet hells"" and also dungeon crawler type games, and even if you don't really like those games I'd still give it a shot"
1394,cool game
1395,Best Action Roguelike game
1396,"The best item in the game is Dr. Fetus.

1397,get repentance on epic games so much cheaper but no workshop

and all the things to do just keep pulling me back to the game over and over again.

1403,I want to like it... but it is too hard and makes me feel stupid.
1404,Nice
1405,mind numbingly fun
1406,the game can be a little difficult but with some practice and time the game becomes really enjoyable especially once you learn how items/bosses work
1407,A game with an absurd amount of content for the price. Couldn't recommend this enough to anyone who wants to enter the rogue-lite genre :D
1408,pretty good ig
1409,"I hate this game 

I love this game"
1410,"It's a Yes and a No from me and I'm only talking about Repentance.
Still for some reason they haven't fixed Most of the buggy enemies that are in this game for some odd reason the game developers can't fix it so thank god they added a workshop so the community can actually fix most of the problems that are in this game, God bless you modders. Gameplay really gets old for me real quick but again that's me. It's rare for you to get any of the items you've spent hours trying to unlock, yes I get there's a slight chance for you getting an item you've recently unlocked but come on how many times do I need to play the game until I finally get an item that I wanted to try out but sadly couldn't.  
The soundtrack for some reason isn't that good for this game, most people that post a negative review say the same thing about the soundtrack and they're right, it just doesn't fit for the game.
I really only play this game when high but even I know this game isn't that enjoyable.

This game has to be one of my favorites, so many memories of laughing at the community made mods, unlocking game breaking items, achieving game breaking builds, getting pissed off at friends, getting pissed off at the game, slamming my fists onto my table, breaking part of my table, living with a broken table. This game has brought me so much happiness, and so much more anger. I'd recommend it to anyone :)"

1429,"fun game 9/10  

if you are into rouge-lites like Enter the Gungeon you will like this game it has over 100 items and many complex characters and over 600 achievements that give you a near infinite amount of play time and theres some DLC (that i would personally reccomend"
1430,"this game is really good, there isnt really any problem and its really fun, and the most fun and fustrating part is when you die on a really good item, you will respawn and get a better one or the same one, some items are bad but the rest of the items are good, i really suggest you play this game"

1466,very fun rng good me have nice time
1467,"Play as a baby who's mother is trying to kill him because god said so. Then traverse multiple levels such as your mother's womb, a cave, and a dungeon! Tons of unlockable characters, items, and challenges to result in almost infinite replay value!"
1468,Most complete and excellent game ever.
1469,"i physically cant play the game without not playing with a dlc i would love to give it a good review because the game is amazing but i literally cant play what i payed for., and i have tried everything to fix this. if anyone has had this problem please tell me how to fix it.
Edit: COOL APPARENTLY TO FIX THIS I HAD TO BUY REPENTANCE FUCKING COOL."
1470,This game is systematically designed to fuck you over and the challenge of beating it makes me feel more accomplished than anything I could possibly achieve in real life.
1471,very fun

1496,"Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a great example of how a game having rough edges isn't intrinsically bad nor unintentional. It can be blatantly unfair, stupid, dated, cheap and punishing. But all of those flaws just make it even more rewarding once you learn to overcome and break the game under your will. Which is why I personally think this is one of the best starting points for anyone interested in roguelikes. It'll show you all of the most common flaws that this genre has and teaches you the important rule to accept and embrace those flaws.

Now, I do have some genuine complaints with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. My biggest one being how the game prioritises quantity over quality regarding unlocks and variety. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is easily the one roguelike game you can sink the most time into. But it's also the one where you'll have the most unequal balance regarding your enjoyment as the game can get really dull and repetitive if you try to unlock everything. However this girth is also a positive, as you'll never run out of unlocks until you have already sunk hundreds of hours into the game.

Lastly, I want to recommend some other roguelikes for those who are now interested in this genre but don't know where to look:
Enter the Gungeon is a great companion-piece to Binding of Isaac as both have a lot of similarities. It sacrifices that feeling of being able to break the game in favour of a much tighter and stronger combat and overall smoother edges. Whilst keeping that feeling of there always being more to uncover.
Risk of Rain 2 is my personal favourite roguelike that I've played. It's more action-focused than any other roguelike I've played. But keeps runs consistently enjoyable through a breakneck speed, excellent variety, an overwhelming feeling of being able to absolutely break the game and overall amazing work in pretty much everything you could ask for from a roguelike.
Spelunky 1 and 2, Streets of Rogue and Noita are other noteworthy roguelikes but they deviate more from the regular formula in favour of a more ""unique"" approach. With Spelunky 1 and 2 being a fusion between a platformer and a roguelike, Streets of Rogue being a fusion between an immersive-sim and a roguelike and Noita just being weird and different in ways too complicated to elaborate upon. Noita does have the same feeling of being intentionally rough around the edges as Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. So if you like how rough Binding of Isaac is, you'll likely enjoy Noita."
1497,Great fun achievement/unlock-hunting.
1498,very mid

1507,its mid
1508,Never thought I would be so scared of a giant worm shitting and trying to kill me
1509,Its fun even when you suck at the game.
1510,man this was such a good game i've played many hour of on my own computer yup hmhmhmhmhm defintetly yuppy doo 1000% percents I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
1511,"Pretty good game, i won't become back my money"
1512,my mom hates me
1513,why is edmund like this.
1514,tboi but ∞ times better
1515,"its go

"
1516,Fun.
1517,"Repentance was just the cherry on top of a cake that fixed all issues and inconveniences that Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ had, to think a workshop mod made it to the official release of the DLC for the game was astonishing, I never was satisfied enough with Repentance, I always feel the need to do a run and let it rip to the end. Overall this game was truly an experience, from the flash version to this, it really changed a lot, and I'm happy that all the breaking run methods are patched, so it's at least fun to play the game without getting all items possible in a single run, Edmund and the Antibirth team really bested themselves, and with a company like Nicalis to release this game, it's honestly the perfect roguelike for people who haven't played this awesome game genre."
1518,Its cool
1519,its fun!
1520,I bought this again on Steam just so I can start over again from my Xbox. 100% worth the 50 bucks for the bundle already at just four hours in.
1521,is fun but hard very good
1522,I found this game through a streamer I watch and instantly fell in love with the dungeon crawler.
1523,"Very fun and replayable. The DLCs also add a lot of content compared to the base game, which is pretty cool. Fun items, fun gameplay, many unlockables."
1524,"A flash classic remade into a full game, kinda a must have for those enjoying rougelikes.
While each run is its own, the game does have actual progression outside in it, in the form of unlocks, and oh boy, there are LOTS of them, some really easy, others.... well, lets just say, beat the game w a 1hp secret character on a difficulty where high tier enemies are common and loot is  [i] s c a r s e [/i].
Atmosphere of the game is... unique. Aka if ya cant stomach really twisted stuff, take this as a massive warning, esp if ya had religious ptsd/trauma. Besides that its really consistent w its grotesque theming of [spoiler]""how does it feel to be in the skin of a 5yr old boy being abused by a religious psychotic single mom to the point of pushing the child into psychosis-like state of grotesque fantasy escapeism... or worse"".[/spoiler]
The gameplay loop is really simple. Shoot and run, in a room / encounter style maze w a boss on each floor, required to kill in order to progress to the next floor. Ofc, the floor layout is hidden by default, the player must explore it to map the level. Loot is given on room competiton, w regular rooms giving consumables, and boss rooms giving actual items along w a few other room types. The amount of encounterable items in the game means no 2 runs will feel the same. This is especially true for those owning the DLCs. Also this game is  a nice pickup for legitimate achievement hunters, for getting all the 600+ achievements can take years of playing (looking at you [spoiler] real platinum god [/spoiler] )."
1525,GOOD
1526,"One of the best rouge-likes to ever rouge-like funny, fucked up, and deeply fun to play and experiment with it's a game I always find myself coming back too."
1527,"10/10 You can play as a bloated corpse whose special ability is to shit itself, you can break the poop to find valuable items and it also spawns friendly flies that sacrifice themselves in combat like a WW2 Japanese pilot.

Joking aside. It is a good ""arcade"" game in the sense that you can play a sesion in a relatively short time, come back at anytime and have fun."
1528,"I like how the game is played and how it can be so big, and yet have so little lag (considering you don't destroy the game)."
1529,A happy little game about Jesus!  ̶A̶n̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶f̶a̶n̶t̶i̶c̶i̶d̶e̶
1530,"Fun abusing the bosses with console commands. 
Playing legitimately and not finding funny ways to bully bosses is also quite the challenge, I like it, would recommend if you're into masochism too"

1548,"One hundred and thirty eight hours. That is where I currently sit with this game after buying it during the steam sale this year. By this point in my time with a game I would be long past the point where I would get burnt out, regardless of whether or not there was content left to do. The Binding of Isaac has broken this mold for me, after 138 hours I have gotten nearly all the endings and beaten all but 1 (I think at least) of the bosses and I still don't feel like stopping. You cannot find a better value for this price. It should go without saying but if you are a fan of top down action games, rougelikes, or just weird fairly difficult games, then this is the game for you. Lets be honest though you already knew this, in fact you already own this game don't you? Just browsing the reviews on a lazy day? Anyways, 9.6/10"

1569,"A true masterpiece of the roguelike genre. It's hard to believe that, as of writing, I have spent over 100 hours on this game. There is so much to do and so much to see that it is truly a blessing that this game has been made. Everything is finely and fairly balanced, there is an incredible amount of things to unlock, and the endings are many.

Truly a 12/10 experience; would recommend."

1575,fun game
1576,"With almost 3000 hours in the game I can safely say that The Binding of Isaac is a game that makes me want to rip every hair out of my head when playing it sometimes. Every misplay i make, i can hear it ringing out in my head ""skill issue, skill issue, skill issue"" it doesn't stop. It only gets louder the more bad plays I make. Every night before bed, I pray to Mr. Edmund McMillen wishing for a good seed the next time I open the game to play. I can see visions of Sacred Heart, Magic Mush, and all the tears ups you could imagine!! What am I greeted with but only Glass Shard and Strange Attractor in their places. ""CURSE YOU, EDMUND MCMILLEN"" I yell. ""I WILL BECOME BACK MY MONEY"" I say as I take more and more damage with not a single damage or tears up in sight. every night I lay awake in my bed wondering where it all went wrong, what led me to this outcome? I never seem to be able to think of a coherent answer to the question. 

All I can think about are the many characters that have brought immense amounts of pain. Rebirth Lost with no Holy Mantle, Afterbirth Keeper and the 1000 coin greed machine, getting stomped on hundreds of times to unlock The Forgotten, Tainted Lazarus, Tainted Cain,  and Tainted Jacob all on Repentance release when they were godawful to play. When I think of the Binding of Isaac, all that comes up in my mind is white noise and the intrusive thoughts of my demons trying to claw their way out.

1582,"A massive dungeon crawler with an endless content, especially with all the DLC. 

Over 1k hours into this game and still haven't unlocked all the characters, let alone all of the items. Haven't even touched challenges. 

The art is animatedly disturbing, with gore-riddled floors and enemies depicted in this fittingly cartoonish art style. 

There's still room for a story in the Binding of Isaac, making itself prevalent from the moment a player launches the game and watches the opening cinematic. It features dark commentary on coping with religious trauma, child abuse, neglect, and a host of other issues made apparent as the player descends the numerous endings, peeling back the layers to theorize and uncover what really happened to Isaac and his family.

There's a reason this game has a legendary reputation. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth was released [b]seven years ago[/b] (at time of writing) and its intoxicating formula is unmatched. Critics have seen this game serve as a gateway for millions of people to get into the roguelike genre. Myself included.

While there have been bosses and endings that don't quite make sense within the lore, or have left the community feeling divided / unsatisfied, [spoiler](Hush, Delirium, Mother, etc)[/spoiler] the gameplay elements have more than made up for these qualms. Not to mention what appears to be the games true and final ending from the latest DLC which, in my opinion, perfectly ties up the game's themes in a clear and mature way.

Perfect 10/10."

Each expansion and fan mod only makes the game more and more beloved to me. I cannot recommend this game nearly enough. If you're looking for a challenge, try vanilla Rebirth or the full Repentance versions. If you want to explore and feel powerful, try Afterbirth and Afterbirth+. All in all it's a great game full of a lot of love from the creators. I can't sing its praises enough. Get it. You'll love it."

1647,"Haven't played since the release of the original flash version of Binding of Isaac back in 2011/2012. I can say so far that the shine and thrill of this game still hasn't left despite coming back all these years: countless hours of replayability due to RNG, challenges, achievements, unlocks, etc.

Although I'm not too interested in this genre of games, I found the characters, theme, and gameplay intriguing and really easy to catch onto. It was definitely a bit easier at first for me with my muscle memory, where I managed to unintentionally get all 18 endings in Afterbirth from playing casually for 50 hours. However, with each win, the game gets progressively harder which is great. I've also encountered some minor issues that were annoying to say the least but nothing too game breaking (In the Afterbirth DLC, which are likely fixed in the future DLCs)


Having looked into the different DLCs, here is the summary of what each are as they can get confusing: 
Original Game
- Binding of Isaac (Flash)
1. Wrath of the Lamb (DLC to Flash Game)

Remake of Series:
- Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (START HERE if anything. Not worth it to try previous versions imo)
1. Afterbirth DLC
2. Afterbirth Plus DLC
3. Repentence DLC (The most polished version of the game as it is the most recent DLC/Expansion Pack)

*** Each DLC adds onto each other as an EXPANSION pack ontop of the base game and DLCs before it with more items, bug fixes, bosses, etc. Each new DLC is usually harder in difficulty.  ***

I decided to pick up the base game, Afterbirth, and Afterbirth Plus DLCs for now to see if it was worth it later to get Repentence DLC. Will likely upgrade in the near future."

1653,"The graphics are well made for someone who might not have a very quick computer. Not only is the game fun and entertaining, the game might make you think more about yourself and daily life.

1676,"Among Us (stylized in the Apple App Store as Among Us!) is an online multiplayer science-fiction/social deduction murder mystery game created by Innersloth that runs on the Unity Game Engine. It was first released on June 15, 2018, for Android and iOS - and was later released on Steam on August 18, 2018. On December 15, 2020, a Nintendo Switch edition was released, which is available on the console's Nintendo eShop. On December 14, 2021, Xbox and PlayStation editions were released for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.[1][2]
The game is set on one of four locations; a spaceship, above-earth base, planet base, or a Henry-Stickmin-themed Airship which contains a group of crew members, among which are up to three Impostors who have to Sabotage the ship/base/planet and kill off the Crew. Crewmates have to complete their chosen tasks, report bodies of other Crewmates who are killed, and initiate emergency meetings if they witness another player doing something incriminating or suspicious.

By 2020, Among Us was considered by Innersloth to be a complete game, and as of June 11, 2020, MIRA HQ and Polus, which were previously paid for, were released for free for players playing both on Windows and Android/iOS/iPadOS to host. The game gained an increase in popularity in 2020 due to famous Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A sequel, titled Among Us 2, was announced by Innersloth on August 18, 2020, and was scheduled to be available by 2021 but was canceled in September. Work will instead improve the original game due to the unexpected popularity of the original Among Us. Also, many forms of merchandise, such as T-shirts and toys, have been announced and launched.

1779,"Damn...the story is pretty damn sad...here's a brief rundown:
Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his Isaac as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Life was simple and they were both Isaac. That was, until the day Isaac's Isaac heard a voice from above. ""Your Isaac has become corrupted by Isaac. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the voice called to Isaac. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac."" ""I will follow your instructions, Isaac. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as Isaac locked Isaac in his Isaac away from the Isaacs of the world. One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the voice of Isaac calling to Isaac. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Me. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of you."" ""Yes, Isaac. Anything,"" Isaac's Isaac begged. ""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I require a sacrifice. Your Isaac, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac, as an offering to Isaac to prove you love Isaac above all Issac."" ""Yes, Issac,"" Issac replied, grabbing a Issac from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his Isaac, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his Isaac to find a hiding place, he noticed an Isaac to the basement, hidden under his Isaac. Without hesitation, Isaac flung open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaac below."

1799,vargina
1800,game fun
1801,Is fun yes? Yes!
1802,its a good game
1803,"A gem among roguelikes,this one is a must play."
1804,its like crack but better
1805,"This is one of, if not THE most replayable and fun game around. The base game has hours of enjoyment and many secrets to unlock and discover. With a modding community to boot, and 3 DLCs that almost should be new games entirely, this is a big recommendation! You can play this game for hours on end without getting bored. If you don't have the game already, get it ASAP. It's worth the money for all of the content provided."
1806,"TBoI is a good example of what can be done with simple gameplay. On paper it's a pretty easy concept to grasp but there are so many little techs and tricks to hone. Although sometimes the game's luck can be tedious, the reward for skill makes it feel worth it. It has creative story, gameplay, items. ect. You even find yourself remembering what every item does over time, without even trying. One of the best rogue-likes out there."
1807,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's Isaac heard a voice from above: ""Your Isaac has become corrupted by Isaac! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save Isaac, my Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again, the voice called to Isaac:
""Isaac's Isaac is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this world and confess his Isaacs.""

""I will follow your instructions, Isaac. I have faith in Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as Isaac locked Isaac away in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the world.
One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the voice of Isaac calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Isaac. Anything,"" Isaac's Isaac begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a Isaac. Your son Isaac will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an offering to Isaac, to prove that you love Isaac above all Isaacs!""

""Yes, Isaac,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's Isaac from the Isaac.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding Isaac, he noticed a trapdoor to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without hesitation, he flung open the Isaac just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below."
1808,"like it but mods r confusing
"
1809,"This game is not for the faint of heart. This game can get brutally hard and infuriating at times, being a top down bullet hell style of game; however, it is extremely enjoyable for those types of us who love a challenge. Most boss fights are very fair once you learn them and very fun, especially for the later game bosses which are fast paced. Bonus points for having an absolutely banging soundtrack, of which I believe most of the songs are metal genre.

What's more is that the game eases you into the bullet hell experience of the later parts of the game through progression unlocked by the various achievements, which in turn are linked to the major ""final"" bosses of the game. Instead of throwing the player into an infuriating head smashing hair ripping experience immediately, they are allowed to learn at their own pace and develop a greater skillset before the next major obstacle of the game. If you are just getting into this style of game, I recommend starting with this one."
1810,steam says it works with a controller but it doesn't
1811,Extremely replayable
1812,"Любиш когда детей приносят в жертву богу?
Эта игра для тебя."
1813,mmm salty tears

1818,fun but weird :D
1819,ya it's pretty fun
1820,MURDER
1821,"This game is a good example how developers should make a rogue-like game. It has got almost every single thing what rogue-like needs, and even if you play it for hours you can have another combination in your run to beat your enemies. Besides its mechanics, graphics and sound effects are also fits perfect for the game. I totally reccomend it."
1822,God I hate this game
1823,"One of my favorite games of all time, a must play in my book! <3"
1824,"hell the fuck YES! I've been playing ever since the Newgrounds version came out, absolutely amazing. Story is well told, very well thought of, and did I mention the AMOUNT of replay value in this game??? Top that with an amazing modding community and bam, its practically impossible to ever get bored of this game. Easy yes for me, don't know why anyone would hate this masterpiece."
1825,"The only game i've played that can make you feel like a god, but also feel like you are the weakest thing in the universe at the same time"

1834,trash game
1835,"This game has so many options and so many endings that it almost never gets old. With hundreds of items and achievements, there is so much to like about this game."
1836,Watch out for that rock
1837,"This game is great. I think I can feel a deep similarity between me and Isaac, with both of us being fatherless and locked in our scary basement, though I locked myself in on purpose. The gameplay is fantastic and the modding community is very active. The story is deep and complicated, purposefully leaving lots to the imagination and making the player have to connect the dots themselves.

I'd rate this game 4/5 because while it's good, but it still can't bring my dad back."
1838,is good.
1839,There is a god and his name is Brain Worm

1864,The binding of isaac is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone who likes difficult rogue like games
1865,"really good game, but its limited scope gives it less surprisingly little replay value for a roguelite - it doesn't detract from the gameplay, but I think that it could do with more base content instead of more items, bosses etc. ESPECIALLY the level generation and the clearly limited room pool. TLDR very good roguelite but don't expect to be able to play it forever"
1866,soy milk best
1867,The best game of all time.
1868,It's ok.
1869,I hope edmund stubs his toes for making this game.

1885,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally,"
1886,Good game

1896,its fun
1897,A game that I love to hate. It can be aggravating and super fun all at the same time. I love that i can just start up a few games and leave whenever I want without having to invest so much time in a single sitting. This game has had a huge ROI for me and recommend to anyone up for a challenge.
1898,class game

1909,It's aight
1910,awesome
1911,"I've put far too many hours into this game. The sheer amount of content that's hidden away is mind blowing. The reason I've got so many hours on this is because every single run is completely different from the last, and you'll be stumbling upon new items and features constantly. Can't recommend it enough."
1912,"10/10 game best game i have ever play its good like you die u get a fresh start with new items highly recommend

1913,I would smash isaac's dad

1916,Coping mechanism for grieving relatives is (somehow) still intact. I would recommend staying in touch with real people face to face before this game sends you over the cuckoo's nest.

1921,"This game makes me grumpy. Some runs you get really good items and then die to a fly, others, I get horrid items and manage to beat most of the bosses!? I dont understand."
1922,"Best catholic simulator I've ever played :)

No, but in all seriousness, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a gaming experience I can't recommend enough. It grabs you with it's opening and it's all uphill from there, the gameplay, the items, the characters, everything about this game is top tier. I can't get enough of it and I can't believe what I've been missing out on by not playing for so long. Honestly one of the best rogue-like games ever to be made, it's up there with Hades.

Plus it's really nice to see a team that started from newgrounds work their way up to making this absolute beast of a fully realized game, DLCs included."
1923,"POV: me irl
"
1924,Trash isaac
1925,Binding of isaac is one of the best games i have ever played i remember playing it on the ps vita when i was little it is a good challenging game that tells more tales the more you play!

1932,really nice game. i suck my dick all night and i like it
1933,"Its a great game, however after buying the DLC my saves have become corrupted. Lost tons of progress. Kinda ridiculous how terribly the profiles and saves in this game are made. Has 4 different save folders in the documents folder in windows, all for the different DLCs."
1934,I hate this game so much
1935,nice
1936,"Although I don't like games that seem to depend heavily on luck, this game's theme, underlying story and intricate gameplay functions made this into a new favorite.

The story is not direct, but entirely is based on biblical stories, everything is at least loosely rooted in religion, from underlying theme or direct reference to the real world. In fact one of the strongest items in the roster is actually ""Sacred Heart"", a common depiction of Jesus' suffering as a symbol. However, this isn't your typical shitty free-ware christian game, this is a fully fleshed out roguelike with a lot of time required to fully complete.

Simple but incredibly effective. So many items in the entire game that you may never have a run that is the same as the last.

This got me HOOKED onto roguelikes."
1937,"A really good game once you understand how to play, its also quite satisfying to unlock something new"

2000,"The game is so barren for way too long, I've seen other's who have way more hours play the game and it seems like an entirely different game. Also not a fan of how required the DLC is, you're essentially paying near-AAA pricing for a pretty standard dungeon-crawler roguelike. There's over 700 items which sounds cool until you realise that they're all incredibly hard to differentiate, especially since most items don't even tell you what they do. the fact that you can only shoot in 4 directions makes hitting enemies a chore in the early stages. I'm sure this game would be great with mods/more time, but I can't afford either the DLC nor the patience."

2023,"Awesome game, my only problem was Delirium being an unfair boss and just randomly teleporting on top of you. But everything else is great."
2024,It takes about 641hrs and countless alt f4 to win the game . I hope the dude responsible for the ' speed ' challenge will for the rest of his life stub his toes on every single corner he encounters . Anyway top tier game of his genre .
2025,hell yes
2026,Good game
2027,yes
2028,"I feel as though its important to say this before anything:
If you would like to play the game, than buy all the DLCs, there is no reason the game should be played without buying all the DLCs, but if you do want to play the game with all the DLCs, than be prepared to spend a lot of money.

10/10 game"

2065,Pretty cool game
2066,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2067,"My hours in game probably speak for themselves. Everything moves slow so there is a lot of bullet and obstacle dodging. No run is ever like another. There's a lot of games that claim to be different every run, but this one has by far the best uniqueness run to run.

The enemies my get repetitive and when you play as much as I have you have seen every room that the game is going to make, but I don't know if I ever will or even could experience every combination of powerup. The powerups really do interact with each other in interesting and sometimes unpredictable ways.

I wish there was a way to create a custom run and tweak the powerups that would or could become more available but part of the fun is the gamble and the hope that every time I open a chest or enter a powerup room that I will get a new and interesting twist."
2068,"i own this game on 3 different platforms, for some reason idk why. This is my FAVORITE roguelike. Definitely a must buy, also get the DLC!!!"

2092,www
2093,"To me, this is still the best Rouge-like game available.
I think Repentance is overpriced unless you get it on sale. But again, this is the best in class in my opinion.

The progression is deep and lengthy. The builds can become absolutely broken in a very fun way. And there are LOADS of bosses with widely varying mechanics.

One major downside to the game is that it doesn't bother to explain itself or the items at all.
And unless you memorize what every item is and does, you will be in a world of hurt picking up bad synergies or even run-ending items. 
This problem is easily solved with the External Item Descriptions mod. At this point though, with as many items as there are in the game, I wouldn't recommend playing without this mod."
2094,cool
2095,I like pain.
2096,amazing
2097,"I've been waiting to write a review for TBOI since repentance released so that I would be able to play it enough to critique it fairly. There have also been a fair number of patches/updates since last year that have improved the game quite a bit. I'll try to keep this spoiler-free, but there will be a warning if I decide to mention major stuff. All of that said...

It is my [i]firm belief[/i] that Isaac is better now than it has [b]ever been[/b].

I have been playing on and off since Rebirth released in 2014, and spent significant time with the game in its Afterbirth+ state (which I [i]loved[/i] at the time). I felt that runs in AB+ were almost always interesting and provided just enough challenge to make those longer streaks feel like an accomplishment. Eden runs were my go-to back then and part of me does miss the utterly broken strategies that carried me through half of them.

Repentance increased the difficulty of the game quite a bit by removing those ""bugs"" (I use that term because Ed stated that was never their intended function) and in the case of hard mode, increasing enemy speed and shot speed. It may not sound that bad, [b]but it was rough at first[/b].

For the record, I was having a blast from day one anyway. I remember how upset some (very vocal) fans were at the time, and thought it was folly that people who enjoyed a game in part due to its difficulty would complain about added challenge. This isn't a game that you can fully judge after a few hours of play. Part of the fun in rogue-like games is the progression over many runs. You get better as you go. It would have been a letdown to just get a couple of extra items and trinkets. Repentance truly doubled the content in Isaac, and it's far better for it.

***SPOILER SECTION***

The [spoiler]alt path[/spoiler] and [spoiler]tainted characters[/spoiler] are really the meat and potatoes of Repentance, and have provided me (personally, because I'm out of my mind) with 850+ hours of gameplay so far. I have [i]never[/i] played a game this much in my life and I would be embarrassed if it wasn't as damn good as it is.

Having [spoiler]34(?) post-it notes to complete and an entire new set of floors and bosses[/spoiler] was so much more than I could have dared to expect from a DLC at this price, but here we are. 

I have only two complaints at this point. [spoiler]Tainted Cain and Tainted Lazarus[/spoiler] are zero fun for me. They are essentially the only ""challenges"" I have yet to complete in the game and probably never will (unless they get reworks AGAIN, which is unlikely). Part of it is a personal problem with impatience, part is game design that I'm willing to critique.

[spoiler]Both of these characters take the (arguably) most fun and important part of the game, being items, and then require the player to jump through obnoxious hoops just in order to obtain them. In the case of Tainted Cain, I shouldn't have to use external item descriptions or a separate browser to try and guess what I'm going to get out of the bag of crafting. You could argue that one doesn't have to; that you just place high value consumables into the bag - NO. THIS IS MY REVIEW AND I'LL COMPLAIN ALL I WANT. It's beyond annoying to leave them on the floor and backtrack, especially on the later and larger floors. 

With T. Laz... same deal. It's just not fun for me to try and pay attention to the charges on flip, or guess how many more rooms there will be so that I can get both items from the item room, boss, and angel/devil pedestals. If one character is under-powered, the run is under-powered and it's unlikely that I'll see a win. And this is even when I have the patience to be meticulous about the charges.[/spoiler]

With that now out of the way, everything else about the DLC is stellar. I think yer nuts if you went back to AB+ but you do you, my dudes.

***END SPOILER SECTION***

Okay, I don't want to write anymore and there isn't much left to say that hasn't been said about this game already. The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, Ed and Kilburn did a phenomenal job sending it off and I believe it is worth playing even if you aren't much into the genre. For me, it opened up a world of exploring some truly fabulous indie games that I might not have otherwise played. 

I will [b]not[/b] become back my money. Thanks for reading, you maniac."

2108,"amaizng game
"
2109,"I played it for one evening and then got bored and dropped it, pretty good, absolutely worth your money. the endless possibilities of a run in this roguelike are unexplainable, runs can range from a couple of items which make it slightly wacky, to becoming a god defeating bosses in split seconds. The story is intruiging too, with the game leaving the player to piece together the deep lore. DLCs are an extension that feels like their own game, especially repentance, which added tons of great items, balancing previously boring or too powerful items, adding many new endings, and doubling the amount of playable characters. This game is the definition of a masterpiece. meh 10/10"
2110,Ye :)
2111,Very Fun

2122,funny child crying murder game
2123,this shit is so good
2124,"This game is just so amazing. I've never really been a fan of roguelikes, but this game has made me change my mind about them. It's just so fun and fluid and everything in it is just great. The bosses are unique and unlike anything I've seen in many other games, the biblical references are clever and the cutesy art style with disturbing imagery and a somber story really help tie the whole thing together. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get into roguelikes."

2152,"Frustrating and exasperating and difficult, with a steep learning curve, but overall fun and especially addictive when you get a good run!"
2153,fun but very annoying game its a good way to spend time when bored

2178,great game it was good when it came out but they keep improving it
2179,this game did the same thing to me that alcohol did to my dad iit's addictive it will ruin your life if you try to complete it i played 178 hours of this game and i didnt even beat the final boss with one character on normal mode and i have to beat every boss in the game in hard mode with each character which there are 34 and 45 different challenges and find every item in the game which there are  716 of and you need to do all of that 3 times overall its a good game i reccomend it 9/10 (update i managed to beat the beast)
2180,The perfect mother-child bonding experience.
2181,"Perfection, every game should strive for this level of quality. 10/10"
2182,"So after 1238 hours I've decided to write a ""review"". Mainly because I finally got all the achievements. For the FOURTH frickin' time. Cause everytime a new DLC released the devs decided to steal my 100% completion rate.

But you know what? It was fun. Most times. Even after all this time, almost every run feels unique due to the insane amount of items and the combinations that come with them. Sometimes you get runs with extremely poor RNG but the next one you get OP just after two floors. When they decided to add characters like the Lost or Keeper I thought I will never be able to beat this game but I kept going and with just a few neat little tricks and things to keep in mind even the most annoying chracters (and boy there are quite a few in Repentance) become fun to play.

So yeah I guess it's time to take a break. Maybe I come back for a few meme runs and Challenge #45 but for now I let Isaac rest."
2183,Fuck this game dont buy waste of money and braincells
2184,"Please don't buy this game. Your life will be filled with hours of pain and torture. This game is so unfair sometimes. Edmund I swear that I will become back my money. Anyways, good game. Only buy it if you get all of the dlc's. Yeah. Have fun hating your self. :)"
2185,It's a really fun game and is definetly worth the money. There is lots of content to be experienced especially if you purchase the DLC.
2186,makes me wish i was aborted... Good game. 11/10

2188,good

I started isaac on the original one The Binding of Isaac, around a year ago and i had an addiction to it, as one of the best games i had played, and then i came to this one and it is 10x better, the gameplay is much more consistent, it is more balanced, and up an amazing game that rarely gets boring due to the every changing, runs. 10/10 game"

2204,"This game eventually gets boring when you become powerful enough, and the music eventually turns into grating white noise, and at the same time it's worsened by the amount of dogwater powerless items added in the DLCs that followed the release of Rebirth.

Edit: it actually doesn't matter if you get a bunch of powerful items or not, the gameplay is too shallow to not get boring and numbing after a certain point."

2214,"1k hours what can I say
At the time of this review the game feels 99% complete or more. There's a few uncommon things that I would say don't quite feel up to snuff (Clutch's art and sound effects feel a little scuffed, Rag Mega still doesn't have attack SFX, a quadrillion random item interactions don't work, etc.), but honestly, given the gigantic scope of the game and everything else that's great about it, it's vanishingly unimportant.
One of the best games of the 2010s for sure, and with the Repentance update, secured immortality for itself with mod support and a mostly finished game state. I doubt very many people have NOT played or at least heard of this game by now, but I think it's worth playing for anyone who cares about video games at all."

After beating the game you would expect for it to be the end, but the content in this game is endless! The amount of replay value is insane because of the amount of items and characters. The lore is really interesting but very dark. This game has everything. 10/10 would recommend!"

2225,"Assim, eu tenho 516 horas nesse jogo e não me vejo parando de jogar isso tão cedo. 
Isaac é um roguelike que basicamente definiu o gênero e como ele seria formado em outros jogos na época moderna. Assim como Slay the Spire foi o maior roguelike de cartas, esse foi o maior roguelike de ação.
Esse jogo e Nuclear throne são dois jogos dos quais, por mais que eu fique sem jogar por alguns meses, sempre me pego voltando pra experimentar. 
As runs nesse jogo ficam entre 25 à 45 minutos, dependendo de quais items você pega, além de salvar no meio da run, caso você esteja cansado ou tenha que sair.
Além de MUITO conteúdo, tanto de personagens, como de itens, a comunidade de mods pra esse jogo é enorme, então se por algum motivo você se canse do jogo base (aliás recomendo muito todas as DLCs), você pode pegar um mod que mude as skins, adicione personagens ou bosses, ou até mesmo items.

Simplesmente o jogo que eu mais joguei na minha steam, recomendo muito a experiência!"

2268,"I couldn't fully appreciate the original Binding of Isaac. Rebirth adds the deluge of content this game needs to be entertaining. Other games of its kind tend to slip into a pattern as the game progresses, but with Isaac, truly no two runs are alike. I would argue that this is the bar for roguelites.

I played the base game for maybe 30 hours, then with the first two DLCs (Afterbirth, Afterbirth+) for another 20 hours. Eventually I caved and bought Repentance, and now I've sunk another 50+ hours into it. That makes Rebirth one of just two games I have played over 100 hours on Steam. I still haven't unlocked all the characters, and I don't expect to for another 50 hours. Even after then, there's more content. I don't think I'll ever truly 100% this game."

2281,"[h1] Summary [/h1]

I suppose what it boils down to is I don't like when it feels like a game is purposefully withholding the ways it could be always fun and interesting just to mess with you and waste your time. If you like games that do that, great I'm happy for you but I prefer to enjoy my time.

[h1] In Depth Complaining [/h1]

I remember liking this game in my youth (mostly on console to explain playtime), but having serious issues with it that kept me from getting into it as time passed. After booting it back up and having several runs of terrible items and alternate versions of bosses that drastically increase the difficulty of early stages, I remember what they were. There's a lot of creativity on display in the designs, the music is good, there are plenty of interesting items and things to find, but I just feel the experience is far too inconsistent to recommend. Even for this kind of game where everything is randomized and you start all over, there are so many ways that said randomization can make for garbage miserable runs where items are terrible, enemies are a pain, and supplies are running low so all you can do is pointlessly flail until something puts you out of your misery. I recognize that the nature of randomly generated levels means that quality will be inconsistent, but it could've been mitigated by not including so many items that make the game more difficult or not having an entire class of items you can only have one of and making it less likely that things you have to actively hurt your run to attempt give actual rewards more and troll bombs less. 

The fact that the game also becomes harder if you dare purchase a DLC doesn't help too. I'm also not a fan of how they handle the increase in difficulty as you progress, kinda wish there were new modes or difficulties unlocked that had the new stuff plus things being unlocked at the end rather than permanently adding things to the random pool so that every run on that file is now forever more difficult.

My final major complaint is a fairly minor major complaint about the obscurity of everything. There are so many items that you will never know what they do unless you Google it and so many rules for how things work that I feel are the same way. Just feels somewhat obnoxious to either have to know everything so well the slight differences are noticeable or just look things up or just not know what you're having to decide between."
2282,good play if you like games
2283,its hard to play but i enjoy it
2284,gotta get to 1000 hrs
2285,i can shoot poop with my tears
2286,"One of my most played and favourite games ever. I've been playing it for years now and the game still shows me new ways to have fun. It has a nice mix of challenges, difficulty and fun that i cant find anywhere else. Till this day im finding new synergies and new ways to play the game that i didn't think are possible and i think that its great. There is the occasional bs moment when you die on t lost or the keeper but its still fun I still think the game is 10/10 would recommend."

2319,"I played like 100 hours or more in my nintendo switch, I saw that the PC version enhance the experience with the help of mods like the item description mod which super useful and not that game intrusive, love the challenge and how easy is to get in get out, that is my type of game"
2320,"I've been meaning to play this game for ages now but because I have such a large backlog I kept forgetting about it. Put simply this is rogue like shooter with randomly generated rooms each time you play and to be blunt it's hard as hell. Admittedly I'm not the best player in the world but I'm also the type of person that likes to improve so if hard as nails isn't your cuppa tea then you might want to think twice before buying this. I will say though this game that I really like initially is made even more enjoyable with mods, my favourite is Eevee, yes Eevee is playable here.  Overall this is a decent time waster 8.5/10"
2321,:)
2322,"Really fun! Very challenging but that makes it more enjoyable. Lots of content!

For people reading reviews to see if they want the game: I recommend getting the DLC, it adds more than 400 items and adds more characters, more enemies, etc. Worth it in my opinion :)

2328,pretty good game
2329,loved it
2330,Extremely rage-inducing especially when you're early game and are missing a lot of items. Grinding through has enable me to become better at the game and unlock new items which make the game somewhat easier; thereby making the game more fun. A completionist's dream (which I am not)
2331,bruh
2332,"I really liked roguelikes like enter the gungeon and wanted to play more of them so I decided to get the big daddy of all of them. At first i just bought base rebirth and decided if I liked it i'd get the dlc. I played it for an hour and a half and I didn't like it. Combat felt slow, some of the items were awful and I just didn't get it. Then I made the financially smart decision of buying all the dlc even though I didn't fully enjoy the game and after a few hours, everything clicked into place. Now I have 127 hours and I have a new found crippling addiction. It's incredibly fun, decently challenging and the high of getting a god run or clutching a terrible run is euphoric."

2340,"I am a 55 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

2349,"Super awesome game, especially with the dlcs but man it is hard.
Definitely not an game you play for a few hours straight, but the amount of content is just huge and you always feel accomplished after getting your goals done and it is super satisfying.
It does destroy your social life, controlers, keyboards and monitors. And your sanity.

Probably my favorite Roguelike, with a dark story, fairly difficult but fair gameplay and an art choice like few games can accomplish.
This game has it all, and we can put hundreds of hours into these basements without ever having explored every possible item combination."
2359,probably the best dungeon crawler of this generation.
2360,game sucks i will come back later and play anyways
2361,"Okay so if you want a quick honest review here it is. Ill be having 6 categories that i will rate out of a scale of 0/10. Then at the end i will add a final note at the end, followed by a final rating by averaging the other scores out of the other 6 categories. 

1:Challenge: The game's difficulty is very unrelenting even on normal, but not so difficult to where you think that its impossible without being perfect. Its gonna take you 5-10 hours max to beat it on normal with the first character that you start out in game. There are no ""Objectives"" or ""Quests"" but after beating the normal difficulty you will get hard mode. Hard makes some bosses and enemies have random, and mostly more harmful effects towards you, like them having more health, dealing explosive damage, etc. On top of that you will have curses sometimes that disable your mini map, your health bar, and give you a lack of vision. When you beat hard mode or normal mode you will get a random item that will appear next time in the game, same goes for bosses.  There are also challenges that will have different set rule's added to them and curses like i mentioned early'er in the review. You do get a reward at the end that will randomly appear in the game the next time you play. Overall the game has a lot of content but the problem is that it's random and you will be doing the same thing over and over again with little change: 7/10 


Story (Spoilers kinda): So I don't think I finished the whole story because I did kill all the pieces of Isaacs  mom, but ill give a run down on it and a theory and then my overall rating. So the whole story is about how the main character Isaac is living in a christian family but the only other family member is his mom. Isaac out of his school was abused and bullied relentless from the other kids outside of his home for some reason. But his mom was supposedly ""nice"" but when you see some of the loading screens his mother neglects Issac. So one day while issacs mom was watching tv she goes insane and starts hearing voices saying that her son is corrupt and that if you want to prove your faith you must take away all of his personal things. She responds without asking any questions (and does this every single time) and does the deed. Then ""God"" says that he is still corrupt and that you must lock him in his room if you are faithful, she does the deed. Then ""God"" says that in order to finally prove your faith you must kill isaac, again she try's to do the deed but isaac found out by looking through his key whole (or a hole on the door idk) so he finds a way to escape by going through the cellar trapdoor. after going through the cellar, the basement, etc. He fights his mom and then wins, but no the whole thing is out of order, his mom corners isaac and is about to kill him but God ironicly moves his bible off the shelf killing his mom instantly. But then a copy of isaacs mom appears in the backround? He then kills that one and enters her womb somehow to kill her heart. Which then somehow spawns a chest to which isaac gets inside of the chest and something random happens. For me, isaac became a god i think. 

And that's the whole story that I got, for me the story kinda sucked it was very very confusing and random. That's what this whole story is, it's random. Also the crude humor isn't really that funny, some of the clever item names are fun and the way they transform isaac is funny, but thats about it:  4/10


Flexibility: The game is a dungeon crawler with strategy involved, because there are a lot of choices that you need to do in order to even beat your first play through, you will have rooms that need to have a key to open in order to get a random but most of the time helpful item, or a door that gives you items for at the cost of some health. I don't want to spoil it for you but this was the best part off the game, making decisions and getting these cool items. So yes these cool and wacky items do make the gameplay more varied, and that's what makes it fun for the most part: 8/10


I was gonna talk about awards but i kinda gave it away on the last part but yea this is also a highlight of the game. You get a dopamine rush everytime you defeat a boss or open a golden door to wards getting a good item.-9/10


The Enemies: The enemies in this game are most of the time hard if you don't pay attention, and sometimes it will become a bullet hell. The amount of bosses and enemies in this game is amazing, even though some of the enemies and bosses are obviously recycled and used as mini bosses later on.-8/10


Sound Track: The sound track in this game is non existent, there are only too songs that i can recall in the game besides the main menu. And there pretty good at setting the tone for the game, but they are way to short and you will get sick of them really quick. That is unless you spend 10 more dollars for it as DLC: 5/10


Overall if you love dungeon crawlers, don't mind the simple graphics (I don't mind about graphics as long as the gameplay is good and is not harming it in any way), repetitive music unless you pay more money for it.  And ridiculous amounts of RNG, but a very good challenge this is the game for you. 

My final rating is going to be a 7/10

Ill have comments allowed, even though i think this game is not perfect, that does not mean that this review is either. People make mistakes and it's our job to criticize them in order to make them better.

2389,"so that one day i went to my friend (sick boi) after school to watch jujutsu kaisen (sick aneme), but then we wanted to make pizza with cheese and tomaTOES. As we threw on the oven, i burned my tongue. while crying i stabbed my toe and went out of life for a moment. in this few seconds i had a dream. i had a vision of my future girlfriend (sick gurl) carrying our kid (i never wanted a child (T_T) ) while walking on air. i thougt she was jesus so i asked for wiseness. she started spittin´ true facts i never knew of. did you know that 9+10 is 21? or that 33+77 is 100? i didn´t either. but now i´m enlightened. i can let birds fly, lions run, fishes die and skunks stink. i am frickin´ unbeatable. anyways, i said thank you to my future girlfriend (sick gurl) and went back to life. there i beat up the oven, repaired my toe and cut off my hurting tongue. then i heated up the pizza myself and we went back to the TV. there we watched a lot of jujutsu kaisen (sick aneme). as i went home i met my future girlfriend (sick gurl) again. this time it was in real life. i showed her my skills and she was depres- uhh i mean impressed and told me to play ""The Binding of Isaac"" (sick geam) to get even more skills.

2443,"One of, if not the best game in its genre. The Binding of Isaac stands as a nearly endlessly replayable game with tons of items, tons of characters, and really interesting story to boot. Not much more needs to be said about this masterpiece. 9.5/10."
2444,great game to kill some time with
2445,the game by itself has so much content and replay value. and along with the countless mods out there? this game is an absolute joy

only like 10% of the game is BS, though, the rest is really neat."
2448,I like it
2449,The amount of content in this game is obscene and i will never be able to play it to true completion... All things considered funny child abuse poopoo fart game.

2453,hamborger
2454,"Isaac was a pretty good game with Afterbirth +, but Repentance just blew it out of the park! It was the biggest ""in your face"" lore drop, gave the most OP items, and to make those items even more OP, they rebalanced a lot of previous items. It's amazing how a single mod became an official expansion. I still have some gripes with the game though, and a lot of them come from Afterbirth +
- Greedier Mode is nothing but pile of shit, it serves no aditional challenge beyond being ""Greed but Harder"". Both Greed and Greedier have not been updated for Repentance with its bosses and alt floors
- the Void floor and the Delirium Boss are not fun - they're long, drawn out and unfair
- the Mother route is extremely discouraging - it takes way more effort to get there since you have to clear two challenges to get the Knife pieces, and all you get is just a single checkmark - in my opinion, after beating it for the first time, on subsequent runs it should give you a way to go to Cathedral or Sheol so you can do something more than just beating your Mom's rotten inside"
2455,Dangerously addicting =)
2456,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone on a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaac, as his Isaac watched christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was simple. And they were both Isaac. That was, until the Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac... ""YOUR ISAAC HAS BECOME ISAAC BY ISAAC, HE NEEDS TO BE ISAAC."" ""I will do my best to save Isaac, my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called to Isaac. ""ISAAC'S ISAAC IS STILL ISAAC. HE NEEDS TO BE CUT OFF FROM ALL THAT IS ISAAC IN THIS ISAAC, AND CONFESS HIS ISAAC."" ""I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac... ""YOU'VE DONE AS I ASKED... BUT I STILL QUESTION YOUR ISAAC TO ISAAC. TO PROVE YOUR ISAAC, I WILL ASK ONE MORE ISAAC OF ISAAC."" ""Yes, Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac begged. ""TO PROVE YOUR ISAAC AND ISSAC, I REQUIRE ISAAC. YOUR ISAAC WILL BE THE ISAAC. GO INTO HIS ISAAC, AND END HIS ISAAC AS AN ISAAC TO ISAAC, TO PROVE YOU ISAAC ME ABOVE ALL ISAAC."" ""Yes, Isaac."" She replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down, into the unknown Isaac below..."
2457,"10/10 Gameplay

2470,you fight things as a 5 year old with his tears
2471,"There are two kinds of runs in the Binding of Isaac.

You have runs that are fun but challenging, making it hard to stay alive, but then you also have runs where you can't even see the enemies because you're shooting so many tears and they're splitting and shooting lightning and turning into laser beams and shooting other tears and bouncing off the walls...

The Binding of Isaac makes it fun to be overpowered, but even when that doesn't happen it's still a great game."

2478,:dip:
2479,"i've bought this game on four platforms now, game of the millennia"
2480,I feel as if base Isaac is too based on luck to determine your runs. A majority of your runs depends on your luck and what items you get. If you don't get good items and get unlucky most of your runs will fail. I personally feel frustrated with the amount of runs with poor items and you feel like you can't do anything on the later floors. Like I have stated it's mainly the luck factor that frustrates me with the binding of Issac
2481,My balls got smashed by a waffle iron

2507,"One of my favorite games of all time. Very very rage inducing but that's part of the fun. Probably my favorite game to mod, there's always a mod that is seriously impressive and improves the game and extends the games life and replayability. But there are also mods that are very stupid and funny that make you fall in love with the game again after countless hours of playing. A must have game, i really wish repentance was less so that more people can experience this masterpiece."

2543,"I am a 76 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I started a game as isaac and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he streamed a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2544,"Ive completed a good amount of the game and thought i should write a review.
I like the game very much and have bought the dlcs for it too. i cant say how many times ive died because of this game.
its a whole lotta suffering but also such joy when you beat that boss youve been trying to defeat.
its easy to know if this game is for you:

Are you a masochist? if yes, this game is for you!
Do you love bullethells? if yes, this game is for you!
Do you want to put an abnormal amount of hours into a game to collect every item and then finally get to experience joy? if yes, this game is for you!

But honestly, this is an amazing game with so much to it, and some pretty cool lore. if you are bored and need a new game, check it out

"
2545,"This is the 4th system I've bought this game on, so actual playtime is somewhere around ~700 hours. I was introduced to this game on the Wii U. I played this game on the 3DS (kinda just to say I have this game on the 3DS). I upgraded to Afterbirth+ on the Switch. I finally got a gaming computer and bought it on PC for Repentance. 
If the playtime isn't enough to go by, this game is absolutely worth every penny I've spent on it across every console. I write this review the day I completed Dead God and finished everything the game has to offer. I have become back my money."

However, it's one of the only games where some items will make your run worse."
2594,yes
2595,"Juegas un juego donde un señor mata cosas llorando.

10/10."
2596,"a defining rogue or rogue like game, 10/10"
2597,"This game is at the peak of the roguelike/roguelite genre in terms of how good it is. I've put well over 200 hours into this game on both pc and ps4. I recently brought the game on pc after having a blast with it on ps4 for so many years and I decided to opt for all the dlc and my god the repentance dlc is fantastic. I truly believe that anyone can come to love this game, it does take some time to get used to everything and to remember all the items and what they do but once you persevere enough you'll get the hang of it. The game also just keeps going, there's so much joy (and suffering) to be had with this game, it's insane. There are lots of areas to traverse, some more lugubrious than others and the art style for this game is top notch. Now I will state that if you are the type to get very annoyed with games then this may not be the game for you seeing as you will die time and time again and even getting hit just once can be detrimental as it can make you panic leading to getting hit more and more. But if you're just a gamer wanting a new game to play then this is 100% the game for you."

2627,"So, you want to get a feel of what people think The Binding of Isaac is like, WELL. I'll give you my look.

This game, 10 out of f-----g 10. I'll explain to you why now.

1. ""Holy s--t, this music is good!""
Pretty self explanatory, The music is a true revelation. Calm, Panicked, Non-descriptive sounds? No matter what, you will always catch yourself humming to the tune of the current floor.

2. ""Touhou was easy, this game is no different""
Yeah, It's basically a glorified bullet hell this game. BUT, compared to other games, The Binding of Isaac is a much more tamer game. It's a lot more forgiving than other games. HOWEVER, that does not mean that it can't be hard, There is a normal, and a hard mode. Both with their own unique challenges and rewards. The more you play, the more bosses, items, mechanic, etc... is unlocked, and with each, the game gets a little harder, but you also get a little better.

3. ""You know what, I'll do it myself""
This game is fully optimized for the Steam Workshop, there is hundreds- if not thousands of player made mods that add all sorts of new content to the game, whether it be an item, an enemy, or even a full on community made concept update that changes the entire game as you know it.

4. ""God I hate random chance""
Here it is, the one thing that the entire TBoI fan base can agree on. The Binding of Isaac is SOLEY BASED on your luck, every item, enemy, floor, is all based on luck. Every run is not the same, Every item is not the same. Is it a good or bad thing? I'll let you decide that.

But, that's just how I see things. Maybe you'll think differently, either way. Enjoy the game."
2628,Werry gud
2629,"Who would win?
- Literal king of underworld, angelic beings and the sins themselves
or
- A child with a cricket head and a fistful of bombs

That's right! Not the child

2637,its cool
2638,"Well made with a lot of content, Maybe a little too much content, you have to play hours on end just to achieve a little satisfaction of ""getting somewhere"".
 I do however think this game is amazing for how cheap it is, Certainly will keep you playing for hours and hours, but learning the game mechanics and what each and every item does is a little tedious, I do feel like there should be a text which tells you exactly what each item does before picking it up, but it also adds a little fun."

2647,A christian's basement: the game
2648,Action packed rogue-like dungeon crawler filled to the brim with fun challenges and Easter eggs. This game is guaranteed to keep you engaged and on-edge. This game can be very frustrating at times but overall it's worth every cent I spent to buy it.

2651,"A lot of time and detail put into game, EXTREMELY replay-able"
2652,"I'm genuinely shocked on how fun this roguelike this game can be. I should've played this game ever since I bought it a year ago because hoLY IT'S SUCH A DOPAMINE FARM. I have yet to get enough experience type out a review for this game but hear me out.

It's one of the most fun roguelikes that you can play as there's just so much things to do, same goes for the thousands of stupid builds you can create and experience. I'm sure that this game will give you SO MUCH MORE value for your cash. Yes, it can be really frustrating, and a snorefest of a game sometimes, but those are just small imperfections in a very polished, and snappy roguelike. Go buy it. Now. I'm not telling anything else. Go buy this game and spend your whole week playing it. 8.5/10."

2660,"This game is the best game ever.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth changed my life, so much so that I killed my cat, locked myself in my basement and started running from my mom, all while killing the little creatures (rats) hiding in my basement by crying on them.
My mom keeps trying to stop me but I know what she's really trying to do.
I've tried to defeat Satan but I cant seem to summon him no matter how many rituals I do.
This game is so good I got a permanent tattoo of Isaac rule 34, I even changed my name to Isaac Shittington.
Will you marry me Edmund McMillen? I love you so much....
I dedicated my entire life to you, Edmund.
Please Edmund.
I LOVE YOU EDMUND.
Notice me senpai or else I'll mail a pipebomb to your house
I will do anything to be with you.

This game has consumed my life ever since I started playing it and I don't think I have played another game in months, of course this game has its flaws but they are outweighed by the incredible community and (semi-active) developer team. Some of the designs for enemies and bosses in particular are nothing short of a great example of good art direction. I would definitely recommend ."

2726,this game so fun i play the binding of isaac (real)
2727,the game is so simple and kind of horror but also adorable it is really fun too
2728,Straight dopamine to the brain. Finally unlocking an item after dozens of tries feels incredible.

2730,He beat his mom and thus his trauma and invented gravity. Truly inspiring.
2731,I have very tiny fingers so I decided to buy a mini keyboard. The thing about the mini keyboard is that you lose arrow keys which are essential to playing this game. you move with arrow key. navigate the menu with arrow keys. YOU CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU DONT WANT TO USE ARROW KEYS WITH YOU GUESSED IT ARROW KEYS. therefor I cannot play this game.
2732,this is so relatable!
2733,its okay

2744,"I never played The Binding of Isaac before and just jumped straight into the Repentance DLC when it was on sale, and from what I've experienced, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. With the countless characters, items, rooms, bosses, and most importantly synergies that exist, this expansion adds hundreds of hours of fun to the game that are a joy no matter if you've played the base game or not. And if anything ever gets a little boring or frustrating, there's always gonna be a mod out there to help you out ;D"

2758,"Fun but challenging Shmup. content made it engaging as well, ending only unlocked further part of the game."
2759,"Bruh, this game got infinite replayability. There's always a new outcome and trying to unlock new things is a grind. I really do enjoy this game, more than any other. It's got funny jokes, hard boss fights (at times), and tons of different combinations to get from picking up items."
2760,Isaac can never escape the basement and neither can I
2761,w
2762,Art and music is very good. Lots of replayability :)
2763,"Edmund McMillen and the whole Antibirth Dev Team did a great job with Repentance in terms  of new Content. I mean it's a LOT of new stuff added in this DLC.

Not only did they include Antibirth Content like Floors (Caves, Dross, Mausoleum, Corpse etc.) and Bosses but also did some improvent. Best example is the Mother Route. First of all the Knife Pieces, which are two little but nice puzzles to solve and second the Boss Fight. ""Mother"" is a way more terryfing Boss than ""The Wittness"" from Antibirth. The two reasons are first of all the appearancev of Mother. Mother is way bigger than Wittness and so is the Stage, which is now 1 to 2 I think. Secondly she's is also way more difficult because she uses more projectiles and has quite many different moves (for example the knife and this pong kind of move) unlike the original. They bring life to the new bosses and improved some old ones as well (Little Horn, Monstro II, Mom etc.).

Besides of the Antibirth Content we also vae a big amount of new Items and Pickups. While some fan favourites got nerfed (20/20, Brimstone, Proptosis, Restock, Blank Card) they added many new ones which absolutely change the game completely. And I especially mean the crazy ones like ""Glitched Crown"", ""Sacred Orb"", ""TM-Trainer"", which make a run a lot more interesting. I was really determined to unlock every Item to the point that I completed the game with ""Dead God"" and it was totally worth. Especially when you unlock ""Death Certificate"".
Death Certificate gives you the choice of every Item but the twist is that you can only take one Item. The good part is sometimes you only need on Item to break your run. I love it.

I didn't mention the best part of the DLC: The new Boss Fight ""The Beast"" and the Tainted Characters.""Home"" is a new floor, which can be found by using Polaroid or Negative for the secret door in Mom's floor and by collecting ""Dads Note"". In the floor Home you can unlock the Tainted Characters by using the Red Key or a Cracked Key (unlocked by unlocking the Red Key). After a nap in Mom's Bed (the purple one) you can fight ""Dogma"". I love his design. It's different compared to the other bosses. After defeating Dogma you suddenly meet The Beast (in Lore this also Isaacs Mom) The Beast is a really special Boss because you fight in a 2D-Perspective. It's kind of a boss rush at first. You fight the four Harmbringers Famine, Pestilance, War and Death (just like in the Mega Satan fight). They are all in a new Ultra Form with stronger moves. When you beat them all The Beast appears. While fighting you have to dogde other hazard like rocks and the screen starts to autoscrolle. The Beast hunts you but can also shot fire, inhales everything in a large radius (including the Character) or summons some ghosts. After defeating her, you get a really sad cutscene between Isaac and his Dad, who left the family but I won't spoil to much about the lore (just google it, lol). Overall a really well designed Boss Fight. Good Job.

Now to the Characters and oh my gawd why are there so many?
Not only they included Bethany and Jacob/Esau from Antibirth they created a new kind ofCharacters. Tainted Characters are different compared to the original ones. Tainted Cain for example can only craft Items with his Item ""Bag of Crafting"" and Tainted Keeper has better Shops but needs to pay for every (Pedestal) Item. It brings so much variety in the character roaster and I appreaciate that. I know they are Characters like Tainted Eden, which can be quite annoying but the developers do their best to improve these issues.

I should also mention that Edmund and his team really do a lot for the game by fixing it time by time. Bug fixes, balancing issues and bad textures will be changed just to improve the gameplay and grafics.

Mod support makes it possible to improve your own game (for Example Item Description, Music, Grafics, new Content etc.). I know it was possible in Afterbirth but unlocks were locked and know you can play with them without any problems.

Repentance is a hell of an great expansion pack and does everything right what Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ did wrong.

Thank You Edmund and the Dev. Team

2796,"This review contains mild SPOILERS!!! Really fun and solid 5/5 game that goes to 2/5 later on... let me explain. The game is really fun with tons of different characters and items you can combine with each other for unique effects that you use to defeat different bosses you can find in the game. The problems arise when you have defeated all the bosses and continue to play for new unlocks and completion marks. With bosses like mega satan, hush, mother and the beast, you will have to complete the game like 5 times to get a completion mark for all of them. There is no way except if you get a super rare item called r-key to kill more than one of them each run (unless im mistaken), this really just feels like a way to pad out your game time, if you get a really good run you should be able to face the other bosses with that build NUFF SAID.

The game contains 34 characters, with some characters behaving basically the same to isaac and others completely different. When going for completion marks with some of these characters the game stops being fun. There are challenging characters that are fun, like the lost and then there are characters like jacob & esau which honestly should have never been implemented, i don't think i had a single fun moment when i got all the completion marks for that CRAP character. There are more anti-fun characters like tainted cain which drags out your runs and tainted lazarus which require you to get an ok run with 2 characters at the same time. 

In summary the game is great for the first 0-200 hours or so, but i don't recommend going for dead god. The game becomes a chore where you just hold r for a good start so you can get a completion mark with an anti-fun character."

2799,"This game is one of the best games I've experienced in recent [b]years[b] ! 
give this game a try. Have someone you know remote play a few runs with you or let you solo while they laugh at your descent into madness and the babbling of isaac."

2801,"This game has had a lot of work and thought put into it and the result is that it's one of the best indie titles.

I'm slightly afraid to do stuff and win in particular ways out of fear of bloating the item pools with poor unlocks that actually make the game harder."

2810,"the pretty much only rouge-like you'll ever need, but this (coupled with the mod community) makes this game interesting for what i imagine to be over 1000 hours of gameplay and still can come back for more fun! a very loved and cherished game by those who've played as far as I've seen, a steam classic, couldn't recommend more."
2811,"bullshit enemies, fuck you the bloat and fucking floating hosts"
2812,"I have many hours on this game on PS4 but switching to PC has been a godsend, absolutely incredible rougelike dungeon crawler, will keep you equally entertained and frustrated for hours on end"
2813,"isaac. who's to say. isaac vs the foes of the underworld. barely scraping by. perchance. where will his raging imagination bring him this time? maybe fighting satan or mega satan or hush or maybe just a small red fly. perchance. is this all real? is this just a sick game? maybe this is the afterlife. maybe hes making it all up. only you can decide.... in this ""isaac"" world, you make the choices.... what will you do?"

It hits hard in it's themes, and the _____ ending (no spoilers) is going to make you cry. So how is the gameplay? Top of the class, and this game still gets updates! But is the team which made the game bad? NO! They are actual chads and really haven't done anything sketchy (to my knowledge)

2971,"Warning: You will die.
This game is the ultimate test of your metal. 

cons: 
rng will occasionally give you impossible to win games.
If you are a completionist you will be at this game for years.
The tears you fight with will bleed into reality.
The learning curve is insane (seriously).

Pros: 
You will never stop unlocking new and exciting ways to kill your mother.
The metas you will get will break the game in the best ways.

Synopsis:
If you have ever beaten a souls game, super meat boy, I want to be the guy, or any game that only 1% of its players have seen the credits to then you will understand the gratification that you get when completing them. The binding of isaac is all of these games combined. When you think you have mastered the game a new mode gets unlocked that doubles the size of the game entirely. Beat all the modes? Do it again with another character that is handicapped.  Honestly there is no other game that makes you feel like more of a bad ass then this. Each run only takes upwards of an hour and a half to complete so you can drop it and pick it up as you see fit. 

Conclusion: if you are tired of being mvp in cs:go and want a real challenge then pick this up and feel what it's like to suck again. Then learn to win. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it."

I get the whole making it harder for the DLC and I would find it still playable if they didn't add the whole ""explode your donation machine and it's gone forever"" and removing all items and consumables while in the abandoned area.  I love gimmicky but that's what made it worse.

3059,"Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, it tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer, turning to a life of crime and partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce and distribute crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.

Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.

Breaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim. Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time.[9] It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all time.[10]

A sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, starring Paul was released on Netflix and in theaters on October 11, 2019.[11] Better Call Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their Breaking Bad roles, as well as many others in guest and recurring appearances, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and is currently airing its sixth and final season"

To top it all off the dlc lets you play mods which ultimately make this game timeless. Has only gotten better and better since it released.

3079,"I am a 38 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 11 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3127,"The game is great, making it all the way from being like one of the original roguelikes to a masterpiece of potential, with every single run being different. The amount of content is insane (and not to mention all the mods if even the regular game isn't enough for you).

Anyway now that the praise is over time to boast about my achievements.

3131,yeah
3132,"the difficulty of a game shouldn't be used as a detraction from the game itself. At least, not for this game. If you're in for an experience of semi-permanent death and a fun learning curve, then this game is worth it for sure"

3137,yes
3138,Really cool game when u start the game as a new player seems hard to beat some of the levels but when you still playing the game and getting process u seems that the game is more easy than before.
3139,Having put close to 700 hours in (at time of writing) and finally have gotten every achievement i can finally say that i thoroughly endorse this game. although not everyone will enjoy it i can say that if you like rogue-likes you will probably enjoy this too. (P.S fuck Jacob and Esau)
3140,fun in a dark way
3141,little crying baby that shits and pisses on floors fights zombie babies with teardrops. best game ever.
3142,game good
3143,Great Procedural level generation. Great selection of characters and challenges for a variety of skill levels. Easy to start hard to master but oh so satisfying watching yours abilities grow. New now with multiplayer which I highly recommend to add all new levels of crazy fun. I personally play using an Xbox game-pad for better control but it offers many control options. New now plays great on Steam Deck. 8.8/10

3165,"Yes
"
3166,"One of the best single-player rogue games of all time, an instant classic. The incredible replayability and the various synergies make the experience feel incredibly rewarding and progressive throughout the game. 

The unique levels and enemy design are incredibly well executed with great concepts, offering a difficult yet enjoyable fast-paced experience. 

Overall, this is one of the best games ever made and it's definitely worth checking out."
3167,"It's a very fun game with multiple weapons, enemies, bosses, and dungeons to overcome. It also has a sad little backstory with cute and scary characters."
3168,game gud
3169,"if you think this shiz is easy, you thought WRONG. It STARTS off easy but gives you multiple mental breakdown when you get further in the game. still a super fun game tho. Now go play it you'll regret it and you won't at the same time.

3178,"TBOI: Repentance is probably one of the best rougelikes I have played, all the content, endings, characters, songs, and even the modding community is all great. Having this many things you can do with one game, it's like the Garry's Mod of rougelikes."

3183,FUN GAME worth 60 bucks
3184,.........I don't want to talk about how fast I racked up hours after repentance dropped (fun fact: I got 99.8 hours on the first week).
3185,"How on earth is this game rated ""Overwhelmingly Positive""?!! It makes one despair of this generation. To describe this game as ""ugly"" sounds like a compliment: it's not merely ugly, it's fugly.

Give it a hard pass, if, like me, the idea of shooting piles of poop with tears in one of the ugliest games ever made doesn't sound like fun."

3196,"Honestly, It's great. There is PLENTY for you to do in Repentance but even by itself, the game is great. It is a pretty unique game as there are many unique monsters, levels and upgrades. There's even a greed mode for people who don't really like exploring (although you have to) and hard mode for experts. There are soo many unlocks in the Repentance DLC and you should get the DLC and not get the rebirth game on its own. You will have a lot of fun sometimes. The final boss is really cool (no spoilers) just like everything else. Some achievements will be close to impossible  to do but if you keep trying, you'll do it! The more you unlock, the easier the game gets. This game is a great choice for a game for adventurers and well... sometimes non adventurers in some cases but if you want to buy this game, buy it. It's a perfect game with little to none flaws."

3217,this is better than cocaine
3218,"The game is constantly trying its best to stop you from having fun. Does Edmund think people are sitting there going ""Wow! That was awesome!"" when they get trash like breath of life from an angel deal? Anyone who has played this game for more than 100 hours has certified stockholm syndrome. The game knows just how many more times it can put you through absolute torture before you give up and uninstall, and right in that moment, decides to give you great items and an amazing run."
3219,I'm not sure if I'm enjoying it or hating it
3220,"Really, really fun gameplay loop. Love the art style and such as well. Would definitely recommend"

3222,fun for a bit
3223,"pretty good.

3224,"Amazing game overall but I hate ultra hard to the point I want to shed tears and I will forever hate this stupid challenge. I have gone through the 5 stages of depression, grief, and every emotion. I will get a good run with like a tier 4 item but then get completely shit on because I go into a room and get bombarded with 20 champions in my face. All in all the game is very well made. The content is just really addictive and you never get the same run twice. Even though it might look silly the game is very fun to play and the lore of it is quite interesting as well. I have played the mobile tboi and I have played many hours on a different account. What I can say is this game provides you the fullest experience and is very interactive and you will never get bored of finding new synergies the game as to offer. Amazing game but fuck ultra hard I am shedding tears and I am malding, coping, hoping."
3225,"Through multiple platforms, I have never lost interest in this game. Hands down the best of its kind imo, 10/10 recommend!"
3226,havent seen outside cues of this game also there is a rei plushi mod thats why i bought it good fucking game
3227,AMAZING
3228,can piss on satan
3229,"A very fun game, it has cool lore and a dungeon style of playing. Its an easy game to learn with simple mechanics, but it is incredibly hard to master. This game has an insanely high skill cap but you don't need to be very good to succeed. I recommend this game to new and experienced players as its fun, and can be easy or hard. It also has near infinite replay-ability."

3258,i am isaac and this is my weapon (holding jar of tears) it weighs somethin idk and fires home made liquid projectiles that kill everything it cost 0 dollars to fire this weapon for 12 seconds...... some people think they can outsmart me (flashbacks to thousands of deaths) maybe (snifle) maybe... i have yet to meet one that can outsmart tear
3259,it makes me suffer but i'm too invested to stop now
3260,its one of the best games ive played its so unique in its own way .

3267,"Have played only 12 hours so far and already it's better than a lot of games. This is a must have. The 50 price tag for the game and dlcs is steep, but worth it. There's like 640 steam achievements and I have 20 something. If you enjoy the format and challenge of games like Dead Cells and Risk of Rain 2, you need this game."
3268,it's alright
3269,I play this game as any version of the lost whenever i want to deduct years to my life :D

3275,great fun game!
3276,Good Game
3277,"b-brimstone go brbrbrbrbr lol
Game good. You can learn Rebirth and then escalate to the DLCs as you feel more comfortable, as the game already hosts a learning curve that can lead to hours of enjoyment.
Or you can be a rebel and get completely swamped with items to remember. Like me! The game's Workshop has mods that make the new player experience very streamlined, even if jumping straight in via Repentance.

Whichever route you choose, you can have literal days of fun exploring item combos, new floors, new character play styles, challenges, and just playing the game itself. It's something unlike any other game I've played, and I adore it for that."
3278,Ta muy bueno el aisac comprenlo

3280,I refuse to get good at this game
3281,"i have cried and sobbed because i couldn't sleep, everytime i close my eyes, im in a room shooting tears out of my eyes to kill the enemies. today i heard the gassy shit doing that ""hgrr"" sound i'm genuinely loosing my mind 10/10"
3282,Unga Bunga!
3283,i like this game
3284,"The game is super fun and one of the best rogue-likes out there. It is heavily skill intensive, but balanced in a way that you can win every run if you try hard enough and know what you are doing. I have over 500 hours into the game and am not close to finishing it 100% (you have to 100% all 3 save files). This game is worth every penny."

3385,"So, now that it does not matter anymore since almost everyone knows this Game, its general vibe and this review in total will not make a difference, I should give my two cents on this one.
To whom it may concern: this game is good, really good. I go as far as to tell you, that this is one of the games one has to play at some point in his life, just to experience a rogue-like as it should be.
While you can stop reading at this point and grab a copy on sale and try it for yourself, i'll give some more detailed thoughts on why i recommend this game:

TBOI is what I enjoy as a person. I am by far not a christian person, so I get the jokes in this game. I like casually playing level after level after level and a steady background progression. I do like unlocks that make sense and do not hinder my overall progress and ability to have fun. I am a fan of the subtle story and all the lore one can get out of this, the art style, the sounds and the list goes on... you know what I am aiming for. However, I am not taking this all to the level of fanaticism.
This is the point where this review merges into a comment and a general advice.

As someone who played TBOI on consoles and the PC, I covered about 200-300 hours in game, as of me writing this. Quite a lot of this time was under a Linux based OS. And as Todd Howard would phrase it: ""It just works"". All of the little pieces work together, the lore fits the art style, that itself fits the music and it all runs smoothly on my OS. Failing a run never was to be blamed on a flaw by the game but on my lousy set of items or just my incompetence to make the best out of my current setup. This game is just the right amount of challenge, story and value of replay-ability. There are two things you should avoid though:

- Do not read or watch anything that might spoil the experience. The game really shines when you explore for yourself and experience everything first hand.
- Do not put this game on a pedestal! I can not stress enough how good this game is and i truly recommend you playing it. However, it is not the holy grail of gaming and a flawless masterpiece. The dev is not the brightest candle on the cake and by far not listening to his fans. The original co-op is disappointing, a usable HUD come with a DLC and so on...

My point is, that this game, by all means, is something special and should be enjoyed without the distraction of spoilers and unnecessary arguments, as should all games btw! Play the game your way and you will have some great fun. Don't take it as an unreachable work of god that will enlighten Satan himself, for it is guiding the way of gaming. Just play the game and have some fun.

9/10 would play some more!"
3386,"Pros:
- easy to learn
- easy to understand
- easy to play
- fun
Cons:
- none
"
3387,"i love this game, i play it in my spare time, the only down side about the game was i had to open the wiki whenever i got a new item, so maybe there could be an item in the game where it can tell u the status of the items before picking them up.

ps: to the comments, i already there is a mod of it, but i cant access those, soooo."
3388,literally play this game
3389,this game fucking sucks
3390,"Awesome, well worth the cost. Infinite replayability."
3391,Can't wait for the Four Souls Requiem® Box set to arrive in November :D . Also the video game slaps and the lore is a gift from Edmund himself.

3402,"Although I'm not the biggest fan because of the difficulty, I COMPLETELY understand why people like it. I keep losing, and that's part of what makes it addicting. I wanna keep going back and trying to beat the part I lose to. I really enjoy the bullet hells and the quick reflexes needed to fight in some of these"
3403,"Get on, do a couple runs, get off. There's so much content that this process can be repeated without boredom for years."
3404,"[b] REVIEW OF The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth  [/b]

I start from the assumption that this game not everyone will like it (unfortunately), you need memory and the right mentality to play it.

Initially I was very skeptical to buy the game, so much so that the first time after 30 minutes I refunded it. I bought it again because I wanted to give it a second chance, and I’m totally happy and satisfied that I did, Edmund McMillen (the creator of the game) created an absurd game prototype.

[b] Points in favor of the game: [/b]

- Unique history
- Arcade graphics 
- More than 500 unique items
- Possibility to add mods to help you to memorize items (unfortunately only for AfterBirth Plus and Repentance DLC)
- Many hours of play, after 350 hours of play, are not even half done.
- Many achievements to discover and unlock

[b] Only point against the game: [/b]

- The game itself (The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth) is devoid of content, leading players who want to buy the game to ask for a refund, unfortunately DLC cost a lot,  in that period I bought everything (including dlc) in the period of discounts (spent about 25 euros instead of 50), mods are only added by buying the last two DLC, bad thing for those who want to learn objects and must help you with the Wiki/ Fandom.

The game really deserves a lot, so who likes the rogue like and looking for a game with a great story and that lasts a lot make his purchase of life playing Isaac.

Total rating: 9.5/10"
3405,duh it's isaac
3406,
3407,this game is basicly the pinacle of old-school gaming
3408,sometimes fun but mostly pain
3409,i made this game
3410,i haven't seen the sun in over a decade
3411,"A lovely game that slowly but surely adds more and more complexity as you play it.
I can highly recommend using the mod that shows you what each items does. 
Game feels a lot more fun to learn and play that way."
3412,I can't aim and I run into spikes a lot 10/10
3413,best game ever plz make thiss game real. i need this. plz. lillith best gitl and cain best boy plz add them to real life.

3428,probably the closest thing to infinite replayability
3429,buy it
3430,"The true king of roguelikes. Eternal singleplayer game (+500h at the very least).

It could be a little grindy since at the end what you are doing is the same paths with dozens of characters, but due to so many items and unlocks every run feels diferent and the world always amplifies.

With all dlc's (specially Repentance) it holds its position as nº1. Also the key for that is that what you do is just to grow the item pool, having more options, combinations and mechanics, and a better skill and knowledge of the game but not upgrades of your characters, their attacks or their weapons as other games like Hades. 

One of those true unmisable games that really became a reference in this medium."
3431,I really liked the game.  Got a lot of time out of it for the price point.
3432,This game is great. The wide range of items and bosses make it an challenging experience for all to enjoy. 10/10
3433,"Bought this from the summer sale

Proceeded to get steam sale on my second run

Won somehow through RNG and a dice room

Coming from the switch version, yeah the game's pretty epic. I didn't have repentance on switch, and here the new content really shows itself to you immediately, and it all looks pretty neat."
3434,"Comparably, not good."
3435,yasss
3436,Very good very nice
3437,"OK LISTEN HERE
BUY THIS GAME IF YOU:
-Like having a hard time
-Like to lose
-Like to yell into a pillow
-Don't suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome
-And want to smack the living goofy people in a topdown game

IF YOU DONT, THEN STILL BUY IT CAUSE ITS A GOOD GAME. >:)"
3438,Great game
3439,best game
3440,One of my all-time favorites. Had to say something at 666hrs
3441,The only game where you can have the head of God himself and still die to a fly.
3442,since i 100% this game i can officially say this game sucks. 10/10 would recommend.
3443,"One day, I'll have all the achievements for this game. By then I suspect I'll be in my early 30s, wish me luck!"
3444,im very bad but its still fun

3448,"Incredible game, I just keep coming back to it"
3449,Si
3450,"Great fun, even when i lose i don't even get mad because of the chance that the next run could be better. there is also a wide range of things to aim for like completion marks or item unlocks."
3451,ive had this game for a while acrossed multiple different computers and steam accounts all in all its been years of enjoyment that u got out of this amazing game 10/10 would play again
3452,devs felt the need to push an agenda with this game. it is my god given right to kill babies and feed them colorful pills
3453,why is the basement so big
3454,"A Tier Game

Hundreds of hours worth of gameplay"
3455,awesome game i'm now addicted and now i wont talk to my friends and i don't touch grass
3456,"Pretty good game. Perfect for achievement whöres. The game does a very poor job explaining various game mechanics. This should be fine is you enjoy discovering things by yourself, but it might be very frustrating to learn for most people. It will be very helpful to have a friend who knows a lot about the game help you out for your first dozen runs. 
All of that aside, very addictive game. Lots of depth and replayablility. You can just play it casually, booting up a run every other day. Or you can challenge yourself to try explore 100% of the game and get all the achievements. This usually takes about 600 hours to complete, not to mention an extra 100+ hours of Northernlion's gameplay you can watch once you're invested in the game. If you're bored and have some time to waste, try it out."
3457,pretty cool
3458,I literally only bought this so I can use the Netplay. :sunglasses:

3476,you know when your addicted to a game when it offers thousands of contents and items and you start running into certain situations over and over again despite that
3477,this game changed my life i now always tear up when i go near my mother incase she throws me in the basement full of monsters and satan because god told her to
3478,Good
3479,"Binding of Isaac is honestly not a very good game. The main issue stems from the fact that there are way too many items. There are huge amounts of items that are completely worthless in general or ones that require other items to be halfway decent. This problem is compounded by the developers focusing on popular items and giving them more synergies, while new ones or older, less popular items might have none. Overall, TBOI is decent, but I wouldn't actually recommend it."
3480,Best rogue like ever
3481,good game hehehehe
3482,Many combinations and controlled-ish randomness makes it fun. Yay.
3483,no way they added a discord moderater as one of the bosses

3494,"I'm NOT saying thumbs down because it's a bad game. I'm saying it because this game is just stupidly easy.

I get that it's all about finding crazy combinations of items, etc.

I played the original and while the RNG is a little unbalanced meaning you can get a GOD run then nothing for 20 runs. Here every run is a GOD run automatically it seems? IDK I had to refund before the 2 hour window closed so I only saw so much, but if what I saw so far is indicative of the overall challenge of the game, I have to say no.

Now maybe I've played too many twinsticks in my life (my favorite genre). But I think more realistically the devs have prioritized item synergy and crazy builds vs. actually being hard to beat.

Sorry guys."
3495,"One of my all time favorite games. Easy to learn, hard to master. Very rewarding for understanding the fundamentals of the games properties and exploiting them for benefit.

Is this game flawless? definitely not, you'll die to some stupidest thing you could imagine whether it's your fault or not. 
This game can also be very hard but also rewarding depending on your patience. hence why it's not for everyone.
The modding community of this game is one of the best things about this game, once you got into it you'll find yourself downloading something like a mod replacing Issac's mom with Ray William Johnson. (P.S.you need DLCs in order to download them)
Today marks 1 year of me since I bought Repentance+ so I'm giving it a piece of thought.

3541,i'm only writing the review because i've played 420 hours.
3542,"This game is the definition of a definitive edition.

This game not only replicated the original but adds onto it. There is new gameplay, items, pickups, characters, new soundtracks, a new art style that fits the game perfectly.

The game design is perfect, you have the cliche 2d dungeon crawler but completely rng based with over 700 items with the new dlc's. hundreds of hours of replay, which is really unlimited because every run will be different and have different items and drops, you can make a unlimited number of builds in the game and there are actual nerdy elements that you can use in your favour to get better items.

but it still has no anime girls... Edmund McMillen, You litte F**ker You made a sh*t of piece with your trash Issac"
3543,"100% recommend Isaac. Endlessly replayable, lot's of chances to experiment. While the story isn't a main factor to the game, the dark and sometimes confusing drips and drops you get for defeating certain bosses are always morbidly intriguing. The base game is great but each dlc raises the bar and is one of the few games I feel like is improved on by paying a little more for extras."
3544,.
3545,Do you like playing fucked up stuff or are edgy? Then this game is for you. Also Isaac's mom is a sack of flour rolled turds.

3562,"This game is great. It's like going out fishing with your son on a crisp Sunday morning in September. The grass is still wet and there are waves of fog on the water, being chased around the by the wind. 
You inhale deeply and then you remember that you don't have a son  and you turn around and there is a fleshy abomination next to you, composed completely from eyes and mouths. It says ""I αɱ ԋυɳɠɾყ, ϝαƚԋҽɾ"", in a voice that sounds like the screaming agony of ten thousand souls in purgatory, and then burrows its teeth deep into the soft flesh of your genitalia, devouring your private parts with several mouths at the same time. You feel pain, but you also feel peace, because you know that it all will be over soon.
And then you catch a fish.

3590,I hate tainted lost but this is fun when I'm not perishing every other quadrillion resets
3591,"This is genuinely my favorite game. I love the enemies, the art style is fun, and new items and updates are constantly being added in.
I need to get all of the achievements or I don't think I'll ever be able to respect myself.
I love how you can have a perfect run going and ruin it all by picking up a bad item or missing a special room.
This game is driving me insane in a really euphoric way."

3676,"Repentance solidifies the foothold and adds countless hours to the already insane amount of content.
Jacob and Esau adds a level of self harm never before seen in gaming, which is cool I guess. 
For players interested in learning the ropes: embrace mechanics that cost HP to use. It will pay off.
Good game 10/10"

3682,The end game content after 1835 hours is bit lacking.
3683,"Got a couple hours in this game, keep uninstalling it but it magically reappears on my hard drive every couple months
What a mystery"
3684,"This game has infinite replayability. It's the only game I have purchased for every platform available, at least once. I cannot even begin to tell you how many hours I have invested into this game over the multiple platforms and accounts I have it on. It always has something new to offer every run, and the community for the workshop and mods is incredible. I recommend waiting on modding until after playing through the game and experiencing all of the endings properly for yourself. It's more rewarding that way, and the mods can help keep the game interesting after you've gotten most of your completion marks by adding in more challenges and different ways of experiencing everything."
3685,Creepycore game creator Edmund McMillen's magnum opus -- and it just keeps getting better with every new expansion.

3719,Very cool B)
3720,"Many games suck, especially when depression is a thing. This game however, is still entertaining even so. The amount of novelty here is insane, and it has been expanded far past when I first was hooked into it. This is a game easily played whenever you are between other games, or heck, go nuts and play this forever till all the content is completed. To keep it simple, it's a rogue like, bullet hell, with seemingly endless upgrades and customization."
3721,you have to cry on poop to survive 10/10 great game

3737,pogger
3738,Greatest religious game ever made so accurate!!
3739,A true rouge like classic. Needs to be played by anyone who enjoys the genre.

3780,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
3781,Yes
3782,you get a noose to hang yourself with. best game ever
3783,my absolute favorite game i really love it so much
3784,Omg this game. Roguelike aka Roguelove
3785,no me angy
3786,The game is weird as hell but it's fun
3787,"The game looks ugly and and the items provide no description of what they do, forcing a player to possess prior knowledge of the game to enjoy it. I love roguelikes but this one doesn't feel worth the effort."
3788,Worst game ever created. Edmund Mcmiller you little fucker
3789,I fucking hate this game. 9/10
3790,"One of my best friends had been trying to get me to play this game for three years before I finally caved, bought it, and I haven't really played any other game since then. Isaac is honestly one of the best dungeon crawlers I've ever played and the amount of content you get int the game is honestly mind-boggling. 140 hours and I've only gotten 27% of the achievments so, yeah, if you want a dungeon crawler you're gonna spend hundreds of hours in, then Isaac is definitely a good choice.

It's one of these games where you get just enough of the story to get a a shot of excitement when you unfold a piece of the puzzle, but that's only an extra, because the gameplay and the hundreds of achievments is what you're really for here. Isaac will give you quite a bit of a challenge, too--it's far from my first game of this kind and it had taken me at least sixty hours before I finally decided that I've gotten a good hang of it. 

Another thing I definitely have to mention in here is the overall aesthetic of Isaac. This game is wonderfully pixelly and delightfully disgusting with blood, guts, and shit, and all of that on top of a lot, and I mean a lot of references to Christianity everywhere you look. I'm not a religious person and ever had been, but I greatly enjoy all the Catholic lore you can find and learn about through playing a run after a run.

--- TL;DR ---
• GRAPHICS: pixely retro style, very nicely polished in the Repentance DLC
• GAMEPLAY: absolutely fantastic
• AUDIO: good, the soundtrack on later levels slaps
• STORY: if you really want to learn more about it, you're gonna have to watch a YT videoessay
• AUDIENCE: older teens and up
• DIFFICULTY: very challenging
• PRICE: worth it along with all the DLCs
• PERSONAL SCORE: 9/10"
3791,"A very fun and simple to run time burner. If you have an itch for a more arcade-y twin stick shooter, this is well worth the money, plus the modding community is on par with that of Skyrims. an easy 9/10 from me."
3792,"I have probably 350-400 hours on switch, its a good game but after awhile it becomes repetitive."
3793,epic
3794,I hate this game but it's still great. The Repentance DLC is a must-have.
3795,norwegian cockroach
3796,"I can't explain it, but everytime I finish a run, I have to poop. Urgently. 8.5 / 10"
3797,PAIN
3798,it's fine
3799,"Will need other 700 hours to review this game first brb

edit: currently at 100 hours, I regret my life choices"
3800,if you dont have this game what are you doing..
3801,"baby cry very funny
"
3802,"One of my favourite and most played games of all time. If you are a completionist like me, the amount of content and achievements in this game will not disappoint. The repentance DLC was a huge improvement in terms of game balance and pretty much doubled the games content with some very unique and fun new characters. It is very satisfying to use knowledge of game mechanics to create strong runs and synergies, but even when I was new to the game, I remember the difficulty was also engaging. The game does have a few issues, it is still fairly common to take completely unfair damage at least once in a run, some of the old bosses are still poorly designed (remove the double adversary room please), and delirium desperately needs a rework, but overall its a good experience."
3803,"Great game all around, tons of hours to be spent here"
3804,👌
3805,item named finger
3806,no
3807,very fun
3808,best!!!!!
3809,"this game is amazing, its hard and no two games will ever be the same, there's over 300 items in the base game and with dlc that number goes up to 700,this game is perfect if you have a few minutes to spare and you want to play something quickly or if you want to spend hours playing, in all this is one of the most fun games ive played recently.

definitely recommend"
3810,"According to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.[Gen 22:2-8] After Isaac is bound to an altar, a messenger from God stops Abraham before the sacrifice finishes, saying ""now I know you fear God"". Abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of Isaac.
Abraham and Isaac (oil on canvas), Rembrandt, 1634

The passage states that the event occurred at ""the mount of the LORD""[2] in ""the land of Moriah"".[3] 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to ""mount Moriah"" as the site of Solomon's Temple, while Psalms 24:3; Isaiah 2:3 and 30:29; and Zechariah 8:3 use the term ""the mount of the LORD"" to refer to the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the Temple Mount in Jerusalem."
3811,"im enjoying the game so far (3 hours) great experience, worth a try :P"

3880,10/10
3881,This game has been with me since its flash days where I would pirate it on a usb to sneak into the school computers so that I can Isaac my Isaac while Isaacing on an Isaac. Since then I've gotten it on many of my consoles and have watched it grow alongside me. Whenever I play it I am in my happy place. To this day I am amazed at how far it's come and am in love with it's wonderful community. You all are amazing. This game is amazing. Thank you Isaac... But goddam stop giving me skill issues when I have the craziest synergies man... :(
3882,This game inspires an absolute rage in me like no other. 10/10 I hate it thanks Nicalis

3892,"Pretty cool, it´s like a simple game you may like to play to pass the time and then boom, you either die because of bad luck and/or your didn´t git gud enough or you get a pretty cool build and you can (and you will and want) expend half hour exploring the rooms and trying to get to a final boss.
In conclusion, it may look like a casual game that you´ll play in small time intervals like 10 mins. but nope, you can spend some time in every run and can become adictive depending on your luck."

3901,"I've spent countless hours spread among the PC, PSV and PS4 versions of this game. Isaac defines the gold standard for roguelikes and roguelites. It's a MASSIVE game, even without any of its expansions. Absolutely recommended."

3908,too expensive for this
3909,"I started playing this game like 3 years ago - fell in love. I love the gameplay, art style, and difficulty. Sure, sometimes some characters are suffering (tainted lost) or you have bad runs, but the game balances it out with awesome item synergies or the reward factor of unlocking or completing a character / secret / challenges.

I don't do them that often, but the daily runs also add a nice sense of competition for the chance of being on-top in terms of score. Plus, this game's modding community is incredibly strong and its always fun - even if you've finished the game completely - to try out new community mods.

Highly recommend this game, and all 3 dlc."
3910,"I used to love this game, now? It keeps crashing so.. money and time lost I guess."
3911,YEES
3912,"- Intense and visceral pixel style graphics that border on creepy and gross, yet are so pleasing to watch at the same time.
- Easy to play and mighty hard to master, every enemy feels unique and equally possible of making you start the twisted journey all over again. (those damn worm ones!!)
- Endless items, buffs, curses, books, friends, pets, deals with the devil and many more......seriously, SO MANY!
- Countless deaths COULD eventually land you a win but this will only make things different and more expansive the next time you play, leading to near infinite map and enemy changes every round.

Hard to put a bad word against this game, its creative, unique and keeps you trying again only to discover a new enemy to hate or a new item that changes the flow of progression. 

Not playing this game, is a crime!!"
3913,This game made me hate myself even more than I already did. Just don't try to get Dead God and you'll have a good time. Sometimes.

3919,"One of the best game I've ever played. You have hours upon hours of pure joy. Infinite items, infinite combinations.
Everything is just good about this game. The only negative thing i'd say is that you need a lot of time to start understanding the game (items, bosses, item combinations, etc.), but once you start getting into it, it will be one of the best game you've ever played, no doubt about it."

10/10"
3929,"I love roguelikes and play a ton of them. The Binding of Isaac is one of the few I can safely say continues to surprise me and change things up even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.

Isaac starts as a simple game, but over time unfurls into this massive behemoth of unlocks, endings, bosses, and characters. If you want a game that ALWAYS gives you something to work towards, I cannot recommend Isaac enough. The game is brutal, dark, and difficult, but the process of mastering Isaac and learning all it is a process unlike anything I've ever seen in a game. It's rewarding and addictive enough to keep me hooked through years of gameplay and several expansions.

(For clarity's sake, I'm reviewing this game with all DLC to make things concise. You should buy it all in order to get all you can out of this game.)"

3972,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures, and playing with his toys, as his mom watched christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above;
""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""
""I will do my best to save him, my lord"" his mother replied, Rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.
Again, the voice called to her; ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world, and confess his sins!"" ""I will follow your instructions lord, I have faith in thee"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room, away from the evils of the world.
One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of god calling to her; ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you""
""Yes lord, anything"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice, your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room, and end his life as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else""
""Yes lord"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.
Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the basement, hidden under his rug.
Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below."

3977,"It is easy to think that this game is not for you based on its look. The aesthetics are childish and off-putting, the story is cruel and even somewhat disgusting. However, it is the most addicting thing ever and I don't think I'll ever find such a replayable game that keeps you surprised with every new synergy and interaction. Even though it makes you suffer and makes you spend hours to beat the most unfair boss with a character who dies from one hit, you'll be begging Edmund to make ""just one more DLC"".
10/10, cried from the final ending."
3978,"The game has many items, things to do and many nuances and synergy.
unlike most roguelikes, which often tend to have a smaller pool of items that either drastically change or makes minor buffs, Binding Of Isaac has a plethora of useful items and effects, since the items also have specific icons and sprites, after enough practice you can know what they are at a simple glance.
As far as variety goes, at the very start your only task is the reach the bottom of Depths 2, which is 6 floors total. If you look at a 100% player, you'll see there is far more that but the game doesnt open up until you complete prerequisites. IMO its a great way to introduce new players who arent used to the game, an option of getting better through practice, since if you cant even beat vanilla mom, theres no way you'll ever touch the other bosses, enemies and floors.

I highly recommend to invest on a steam sale, if my hours played and mod list doesnt speak for itself.
(note if you dont care about valor or honor, after you beat mom once you can activate the debug console and modding in the options.txt of the game)"
3979,"Honestly, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, especially with all of its dlcs is a masterpiece of gaming. I came in not exactly expecting to enjoy the game because of it being a roguelike, but boy was I wrong. This one game contains infinite hours of gameplay with an extreme amount of replayability. Somehow, the game is brutally hard to the point of being unfair sometimes, yet it's done in the right way and the game is still fun.

The art style of this game, albeit simple, looks excellent in my opinion. I also like the strange and grotesque creatures that inhabit the different floors. The floors themselves are of course randomly laid out, as the game is a rogue-like, but the rooms are selected from a pool of pre-built rooms rather than being completely randomly generated.

Each of the playable characters is unique and has a special way to unlock them. There are even 'tainted' characters that have more unique mechanics to them. The majority of the characters are fun to play as due to their unique gimmicks, but I still prefer some characters over others.

The story of this game is quite sad in my opinion. Most of the time it involves the titular character, Isaac, being locked in a chest and suffocating to death. It's very likely that what Isaac sees in the game are actually hallucinations from lack of oxygen, which is quite dark.

I only really have the minor nitpick that sometimes you might have to restart a run if you get no good items, but even with that, this game is definitely a 10/10 in my books."

3995,"This game saved my life.

I am 54.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
3996,Game sucked barely played it
3997,funny baby
3998,"I accidentally deleted my main file. Other than that, amazing game."
3999,great game
4000,"Fun roguelike with TONS of unique item interactions, i find something new each day! also very good for if you like trophies and unlocking secrets as you unlock a new item for EACH BOSS killed with every character! Although, its very challenging which i like but new players might not enjoy"
4001,"Probably one of the best, if not THE best roguelite I've ever played in my entire life. There's way too much to say what's good about this game in a short comment, so I'll probably point out the biggest thing that to me really defines what makes this game so great.

Item interactions and synergies are perhaps the most prominent thing about Isaac. There are hundreds of items which all have their own differing effects on Isaac and how you play him. Not to mention, many of these items then come to interact with one another to create unique combinations that mix up what Isaac's abilities, attacks, etc., making every run have nearly infinite potential into what direction it could head towards. It also helps that many of these synergies are very visual and flashy, making it so that you can feel just as powerful as you look, which is an extremely satisfying aspect of the gameplay that makes this game endlessly replayable. 

I would seriously recommend anyone who likes games to at least try it out. It's a masterwork of gaming that surely cannot be missed out on."

4012,"I've been craving to get this came ever since 2016 when I started watching gameplays on youtube in my free time, so far 420 hours into it there's still achievements left to unlock and who knows how many sinergies between items I haven't seen, excellent workshop too, and the story is even greater.
Devs are aware that certain item combinations can literally break the game and they do not get their hands in there because in the end breaking the game is a valid mechanic that can only be achieved with good analysis/thinking and game knowledge, which is very charming and one of the main reasons I play.

Quick summary: delete Jacob & Esau <3"

4027,"I've been playing since flash Isaac, so one could say I'm a ""long time fan""

Repentance revitalized my love for this game.  Even with it's issues I still love this game just as much as I did when I was in middle school back in the flash days.  It almost feels, in a way, like the game grew up with me.  And even though we've been told there won't be anymore expansions to this game, I think that this will be a game I keep coming back to time and time again.  It has ENDLESS replayability, even after you've unlocked everything, just looking around for new synergies, building custom synergies using the console commands and being able to play your own way with next to no punishment for it makes it a game I come to whenever I'm having a bad day.  

Funny how a game about a dying child escaping his abusive parents is my safe space, huh?"

The items are really varied and Repentance improved some boring items like Holy Water, nerfed some items that would win you the run instantly and added some great new items like Psy Fly which is my personal favourite. Going to love sinking a lot more time into this game to unlock all the cool new stuff in Repentance!

4097,"Repentance is a sizable expansion to the honestly kind of shitty Afterbirth+ which was an expansion to..oh who am I kidding, anyone who plays this game already has all the DLC. And I still do if I really want to come back. Very laborious grinding as every character is required to achieve 100% completion, and if that's what you're going for like a lot of people (because the game gets boring: runs either go hot and melt everything in your path or cold and you will feel like you're getting your ass handed to your for no reason, often prompting an immediate quit.

Often billed as the easiest roguelike, it still has its problems in that the dodging is very inertia-based and your hitbox is a straight up circle: You will often run into rooms with things like undodgeable explosions, enemies that have little to no tells and expect you to see off-screen, and an endgame boss that quite literally, if not melted immediately, will decide to end your run when he wants (Teleporting on top of you, much?) This is at least getting a rework, but some rooms need to have their layouts reworked. (This is such a problem in Gehenna/Sheol specifically, usually the hardest floors in the game.)

Isaac's item synergies are admittedly fun, but can quickly stack up with a few good items to become nigh unstoppable in the first few floors: Play right and you usually don't have to worry about a thing other than dodging. I may not know how to effectively min-max a character, but early game it's hard to get traction going with most characters that aren't already OP (see [spoiler]Tainted Keeper[/spoiler]) and with the game's deal system, taking damage once without a buffer can end your run prematurely. All in all, it's about both breaking the game and avoiding any hits: Once you have damage, you're set, but before the advent of things like spectral tears, there will be a lot of resetting. I can't get over the people who streak this game, they are absolute masochists. 

All I can say is that after 330 hours and multiple instances of the game deleting my save file across computers (awful Steam Cloud integration) and the ""experience"" that is optimizing runs, I don't think I can handle the level of play and respect these players go through to spend countless hours (most I knew had around 2000-3000) to perfect an art. It's a game with a lot of reading, memorization and planning, as well as execution that can just be straight up ignored if an enemy decides not to play nice. A game with a high that only lasts a little bit upon completing that synergy or transformation you want, then boredom as you plow through the final floor with a screen-clear that kills regular bosses in half a second or so. If you want to craft your way to perfection, this game is a goddamned sandbox of ideas. For people who can't handle throwing a run down the toilet after you spent three hours breaking the game, this is not the game for you or me."

If you like games where you could waste hours on, or maybe multitask (MAYBE)... This Game is for you. This game is awesome, and I'd totally recommend buying the DLC if you're into the base game. Hours of fun, never really gets old, and if you ever feel bored because you've unlocked a lot and beat a bunch of bosses, just reset! :) Have fun going insane..."

Isaac is tough but fair, and filled with a metric tonne of unlocks, powerups, enemies, bosses and items. Not to mention the diverse range of characters to play too which change the game up. 

When I first played Isaac, I honestly thought it looked kinda weird, but you only need to play a couple of runs before it gets crazy addictive. This is the kinda game where you go after every achievement and each one unlocks a new item for your playthroughs. The theme is dark and strange in places, but it only adds to the atmosphere of being lost in this crazy giant dungeon.

If you've ever enjoyed Roguelikes, you will enjoy Isaac, absolutely. It also has a lot of workshop stuff and mods if you want to mix things up."

4202,"worst steak i ever had, too chewy. waiter was rude. never coming to this restaurant again
8/10"
4203,"My review will be on the most recent version of The Binding of Isaac: Repentance

Isaac is one of the all-time classics of the roguelike genre, and for good reason. The game has a massive amount of content, including:

* 34 characters, each with their own unique mechanic to mix up gameplay and challenge the player
* 700+ items, with an insane amount of care put into special interactions and synergies
* Hundreds of enemies and ~100 bosses
* Thousands of different room layouts
* 45 unique challenges that tweak the game's formula in a way that you'd never see in a normal run
* A thriving modding community and great mod support, making it super easy to download and install mods

Roguelikes are all about replayability and having no two runs be the same, and Isaac may be the game that lives up to that idea the best. Even after over a thousand hours of gameplay, over a thousand runs, and 3 completed save files, I still see new item interactions and room layouts very regularly. There's always something to keep the game fresh, interesting, and challenging. I'd absolutely recommend the game to anyone who enjoys roguelikes and doesn't mind a challenge.

Complaints about the game:

The game's difficulty is most people's main issue with the game, but personally I found it to be fine. It's definitely very challenging early on when you don't know enemies' attack patterns, but once you do learn them, they all have tells that let you dodge them (with enough skill). There are only a few characters, bosses, and enemies in the game that I'd consider unfair or poorly balanced, but they're few and far between in a game as big as Isaac. 

I myself don't have any major complaints with the game, only some minor nitpicks, most of which can be fixed with mods:

* In game item descriptions are usually completely unhelpful, forcing new players to check the wiki often. However, once you beat Mom for the first time, you can (and should) install the External Item Descriptions mod, which tells you everything you need to know about any item in the game

* Backtracking can sometimes be an issue on larger floors, especially when you have low movement speed or there are annoying obstacle rooms. 

* Early floors can feel very slow, especially the boss fights. When the first boss can take a solid minute of shooting to kill, only for it to give you a useless item, it's no wonder that some people hold the reset button until they get a good starting item. 

* Most floor curses are annoying or plain unfair instead of providing a real challenge. Curse of darkness makes the game darker, which can lead to enemies attacking you from outside of your vision range. Curse of the lost removes your map, which is just an obnoxious time waster. Etc.

* Hard mode is poorly implemented. The main features of hard mode are less heart drops, more champion enemies, and more curses. Less heart drops is a good challenge and more curses is annoying for the reasons I just mentioned above. More champions is the real issue though. Most champions don't actually feel harder to fight, they just have more HP, which makes early stages even slower due to your lack of items. 

Overall, none of the things I listed ruin the game for me, and most of them could be fixed with mods if I did hate them enough. For example, the item description mod I mentioned, along with mods that add room teleporting or remove curses. 

The game has its flaws like any other game, and can definitely be frustrating at times. However it's also very rewarding to make progress and see new things in the game, whether it's a new character, boss, item, synergy, or even a new mod. There's always something new and fun to experience in the game, which is what keeps me coming back after all this time."

4217,"[h1]TLDR[/h1]

Great roguelike with high replayability value, variety of characters and items, good OST and ton of other features that make this game great. Be sure to grab all DLCs to get this game at full potential.

[h1]LONG VERSION[/h1]

Well, It would be a crime if I won't leave a review after a long wait of finished product, so it's a great time to do it.

I've played OG Binding of Isaac. It was a great time, even the game was hard (and it becomes even harder with Eternal edition). But then devs made a remake, which is this game. While it barely brought something on the table to this time, except new OST and graphics, after some time, DLCs were released, getting 3 in total and making Repentance DLC last. There's a bit of drawback on this game is that if you want last DLC, you need to have all previous ones. Not complaining here because I bought them all progressively, when I 100% back at some point.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
But anyway, let's talk about advantageous sides of the game. I am going to speak as of Repentance DLC, since it includes all the content, and I recommend you get all DLC, because it's one of the games, where DLCs are worth their money entirely. Okay, here we go:
+It's a roguelike. The original game hasn't changed formula much on the game, but now the game has seeds of the run. And if the seed contains 8 letters, then it should be somewhere roughly 4 billion outcomes of your run. Yeah.
+A lot of item combinations & synergies. I like how with some items, you can just break the game in half. It was a marvelous descent into item madness. In Repentance (again, last DLC), synergies went sky-high and there are more of them now.
+Choice of many characters. Yeah, there are 34 characters available in this game, which is insane. Well, some of them you want to touch once or if you feel the urge to suffer, but doesn't mean they contribute to roster, eh?
+Good OST. I absolutely enjoyed some good music in this one. Again, it's preference, but you should try listening yourself.
+Workshop support. With the latest addition of Repentance, there is a workshop support, that adds new characters, items, reworks and memes. That will surely make some people to stay for a long time.

Well, that pros for this game. 

[h1]CONS[/h1]

But are there cons? Not much, but they exist. Here we go:

-Co-op between steam users is a bit lacking. So in order to play with other steam gamers, you have to use Remote Play function. And I've tried it - I personally didn't like it. It has a certain delay, since the actual way you play with a friend is that you stream your game, and with that comes a small stream delay, which sometime is not ideal. But if you play local co-op, Repentance DLC got this immensely better than before it. There are mod to make co-op true through Steam, but it's only use better when you unlocked all, since if you have mods - no achievements or unlocks(?) can be granted.
-Can't really gift this game. Once you bought that, you can't gift it to your friend, perhaps for a reason above. Or you are just being generous or want to do a birthday gift. The way why it was made this way because if you would give, for example, afterbirth+ DLC, then it won't work without afterbirth DLC itself. To put it simple - to prevent game has problems with maintaining content. So if you want to gift a dude this, better give him a gift card in steam, so he can buy the whole package.

Like I've said, not much. Not all games are perfect, though.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]

Would I recommend this game to you? Absolutely yes. If you plan to 100% it, it has a big replayability value. Amazing how this game stood well after pretty much 10-11 years and there are lots of people still interesting to grab it and share their cool runs. Grab it, you won't regret it."

4246,Fun game
4247,"+ Incredible amount of unlocks
+ Permutations of all the variables in the game makes every game drastically different from the last
+ Challenge runs (presets & modifiers for a themed challenge experience) 
+ Tons of achievements if that's your thing
+ Sound design is great and immersive
+ Works great on controller
+ Never experienced any bugs during my playthroughs

/ There is probably a mod that exists for this; but it would be nice to have a more comprehensive description for items and their effects. I will concede this was likely by design to promote a more unpredictable and memorable experience

4279,"I usually try to be funny in my reviews but this game means so much to me I physically can’t. This is my favorite game ever, I’ve played the previous Isaac as a child and now I’m an adult still playing this, and trying to 100% it for a second time. This game is a piece of art and an experience to behold. It brought me and my siblings closer through its gameplay trying to unlock everything to see what came next. I mean this from the bottom of my heart if this game peaks your interest just get it, it’s an amazing game."
4280,Fun

4289,"I can't tell you how great this game is. It's totally up to you. But it's obviously overwhelmingly positive. I may be no one in your life, but let me tell you one thing. If you like Roguelikes, this is absolutely a game for you. It's a staple of the genre and the difficulty is perfect. There's so much to do and explore and learn after each run. The lore is great, it's deep and sad and has multiple endings. You will not regret getting this game. Make sure to get the DLC too, it's all fun."

Played rebirth when it was released but only through family sharing 'cause I was a cheap lil bastard
Got the game on sale 3 months ago because I had some leftover money on my wallet and wanted so see what had been changed in the past 7 years
Now my life has spiraled out of control
If you want to get all the achievements, you have to beat the game like 400 times
Right now I have 271 hours on record and only 78% beaten
Game is still fun tho, because every achievement unlocks something new for the next run
Be it good or bad"

4311,fun
4312,really fun and addicting
4313,"Would absolutely invest in this game. I've owned it for a long time, and go through phases in which I play nothing but this. It's consistently different enough that you can get 200 hours messing around on it, but also similar enough that at a certain point you start to feel like you're ""getting good"" at it. I WOULD WARN: Be careful when purchasing DLC. Afterbirth+ worked for a short while for me, but now crashes my game. For some reason the newest DLC, Repentance, is buggy, and seems half finished, textures missing, textures broken, sounds missing or broken, etc. Rep crashed when I entered a blood spike room. 

But otherwise, 10/10, would play another 200 hours"
4314,this game is so much fun although frustrating too. there are so many items and ways to play that it can be difficult. however this same reason is what will give you the re-playability!!! Deceptively fun and creative!

DLC are ***REQUIRED***, the vanilla version is quite rough around the edges.
I'll see you on this magnificent journey to obtain the ""Dead God"" achievement.
So long."
4360,Best of the best! Played since it was a flash game. Love it completely! I've looked over the years for a game like it and nothing comes close to the feel and the synergies of items and the story and monsters. Love it! Will play it forever. It will always have a space on whatever PC I build.
4361,"great game i love it when the isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day isaacs mom heard a voice from above: ""UR son has become corrupted by sin lol he needs to be saved""

love that part"
4362,"This is a good game all be it not for everyone, it can be very hard but also rewarding depending on your patence with it and willingness to go through things a fair few times, if your looking for a good roll of the dice in your overhead destruction, give it a shot, just be ready to also be suspect when ever things go well..."
4363,it was pretty gaming you know how you game sometimes and it is gaming thats what this game is

4402,Meh. Average.
4403,One of the greatest games of all time. Hands down.
4404,one of the best indie games ive ever played. worth the 60 dollars i spent to get dlc
4405,"Very good game absolutely no problems at all, especially on mac. I would recommend downloading as many mods as your little computer can take. This is not a joke and i am very serious."
4406,"This is probably the only game that contains bullshit losses due to RNG or factors outside my control and yet is still terrific and fun.

I'm fairly confident that this is in part to just the so many options and versatility it has.

Don't like getting your ass kicked over and over again? No worries! Pick a slightly-easier character or restart quickly and easily until you get an item that gives you a good start.

Kicking the game's ass TOO hard? Well, luckily for you, there's a Hard mode, and very hard characters, some of which I haven't even unlocked yet. And hard Challenges.

This game handles Difficulty Modes in the absolute finest way possible - it mostly doesn't. The difficulty is presented in the character you pick because you haven't adjusted to how you play them yet, as well as the blessings of RNGesus.

Speaking of unlocks, this game is fucking HUGE. There are so many Challenge Runs, Characters, Items, Chapters, and just... MORE GAME, to unlock.
And like, the more you play, the more of the game is available to you, and most of the time that wasn't even your intention! It's AWESOME!

I will be the first to admit I hate losing and I am a terribly sore loser, but every time this game kicks my ass, I never find myself blaming the game specifically.
It's a bummer to lose all that time, effort, and the possibly good run (especially to something REALLY small), sure, even to the point where I need a break for a few days.
But unlike most other games, I find myself either blaming myself for sloppy play or just blaming the massive RNG table of... everything in the game. Never the game itself.

And unlike most other games, you never have to suffer through an extreme losing streak.
Other games, you change your playstyle or try to learn from your mistakes if you suffer a painful loss, and the game will then kick your ass even harder.
This game? This game encourages you to win, and to learn how to win.

The game itself never feels unfair.
It doesn't feel like it cheats, or is playing unfairly, or that you need some sort of metagame strategy to get some sort of enjoyment of the game.

So many ""challenging"" games are just set up with seemingly impossible odds or rules stacked against you, and that's pretty much their entire gameplay - beat their bullshit challenge.
Things like low longevity, cheating AI tactics or resources, unfair strength or speed, you know what I mean.

And with games like this, you'll always find that a handful of extremely intelligent people have completely gutted the game code, studied it inside and out, and have developed the perfect gameplay instructions that will allow you to have ""optimal enjoyment"", which with some games is just the ability to win at all.

This game has none of that.
At most, it's like a bullet hell but... fun.
There is no meta. Just be a good player. And I FUCKING LOVE THIS SO FUCKING MUCH.

It never feels too stale (what with the additional GAME being unlocked almost every run), and if it's not giving you an adrenaline rush almost every fight then you probably have a build that is absolutely wrecking house, or you're numb to it.

If you enjoy old-school arcade machines, like with the cabinets or what you can find on things like MAME, it is essential that you play this game.

HOWEVER, if you enjoy work, chores, not having fun, planning over playing, watching video guides and tutorials, being bored, the opposite of excitement, datamining and other strategy development via game dissection, and generally encouraging the shitty practice of game developers making their target audience an elite few people who could probably be part of the Development team with how much they know of the game, then this MIGHT not be for you.

I give it Italian Hand Gesture / 10; this is a masterpiece of gameplay and game design, melding casual with intensity, that other game developers need to learn from."

4529,"Was alright to play before repentance. Now it's just too much, I don't like saying this game is too hard because it is designed that way. But this isn't fun to me anymore. Feels like I sat down just to get slapped in the face. Not a fan."

4554,"This game is so frustratingly fun. At the end of every playthrough, I am crying harder than Isaac. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who wants waste hours of their lives getting to the final boss and then dying to a fly."

"
4559,Very epic game about Isaac who is epic.
4560,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4561,"Its good. You should know what this game is by now. If not, play it and rock out to the soundtrack for a few runs then turn on an audiobook/podcast and relax.

Also pull up a wiki/cheatsheet/download a mod because its a PIA to remember what all of the items do."
4562,I would pay a ludicrous amount of money for this game to be entirely re-skinned into a piece of media that I could comfortably share with a wider variety of people.
4563,"An outstanding experience, seriously, this game can keep you HOOKED for hours. It has what every roguelike strives to achieve: a slew of varied characters, interesting level design and enemies that keep you on your toes, (mostly) fun bosses, and did I mention the items? All the various synergies and interactions between them keep the gameplay fresh and exiting every run.

Although the story element isn't Isaac's strong suit, its gameplay variety certainly makes up for it. Oh Yeah, and the DLCs?
Get them all. ESPECIALLY Repentance, they add so much to the game that I fell it would be woefully incomplete without them.

My only gripes with this game are its convoluted and outdated progression, some bosses (DELIRIUM) that are painful to fight, and its many questionable themes that, while certainly innovative and well presented, kind of keeps me from recommending this game to my friends (from fear of considering me mentally insane and in need of psychiatric help).

Overall, this is probably one of the best games and one of the best rougelikes (or roguelites? don't know the difference :P) and I HIGHLY recommend you buy it, download it, and venture into the unknown depth bellow..."
4564,weiudhkjshbsfjkhndfsjk YEAH !!
4565,I played a thousand hours cuz it sucks!
4566,Its okay
4567,Good game. Best Game.
4568,Pretty damn good
4569,masterpiece
4570,I now know to blow up spiders
4571,i lost my family
4572,It's pretty okay.
4573,it's gud
4574,Gud
4575,its a enjoyable dungeon crawler game.
4576,this shit slaps pretty hard my guys
4577,"I don't do reviews. However, this game is absolutely amazing."
4578,Very fun and challenging game! Can be frustrating at times but that makes your victories all the more satisfying. There is also a TON a replay value so that's a huge plus for me.
4579,love this game <3
4580,vewy ni
4581,"I love and hate this game from bottom of my heart.
Mostly love, but still.
So much to do still.
So many runs to beat and fail.
Many challenges to make you cry like Isaac did.
And if that is not enough?
Many mods to spice things up with.
I love this game.
And i hate this game.
From bottom of my heart.

Thank you and fuck you Edmund for giving us this masterpiece."
4582,this game is very fun if you want to snack while playing i would suggest a very good and juicy double bacon cheeseburger it complents the game nicley!
4583,kyle dudek
4584,good
4585,I love this game every time I play its something new that's what makes this game so fun and enjoyable
4586,Probably the most addictive game I've played in recent years. Trying to collect all the items is a huge task but it is what keeps you coming back. You could probably play this game for 1000 hours and still not have all the unlocks.
4587,"I keep on grinding... this was definitely one of those games you used to play at school. Play it once again, it's all for fun, unless you really wanna get everything..."
4588,best rougelike game ever
4589,isaac
4590,nice game Edmund
4591,Game Good
4592,"i love this game so much oh y god. its become my life and its literally something that i play like, almost daily. i was gonna make a joke review saying you shouldnt play because itll get you addicted but honestly i really enjoy this game. the game is bad to me, and yet i have stockholm syndrome for it <3
thank you edmund for being a shit of piece"
4593,so gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood and fun a million trillion stars and no complaints. it was too hard for me when i was 14 because my brain hadnt fully developed but now i am the ripe old age of 19 and the game is like hard enough to be challenging but not so hard i cant play any characters other than azazel lol
4594,"Fun game, lots of replayability."
4595,Each run is never the same. I really like how you can play for hundreds of hours and still not have unlocked everything. Definitely worth every penny.
4596,Good
4597,good
4598,It is good
4599,Im baby
4600,"I hate it, but i can NOT stop playing it"
4601,I'm literally baby
4602,cry
4603,cry baby piss pants
4604,I all right I guess
4605,"Really good game, super fun. Recently picked it back up after a long hiatus and it's just as good as I remember. If you're ever wondering ""is this worth it"" the answer is YES"
4606,If you are into roguelikes you'll love this one!
4607,"Don’t be fooled by the short levels, you’ll have a tough time going through them with how hard the game is. It feels like OG Legend of Zelda, but with way more content than I can speak for; also the style is super cute despite being fucked up contextually. 

The Binding of Issac is a simple, fun game with tons of replay value, but it does suck how the 4 player Co-Op is locked inside of DLC, which also can’t be purchased by itself, but only through a DLC bundle pack. 

7.5 / 10 without DLC
10 / 10 with DLC"
4608,siiii
4609,very very nice but sometimes edmund make mistake.
4610,"69 quintillions / 10


just play the game its totally worth it"
4611,"I've barely started to play this game, but seems nice!"
4612,game sucks dont play
4613,"very fun but bad thing is that its addicting and its an actual challenging game to beat and get all achievements!
multiplayer is also fun but one person needs a controller."
4614,if you want to have a life that game isn't for you
4615,Fajna gierka do chilowania
4616,:(
4617,I am suffering with the child in the basement who likes to cosplay and put things in his eyes
4618,"wow. this game. every time i play. boom, something new. i bought all the dlc's and i bet im not even halfway through the game. i am totally blown away by issac and other characters and their abilities. i give this game an 9.8/10."

4628,i liek the game
4629,"Im starting to develop antisocial tendencies
"
4630,damn
4631,its really good and better if you'r looking for a challenge and one of the better indie games I've played i would 100% recommend (unless you rage a lot)
4632,i found pills
4633,"Well, honestly the game isn't for everyone, being that it can be unforgiving at some level. Personally it is fun and especially when your run is broken with powerful synergies. Play this game if you like a challenge, I suppose. There is a learning curve that can intimidate the best of the gamers out there, I bet, but it is worth it to give it a chance..maybe 100 hours at least"
4634,"My go-to game when I just want to zone out and chill. Takes skill and some knowledge about the game mechanics, but once you get the hang of it you win fairly often. Even at 140+ hours, each game feels fresh as different upgrades require you to adapt your play style"
4635,Oh my god ultra greed fuck dsude

4641,"Really unique and original game! Very dark subject matter, but that's what makes it so great - not much else quite like it. There's so many things to unlock and work toward, you can replay over and over and never get bored. Having never played anything quite like this before, it took me a while to get the hang of it but I found the learning curve wasn't so difficult that it was not enjoyable - you can feel the progression of your skills over time and the unlocks really help to. Definitely recommend!"
4642,"you're the nirvana baby and you play rated r adventure time and do heroin and your mom's a psychotic cunt who tries to kill you because she has major schizophrenia and probably has a history using lsd and heard god's voice telling her to kill you so you go into the basement and it's a near bottomless pit of random creatures and humanoid infants with insects in their skin and you kill satan and yourself and it's a fun game

4650,"Nothing really needs to be said about this game, it's one of those games that you can throw 500+ hours and still find more things to do, every single hour playing this is fun."
4651,"He's the number one; God's favorite Son.
His flowing robes leads down from Heaven.
His hands will touch you; build a world around you.
The light within His heart is enough to heal us all.
He will fill your soul when life takes its toll.
Your only goal is to find His kingdom.
His love is real; the golden seal.
Trust in the book and the bread you took"
4652,I hate this game. How do I stop? I can't stop. Isaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac 10/10
4653,"How do you even rate this game. After completing this game 3 seperate times (100%'ed once for every dlc that came out), and none of the experiences being comparable, it's just hard stating everything in one condensed review, so i'm just gonna try and quickly summarise as much as i can here.

What is Binding of Isaac: Rebirth?

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is the sequel to the immensely popular indie game The Binding of Isaac (big shocker, i know) and it basically improves and refines the formula the original flash game had to a ridiculous degree. The game is a roguelike, meaning that every run you have is rather short and, outside of unlocking new items for future runs, the runs themselves are entirel unconnected. This makes the game great for playing in short bursts, playing a run or two and then moving on to something else. 

The Good:
-Ridiculously polished gameplay loop
-Incredibly large item pool, with most of the items being worthwhile, leading to a lot of unique runs
-Enemy and boss design is, for the most part, incredibly well done. Some stand-out bosses are incredibly memorable
-Gradual increasae in difficulty, as you get better at the game, you also unlock new paths for different ""final"" bosses
-Almost all the playable characters feel distinct from one another and most of them are fun to play
-Great soundtrack and sound design in general

The Bad:
-the level of RNG is pretty insane at times, leading to some runs that simply feel unwinnable no matter what you do
-Suffering from success: Repentance adds a lot of content. Maybe too much, more than doubling the amount of playable characters was a bit overkill and the sheer volume of new content leads to the game feeling a bit bloated with some of the ends being a little unfinished on release.

The Ugly (Major spoilers ahead):
-Some of the characters added in Repentance are either so hard to play that they border on unfun (Tainted Jacob), or are simply so incredibly boring that you have to look at guides for half an hour per run to even play the character (Tainted Cain). Tainted Cain is the worst designed character in any game i have come across and balance patches have just made him worse.
-This is the Delirium hatred section: This is the ""final"" boss of the Afterbirth + dlc and MY GOD THIS IS THE WORST BOSS IN THE ENTIRE GAME. He has bullet hell elements similarly to The Hush (final boss of the previous dlc), but that's not the problem. The issue arises with the fact the he can change forms to other bosses you have met in the run, but on steroids. After losing some health, he gets even faster and more erratic. But the worst part is the teleporting. THE FUCKING TELEPORTING. He can randomly teleport around the room, which often leads to you getting damaged through ""tele-fragging"", aka he teleports either very close to you and hits you with a neigh-undodgeable attack, or he straight up teleports inside of you to deal contact damage. This boss almost made me quit the game on its own, because of how incredibly unfun, annoying, tedious, frustrating it is to fight him

In summary: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Afterbirth Afterbirth+ Repentance is an overall incredibly fun experience with a lot of replayability and the good massively outweighs the bad, but it has a handful of key factors that drag it down from being an absolute masterpiece. Still one of my favourite games and an easy rating of

8/10"

4676,"I don't get it, why is there a child?"
4677,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaac as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac.
Isaac was simple, and they were both Isaac.
That was, until the day Isaac's Isaac heard a Isaac from above: ""Your Isaac has become corrupted by Isaac! He needs to be Isaac!""

""I will do my best Isaac to save Isaac, my Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again, the Isaac called to her:
""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac! He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac.""

""I will follow your Isaac, Isaac. I have Isaac in thee,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac away in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of you.""

""Yes, Isaac. Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac begged.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I require a Isaac. Your Isaac Isaac will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to me, to Isaac that you Isaac me above all Isaac!""

""Yes, Isaac,"" she replied, grabbing a Isaac from the Isaac.
Isaac, watching through a Isaac in the Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find a Isaac, he noticed a Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac and threw Isaac down into the unknown Isaac below."

4691,"Provavelmente um dos melhores jogos em termos de conteúdo e re-jogabilidade. Cada pedaço desse jogo é cheio de personalidade e criatividade, e a jogabilidade fala por si só. Um conceito extremamente simples que funciona por diversas horas de jogatina, com muitas variações de itens, coisas para fazer e desbloquear, modos de aproveitar cada item, além do gerenciamento de recursos e encorajamento a aprender como usar cada item ao máximo para seu benefício. Ainda assim, um jogo desafiante, até para jogadores mais experientes.
Ao meu ver, não há um jogo que dê tanto valor por seu preço, mesmo custando (no momento dessa review) 100 reais pelo jogos e pelas DLCs, que incrementam ainda mais o conteúdo extenso deste jogo.
A história do jogo é contada por cutscenes e até mesmo pelos próprios itens obtidos enquanto joga, e faz uma crítica à religião organizada e como ela pode afetar as crianças e menores de idade. Porém, não se resume a uma crítica, ela aprofunda na vida de Isaac, sua imaginação, e como ele vê o mundo ao seu redor.
Se você busca um desafio que pode te proporcionar milhares de horas de entretenimento, com cada jogatina sendo diferente da anterior, você tem o DEVER de jogar Binding of Isaac."

4695,"isaac and his isaac lived alone in a small isaac on an isaac. isaac kept to himself, drawing isaacs and playing with his isaacs while his isaac watched christian isaac on the isaac. isaac was simple, and they were both isaac. that was, till the day isaac's isaac heard an isaac. ""your isaac isaac has become isaac he needs to be isaac"" ""I will do my best."" isaac's isaac replied, rushing into isaac's isaac and removing all that was isaac from his isaac. once again, the isaac called ""you have isaac-ed isaac, but i isaac your isaac. to isaac your isaac, i will isaac you an isaac. go into his isaac and end his isaac. your isaac isaac will be the isaac."

4710,"very good game. yes, much fun"
4711,"This game has overwhelmingly positive reviews for good reason. Few games have the luxury of being worked on in several forms through the course of a decade as I write this and will probably continue to receive updates for the sake of fixing bugs. It's hard to fault the game for that though considering the sheer scope of it. This game is probably the only game where an achievement can strictly make the game more difficult or complex and make you feel good about it. If the religious themes and crude humor doesn't scare you off of the trail to the true ending, then welcome to the basement. The community's glad to have you."
4712,"This game is incredibly unique.  I've never played a game with so much replay value.  You can beat the game in about an hour, but doing that won't give you the true experience of this game.  I currently have over 800 hours in this game and I'm still nowhere close to getting 100% even on one file, but I'm loving all of the progression towards it.  This game is best experienced with the DLC.  Every DLC pack is so large that it basically turns this game into a new game.  100% totally recommend."

4781,"I have been playing this game on and off since its release. It is by far my favorite rogue-like to date. I cannot express the joy and pain this game has brought to my life. Those feelings that will continue until I finish all my post it notes. The replayability this game offers is on another level to almost any other game I've played before. No run is the same. Combine this with tough but fluid gameplay, a great soundtrack, tons of different floors, bosses, and endings. Isaac is full of surprises to newcomers and has near infinite replayability for the die hard fans. I cannot recommend this game enough. It taught me how to enjoy hard video games and got me into the genre of rogue likes and souls-likes."

The potatoes name was tom,he was sad because he had to do a quest. you see, It was a very big task doing all the plumbing in the town. It was strange because normally the king would give you a quest to save a princess or slay a beast. But no, the king said to do the plumbing, in fact Tom just thought it was a waste of time. So Tom avoided it day after night. But when sewer waste started coming out of the tapes Tom was locked in the sewer. Which was great because he could finally start his quest. The only bad part was that he would be there a while. After 2 years he came out of the sewer, super dirty and heroic. they had a party and a sower. One day later he died of poisoning, so heroic.
5 months later the sewer clogged up again and everything was back to normal

okay its fine i got good run"
4841,I mean...c'mon.
4842,"This game is incredibly addictive and has seemingly endless amounts of content, it´s a stunningly great game...and then comes the point where you get really hooked and try to complete it. From there on out it´s lots and lots of pain but the good kind of pain, of which you cant get enough. I´ve had multiple days where i played for hours at a time, until I decided I had enough of the game, just to go back playing for hours again 20 minutes later."
4843,"Edmund McMillen, you little f*cker, I paid $50~ for this shit of piece and did not regret my purchase! great game 10\10"
4844,"Excellent game, makes up for a good time spender!"
4845,"the game is fun, gameplay is exciting, many different enemies and a frankly absurd amount of items/unlocks. this is the only roguelike where every run is truely unique. 

this along with the cryptic and gross, yet very appealing artstyle and lore implications make this a very entertaining game. 

HOWEVER 

the game is very RNG based. VERY. RNG. BASED. this won't be a super big problem if you are skilled at the game, but if you are around average or lower in skill your runs will be based a lot on weather or not:

you get good items
you get keys when you need them
you get healing items when you need them
you get unlucky with room generation (some are harder than others)

and many other things. here are some examples of times when i personally did very little wrong but the game decided to F*** me over:

i didn't get any health for 2 rooms
i ONLY got health items, making me unable to kill anything in the later stages of the game
i got ONLY damage items, making more bullet-helly bosses practically impossible
i got 5 active items in a row (items that can be activated with a button, you can only equip 1 at a time making multiple useless)

it can feal super unfair. if you can accept that and have fun with the game for what it is, than i highly reccomend this game.

4860,this game is fun beyond everything but it pisses me because haha 30 flys first room you walk into ur dead or you get screwed by getting several bad items in a row but other then that great game 10/10 would play modded again
4861,helps me cope
4862,"doesn't worth money paid at all
1've been playing previously(several years ago). and through some versions game graphics and optimization progressed a lot. but it's not becoming less repetitive in a way needed(imo) - you have many boss variations, all of them is the same boring thing
another problem of the game is pointless long-to-comlete rooms on first several floors. they are not hard just extremely annoying(looks like filler-parts of the movie, completely unnecessary here, in the game)
overall theme of the game is disgusting too. 1 cannot comply about that, supposedly(as mentioned played previously & watched trailer). but there is clearly too much of it. you will possibly get uncomfortable(if any moral persists in your heart)"
4863,"its a great game

4873,Gud Gaem
4874,"Every run is always something new, filled with odd trinkets to go from a frail child to an unstoppable room-clearing and boss-slaying god. 

Out of all the roguelikes I've played, this is the one I always come back to. There's always something to do and something to work for, whether it be getting completion marks on characters or beating challenges to unlock even more trinkets/items/what have you.

Only problem is that you essentially need all the DLC in order to experience the game fully, which is fine since it goes on sale quite frequently. I was only willing to pick up the game when said DLC did go on sale, but when it did, I've been playing it since I got them.

If you like roguelikes and haven't tried out Isaac, give it a try."
4875,10/10 would recommend to experienced players except just don't play T Jacob
4876,Fun. Tip: Unlock Azazel ASAP. Makes the game much easier.

4878,Best Rogue like game there is!
4879,Amazing game
4880,I will get my money
4881,"I would say that The Binding of Isaac is the perfect rogue like, period. The amount of content, variety, challenges, bosses, enemies and items is staggering. 

You will have in your hands a game that you can play for literally all the hours you'd want without getting repetitive.

The joy of getting a ""perfect run"" where the stars align and you get the best power ups and items is like nothing you can experience in a videogame.

Also, the style and religious theme of the game fits perfectly with it's tone, atmosphere and graphics.

The only way I wouldn't recomend this game to you, is if you find parodies of religion ""blasfemous"", you get grossed out by violence, gore and filth or you despise challenging games. Other than that, just play it!"

4883,"Great game with endless possibilities

4886,kkk
4887,"Excellent bang for your buck. At sale it might cost less than 10€ per expansion but the amount of hours you will put in will greatly exceed what you thought possible. If you don't take advantage of all content, don't expect to have as much gametime as me.

With 34 characters, each having 24 completion marks you won't find yourself without something to do anytime soon, considering that most characters have some requirement to be unlocked before you can play them.
This is without considering things like challenges and then the other secret unlockables.
Every unlockable thing is a Steam Achievement, which is why it has 500+ achievements, but it doesn't take overlong to get them all, until you get stuck at certain tainted characters.

Will recommend to anyone with ~20-30 min to spare per run, maybe less if you die but then again - RNG is a bitch. Oh yeah, gameplay. It's fun if you don't tryhard. But some things need tryharding. Thus it sometimes isn't fun. All you need is the right combination of items to breeze through the game-"
4888,"I dont get validation IRL so I need to to get it from achievements. Look at me, I 100% TBOI without cheating, are you proud now?

4892,(:
4893,No other roguelike I've played has come close to the amount of replay value this game has given me. All the zany power ups and combos you can get is an absolute joy to use until I die and rage quit only to come back a few mins afterwards because this time I'll finally get that clear. It's this that drives me to continue playing for hours on and I love it.

It's one of the best games ever made, many people are saying this."
4905,"very overrated game, gets extremely boring real fast. the enjoyement of a run is purely based on rng, and if you're unlucky like me you will always end up struggling on the later floors or resetting most of your runs when you reach cellar I because you only found shit items.
despite the gameplay being quite bad the artstyle is kinda amazing ngl

4917,"Expanded version of the original Binding of Isaac. If you loved that game, or like rogue-likes in general, this is for you.

Lots more mayhem and faster action than the original, which can mean many more deaths, but it also makes for more things to discover. Nice fun, ""just one more game"" type of game, but at least when you die you have a definitive ""take a break now"" point, unlike something like Civilization which can go on for days."
4918,fyi you dont have to be religious to play this
4919,I got 150 hours on this game using FAMILY SHARE WITH MY BROTHERS ACCOUNT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF

4922,"A fun rogue like with an overwhelming amount of content. 

I struggled trying to like the art style of this game and i still dont but its what makes this game good, because it just fits its style of gameplay and story."
4923,This is a cool game.
4924,best game ever!
4925,"I'll just use this review to tell you NEVER USE THE BIBLE ON SATAN!

It's a suicide action. Save yourself an hour of your time by not having to learn it the hard way like I had to.

Oh and since there is a mechanic that insta destroys your progression by doing something as intuitive as using the bible on the Devil I'll keep the review negative. Maybe change it to where you lose half your life or something but insta death is a badly designed mechanic in any game that gives you a life bar. Of all the deaths I had, this one is most certainly the only unfair one. The price to pay to learn this is just too high and it didn't feel like this run made me get better.

Don't be dissuaded in buying the game because of this. It's still fun but moments like this HAVE TO BE MENTIONED to any players out there.

Bad game design, Edd..

EDIT: With the Afterbirth DLC, you can mod the game to be less frustrating to play, with many interesting options such as getting item description in game (very useful if you don't have the memory of a theater actor), item pool modification so you can get better items and a more pleasant experience (unless you are a masochist or a Dead God), etc.

Get the game WITH AFTERBIRTH! Skymod is a good starting point for a fair & fun game experience."

4947,"DEfinitely not a game for anyone who doesn't like gore/cruel imagery. But it has it's own style at least! DEfinitely worth playing, the characters are well designed (besides tainted eden). The gameplay by itself is well balanced and fun"
4948,
4949,"Highly recommended, especially if you played and enjoyed The Legend of Zelda for the NES.

If you enjoy rougelike games or the traditional Zelda game format, or if you are looking for something you can invest 5 or 10 minutes in here and there, you will likely enjoy this game.  There are bullet-hell elements to the later, harder bosses that are a lot of fun if you've enjoyed that style of game also.

One of the best features of this game, and the original game that inspired it, are the extensive references to both religious and game culture, and the oddly positive/humorous twist it takes in these references -- a bit of extra fun for those with a shared background/history with these areas.

Those turned off by poop humor may enjoy this game less.

4950,"game is pog, worth the cash"

4990,"After nearly 30 hours, I have the utmost confidence in saying that this is my new favorite game of all time. Tied right up there with Yakuza Like A Dragon. This game is so unbelievably outstanding, that I'm struggling to put everything to words. I can talk about this game for hours, don't get me wrong, but I can't discuss it to that extent without getting into spoilers.

That is how important a blind play-through is. Let me emphasize, this game is best played 100% blind. More than any other game. At most, play the demo (that isn't available on steam for some reason), and maybe know that it's a sci-fi VN that isn't for the squeamish. That's it. Because this game throws so many twists, turns, loops, and details that even pointing out one of the many genius things this game did is pulling on one thread of this beautifully crafted sweater, of which is best pulled apart yourself.

This game had me falling off my seat laughing, glasses off and face down crying, fetus position terrified, and even physically ill at points. I would wake up every morning these last few days, scrambling to reach for my controller so I can see if the theory I dreamed about came true. I would go back and play parts, to feel the emotions that no other game has made me feel. This game gave me an experience, and I cannot recommend said experience enough. I will never forget this game."

Too many useless items."
5005,666/999
5006,Isaac means a lot to me as a player. This was the first game that I was able to really focus on and get fully invested in. I have made a full spreadsheet for all three files with what has been completed and what still needs to be completed. The actual gameplay varies from great to fair to unlucky to complete bs but despite bugs and unfairness I still find myself coming back to sell my soul to Edmund and complete this game.

5038,It’s fun but limited mod support unfortunately but you can still get antibirth on here which is sweet. If you plan on getting this try to get AB+ as that has the most support in the steam workshop but a great base game nonetheless.

5042,yes fun
5043,Its Isaac just buy it
5044,the best rougelike I have ever played
5045,cool game pirated this game like 5 five years ago to play on my school computer and basically finished the game
5046,"I've spent a lot of time playing this game. While it can be fun, especially if you do custom challenges via console commands or just playing it with another person, it is a genuinely painful experience if you play it for completion (like me). Some characters feel unplayable without very specific items (Like tainted Lost with Glowing Hourglass or Tainted Eden with Birthright). While I'm not the best at the game, I am definitely skilled at least to some extent, and some characters just feel so impossible to actually get marks with. And for as fun as the RNG can make the game, it's really not fun to lose a run because you happened to get a really bad room or got bad items. While this game is still one of my favorite games for how much replayability it has and for how fun a lot of the characters are (I personally enjoy Tainted Judas and Tainted Jacob, as well as The Forgotten), I would not recommend it for people with short tempers and I especially would not recommend it for completionists due to how infuriating it is to get marks with certain characters (for me Tainted Lost, Tainted Bethany, ???, and both Keepers are the worst to play for marks). Not to mention some bosses (The Bloat being the main one) feel unfair and overly difficult for no good reason. Tboi is a very good game with a lot of fun bosses, mechanics, characters, and items, but playing it for completion or unlocks is just downright painful, and can be really repetitive and sometimes feel outright impossible, hence I don't recommend it unless you have lost of patience or are just a masochist"
5047,very very nice game
5048,"vare fun recommend this game also some of the mods are funi XD
20/10 most buy if you like roguelike games"
5049,"Game, even after so many years, just does it right for a rogue-like. Simple yet so much content and synergies. Just love this game probably till I'm an old ass person xD"
5050,"I have not felt this childlike excitement to play a game in almost 2 years, but this game rekindled my excitement to play games on the daily

Genuinely so fun, endless replayability, constant improvement, a lot of content, insane modding support, satisfying, challenging, all the good marks
"
5051,It's a good game  8/10.
5052,"this is the best game to play if you don't know what game you want to play or if your just bored. every run is different, there are hundreds of items! 600 achievements! 102 bosses! and a lot of characters to unlock. this game is also beginner friendly no matter how bad you are, if your lucky and get good items you can easily beat the game. but theres a catch to truly beat the game you have to beat it a couple of times. this game isn't too hard or too easy. if you played or play newgrounds there are tons of references in the game. every character has a different ability and some even have different attacks! trust me, just when you think you've beaten the game you haven't. overall this game is very fun and you can play it for a very long time without getting bored. you might see your friend play this, watch videos of this game, or remote play with your friends and not like it, so did I until I tried it myself and ever since i've been playing this nonstop. I genuinely don't think you can go wrong with this game."
5053,"one of the best games that i have played
best rouge game"
5054,egg
5055,Its an okay game.
5056,"A fun, ever changing rogue like that will keep you on your toes at all times"
5057,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That was, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac. 'Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac.' 'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac', she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below.

The story of the game is pretty good but it doesn't negatively affect the game when you dont know it, the games ost is great, there is a plenty of characters and a great amount of mods to mold your experience, you can add mods that work well and look like in game content... or a car.

5178,"I love this game, but dor some reason once i installed the DLCs it stopped working (mac user)"
5179,if you like any kind of dungeon crawler type game this is a good game for you. not only does it have a ton of items (hundreds even) to mess around with it also has a lot of characters for you to mess around with including different ways to unlock them all. you get a great sense of acomplishment from just playing the game as you unlock characters and new items as well as expanding the game itself adding new levels enemies and bosses. this has hours and hours of replay value and even unlocking every single item can be fun. there is very little to complain about in this game and i highly recommend trying it out

TBIO is a rouge-like in which you move from floor to floor battling gruesome enemies and collecting power ups. At the core of it's game play this is all there is, but the sheer amount of replayability mixed with the dopamine rush only comparable to gambling is what makes this game stand out. It's known for being unrelentingly difficult, even among people who have made a career out of playing it."
5201,cool
5202,"games good
"
5203,"This game is so complicated but so fun, your gonna have to play for hours just to learn that this item spawns poop and it has a perfect synergy with this item which makes poop gold and that synergy will work perfectly with another item that refreshes shops for free but you havent unlocked any of those items so you have to go kill satan 34 times with varying characters and for some reason you have to kill your mother 5 times and then her heart 10 times before you can even access satan, and if you dont have good items you cant kill the heart 10 times but the good items requier you to kill the heart with different characters but those characters requier you to kill the heart so your stuck in an infinet loop of dying with one character untill you get a marginally good item or give up and turn on the debug menu, and even after you do eventually kill satan 34 times you still have to kill mega satan 34 more times but you cant kill him with half of those characters becuase you havent unlocked the tainted version but you cant get to the place where you get those characters because you havent unlocked and killed the secret boss which requiers you to go through 4 more painfully hard levels just to get this one item which lets you fight the boss and if you die even once during all this its all gone down the drain and you have to repeat it again untill you get a good item setup and arent stuck with literal shit , and you havent even unlocked the shit yet so you dont get anything, and even after all this, where youve killed every boss with every character and done all the secrets, you still need to memorise what every fucking item does or else your gonna pick up some piece of shit item which completely ruins your run and kills you, and then you have to memorise them all over again when mods get involved, which turns your pc into  the potato from portal 2. Still theres a mod that adds vine boom sound effect so good game really no complaints."

5256,"The best roguelike i have ever played. Not repeatable, every run is different. Bosses are balanced and fair (expect Delirium). You can choose game difficulty: Hard (which give you less hearts, bullets are faster and enemies has more hp) and normal (you get more hp, bosses are easier and bullet are slow). A very addictive game for hours, I recommend it with all my heart <3"

5272,"This game is older in the current grand scheme of roguelikes/rogulites, and, with the addition of the added DLC's, it still holds up very very well. Although I would say that the base Rebirth version of the game is still pretty good, adding on every DLC that has released for the game adds so many new bosses, items, areas, characters, etc. that it essentially is a sequel of sorts to the original version. Not every area is unique or a hit, and not every boss is super enjoyable to fight or jaw-dropping, but the sheer amount of them and the diversity between them makes up for it.

If you are not super familiar with the genre this game is a part of, in this game, you essentially go through rooms of randomly-generated floors and fight enemies while getting items that change how you attack or function, getting stat upgrades for your character, and at the end, fight a boss. You proceed to the next floor, and the enemies and bosses get progressively harder until you fight the ""final boss"" of that run. However, what is considered the ""final boss"" of the game at that time in your save changes significantly as you continue to play. Keep in mind that that was a very big simplification of the game, and there is a lot more to it than that.

The one thing in my experience that this game does the best is item synergy, as in how well different items work with one another. After unlocking certain items in your save, you can create some absolutely ridiculous builds that are either extremely busted or are just really fun to use, or both; for example, being able to shoot 3 homing rockets out of your eyes that spawn more rockets when they hit something, starting from just simply shooting basic teardrop projectiles. There is much, much more crazy builds than that, but it is mostly up to randomness for you to get them.

I will say that a bad run with bad items in this game sucks pretty bad, but the fact that you can just simply hit R to start your run over makes it a least a little better; after all, bad runs are a staple in these kind of games. Every run you do can be so different from the last, for better or worse, but that is what keeps it interesting, in addition to the large amount of characters you can select from with different stats, starting items, or effects. Touching on characters for a sec, the Bethany character that you can unlock with the Repentance DLC can create some of the most diverse builds out of any of the characters you can play, and can make any run at least fun to do.

In the end, this game is a very addicting roguelite with great build synergy possibilities, a large amount of enemies and bosses to kill, a ton of side challenges that unlock new items for you to use, and a ton of endings to get as you get further into the game. Having the ability to add on great mods like Antibirth on PC doesn't hurt either. The Binding of Isaac has always been and continues to be a staple of the genre."

5359,"Unforgiving piece of 💩.

But kidding aside, it is still not a perfect game. At least some of its parts are really BAD.

[b]Good parts[/b]:
[list]
  [*] Replay value - Very high. Tons of items/trinkets (and different combinations between them), dozen of characters might keep you in game for hours
  [*] RND - Largest force that can (and will) ruin your run. Some people like this.
  [*] Many kind of enemies. Most of them annoying. Suitable for people with peculiar taste 
  [*] Music
[/list]

[b]Bad parts[/b]:
[list]
  [*] No in-game wiki or context help - You have to either remember what each item/trinket do or use a site or mobile app with image recognition to figure out whether this item is good or bad for the run. I can't imagine a person who would enjoy doing such stuff.
  [*] This game is addictive - Well, it can be a good part as well.
  [*] Some items not simply useless but can be a burden (like charged shot or orbital tears)
  [*] The game make you enjoy self torturing. After loosing several runs you might unable to resist trying again.
  [*] Game obsession with poop - I fail to understand what is this thing is about.
[/list]

PS: Thumbs down for ""No in-game wiki or context help"" - this is most annoying part of the game for me."

5418,good game
5419,"Baby's first rouge-like. Very simple to comprehend and fun to boot. A completionist's nightmare, but fun in a way. Absolutely a must-buy with the most recent DLC.
Pros:
+ Simple and attractive design
+ Fun gameplay and immersive
+ Fun to run around with OP tactics
+ Wide range of characters to suite multiple playstyles
+ Lots to unlock and play around with!
Cons:
- VERY RNG based. (Random room/floor layouts, items, enemies, etc.) You can be OP on the first floor or have nothing worthwhile at the end of the run. The most random of things can be extremely beneficial or absolutely terrible.
- Frustrating for certain unlocks (Looking at you, cobweb brat and skeleton man)
- Religion is a big topic in the world of this game. (Duh.) Some may find this offensive. (Unless you don't follow a religion, then it's just fun.)
- Hitbox for the character may be a little off at times, but this requires time to get used to.
- HUUUUGE time-sink for people who want that 100% completion

BONUS NOTES:
If you buy, you should also look thru the workshop for the following mods. They can all be turned back off if you prefer the original gameplay:
- J&E overhaul (Makes them a bit easier to play overall, but this one is very much subjective.)
- Item descriptions (Shows a little hud that will tell you what an item does before taking it. Works for cards and pills too!)
- POG for good items! (Just because :))
- Enhanced boss bars (Adds a little flare and helps to know which boss(es) you've damaged when there's more than one.)
- Animated items (More flare)
- Planetarium chance (To help with clarity once they're unlocked.)"
5420,"I honestly have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game.

It's replayable to hell and back, with an immense amount of possible combinations- You could do a million runs and they would be nothing alike. Game proved really addictive to me for that reason, as the hours confirm- and that's without add-ons. No difficulty settings, but there are plenty of ways to make a run easier or more challenging, so I believe the game can be played by quite a broad audience. Plenty of stuff to unlock for completionists, too. While the lore isn't very deep, it's plenty interesting and I recommend looking into fan theories if you're into that.

My favourite feature of the game is its soundtrack which I think is an absolute gem, and I'll still be listening to it long after I stop playing. You could forgo the game entirely and it would still be a massive banger.

Overall a great game, if you're into roguelikes I heavily recommend it."

5517,"NOTE: Everything in this review is based upon having access to all DLCS, up to Repentance. All versions of this game are great, but Repentance makes it the perfect experience.

It's strange, isn't it? Somehow an indie game from 2014, getting a final DLC in 2021, would make this the pinnacle of indie games, maybe even a contender for games of all time?

Currently, this is my most played game on Steam. This was very shocking to me, as it felt like no time had passed at all. The thing is, all of that time, all four hundred and fifty hours were spent doing new things, new situations, new ways to both utterly break the game and ways for the game to completely break me. Every single mechanic works together in this wonderfully chaotic mix of reason and pure insanity, with some runs going from zero to hero because of a single item you hadn't seen or even thought of for days, or weeks. Even after 100%ing the game on a single save file, I'm sure if I were to start up a new run, it would surprise me even then. 

Even if you 100 percent the game, and you want more content, there is plenty of it in the way of Steam Workshop. Countless characters, entirely new ways to play the game, add-ons to make the game all that much more playable and re-visitable. With plenty of massive mods in the works to add on hundreds of more hours of gameplay, there will never be a shortage of things to do, and, if you're feeling like contributing to the community, create. 

This game truly is the pinnacle of rogue-likes. While I thought someday Issac in it's most basic form would be overtaken by some other game in the rogue-like genre, with all of it's DLCs, it is IMPOSSIBLE for that to happen. This is, and will forever be, the ultimate rogue-like experience, at least until a sequel comes out, if that ever happens.

Buy the complete edition. Every single penny is worth it, and you will get more than your moneys worth out of it."

5559,"The Binding of Isaac is the heartwarming story of a small child just trying to make a name for himself. Here's some of the game play you can expect from this touching experience:

- shoot your sadness at freaks of nature (this makes them explode)
- poop
- make deals with the devil, regret it within minutes
- kill the devil because that made you mad
- kill your mom
- kill yourself
- kill yourself (a clone)
- kill yourself (a clone, but he's dead and blue for some reason)
- enter your mom's corpse and kill her again
- kill poop
- play as characters based on scripture
- face off against the embodiment(s) of sin
- get mercilessly slaughtered repeatedly
- complete hard challenges only to unlock something even harder
- befriend insects
- so many insects
- collect the body parts of your dead cat to become him and ascend to godhood
- hold your eyelids open with toothpicks (this makes you cry faster)
- stab yourself in the head with a safety pin (this makes your cries faster (not a typo))
- poop
- why is it always the fucking bloat
- poop
- any many more

10/10 a real tear-jerker (HAHAHAHAHAHA)"

5561,"Rebirth is SO much better than the classic!!! It adds a ton of new features, such as new items, new enemies and bosses, better rooms, more challenges, smoother animations, better fps... If you can think of an improvement, It's probably here! [includes Rebirth and the DLCs]"

5600,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself - drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaac as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on Isaac. Isaac was simple and they were both Isaac. That was, until the Isaac heard of Isaac from Isaac. ""Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac. He needs to be Isaac."" ""I will do my best Isaac in my Isaac ,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. 
Again, the Isaac called Isaac. ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac."" ""I will follow you, Isaac. I have Isaac in Thee,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac away from the Isaac of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes, Isaac. Anything,"" Isaac's Isaac begged. ""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac, will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac Me above all Isaac."" ""Yes, Isaac,"" she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. 
Isaac, watching through a Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaac below.

5620,"Now this one's a bit controversial. On one hand you have a very well made game, with lots of developing history, and on the other you have a blasphemous piece of work featuring abortion, sex, drugs, and loads of shit. Literally.
I love this game, it's challenging and frustrating, but in the end it's got that overcoming thingy that soulslike games have. it's got hundreds of hours of content, if you want to explore all those achievements, now with all dlc finished. Sure it's a bit pricy now, but what 500 hour+ game isn't."
5621,"""You need to repent. You need to confess your sins and become saved! Let His light inside you! Cleanse your soul!"""

( i already looked up several guides but none was able to help me) okay so how do i put this.. i accidentally killed my mom? idk i thought it would give me the last achievement yk, beating mom with all isaac characters gave me majority of the steam achievements but not all of them.. but altho she is rotting in our bathroom, the last achievement doesnt pop on the screen? i am utterly confused about what to do now, especially since i cant find a way to enter her corpse? man idk im just a lil desperate since it ruins my steam profile's completion stastistics, without the last achievement and all

5667,"Astounding game, easy to pick up, challenging gameplay, awesome visuals, and a dark, dark story. I have played for 400 hours and still have many great things to do. Not the cheapest with all the DLC now but every DLC is the size of the game so it is difficult to complain. On top of that all of this comes bundled with 700% pain! What is there not to love? Ed you glorious son of a bitch, take all my money."

5698,subpar game
5699,just a realy fun game
5700,yeah its aight
5701,One of my favorites of all time. So many hours across at least 3 platforms. A shining example of how to do a roguelike.
5702,I spend over 1000 hours with this game. I hate it and i love it so so much.
5703,"Great game, In my opinion it should get a few new characters though"
5704,"Probably in my top 5 of favourite games of all time. Tight skill-based gameplay with a bit of RNG to add to replayability and tons and tons of content. Also some interesting lore, but not much of a story. Overall heavily gameplay-focused. It's not perfect, but highly enjoyable if you like hard roguelikes with a a bit of a learning curve."
5705,running a tainted lost run to mother hurts more than birth
5706,"Gradually unlocking new content (Items, stages, characters, and enemy types) over multiple runs is very satisfying and helps keep things fresh. A lot of similar games do this (Risk of Rain 1&2 and Enter the Gungeon), but I feel like The Binding of Isaac takes this to a whole different level. There's just so much to unlock and explore.

Ive played this game for 69 hours and im only just now barely touching end-game content, its crazy how much the devs have managed to fit into this game. Plus if you ever get bored of the vanilla base game content there's a huge selection of awesome mods on the Steam Workshop to mess around with."
5707,I like it 😃.
5708,Great game much spooks and blood and goreish love it
5709,Good game and very fun play together with my friend in this game i see only 1 - expensive if u wanna have full game

5722,"This game is a perfect blend of casual and hardcore grind. You can either play for all the unlocks or just play every so often when all your other games are boring you. Although it can sometimes be rage inducing, the blend of luck and skill is normally relatively fair for most characters. Probably use a mod for external information so you don't always have to go to the wiki though! (If you're worried about achievements being locked away because you're using mods then just beat mother once on your save file without mods and then you're able to download them and still get achievements)"

5764,"Always loved this game. Played it on PS4 and Xbox One and never got the Platinum God achievement, now I'm aiming for that and beyond like 1 mill%. I'm dedicated. I very much implore anyone who likes Rogue-lites to get this game."
5765,Edmund McMillen ily
5766,"Really great game, really really great game"
5767,"I hate this game with every fiber of my being. 

With that said I LOVE this game and it is 100% worth your money. So many things to do. I've owned this game for over a year and still haven't gotten close to 100% beating the game. It doesn't get boring either, it stays fun (for the most part) and addicting. 

Occasionally there are bosses and floors and rng that will screw you over and feel very unfair, but to be entirely honest, that's part of the charm of the game. Every player has that moment where your perfect run is ruined by the smallest bit of ring, but it's part of the game.

Totally reccomend this game, but I do warn that there is some graphic content in the sense of there is a lot of content involving Isaac being abused by his mother and father."
5768,"gud game
"
5769,Pepega
5770,"Currently the 3rd game i've had to reach 1000+ hours. I love this game but i will say it does have some issues, while it's clear there's a lot of care and thought put into the game, think it does have an issue of player retention? in a way. Unless if you're really into this game and roguelites, it's hard to really play the game after you've made a good amount of progress, in fact at least for me i've gone through some months of burnout more than twice during my entire playtime of this game. (could be due to playing roguelites a lot around those times)

I WILL say, that with Repentance that issue was lessened way more than it was an issue with AfterBirth+. The game is lots of fun still. Maybe it's a me issue that i sometimes tire of the game after a while, BUT HEY, about $25 for up to Repentance? It's a GREAT deal! i would just be careful with how much you burn yourself out on the genre


I wanted to add a bit to the story and themes of this game too, while i don't want to spoil things I love the symbolism and creativity with all the bosses and enemies, like my god it's great, and the story of the game backs that up!  The true ending that was added with Repentance actually made me tear up and wish for Isaac to have a happy life, and put me into a bit of a mood where i would think up what the ending meant, i personally like to think that with the inclusion of certain items like adoption papers that it would of applied to Isaac and that he would of been able to escape his horrible life thanks to his father. Makes me put a whole different spin on the game that Tboi is kinda about Isaac coping with his old life and thinking up what could of happened if he stayed. With the true ending being the true happy ending and a sign that even though Isaac had an awful life, things changed and he can have a happier life <3


Also an additional note, The music in this game is AWESOME!!!!!!! i can't think of a single track i honestly dislike, that's a big plus in my honest opinion. :P"
5771,"Just....sad.

5813,This game is a little cooky but fo sho a good buy 'wink'.  It's a mix of silly creepy and quirky fun characters with an eerie art style.  It's a widdle difficult at first but it gets bedder. lol.  Maybe not the best for first time newbies pee u.  But I do see this as a steal for giga chad pros who are looking for a harder challenge.  Gamers rise.
5814,e
5815,my balls itchy
5816,good game but bad game
5817,"basic bullet hell with a plethora of items, do recommend"
5818,good :steamthumbsup:
5819,It's good.
5820,"Where can I even begin with this gem of a game?

It has everything a rougelike person would want; secrets, lore, many many hidden strats for anything, and rewarding skill based gameplay...Do not even get me started on the IMMENSE amount of items! You always unlock something new for your next run, and those keep you going till you think when you mastered all the characters...then BOOM. INSTANTLY doubles what you got to do!

A amazing game that has shaped my childhood, especially with Repentance finally out
What are you doing reading this review? Go buy the damn game already!!"
5821,Very fun
5822,Poggers
5823,good
5824,I hate it.
5825,5/10 would probably cry again
5826,when you outside and you smell that ZAZA
5827,funne crying bb
5828,It really feels like you are binding isaac
5829,how the fuck do i have 5 hours on this game? i dont even own it?!
5830,"pog
play it or i will your mom :)"
5831,"amazing
"
5832,"One of the best rouge likes in terms of the variety that each run can potentially have. It's got a lot of secrets, a ton of depth that I'm still finding out almost 900 hours in, and the content expansions over the years have been great. 

The Workshop support really increases the already massive variety further in many ways, while not a must for the first time through (Which if your going for 100% can take, on a perfect clear for each char [spoiler] 17 Characters x 2 for tainted versions for a total of 34 unique characters x 24 seperate completion flags + the 10 per char needed to unlock the ability to even run all flags, at an avg of 15-25min per run! [/spoiler] ) really does add more flavor and options to the game.

5833,"garbage game, every boss should be the bloat"
5834,"yo

5835,game fun
5836,soooooo fun
5837,It's ok
5838,godhead is overrated
5839,Fun.
5840,its addicting lol
5841,This game makes me want to shove my head into a meat grinder. 10/10 experience.
5842,RNGesus please have mercy
5843,"A classic, also the best edition of the game as Steam allows for you to add mods to it and make the experience infinitely more replay-able and fun. There is simply nothing that I can say that is bad about The Binding of Isaac, this game is perfect.

10/10"
5844,yes.
5845,"i hate this game, strongly recomend
"
5846,"watched a game theory on this game 7 years ago ( i was 9) and it traumatized me so much that i wanted to play it ever since. finally got it as a 16 year old and honesty did not dissapoint. 

10/10 gave me nightmares when i was 9 for like a month"
5847,"It's an incredibly fun game, the controls are tight and responsive, there's a limitless amount of builds to do, and the levels are fun to navigate. 

on a different level, the overarching story of an extremely religious mother with sinister means of getting her point across is very similar to my childhood, so there may be some bias coming in.  i wish the creator all the best in the future (and realize what an awesome way he was able to transform his trauma into art.)"
5848,I'd cry if my basement was full of poop too
5849,baby shoot tears
5850,The game is very fun but steam won't let most people play it anymore. It launches it as a back round process while it cloud sincs and windows shuts it down as an error since that is not what the computer is trying to do. And if you try and launch the game with clond sinc turned off it says files out of sinc and refuses to launch it.
5851,
5852,This game is awesome amazing story and good game 10 out of 10 game
5853,I will get dead god one day
5854,"It's a good game, sure, but don't attempt getting all achievements. It will break you."
5855,good
5856,CAN´T SEX ISAAC
5857,Cry harder (laugh pls)
5858,"I played this game alot on Ps Vita, and it's still one of my favorite games. Surely try it, it's worth every cent u pay for it."
5859,p good
5860,Very fun to play.
5861,The amount of content is nuts
5862,"A masterpiece of rogue-lite history.

The sheer amount of raw, high-quality content in this game is not comparable to any other in it's genre. It took me 527h to finally unlock everything and complete become a Dead God. Isaac may take a little bit of commitment to get into, but once you're hooked, YOU'RE HOOKED. This game is both a completionist's nightmare and wet dream at the same time, and it's phenomenal. Repentance has expanded and improved the base experience of Isaac to beyond modern standards, gameplay-wise it is the best roguelike I have ever played. It feels amazing to unlock new things and finally beat something you have been struggling for a while. Learning this game and gaining a deeper understanding of its mechanics is pure satisfaction. 

Be sure to play this game with all the expansions, especially Repentance, as playing it without them is like playing a completely different game. [b] The modern version of the game is 'The Binding of Isaac: Repentance', be sure that is the one you buy for the best experience.[/b] 

I highly recommend giving Isaac at least a try, it's not expensive, especially on sale and if you get into it, you get incredible value for your time. Even beyond completing the game there is even more content as the game has a passionate and lively modding community via the steam workshop, able to tweak your experience to your liking."
5863,if you think you will like it. Play it.
5864,Boy crys and enemy die haha very cool
5865,The game that kick started the Rougelike trend. 10/10

5873,This game is hell on earth. I absolutely enjoy it
5874,yes it swag
5875,"The quintessential roguelike. Tons of content. So many hours of entertainment. It has bullet hell aspects in the end game portion, but also limitless potential for builds that can blow your mind and melt bosses."
5876,this game makes me angry and i love it
5877,IF YOU LIKE TO TALK TO TOMATOES
5878,"played a bit, its good"
5879,baby game for men
5880,shit game but i paid 50 dollars for it so its good
5881,Good game
5882,very fun and challenging game
5883,"it's great but it's got a lot of content bloat. One great quality is as you play the game and learn more about the different mechanics, you can really use them to your advantage to become much more powerful. 

overall i'd say if you wanna play a game of this genre for 100 hours + Isaac is the game. If you're looking for a shorter experience I'd try Enter the Gungeon. The amount of content in this is actually insane."
5884,I love the storyline and how smooth and simple the game is I'm about to purchase the others and I love and adore isaac and all the other playable characters.:)

5896,Is good
5897,"I do not exist

Therefore I do not suffer"
5898,uwu
5899,this game is sick af
5900,I play this game for the plot.
5901,"This game literally has me pissing and cumming in my pants, not only my pants though. My friends have been complaining to me every time I hop on this game, because I keep cumming and pissing in mine and their pants. It's a real problem that I have. Most of the time they're at work when it happens. But I just can't help it, I mean what am I supposed to do? Hold it in and blue ball myself? I don't think so, they can deal with a little piss and cum in their pants. I mean really, who doesn't carry an extra pair of pants and underwear with them. That's if they even wear underwear in the first place. I personally go commando just so that I don't have to carry extra pairs of underwear with me everywhere I go. It takes up too much space, and I mean do you really need underwear to function as a normal member of society? In my personal experience you really don't need to be wearing underwear for most if not all occasions. I see underwear as more of a detriment and a disappointment to the clothing world. For real, they get in the way when you try to pee, when your trying to take a shit. They're just very detrimental to the overall time it takes to do very quick ordinary tasks. And I mean if you really think about it, it works both ways. If you have a large dick, then it's out there showing itself off to the world. And if you have a small dick, they'll just think that you're wearing underwear. So there is literally no reason to not, not wear underwear. But aside from that, the game is really good."
5902,"I love biblical mythology, rogue-likes and this game delivers."
5903,ye
5904,Great
5905,good
5906,"The potential for manipulation of game systems and using every little tool you are given is done better in this game than any other I've ever played. The first hundred hours of game play are a blood sacrifice to cut your teeth and learn to both play competently, and understand how to twist the game to your will. I wouldn't say that's a bad thing as the learning curve is massively rewarding"
5907,One of the best if not the best indie game
5908,There are no words to explain how darn good this game is well done!!!
5909,"My wife divorced because I was playing this game to much. I was Sad untill I realised she unknowingly gave me Tears up and a soul heart,"
5910,"Very fun, made me want to end my life. Strongly recommend."
5911,"I am not at all proud of how much of my life I've sunk into this game. If BoI was heroin, I'd have OD'd a long time ago. But, like heroin (I imagine), you just can't stop. Heroin actually might get me to stop playing. Something to think about...

Compromise! Going to listen to Alice in Chains WHILE I play Isaac. Best of both worlds."

5929,"[h1]Game Review from 30 Minutes of Play[/h1]
Reminding myself if I should revisit and if you should purchase.

[b]ELEVATOR PITCH: Better Zelda with Pew-Pew[/b]
LIKED: Born for Steam Deck. As such, time got away from me and forgot to review within 30 minutes. Whoops!
DISLIKED: It took me this long to finally take a spin on this game.

[b]===== Mood After 30mins =====[/b]
☑ Addicted
☐ Afternoon delight
☐ Grindfest
☐ Frustrated

[b]===== Will I Revisit =====[/b]
☐ Yes, I aim to 100% complete
☑ Yes, but only beat the game
☐ Eventually. Until then, back to the pile
☐ No, on to other games

[b]===== Price =====[/b]
☑ Full price worthy
☐ Discount
☐ Deep discount
☐ Pass

[b]Disclaimer:[/b] [i]I'm aware 30 minutes is not enough time to properly review any game. Historically, I'm a big completionist when it comes to gaming, but my backlog will just not die and adulting obligations continue to mount. I needed to find some sense of accomplishment with my backlog other than buying them at great discount. Dedicating at least 30 minutes of play per game will be my arbitrary sense of achievement. It may not justify my gaming spending habits, but I'll suffer less buyer's remorse. Who knows, in 30 minutes I might discover a great game I want to revisit and something you want to purchase.

I must say I enjoyed this game although it did anger me from time to time if I had a good run. Overall i reccomend this game a lot since there's always something new, it can surprise easily and keep you entertained for more (atleast that's how it appealed to me). So be sure to check it out if you like rouge rpgs based on chamber system:)!"
5964,"Massive replayability. Each run takes about 30 min to an hour and some change, so if you're looking for something challenging to sink some time into, I definitely recommend this game."

5966,great game for just sitting back and playing or sitting down and putting your all into it. plus i lke having challenges to try out it adds another level to the game to replay it multiple times.

5969,cool game
5970,"After adjusting to the weird (somewhat childish and disgusting) atmosphere of the game, I ended up really enjoying the gameplay mechanics and high variability experienced between runs.  There are a lot of strategic decisions to be made during a typical run to try to maximize synergies and increase your chances for success.

I got quite a few fun hours out of the title before growing bored with it.  I think it was good value for the money."

6123,"Wanna see me waste 100 hours
Wanna see me do it again"
6124,"By far my favorite rogue-like, The Binding of Isaac kept me coming back time and time again with its addictive gameplay and expansive replayability. No run is ever the same as the game randomizes floor layouts, enemies, items, and boss encounters. 

Like most rogue-likes, death can hurt, and this game will certainly challenge your concentration and ramp up in difficulty the further you descend into the darkness. With that, be prepared for a bit of frustration as your run can end unceremoniously if you are not careful. The game dares you to give it just one more try, however, and you can save your progress at any point and continue your current run at a later time.

With multiple endings, many secrets to discover, and a great soundtrack, I highly recommend this game for fans of the genre."

There is a massive amount of items and effects they can grant, which makes the game very fun and it never gets old.

6189,"Super challenging, super fun."
6190,You're either lucky or going to die in a desert from a heartless RNG boss.
6191,"First of all i fucking love this game the game is about as addicting as crack cocaine, and it feels very satisfying clearing every single check mark on the characters and looking at all the completed challenges. Also the play time is to infinity and beyond due to the game being a roguelike and every run usually either completely screwing you over or giving you a powerful combo with an item you rarely may pick up. 

If you have the afterbirth+ DLC you can mod the game through the workshop! The modding community has a quite a selection of mods changing sound effects or sprites to look better or optionally make everything look worse, there is also mods that are complete shtposts and the really well done shtposts such as the car mod which... some actual genius added a car into this game, anyways there is also the really high quality mods that add characters and unlocks to the characters!

The game itself is built on toothpicks and dreams so with many combos it is really easy to either freeze or crash the game which makes you practice self control especially with a lot of the items repentance adds! Though usually the items that get close to crashing the game are specifically Parasite and Crickets body.

If you are into roguelikes that are heavily luck based this game is definitely a game that you will enjoy~"

6218,why.
6219,repentance has some goofy shit but still very fun
6220,Best game ever
6221,"Okay.
Actual, honest, review.

For starters, as someone who unfortunately only owns Rebirth and Afterbirth, the game is totally great. absolutely amazing. The music is wonderful and I cannot get the basement theme out of my head. I played probably a good 100 hours in Rebirth, and a good 20 in AB. I do play on Mac, so I cannot get Repentance; though I do play it remotely (thanks steam!!). Runs great in remote play.

Okay. Enough bias, real stuff now. If you're looking to buy the game for the first time; do it, like literally buy it right now if you can. It's a genuinely pretty good game, even just Rebirth. Rebirth has a good chunk of content; just doing all completions on one character if you're up for a challenge, or just testing around and getting unlocks. The game is a total blast. 

Second, the lore. The games lore is absolutely wild. No spoilers for people who for some reason haven't played this game yet, but it is a rollercoaster. The (Repentance) ending is actually very upbeat until you realize/remember Isaac's fate. If you aren't one for getting unlocks and playing hundreds of hours of gameplay, i'd recommend 2 Left Thumb's video on said TBOI lore: roughly an hour long. Even if you have seen all the lore, still recommend the video. Watched it after completing most endings and already knowing the lore, and they still said some stuff I didn't know. Pretty cool video.

Next, of course, gameplay. Ohhhhh, gameplay. Rebirth itself has tons of gameplay, even without the lore. Pretty good amount of characters (and Maggie); each with their own niche. For example, Isaac, the starting character, starts out with pretty middle-ground stats. He's the beginners choice, and the beginner himself. Nothing special about him too much, but that means that theres not really any downsides to Isaac. He's pretty universal. Another iconic character is Azazel, they can fly by default, and instead of shooting tears they mix it up with an altered Brimstone, a short-range, rough, oversized laser that deals continuous damage. The downside to Azazel is that the Brimstone has charge, and the range of the brimstone. Plus, in Rebirth and Afterbirth, alot of items don't synergize. One of the saddest references is Mom's Knife, as it just totally gets rid of Brimstone and all tears in Rebirth and AB. Mom's Knife in AB+ has some synergies, but they added alot in Repentance. 

Finally, the music. The. Music. It is phenomenal. Rebirth-AB+ have a soundtrack composed by Ridiculon, which is all around a great soundtrack; ~70 songs for TBOI. Though, no offense to Ridiculon, the Antibirth/Repentance Soundtrack is an absolute bop. Huge props to Mudeth for making the soundtrack. They took what was already great and somehow made it better. Though both soundtracks have their fair share of great songs. Also the arcade theme is the best OST hands down, give it a listen.

Alright, enough of me. Sorry for making this so long. I'll probably make another one of these sometime in the future, maybe at 500 hours played lol. Unfortunately I do not own AB+ for myself, and I play on Mac so I cannot purchase Repentance. I know alot about both DLC's though. Definitely recommend buying the game, my favorite game for sure."

6229,Is aight.
6230,its just good
6231,amazing game but still waiting for my physical switch release
6232,"Me and my brother have played this game since release, and each DLC has been drastically different in terms of drop rates, enemies, balancing, and of course items and the like. 

The final DLC is absolutely the best iteration of Isaac. True Co-Op is a dream come true and it's done so fucking well! The balancing feels good (no more portals on floor 1 lol), the new enemies and items are great, and they seemed to have gone back through and revamped just about every item/trinket/active to feel less shitty than the previous iterations of the game. 

The base game is of course a masterpiece on its own. I do highly recommend this game, but it can be pretty pricey if you are going for all the dlc's and the base game while not on sale. The true Co-Op is only on the most recent dlc without mods, and you require all previous dlc's for it to work, which is sad for anyone looking to have an equal multiplayer experience with friends. If you have the cash, pick it all up for sure! Otherwise build the collection during sales.

"
6233,"Really fun for fans of rouge-like games. Has a ton of content and so many items and synergies, if you like this type of game or even think you might, you will love it."
6234,meh
6235,good
6236,"The Binding of Isaac is technically a mom beating simulation. 

Don't buy this game if you love mom."
6237,"One of the best roguelike games!!! INSANE replayability, infinite combos, infinite item interactions and a lot of characters with different playstyles. If you are a minmaxer, you will love this game. Even if you complete the game, there are still ways to enjoy it(Eden streaks, T lost streaks, run randomizer, daily challenges etc).

Drawbacks: 
- Delirium is not an enjoyable boss
- Jacob and Esau are not enjoyable characters (or maybe it's just a skill issue)"

6247,"Hours of gameplay, good challenge, good dopamine rush when the good run hits"
6248,"If you liked the flash Isaac, you'll love Rebirth.
If you hated the flash Isaac, you'll love Rebirth.
This game has all the content of the original (and more)- but better!
With about double the amount of items, characters, endings, levels, modes, and others (more than triple with all the DLC) and all of them being unique and special, this game is more then worth what it costs. including the DLC. With the addition of mods with the afterbirth+ DLC the game might as well have infinite gameplay!
Not to mention the final DLC, Repentance, DOUBLES the amount of characters and adds a whole new set of unique floors with their own mechanics in addition to all the other new stuff it adds. 
Even with just the base game, Rebirth is great on its own with every single run being different.
TL;DR ok but why the man eye sack always cryin though"
6249,"Currently its just another rouge lite, but after I dump some more hours into it I'm sure it will be much, much more."
6250,game
6251,BEST GAME
6252,there is a piss item. 10/10
6253,"I love this game. There is so much content in the game and the lore is good. There are so many synergies between the items, and you can even play with friends! Not only that, there is an entire modding community around this game which adds even more! I think that this game is very much worth the money. It's great if you are looking for a game that you can play for a long time."
6254,Azazel is best character
6255,Game good
6256,cry about it
6257,This game sucks I play it and I continue to play it and it still sucks anyways
6258,"This game is unbelievably fun. I have never been so hooked onto a game in my life. Pair the replayability with the endless amount of content, you are bound to put in hundreds of hours into this game. I know for sure that I will be putting many more hours into this game and that I will enjoy every second of it. Would recommend!!!"
6259,Lots of poopoo
6260,"This is an adiction, run while you can"
6261,Add sex
6262,"Not much hours in in it, looks fun : )"
6263,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
6264,"sacrilege, heresy, blasphemy, etc. (affectionate)"
6265,too easy
6266,"This is less of a review and more like me rambling about my thoughts on the game and my journey to 100% completion. At the time of writing this, I've just obtained the final achievement in the game with about 663 hours of play time (I have about 300 more hours on my Nintendo Switch, making this add up to around 963 hours.). Out of all the games I've played over the years, I would consider The Binding of Isaac: Repentance to be my favorite game of all time. I'm unable to put into words how truly fantastic this masterpiece of a game is. The journey from getting my first Mom kill to getting every achievement in the game was long and brutally difficult, but it was an absolute joy the whole way through. I've had a blast fighting my way through hordes of monsters to one of the greatest soundtracks I've ever listened to. Games and movies rarely make me emotional, but this game alone has made me tear up at least three or four times as I discovered each ending and learned more about Isaac's life. Although I love this game to death, there are two issues with it. First, most of the challenges are very boring. Second, Delirium is a very cool concept for a boss, but he's too unpredictable and he can telefrag you. Besides that, this game is phenomenal. I would highly recommend anyone to play this game. I'd like to thank all of the developers who worked on this game and Edmund McMillen. Thank you for changing my life forever and for so many wonderful memories from this game."
6267,"Hmm...
Yes, Very Good
"
6268,Imagine if I put 700 hours towards learning a valuable skill rather than mutilating a child so he can beat up satan
6269,this game is awesome sauce!
6270,yes
6271,add sex
6272,A lot of possibilities
6273,it's okay ig
6274,satisfying yet brutal
6275,Соя имба

6277,greed machine broke after 1 coin 10/10 would recommend
6278,Shit game.
6279,There's poop everywhere and I'm really enjoying myself. Time to re-evaluate my life.
6280,"I'll tell you about Isaac. This game is a hidden jewel. You usually don't find games like these. This game is probably one of the single player games that has the most gametime. The fact there is people with 1000+ hours that haven't completed this game just says a lot about it. Me personally is sitting at around 230 hours. I have speedrunned all the items and really have tried my hardest. I have watched a lot of videos how to get things fast and really have seen results. But still im yet to i am at about 70% completion in this game. The game is not for everyone. It requires dedication. If u wanna get good at the game i really recommend downloading mods that help you with item descriptions. That is definetly the hardest part about this game. The reason behind this is because a lot of the items in Isaac can actually ruin for you. I  learned it the rough way :(.    


Please get this game. And if you manage to get into the game. There is also expantions that DOUBLES the amount of characters. ill tell. Getting the binding of Isaac : Repentance takes ur life away in a good way."
6281,With the other dlc's and repentance or mods this is worth the buy but by itself maybe not unless you like really hard games or your really good at them I suggest saving up for the extra content.
6282,shit's wild
6283,must play
6284,"One of the best Roguelikes on the market right now, all you need to know"

6287,dead god is worth it. just beware of tainted jakob.
6288,veri veri good
6289,"This game is so hard, just way too hard. However, it isn't a luck based game there is always room to improve and that's why I keep playing it. Seeing the improvement from one run to the next in this game is extremely satisfying."
6290,cool game
6291,"fukin awesome game, i love games with a weird christian bent to it, because I'm not christian, games like Blasphemous and this one are incredible with that style (obviously coming from different perspectives)."
6292,pretty good

6296,"Yeah, this game is f*cking awesome. Maximum fun is greed mode Lilith :-D"
6297,"It's alright, I guess."
6298,"What an amazing game man honestly, I have put many hours into and still suck cause ITS SO HARD, but so fun at the same time. I love the synergies and basically everything the game does, and I cant wait to play every run. I am gonna put way more hours."

"
6335,Great game just as I remembered
6336,"I mean, I have 442 hours in the game. So it must be okay. Probably worth a try."
6337,"I hate this game!
Heres why you should play it. Every run is pure fucking serotonin. The amount of fucking characters especially with repentance will make it so you never get bored. So much items bosses characters everything. pure rougelite bliss
"
6338,"Great game. Definitely a fun game, its got an amazing repeatability score from me.
Make sure to get the DLCs, makes it even more fun. Don't play this if you can't handle
long grinds; you get used to it."
6339,help
6340,"the game's good, but i got a mod, and then i chose a character that was glitched, after that, the game crashed, and if i use my DLC s the game crashes when i start  it"
6341,i wanna play this game on acid one day
6342,a
6343,yes.
6344,religion rocks
6345,"if you hate yourself and want to comit supuku, this game is for you."
6346,"It's infuriating, unbalanced, outright unfair at times and makes me wanna rip my skin off at it's worst. Fucking love it"
6347,"Biblical references are great and gameplay doesn't disappoint, rage filled hours of fun!"
6348,c section & psy fly op
6349,"Amazing game
"
6350,This game is fantastic and taken to a new whole new level with the Repentance. It's one of the best Roguelikes ever made and a timeless classic.
6351,I HAVE LIKE 900 HOURS IN THIS GAME. WHEN I REALIZED THAT I FUCKING UNINSTALLED THE APP. I HATE THIS GAME AND IT MAKES ME MAD. AFTER YOU BEAT TAINTED LOST THERES JUST NO POINT IN BEING AROUND ANYMORE.  0 POINTS
6352,this is the worst game
6353,"if you have not played this yet, you are missing out"
6354,its a yes from me dawg.
6355,"so far good, over all pretty decent"
6356,"I absolutely LOVE this game. I remember when I was pretty young I used to watch Isaac rebirth and it means a lot to me to be able to play it. If you're thinking about getting this, please do. You will spend money to get memory's that will last a lifetime."
6357,"My wife's favorite game of all time. 

Among my top 10 of all time. 

Should you play it? Definitely.

Should you love it? Almost certainly.

6372,this game ruined a generation of men
6373,The funny man made a good game
6374,"Endless hours of difficult, but fun and rewarding game play. All DLC that is released explodes with 1000s of new content from endings, to items and usually adds a new character. If you enjoy things like the original Legend of Zelda, or other dungeon crawlers with perma-death, this game is right up your alley."
6375,"You will not get bored playing this game! Endless possibilities, different item combinations, a lot of boss fights and different endings decided by the way you play troughout the run. Great game!"
6376,Great game. There's always something new to do and it feels so rewarding when you finally beat that next boss.
6377,Randomly deleted 471 hours worth of data and progress. Great game but holy shit Im not doing al of that over again. Fix this
6378,Very fun rouge like.

6425,"Isaac, what is he binded to?"
6426,this is the game ever
6427,"satanism.



meh."
6428,Fantastic game with the best DLC value I've ever gotten. Repentance might as well be another game. As far as rouge-likes go it's fairly simple but still high enjoyable. An incredible amount of content and options leave this game with near unlimited replayability and a playtime that can easily go into the hundreds of hours. Definitely recommend.
6429,"good game
"
6430,Amazing game! just know you cant transfer saves all too well.
6431,Baby cry which can be used as bullets. 10/10
6432,"Ive seen a bit of isaac content before I started watching a Slay the Spire streamer, the game didnt seem too interesting until this guy showed me the world of trying to make the most of every run instead of just taking what you get in isaac.  It looked fun enough that I had to give it a try and well, I played for 7 hours in one day so... I don't like that you MUST get afterbirth+ or repentance DLC in order to use any good mods on the workshop, but other than that its ok.  I guess just look at it as a $60 game instead of a $15 with too many dlcs.  I always look to Terraria as the PERFECT game for judging content vs cost.  You could find terraria for $2 sometimes and that game has full mod support because the devs were nice people.  Doesnt even cost anything to get the practically 3 dlcs worth of extra boss fights and content.  But overall I would say its a 7/10 the gameplay is great."
6433,I love the fact that I own this game and it's in my game library!
6434,"A very good game, nothing else much to say. Its obviously really fun if your run is overpowered but again hard if an run is not so overpowered, and the story line was well made on top of everything 9.7/10."
6435,Game has gotten so bad now
6436,who is this man
6437,1600 HRS total play time to date. I still have tainted jacob and challenge 34 left lol. longest companion game ever for myself
6438,"plenty to explore and achieve
"
6439,isik
6440,it alright i guess
6441,Good shit Kinda hard
6442,"this is a game, a game that i would recommend"
6443,The poop guy is funny
6444,i really enjoy this game. it is engaging and helps me kill a ton of time lol! it is also really hard to play. a lot harder than it looks. i have played 500+ hours and still have not unlocked everything. lol thre is a lot to do in the game for sure.
6445,"my mom tried to sacrifice me to jesus, and i didnt get tears that can kill people! 0/10 WORST GAME EVER!!!!1!!!!!!11!!"
6446,It is a challenging game that'll keep you going
6447,"Good game
Haven't played the DLC yet, probably will though
Worth the money, also seems like there's a ton of content that I haven't found yet"
6448,"Good game but challenging. Don't worry about time at first but some challenges require to beat 2 bosses in under 30 minutes, Anyways, good game that has good DLC's, Quote for the game: Good but only for good players"
6449,ISAAC!!! - Mother
6450,"i re-rolled my entire inventory twice and killed satan all in the same run
pretty solid game"

6457,"i can throw my own shit at my mom, the immersion is insane"
6458,Crazy amount of content and fun gameplay loop
6459,very good game -obama
6460,"this game infuriates me, i love it"
6461,cry
6462,"I've probably spent more time playing this game than any other.  It's easy to pick up and play for an hour, or sink an entire night into.  There's so much to unlock, so many endless combinations that you'll never experience them all. I'm over a thousand hours of playtime into this game, and I've still yet to complete it.  Get this game...period."
6463,"Binding of Isaac. 

637 achievements throughout the base game and three DLCs in total. 

Done.

1.500 hours of playtime since October 2015. 

That’s almost 2,5 hours per achievement and almost 20 hours of playtime a month in average, over the timespan of 6 and a half years. 

Good game."
6464,love it
6465,Broke my fingers 10/10
6466,this is the best game in the god damn universe
6467,"it's alr

6468,Back when I was 13 I thought religion was the worst thing invented so I thought I was cool playing this game 💀
6469,yes this game is really good and this is the first game i chose to play above others
6470,Endless Suffering
6471,"Great gameplay mechanics, fun bosses, great level design, challenges, secrets,unlockables a billion different fun and awesome item/trinket effects with tons of synergies makes for a great recipe for this replayable game. On top of that theres a interesting theme (which may be offensive to some) to the game, great music, and more. Check it out, and if you have any doubts try getting it on a steam sale."
6472,makes me want to kill myself
6473,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

6497,yes
6498,most favorite game. Game sad buit good. bleh bleh awesome game
6499,Game reminded me of my younger years when I was in Catholic school. Thanks Edmund for reminding me of those weird and troubling days of learning about hand in prayer!
6500,Every time I pay for DLC for this game I'm literally paying the devs to make this game harder. I'm on a win streak of like -45 with the latest DLC. I suck at this game. I can't stop playing this game. Fuck this game. I love this game.
6501,game so goofy so silly
6502,very funny
6503,
6504,"The first rogue-esc game I've ever played, and I love it to bits. Game is fun, soundtrack is pretty cool, I didn't get hit there but that's fine

The mods? Oh dear god the mods
There's a lot! It really adds to the experience of the whole thing especially if they're well made! The fan made stuff is beautiful too, and who could forget Mudeth's BANGERS?

There is one issue I have with Isaac though: performance 
Thanks to where it was made, the game seems to run mainly on CPU, at least I think, only utilizing one core from what I've heard. This could be it, but I don't know shit about this, so I couldn't tell you.
Fun game either way, would kill Satan again"
6505,Holding 'R' is for quitters.
6506,"Played Afterbirth+ on the Switch, saw Repentance came out and on PC and had to try it out. Played the same as on the Switch. As of this review I've put 260 hours into the game, I've achieved about 440 of the achievements. It's a fun game, can be frustrating at first just trying to get the hang of the game but once you've got a good basis of the game it's very enjoyable. There are endless possibilities, especially since you have so many things you can unlock between items and characters."
6507,"it goofy, it fun, it a very good game"
6508,i literally fucking hate this game

6541,fun but why wont my mods work
6542,i am compelled by ed to 100% this game
6543,Very chill and child friendly game
6544,"Great Game Love it enjoyment for tons of hours a bit rage inducing especially playing the lost.
"
6545,good
6546,"Amazing content, classic roguelike"
6547,Yes I recommend this of course.
6548,"Amazing game and amazing remake of the original Binding of Isaac with lots content (especially with dlcs) and workshop support, it also has amazing soundtrack, amazing visuals and amazing sprites. Its a fun but challenging game that sometimes does not f**k around and straight up punishes you for your mistake even if it wasnt your fault.

[b]My only complaints are:[/b]

- Hitboxes and hit detection is sometimes weird. Sometimes projectiles hurt me even tho I didnt touched them or there are cases where I touched an enemy projectile and it didnt hit me.

- Greed and Greedier mode could use some serious improvement like for example adding alt path and spicing things up for little bit.

- The game isnt cheap expect paying a litlle bit of money for the base game and dlcs.


Other than that do I recommend this game ? F**K YEAH !"

6615,"good
"
6616,i learned how to walk in the game
6617,yeah its good i guess
6618,"In my opinion, this game is timeless, and always full of surprises."
6619,I've played on console for like 2 years and was still good even though for most of the time it wasn't updated since I didn't have the DLCs. On PC it's even better and this reignited my passion for this game.
6620,this game is just endless
6621,no comment
6622,t.lost ate my balls
6623,fun
6624,
6625,"Really fun and entertaining game, These are arround my first runs and I already love it. PS: Azazel god"
6626,cool game i like it
6627,"playing isaac is like trying to get a pickle jar open but you have no hands, so you try smashing it against your head, broken pieces of glass are stuck in your skull, making you bleed out and die. In the end it wasn´t even a jar with pickles in it, making your whole sacrifice worthless.
overall good game doe, id say prolly a solid 8,5/10"
6628,"I easily played this game for more than a 1000 hours if you combine the time i've played it on pc and on switch. I still enjoy it and its my go-to game for when im bored and have nothing else to do. 
One of my favorite games of all time 11/10"
6629,poor isaac :(
6630,nice game
6631,2nd best game of all time love it to bits amazing yes yes yes wish more games were like this :)
6632,100% best rogue-like
6633,"Very fun and challenging, lots of content and replayability"
6634,game good yes
6635,funny poop
6636,10/10 with the car mod.
6637,"I love games which allow mods and provide some basic platform without the requirement of third-party program in order to do that, while the base game is nice and the concept is good (it is quite disturbing even with such graphics so it is not right for everyone), the fact that you can change the game to your liking and find your favorite playstyle is always great. It is worth mentioning that it also adds a lot to replayability because there is always new content, updates and customization.

The controls and the mechanics are simple and easy to learn and the most important thing is staying alive as long as you can so you have to know and understand both the enemies and your abilities to get the best results.

There is almost no story so the main focus is on gameplay.

Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't get frustrated about the game and enjoy as much as you can, otherwise just take a break from the game instead of getting angry for no reason :)"
6638,this gaem tis some god!!!111!1 wold rekomend gaem.
6639,"*throws run after getting brimstone*

yup."
6640,"The endless cycle of getting loot, getting exited, almost beating the game, and dying    but in all seriousness this game is quite fun and it pretty much never gets old due to the infinite amount of possibilities as hard as it is its fun as hell"

6642,Yes! :)
6643,mustarr  d

6645,If you like poop buy it.
6646,"this game has literally infinite replayability, it never ends"
6647,"Very relaxing, not frustrating at all, for all types of gamers, especially casual ones, you'll have a good one!"
6648,Great game! All about rainbows and a great childhood. Gave me everything from anxiety and nausea to addiction. 10/10
6649,"After 600 hours, I'm almost halfway done the first save file"
6650,Great game to pour countless hours into
6651,Good Game.
6652,"Incredible replayability and fun, mods if you get tired of normal game. Enough achievements that you'll never really win"
6653,yes grd
6654,I really like this I play it every day and rage every single time.
6655,angry dopamine
6656,unreal game
6657,Hehe dying child go brrr
6658,i have an addiction
6659,Why the hell does the DLC total over $40 CAD?
6660,"Get it, and play until you at least beat the Cathedral/Sheol, and if you like it; your welcome."
6661,"First and foremost, get all the dlc. Non-negotiable. It's an amazing game and like 4x the size with all the dlc. There's over 30 unique-feeling characters, each with cute gimmicks that define their play style. From Melee, to no hit, to glass canon, to minecraft creative mode, this game's got just about every character angle you can think of, and if it's not in the game, check out the mods list. There's so much jam-packed into this thing and it's impossible to explain it all, but what I can say is this: It's the definition of the modern roguelike/lite. Each run is fresh (though you may unlock new features and items for the pools.) Every roguelike/lite that's been made since the initial release of this game has either taken inspiration from this game, or just tried to copy it. And for good reason. This game is so, SO good. Give it a few shots, try it (for less than 2 hours) and then refund it if you don't like it, but it's so mind-blowingly well-made I can't help but squeeze a run or ten in when I can."
6662,"do i even need to write this?

its isaac, if you have a couple hundred hours to spare, its a must play. (like actually, i know this is kind of standard for roguelikes, but especially for isaac, if you dont have a good amount of time to play this, youre not gonna get as much out of this to make the difficulty worth it.)

beyond that, the only issue  is... okay its kind of hard to explain... but like.. you know how people say the thing about monkeys writing hamlet?  its like that. there is so much content, so many bosses, items,rooms,and mechanics that it is literally impossible to not have terrible balancing issues a QoL issues.
but mods can fix that."
6663,"this game is great idk how to do reviews good but trust me, this game is good"
6664,It has come a long way from it's Flash days.
6665,"good, but the dlc cost to much for a poor person like me"
6666,Not bad
6667,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.
You made a shit of piece  with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."
6668,fun game for sadomasochists
6669,Great game to play with your friends. Highly recommend if you like a challenge.
6670,dont
6671,yeah I think it's a game.
6672,"top notch game, if you like it you should check out Enter the Gungeon"
6673,"The Binding of Isaac, the game where you're a small boy trapped in a basement forced to kill vicious monsters for your survival because your mother is trying to kill you, having been driven insane due to christian television.
But, did I mention it has a killer soundtrack, endless replayability, great graphics, and is made by the same person who made Super Meat Boy?
The point I'm trying to make is, while this is a great game, when you really think about it this game is [i]disturbing[/i]."

6725,"This has been a long time coming for me personally, and the hours on steam here don't even count to how long i have actually played this game, because I once played it on WiiU too. With that, here's my review:

The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike dungeon crawler akin to that of the original Legend of Zelda, a game with overall endless replayability and an absolutely nasty skill curve to start. If you've never played a roguelike or dungeon crawler before, then sonny you're in for one hell of a storm. It can be egregiously difficult, and at times unfairly so. I've found myself dying over and over and over at times simply due to a mix of frustration and overall lackthereof patience. Now if you're willing to take the time to learn this game, then prepare for a goddamn ride.

Isaac is a game that can either feel rewarding or punishing depending on how solely lucky you are. At times you'll find items worth your time, items that will hinder you, and lastly items that you either forget what they do or how they work, and cry about as hard as this naked child ransacking their basement and gargling pills more than a your grandma who's basically a walking pharmacy at this point in their life. RNG is the name of the game and if Jesus says fuck you, then you will either run face first into the nearest enemy or try to be like the dirty needles that this child finds and push deeper until the pain goes away. (It won't I promise)

What makes the game itself so good is the constant dark theme, beautiful spritework, challenging difficulty, crap-centered humor, and most importantly; synergies. Synergies are gonna be the bulk reason you come back. Or masochism. For me it was both. Each character has unlocks including they themselves becoming unlocks. From as simple and easy-to-survive characters like Magdaline, to the bone swinging husk of The Forgotten with many more in between. When you play in this game, it has a differing playstyle depending on how you like to roll. Do you like to take a chance when you see an item you don't like? Play Isaac when you unlock the D6. You like Chaos? Play and beat enough runs, unlock Eden, and slam your face into the random key and bitch about how you got a shit set of stats but a half decent starting item. Do you like eternal suffering and damnation? Unlock The Lost and realize you'll be a ghost before you get your first marking on that little tacked up piece of paper in the character selection menu.

This game is all about remembering what items are what, picking up the ones you want and hurling the shit you don't want at the wall. Sometimes literally hurling shit you don't want, at the wall. And enemies. And everything else. A lot of this game is about remembering enemy patterns, playing around them, and praying to god you don't get that one bomb fly room in the caves because you know damn well you're gonna get hit (unless you're flying that is). From bosses, to enemies, to champions, to items, to item combinations and the usual question you gotta ask when looking at two items you'll be constantly wondering ""will that work?"" The answer is usually ""yes"", and the other answer would be ""yes, but playing with chemicals is a terrible idea"". I'M LOOKING AT YOU TRISAGION/IPECAC. DON'T PICK THAT SHIT UP UNLESS YOU GOT HOST HAT OR PYROMANIAC.

A majority of your time will be spent playing Hard Mode, as if the normal mode didn't make the shit ridden tourniquet any less infectious on your open wound. Enemies are faster, shoot faster, and Champions (harder variants) of monsters spawn more, but damn near every major unlock is stuck behind this mode. If this game was a pain in the ass before then you're gonna be loving the much more coarse sandpaper rubbing between those cheeks. Every character has a grand total 12 completion marks for 17 characters (plus the secret characters I will get to later. Spoiler warning when I get there). Some easier than others and some rewards just fucking not worth the effort (coughcoughstickynicklecough).

You'll encounter minor bosses who's patterns are easy, major bosses you'll fight on repeat, and an alternative route that will drastically shake up the difficulty. Your best friends are gonna be Angel Deals, and with the Repentance DLC to a lesser extent Devil Deals. (Don't count ol' Lucifer out though, he still has some good stuff). In order to encounter these deals you gotta be both skilled and/or lucky to not lose a regular heart via preventable damage, (excluding running through a spiky door, shredding your feet on some sacrificial spikes, and other various things)

The main game will be your bread and butter, but the side mode of Greed Mode is a bit of a change if pace. A wave defense mode where you earn money for items and buy items to go further. Just pray you're not a complete dunce and hit the button every other round because you tried to dodge that one stray bullet that was gonna hit you, but you decided to double the damage you'd take and run over the foot shredder in the center of the room. It's a fun mode, simple but effective, with a pretty solid (but still somewhat) unfair boss at the end. Again, pray for RNG.

This game, at its core, is fundamentally a masochists wet dream, and somehow also a power-hungry bastard's blessed nightmare, with varying enemy variety, difficult bosses, constant bullet hells you're gonna encounter, but overall crisp gamplay that makes the tension feel real at times. To feel the blood rush when you narrowly dodge a bullet or enemy by the skin of your blood soaked toes, to holding your breath as an onslaught of bullets hurl your way while you're within an inch of becoming the rotting corpse beneath your mother's floorboards. And the power trip of going from trickling damage off a boss, to doing what is the equivalent of a warcrime on a giant mound of partly digested flesh.

((( VVV SPOILER WARNING AHEAD VVV )))

The story isn't too much to write home about, and is ambiguous at the end, being up to interpretation, but no less welcome because for the longest time this game has had dreadful, depressing and downright bleak endings. To end it on a higher note with Isaac being freed from his bindings in purgatory and actually...having an ending. I doubt that they will ever do another DLC like Repentance, but they did a damn good job capping it off and jokes aside, seeing a sorta ""good ending"" to this game...it's gratifying.

(( ^^^ SPOILER ZONE ^^^ ))

The Binding of Isaac, from Rebirth to Repentance is quite a rollercoaster. This game is nothing short of endless, with dailys you can do, challenges to unlock and play, to bottomless seeds to play through. From miracles to heartaches, and as of now is still currently being patched, updated, and adding in more content on occasion (recently adding in Clutch as a boss and updating two characters). But I will say, this game had broken me on several occasions. I played through this game without a single mod added, beginning to end to truly challenge myself. And I managed to collect every achievement and cap this game off. So what do I say about Isaac?

Fuck this game man. If you value your sanity and/or time, then don't play it. I have over 630h invested in this game not including the time I spent playing it on WiiU. Completing this game vanilla is a fucking slog and I wouldn't recommend investing your time and effort into getting every checkmark on every character.

...That said, I still recommend it. If you don't mind these things, the devs took a lot of time and effort to make such a simple but incredibly in-depth game that was worth me spending literal days on. Not to mention the community workshop. It makes this already infinite game that much more bottomless. 8/10, fuck you Edmund."

6786,"A roguelike with a lot of redeeming qualities, and content exploding from everywhere, this game has potential to keep you coming back endlessly.
Positives:
+A lot of content, from items to rooms to enemies
+Constant updates and rebalancing
+An absolute ton of synergies to be had with items
+Tons of unlockables
+A solid upgrade from the original flash version

Negatives:
-It almost feels like Edmund can be too sadistic. Some challenges are downright unfair and extremely obnoxious, such as ""April's Fool"" and ""Ultra Hard"".
-Once you hit a certain point you might often find yourself resetting over and over again to get a good starting item
-Some characters are obtuse to play, such as Lilith and [spoiler]Tainted Cain[/spoiler]. They make for very unfun runs when they basically bank off specific items in order to be functional.
-Some unlockables end up being less than beneficial. [spoiler]Going back to the Ultra Hard challenge, I had already unlocked everything that Samson was capable of unlocking, so the extra health was pointless.[/spoiler]
-To be honest, the game has a lot of DLC. It's usually on sale, but I personally wouldn't recommend purchasing the base game + all DLC for the price it is.

Ultimately it's a good time waster and easy to pick up or put down at any time."
6787,I bought this for my switch and got around 200 hours in before i also bought it on PC (for quicker updates and mods) and i have enjoyed every second of it. The items are amazing as you will either find fun items like Brimstone or funny items like Big Chubby. Every single character from the base crew to the DLCs is fun and creative as hell (except for like Maggy but come on thats 1 character out of 34). I really dont know what more to say besides this is very good shit and you should buy it and love it for the rest of your life.
6788,Isaac and his mother

6807,"The Binding of Issac was my introduction to the rogue-like genre originally with the flash game all that time ago. Years later it is still one of my favourites with still not fully completing of collecting everything + the ability to mod for even more content. Fare warning if this is your first game like this, its going to be HARD with steep learning curve. But it gets easier the more you play and you learn more about the items over time or just use a guide like Platinum God or mods that give descriptions of what the items do. 

Endless replayability with something different every single time 100% recommend picking this up and recommend getting all the DLC at once if you can."
6808,pain
6809,"After playing this game for roughly 70 hours, if you are interested in a semi-mindless rouge-like game that can offer a bigger challenge if you want, then this is a great game. It's easy to hop in and out of and allows to pause games in the middle of a run. Definitely worth $15 and I have yet to play the DLC."
6810,best game ever although it [for me] is really hard and freezes my computer on rare occasions.
6811,I liek it. .w.
6812,"The Binding of Isaac is THE roguelike, the one that started it all.

I've played a lot of roguelikes, but this is easily one of, if not THE hardest one I've played. The only other roguelike I've played that is harder is Noita, but I have to put some more hours into that game for more confirmation. This game is punishing, enemies will throw so much bullshit at you that it seems like they are cheating. Along with this difficulty comes a clear sense of progression, however, as you can clearly see yourself getting better with each subsequent run. Mastering this game and its mechanics makes it one of the more rewarding roguelikes out there.

The controls of this game are admittedly hard to get used to at first, as you can only shoot tears in the cardinal directions. Once you get used to it, the game opens up very quickly and it becomes a fun interaction with the hundred of enemies that you will run into.

One thing that is worth pointing out in this game: there are so many unlockables that it is overwhelming. Each achievement in this game correlates to an unlockable, and there are over 800 achievements...so you will definitely be spending many hundreds of hours on this game if you plan on doing 100%. I've played this game for around 70 hours and I haven't even scratched the surface of what you can find in this game.

The bosses in this game are frustrating but fun to fight against. There are many bosses which are rehashes of other bosses (the headless horsemen bosses come to mind), but also many completely unique bosses to keep things fresh. As you progress more and more into the game, you find more and more bosses as well, so while at the beginning of the game it might seem like you're fighting the same boss over and over, that will change the more hours you put into it.

One thing that Isaac nails is the fantasy of becoming a God, which I value when I play roguelikes. With the myriad of items in this game, there is quite literally an infinite amount of item combinations that you can try, much of which leads to incredibly broken item combos. Isaac doesn't cap you for the most part on the damage you can do, so you can get some truly game-breaking combos that allow you to stomp every enemy and boss in the game, similarly to Risk of Rain 2.

Another thing I appreciate about this game is the ability for the player to truly optimize their run to the max. You can take as much time as you want to progress through your run, so you're able to pick up most of the content through your run to the degree which your knowledge of the game allows. If you know what to do and know what you're looking for and you're good enough, you can make any run a god run given enough time. This isn't something that isn't in a lot of roguelikes like Isaac, as most of the time in other roguelikes some runs will simply be just good enough to get by. Isaac provides you with every opportunity to make any run a god run, as long as you the player are good enough.

This game visually is very compact, scaling the camera view to be one room at a time. The pixel art style is nice, and while the content matter is visceral, it fits the theme of the game perfectly fine. I will say I am not the biggest fan of the music in this game. I definitely mute the music and put on my own when I play Isaac. 

My chief complaint about this game might be a plus for most people: there is literally an overwhelming amount of content (items) to this game. I know with a lot of other games I've played I love the amount of content in a game (Terraria is a good example), but with Isaac the content that is unlockable in this game is mostly limited to new items. While this is nothing to sneeze at, it is vastsly different than Terraria getting new content in bosses or events, which is much more engaging than unlocking a new item you can find in a run.

Another complaint I have is that this game is basically unplayable without the External Item Descriptions mod. The in-game item descriptions are terrible, with most descriptions vaguely telling you what the item you just picked up does, with others telling you literally nothing. The External Item Descriptions mod fixes that, but in my opinion this should just be a feature in the base game. It beats having to open an isaac wiki page for every single item you pick up.

Overall, the Binding of Isaac is a very pure roguelike experience in which I recommend. It is very easy to jump into a game and hit the ground running, and while this game is difficult and has its shortcomings, I find myself sitting down to play a run of Isaac quite often to kill the time.

6829,"The Binding of Isaac is a must-have if you're into roguelikes. It was one of the first game franchises I ever got really into, and I spent over a thousand hours on Rebirth and the base game alike trying to unlock as much as I could. It has a ton of interesting items, synergies, and unlockable characters/items/bosses/floors which you can spend hours of your life trying to get, most of which are worth the effort. On top of that, despite the amount of people that would say otherwise, I think the lore is also interesting to deconstruct and figure out. Overall, it's a very fun game that I recommend to anyone looking for a roguelike to play. 

That all being said, unless you're one of those hardcore no-lives that downloads mods that purposely make the game harder for literally no reason besides masochism, stay the hell away from the Repentance DLC. The only other reason you might want to get it is to download mods that only work if you have it, and even then, [i]I really don't think it's worth the pain[/i]. I made the mistake of thinking that Repentance was worth getting around the time it came out. That led me to having to install, no exaggeration, [i][b]100+ mods[/b][/i] to make the game feel fun again. Unless you're willing to spend hours of your life looking for the right mods to put together that fix a lot of the items, mechanics, and characters nerfed by it, [i]stay the fuck away from Repentance.[/i]"

6900,"TL;DR
If you are a roguelite/roguelike enjoyer this game is a must play or if you already played Rebirth I still highly recommend playing it regardless. Repentance came with an update that changed almost all of the items and new characters/floors/bosses. It is a brand new game.

Not TL;DR
About 9 years ago, when I was about 20 years old, I played Rebirth and put 185 hours to it, never played any DLC that came after because it seemed like a waste of money at the time and I thought that it was better that I invested it in other games. I said at the time that it was a very good game, tried to do a 100% completion but never ended up doing it. 

9 years passed and Repentance came in, started watching videos of Northernlion and became hooked again. Decided to buy the bundle with the remaining DLC's and Repentance and also decided to play it in a new save file since I didn't remember much of the game and wanted to experience as much as I could. 

I cannot stress enough how much I love this game. It got so many things going on for it that it would make this review way too large. This game is so good that it drove me to 100% completing it. The game is big, in a good way. There are so many combinations of items and trinkets that one cant even comprehend, it makes the game so diverse that you cant never get bored. 

If you are a roguelite/roguelike enjoyer and haven't played or played the base game without the other DLC's, I highly recommend playing Repentance. It gives you every penny you invested and back."

6963,I love this game. Frustrating a times but great game play and a wide variety of picks make it highly replayable.

6970,Yeah it's alright I suppose :P
6971,"This is my favourite game of all time. I played it a bunch on my nintendo 3ds and through family sharing and finally decided to get it. What do I say, it's an extremely good game with a lot of thought and love put into it. And trust me, you'll like the story. One thing I might add, the game is difficult, but fair, at least in the case of repentance. And I'm glad they made hard mode actually hard too."
6972,"je to totální sračka, nehrajte to prosím <3
"
6973,"You have to download a mod to know what any of the items do. Oh, and that mod only works if you buy the DLC. Lazy rogue-like that is only somewhat passable as a decent game thanks to the community. Im not going to support a developer that is too lazy to make their own game playable."

6993,"The game, as a whole, is a very polished experience that will keep you coming back for more. That being said, if you play this game, you're literally selling your soul to the devil. That's not even a joke. I have lost years off of my life from this game and I'm one step away from being sent to a therapist. If you're a masochist and you love feeling rage flowing through your blood (like me), then you'll probably enjoy this endless CBT simulator.

Also this is a personal middle finger to Jacob & Esau, Tainted Lost and Keeper. These characters are awful Edmund WHY"
6994,yes dude
6995,good

It's near impossible to describe this game without understating it's quality, so I won't bother.

7013,"Lacking any form of balance and design.  Full of bugs that will never be fixed and items that in some cases just don't work or that kill you when combined with something else.  Sometimes bosses will just move off screen and never come back, leaving you stuck and unable to leave the room or progress.  I've mainly played a large amount so see if things get better as I unlock all the characters and items...it honestly doesn't. Paths to certain bosses that require items that aren't guaranteed to drop is just one of the things added in Repentance to make it even more annoying."

7025,"Can't believe I held off on this game for so long. I played the original Isaac first and it never really clicked for me, but I took a gamble on this game after seeing what some of the late game and crazy synergies looks like. Don't regret it one bit. I'm going to be coming back to this game for a very long time, at least until I beat the Beast and Mother with a few characters. It's still complete RNG BS, but it's incredibly fun RNG BS.

10/10 will not become back my money and Edmund is not a little fuck-er."

There are so many amazing playable characters and there are DLC's that add so much to the game as well. I say it is well worth the purchase as long as you have the patience to get better at bullet hells. Overall, would recommend, very rewarding game, do enjoy."

Before you play this keep in mind that this game isnt only difficult , it very unforgiving. by that i mean , while other ""hard"" games at least that ive played, like lets say DarkSouls will ususally give room for experemintation , trial and error , and a general margin for error, this game has ZERO chill when it comes to the player fucking up. Look away , zone out or get distracted for even 1 second , even in a room without enemies, and the game will absolutley beat your ass"

7117,"The short answer is yes I would highly recommend this game.

Whilst I am not a veteran player, I have sunk a few hours in to the original game. This re-boot far surpasses the original in every way. Both in terms of performance and gameplay, everything feels considerably more sleek than the original game.

The gameplay is self explanatory, yet a lot more addictive than it may seem. There is a steep learning curve that creates a very rewarding experience. Without spoiling too much there is progression that isn't constrained to a single run. So, game after game you feel you are working towards new unlocks, which gives a real sense of replayability.

Each DLC enriches the game even further, however, I would play the base game for at least 10+ hours before investing in additional DLC. So as to learn the basic mechanics of the game before muddying the water with new items/enemies.

So yes, I would highly recommend the game. It brings great value for the price tag and I shall be playing for many more hours."

7152,"hands down one of the best games i have ever played. if you like Zelda (the original ones e.g. A Link To The Past), you'll love this game as they are both rogue-likes with a great story and replay value but, the binding of Isaac is a much better game due to its amazing art style, great soundtrack and customizability in game, for example, you could have a decent run with items that could be better but then you find a joker card, use it and are teleported to the angel room with godhead and multiple soul hearts. its this ability to easily change a game from ehhh to OOOOH that just solidifies this game as one of the best of all time (i know that runs can easily turn bad but shush you debbie downer they can turn for the better just as easily). just such an amazing game, 100/10, deserves a million golden joysticks."

7155,"La Crítica de la razón pura (en alemán: Kritik der reinen Vernunft) es la obra principal del filósofo prusiano Immanuel Kant. Tuvo su primera edición en 1781. El propio Kant llegó a corregirla, publicando en 1787 una segunda edición.

Se trata de una indagación trascendental (acerca de las condiciones epistémicas del conocer humano) cuyo objetivo central es lograr una respuesta definitiva sobre si la metafísica puede ser considerada una ciencia. Entre otras cosas, Kant intenta superar la crítica al fundamento epistemológico del principio de causalidad (y por lo tanto al saber científico) que había hecho David Hume, que no tenía una respuesta satisfactoria hasta su época.

En esta obra, Kant intenta la conjunción de racionalismo y empirismo, haciendo una crítica de las dos corrientes filosóficas que se centraban en el objeto como fuente de conocimiento, y así, dando un «giro copernicano» al modo de concebir la filosofía, estudiando el sujeto como la fuente que construye el conocimiento del objeto, a través de la representación que el sujeto, mediante la sensibilidad inherente a su naturaleza que toma del objeto."

7192,good game
7193,"This game is great for those who love a game with constant challenge, near infinite replayability, aren't discouraged by a little bit of gore or medical terms, and like the roguelite/bullet hell genre. The Binding of Issac always keeps you on your toes, while giving a unique and interesting experience to every run with its randomized choices of over 600 unique items, assuming you have all the DLC, which is most definitely worth it, as this game will give you AT LEAST 1,000 hours worth of content with it, if not more.

Prepare yourself for an immersive and fantastical experience, driven by some of the best-fitting game music I have ever heard. If you happen to find a friend laying around within the area, you can give up to three of them a controller to plug in and play with you on local co-op. And if you have no friends, that's okay, I'm sorry for your loss, but you at least have Issac and friends to give you company and just a *tiny bit* of hair pulling frustration as you conquer the underground and its inhabitants, before emerging victorious with shaking hands and a euphoric high when you finally win after you spent the last 15 hours trying to beat Mother as Tainted Lost.

Game play never gets repetitive or old, Hours of fun to be had. Like, Hours and hours, or in my case, Years. Buy it, like right now. It's a flawless game, I can't even name one thing wrong with it off the top of my head. I'm still not done with it, and I'm playing it everyday. If the Devs see this review, thanks for the 7 years of fun, you've gotten me through some tough shit and your game is always a highlight of a day, or a wonderful fallback when i have nothing to play.

7220,"The Binding of Isaac is a rouge-like video game that's gone through several changes through the years, with each DLC being added making the game increasingly better. I think I'm eligible to say that this game is definitely one of the most replayable games there is, as there is many different items, bosses, and even floors to unlock with each different character you beat the game with. I've been playing Isaac since the original days, around when Wrath of the Lamb came out, and have the game beaten on almost every console, and recently returned to the game on PC to finally see what Repentance is all about, and let me tell you, it is so worth your time. Something I especially like about Repentance is that it's basically the mod for Rebirth built into Afterbirth+, which is amazing, considering having Antibirth as a mod for Rebirth was a bit annoying, not being able to have all the content that the other two DLCs have, but Repentance basically slaps that entire issue in it's ass, and gives you everything to do in all DLCs, which is the best part. In short, Isaac is an amazing game that's definitely worth the money, even if you don't get everything up to Repentance, as there is a fair share of things to do in the earlier versions and DLCs.

7246,I love this rouge style game play it is so fun and addicting where you may want to play one or two runs and end up playing for hours
7247,I would recommend this game.  It's really fun and will keep you playing for hours.  I recommend watching videos of others playing first so you can understand the base mechanics of the game.  It does make a lot of stupid moves that purposefully get you hit and can make you VERY enraged.
7248,"I was gievn this game for kinda free, as in the main game and all DLC's except Repentence, but I bought the Repentence DLC myself.
 I have played 50 hours+ now and can recommend this game to anybody who likes learning different fun mechanics and doesn't frustrate themselves over small things. The gameplay is a rougelike mainly built around you're current character and the item synergies or just items you have. There are hundreds of enemies and many bosses with possibly a thousand or more items, truly a game you can replay an infinite amount of times"
7249,I hate this game. Highly Recommend!

7299,if you ever get into a fight just cry aggressively at your enemy
7300,"Now that Repentance came out, the game(Afterbirth +)'s initial content literally doubled. Great decision mixing Antibirth with AB+.
Stuff that's added include;
-19 new characters, up to a total of 34
-Whole new stages(Stage 1.5, Stage 2.5, Stage 3.5, etc.)
-Two new completion marks to go for
-Bunch of pedestal items, QoL, characters, etc. rebalances that are still being added via frequent updates(Really shows the devs' passion for the game)
-An extra 1,000(or even more) hours to invest in due to all the new content
-Hard mode is actually challenging(to a point) now
-And so many more I forgot to list


Conclusion is, definitely worth the buy, and I'd personally recommend purchasing this when it's on sale(25% or more.)"
7301,yed
7302,It's ok
7303,"hee hee crying baby go poopoo

All jokes aside, however, this is a game with unlimited replayability. Even after you unlock every item and beat every challenge, no two runs are the same (unless you used the same seed or something, but that doesn't count!) and you're left with infinite possibilities. If you're tired of the same old-same old, the modding scene is a flourishing environment with more content you could even dream of getting your mouth around.

I won't beat around the bush here, this game is asspoundingly hard at times. Especially if you're not focusing and accidentally pick up an item that completely screws over your setup. But that just makes the moment you play an OP run that much more satisfying! 

For me, a basic run lasts around 20-30 minutes. I also have the Switch port of the game, so it's perfect for killing time on public transport. Wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's splendid."

7311,"Rebirth kinda sucked but then it got better once Repentance came out and fixed all the minor flaws of the game, it's worth every ounce of your wallet and its replay value is high. For the most part, you may find yourself making more mistakes in the levels themselves instead of bosses, which can benefit you or screw over the entire run. You have to take a chance and hope you get good items. Besides the mechanics and luck-based parts of the game, the story is one I found to be very interesting and the first time I played I never really noticed it was almost entirely Isaac's imagination, and not gonna lie it's kinda upsetting

also delirium isnt hard"

7365,"I really can't get into this game. And it's frustrating because I know I'm only scratching the surface but the lack of any input into your build (outside skipping an item that would kill a synergy you already have) makes the game feels like a waste of time.

On the plus side, I like the different hearts. I like managing resources (mostly hearths) to try to find/loot more stuff from various events and special rooms. Most items (that aren't just stats) are creative and modify the gameplay in a fun way. And I also appreciate that this game inspired many more games like it over the years, many of which I enjoyed a lot.

So yeah, very creative and influential game that I sadly don't enjoy very much."

7380,"I'm coming back to change my review. In my old review I recommended the game, but only under certain conditions:
    - With DLC, because the DLCs are more like updates to the game.
    - When on sale, because the total cost including DLCs is surprisingly expensive.
    - With mods, because the vanilla game is lacking in some areas.

Coming back to this, now I wonder-- if I wouldn't recommend the game if it didn't have mods, should I recommend the game at all? The game has a built-in menu for mods, but still. (The main aspect of the game that I need mods for is getting items' descriptions before I pick them up, because of their sometimes obscure or even detrimental effects.)

Also, as I mentioned above, the DLCs are really pricey for some reason. Yes, you can get a ton of hours out of the game and its individual DLCs, but it's time spent on doing new runs rather than time spent on cutscenes or other story-related stuff.

Lastly, I should mention that there are definitely some balance issues. Certain challenges (I'm looking at you, Ultra Hard) and mechanics really feel like they could be designed better, even if other aspects of the game are fun.

Do I still recommend the game given the afore-mentioned conditions? Yeah, I guess. But I don't recommend the vanilla game at its normal price.

Gameplay: 3/5
Story: 3/5
Tone: 4/5
Synthesis: 3/5"

What will the name of this young man be?

Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play GAMES sometimes.

What will you do?

Your ARMS are in your MAGIC CHEST, pooplord!

Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it on his BED.

You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS.

You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means though.

There are other items in the chest.

In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.

You are neither of these things.

Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX], ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S ""WISE GUY"", BY MIKE CAVENEY."

I never recommend.
I adored this game since I have ever known, as for its 'intense' gameplay was so entertaining to watch. However, when I finally got to play it on my own, I don't get it. I don't understand how this is considered 'fun' to play.

This game feels like a big joke to the player, as any rogueliteesqueism game would be, hammering them with RNG. There feels no intention on the placement of given items, the devil room conditions are excruciatingly difficult,
And don't even forget those darkness curses that literally impales your vision in this dodge-hit game, crazily moving spiders, smirking 'the bloat', impossible 'mask', and all of them, sculpting this so-called ""game"".
And yes, I tried a lot of challenges and did completed good portion of it that this game has to offer, Yet still I feel no satisfaction; they were just the stars being aligned, really.

This is not a hard nor an easy game. This is just a jumble of probability and you are just chasing completion marks in vain. If you really enjoy this game, do you finish every run without pressing R for 10 hours?

I think this game is genuinely a mockery to the player's effort.

I do not plan to buy any DLC; I can suffer enough with less awful items.
It is already saddening that I cannot refund this. 



######## (247.5h) ########

I revise my verdict, as I have played this game more than I should have; Now I'm a fully grown adult. Now is a time where one fully understands that this is not a game to be easily enjoyed.

Basically, this is a game for the Gamer. The Gamer's game. You git gud. You eat your lemons, you grind and strategize. And it did all worth the task. I have improved myself through every run I encounter. I have achieved what thought to be impossible. (Currently there are only 20 achievements that are really out of my reach, while I am already satisfied with current status.)

Of course, with a cost. This game does not like to entertain you, until you are entertained on each struggle you encounter. This is a hard challenge, and if you are not on the necessity of this game, it will be a self-harming experience. If you really want ""fun"", this is not a game for you. If you want to challenge yourself through this voyage, you will have to be stubborn than you ever were. (<- maybe some exaggeration there)

And this is why each win and completion truly shines in this game. They are difficult, but with extensive hard work, it will be gifted to you with a relief. This especially goes to challenge characters in the game, such as Blue baby, and The lost. Remember that if you feel depleted, it was intended. It was to derange you and challenge you. And you will conquer, as any other before have too, faced such despair.

If you really look into it, it really is a skill issue sometimes. The game is unfair, but also you can choose to continue on, slowly but steadily improving yourself. That's the only way granting yourself a glory.

Here are some tips that I can give to younger myself. Curse of darkness, just increase screen brightness... Spiders seem random, but they only charge when you are near. The bloat seems tricky, but he can't shoot upwards. The mask is hard, but always, ""Patience is key"", as anything in this world seems to be.

This might be very weird, but this game taught me to be brave and to trust yourself, in the bleakest times, even. Maybe, if you have a spare time for some bad reason, I think this can be a good challenge for you. I hope you understand my message here. This is a great game.

And heck yeah I'm buying Afterbirth DLC; I just need some break.

7488,Pain and pog
7489,if you like OG zelda graphics and RNG gameplay then this game is perfect.
7490,a very fun rouge-like/lite
7491,play it now you need to
7492,yeah
7493,yes
7494,me gusta
7495,"Challenging, fun, and the randomness adds a lot of replayability with how many items and characters it has."
7496,It's pretty fun.
7497,"9/10
This game has an outstanding replay value you wont find anywhere else. The art-style is perfect for such a strange and disturbing game, and if not for me overplaying the hell out of this game, I could have easily played it 300+ more hours than I have now.
Every DLC has also added hundreds of hours of extra gameplay to the fold.  If you ever wanted to try a rogue-like out, this is truly the one to try out."
7498,"My boyfriend is addicted to this game, and eventually I became addicted to. Requires skill but all the combinations you can get with items is insane"
7499,"I still havent 100%'ed the game. 
"
7500,game grate :thumbs_up:
7501,its just so good
7502,"10/10 would recommend

"
7503,"Ive played this game for many years and had over 900 hours, but for some reason when i logged in today i had lost 100 hours? idk if it was because of the recent update but i lost so much progress. Ireally hope its possible to get those hours of grinding back :("
7504,this is a good game altough it may not be a keeper like fallout 1 it does have a man called keeper so theres that to consider also.
7505,haha sad baby go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
7506,"I like this game but its there are many rogue likes that are better, the rng really makes this game hard to not get mad at. when you just get no damage ups or the last 4 pills have been bad. I understand if i died due to my own lack of skill but when you just get shit luck and there is nothing you can do about it, it really pisses me off."
7507,"Binding of Isaac, Reminds me of my childhood 10/10 would recommend"
7508,yeah it´s alright
7509,"should have made lilith a femboy
aight game tho"
7510,game is simple and easy to play you dont have to be extremely invested to play like say clashroyale but you can always just start a new run and play on the fly.
7511,prodigious
7512,"fuck jacob and esau, everything else is best"
7513,I hate it
7514,crying child
7515,"Yes
"
7516,"Eggman Mcmuffin has done it again, he did your mom you little fucker"
7517,"Watch Breaking Bad, It's really good
"
7518,.
7519,slaps
7520,Holy shit they binded Isaac
7521,like crack
7522,"Very fun, very frustrating, very highly recommended."
7523,"Tboi is like getting kicked in the balls: Most people fucking hate it but some of them just keep going over and over and literally have no problem with it, i genuinely cannot 100% this game"
7524,"The patches tend to make the game less friendly to newcomers by making things harder, but none of it is insurmountable with experience and effort so overall I'd recommend you start with rebirth and update directly to repentance tbh"
7525,i hate it
7526,"good game... just bad at it
"
7527,yes that is true
7528,A game that gets slightly easier but more disturbing the more you play.
7529,good game
7530,"Really fun, rewarding, and makes you feel motivated to go and unlock everything. It has its flaws, but it's a great game that I can play over and over."
7531,Too hard to not have fun playing this game.
7532,ITS REALLY FUN
7533,yoooooooooooooooo isac
7534,Haha shid on floor
7535,its pretty good
7536,meh okay game but has a better version
7537,Most fun bullet-hell game I've ever played. The re-playability is wonderful too. I can easily get sucked into this game for hours if I'm not careful.
7538,:troll:
7539,its good with dlc and fun without
7540,good
7541,for babies by babies
7542,nice game.
7543,the binding of isaac: repentance :)
7544,u rbad
7545,lots of sure
7546,"Okay so this game is a little weird and a little hard. Little, in both cases, is an understatement. Enemies can be weird zombie creatures or they can be sentient farting poop machines with chunks of corn that they shoot at you... Items can be extra damage on your shots, health up, or more, but sometimes its a placenta or moms bra or pads...
If you are open minded or close minded enough to ignore or embrace the weirdness of this game, then you will find possible the most fun and best rougelike ever made. The progression is phenomenal, the endings are unique, the pathways to the different endings are awesome, the story is engaging, the items are super diverse and the synergies are incredible to say the least... you have a solid sense of accomplishment when you win and generally a really good time when you lose. The different rooms, puzzles, designs, pathways, and hundreds of enemies all with different attack patterns are awesome. After the first couple levels, you have to decide, based on the items you have and the character (of which there are A LOT) you are playing as, which ending you want to take on. Do you want to fight in the Cathedral? The Void? The Dark Room? The Chest? The Mauseleum? There is over 30 endings and you get to choose... Or do you want to make your way back up to the house and fight the final boss of the game? You get to decide every single time, and it's awesome. I played the original game for years and bought this one about 6 months ago and have enjoyed it thoroughly. The only minor gripe I have is that, for some reason, the game will not play through my headphones. Probably is just me. Anyways, I would recommend this game to anyone. I play almost daily. Just a round when I get home from work to decompress. It's just fantastic. Highly recommended"
7547,"Endless fun. I think this game is the great culmination of years of hard work, a good community, and a the motivation to make a game that really means something."
7548,gud
7549,"The Binding of Isaac: Repentance is a game where you can fire fetuses out from your body rapidly and they can blow up

absolutely brilliant
10/10 would holy mantle break sfx again"
7550,Worth the grind to get good
7551,eyesack
7552,Really fun and challenging. Amazing story and fun characters mostly *cough* *cough* jacob & esau
7553,"It's a fun rouge like game with a lot of variety and good mods, just don't tell your Christian friends you play it"
7554,my fav game ever <3
7555,"One of the best roguelikes out there. It has a ton of content between characters/items/levels, and endless replayability."
7556,poop everywhere very sloppy and gooey
7557,"Destroyed the game by getting 50+ items in a single run, got an achievement for it, giggled like a maniac as I proceeded to break the game over my knee. 11/10."
7558,.
7559,"the DLC is really cool, and is actually really worth the cost.
Overall amazing game"
7560,yes
7561,your mom
7562,

7574,"Very fun game, it's challenging, but in a fun way. Would defenetally recommend."
7575,it's fun lol
7576,The perfect challenging creepy and unholy Rogue-like.
7577,This is literally my favourite game and is the only game I have motivation to play.
7578,просто по приколу все сейвы слетели игра крутая спасибо
7579,big mom. Mmmmmmmmmmmm
7580,A great game but made DLC's so it is better to wait and  just get the discounted bundle.
7581,eye sack end his madder leaved a loan in as mall hows on a hell
7582,Funny Number
7583,"bald child dies in several hilarious ways, while i am tortured in as many hilarious ways, very cool"
7584,"Game is so fun - apparently it's the original roguelike game and its gameplay elements are definitely familiar, it has spawned so many more awesome games from the roguelike genre. I've played quite a few over the past few years, with notable ones being FTL, Rogue Legacy 1, Rogue Legacy 2, Dead Cells, etc. This is one of the best roguelikes I've played - there's so much depth and complexity to this game, the gameplay loop is addicting, challenging, and rewarding. The runs are fairly short and the game respects your time. Overall, I've had a blast. I recently got an RTX3080 but have been playing this game most of the time as I bought it right after the 3080 - it goes to show you don't need to have amazing graphics or AAA high-concept ideas and characters for a game to be insanely addictive, fun, challenging, rewarding, and that sucks you in. Highly recommended!!"
7585,"good
"
7586,"pretty good
"
7587,yeah it ok
7588,this game has a boss called mega fatty 10/10
7589,It fun
7590,hell yeah
7591,"This game was very fun to play; my favorite part being the numorous amount of power ups, and i hope to see all the zodiac signs as power ups."
7592,Fun. Difficult at the start but fun and replayable. Lots to unlock. Play it.
7593,is a gud game
7594,"Game is amazing, the Binding of Isaac: Repentance is a phenominal game that is very hard and makes me so angry I want to smash my skull in after I had a good run. Anyway, 10/10 would recommend."
7595,I hate it
7596,amazing
7597,BUY IT NOW
7598,goog game
7599,very good game to play when bored with endless fun if you like random maze type games this is the one for you :)
7600,good game
7601,"Amazing game, years worth of content"
7602,it's ok
7603, i love this game and you will too
7604,it pretty good
7605,"It was pretty good, but very short. This game could benefit from some expansions or something."
7606,"Despite the time on record, I've played this more considering the 3DS port. My mixed feelings arise from the merciless RNG from the Wrath of the Lamb days (i.e. reminder that this is a remake of an earlier version of Isaac). I've seen loads of YouTube videos on the game and the potential loadouts are innumerable and remarkably varied.  The biggest quality going on for the game is the soundtrack, followed by the intellectual stimuli in the references within the game (both outward and self-referential).

PROS: the promise of different gameplay per run ACCORDING to RNG pickups and characters, varying from difficulty to traits. For a rogue-like, great level design paired with a great soundtrack to set the ambience.

CONS: repent and maybe you'll get a blessing from the RNG, and then pray that the bullet hells do not claim your life ad nauseam."
7607,You can play this game for hours on hours and it'll never get old. It's perfect for those times when you wanna play by yourself or if you don't have great internet connection. It makes every long flight feel short.
7608,"The base game's difficulty is pretty easy, but just download mods or get the dlc, and you'll be golden."
7609,baby plum
7610,Get it
7611,"make tained azazazel shoot normal-size brim
also game epic
very good
cool"
7612,pog game
7613,Good game
7614,.
7615,"great game but good grief give repentance linux support, Payed for repentance and have afterbirth plus"
7616,"Pros : Slowly turning into a God Gamer

Cons : Addicting as Fuark"
7617,Yea sure okay yea
7618,"one of the best if not the best randomly generated to exist. many have tried to compete but most have failed, hades and enter the gungeon being the few exceptions. this will always be one of my fav games I have lot more playtime then is shown since I have played it since it was a flash release on multiple systems,"
7619,One of the best games ever if you play it every once in a while. One of the worst games ever if you try to 100% it.
7620,Pretty ok game
7621,Toxic relationship: the game.
7622,"Great game, lots of RNG, but enough skill to keep it interesting. Definitely a game to spend many hours on, the content doesn't end!"
7623,A story about about a mother wanting to kill her child to show her love to god has never been so eerie yet fun and time killing.
7624,"Bald kid die and sad :(
game good"
7625,"dead kids are pretty cool, 10/10"
7626,"Great game, I am addicted. Boyfriend says that it is a masterpiece"

7665,Help me
7666,"Bumbo has my soul captive until I complete the game, and is threatening to trade it for a singular coin. Because Bumbo [b]WANT[/b] coin.

Jokes aside, the game is plenty fun, and with a good head now in charge of the updates for repentance, ala the Antibirth team, character QoL is improving vastly. Most normal characters are good fun to play now, and most tainted are refreshing, except for Tainted Lost, which is actually an experimental torture device devised by NATO to break even the strongest spirit. 

9/10, Give Edmund coin or Bumbo will keep my soul."
7667,i dont even own the game

7677,"Great game, beautiful synergies and massive amounts of SKILL ISSUE!!"
7678,I FUCKING LOVE WHEN KIDS START TO HAVE RELIGIOUS TRAUMA AND DECIDE TO DROP INTO A BASEMENT WHERE THEY FIGHT ALL THEIR INNER DEMONS TO RISE TO A UNHELPFUL GOD WHO WATCHED HIM SUFFER
7679,FUCK U EDDY 100/10
7680,Good
7681,Orgasm Denial
7682,Games really fun to play. The only issue i have is the console update speed. It took 5 months in order to get repentances first update
7683,Binding of Isaac com certeza é um dos jogos já feitos.

7690,"I love it, 10/10"
7691,great gameplay rarely gets boring
7692,One of my favorite games. I had a pirated copy and then bought it cause dammit they deserve my money.
7693,"This game is not for the faint of heart, but just keep playing and you'll see why people like Sinvicta or Cobalt on YT are very popular considering this being an indie game and all, so much content and just a roller-coaster through and through. Hope you reading this tries this game. :]."
7694,"yeah it's pretty good, i just hope you have a lot of free time and a healthy appreciation of RNG"
7695,BEST GAME EVER
7696,i hate
7697,Nice.
7698,Yes I love it Help alot of your focus and other skills. Also It creates a better understanding of video game world and real world. For example This game focus on skill and other examples. But in some games they force your to et into there world and you know!!!. Anyways this game has alot of grinding the game and also has alot of cool characters from grinding the game. It isent stressful for a matter and also it help alot for skills.
7699,It's alright I guess.
7700,really fucking good
7701,Enjoyable fun with a dark sense of humor

7706,Great Game
7707,"Although this game is pretty simple in nature, I honestly still really enjoy the core game play loop. I never thought that I'd be saying that horrifically murdering the whole human race would be fun, but it honestly is and while I fully understand that most of the enjoyment comes from the whole, big number make monkey brain go BRRRRR, but creating, adapting and generally managing your own disease or um, plague, is honestly a really fun and enjoyable experience, also, games aren't generally too long so you can easily slide in a game or two whenever you probably shouldn't be (while my oven is slowly burning down my house, is my personal favourite)"
7708,Isecc
7709,good game
7710,"Viciante, te deixa puto, te deixa sentindo como um deus, e as vezes te deixa triste"

7771,"Ok, first of all, this was my first contact with this game, so many years after initial release. Wow. I didn't realize that I was missing such a great piece of game. I usually avoid all roguelike games, but decided to try this one. What I can say? It's a small masterpiece and I am enjoying it a lot! The best thing is discovering all the things without any tutorials, wiki etc. Picking different items and checking the results. Building new strategies, checking all possible ways, which seem to be endless. Gameplay has so much depth, even if it looks easy and straightforward. I have put away all the games I was playing, just to focus on Binding of Isaac. That's the best recommendation. I don't recall any other game, which motivates me so much after a failed run. BUY THIS GEM! :)"

34 playable characters
a lot of bosses and enemies(idk how many look it up if you care)

You can play this game for 5000 hours and not unlock everything
After your first 5 hours you'll feel good about your progress
After your first 20 hours you'll be excited at getting to see new areas and bosses
After your first 50 hours you'll be amazed at how much more to the game there is than you thought
after your first 150 hours you'll be crying because you're only unlocking 2 achievements a day and you realize it'll take a year to complete the game ):

anyway amazing game you should buy it, along with all the dlc. It might seem expensive but it's worth it. If you're on the fence, but the base game, play it, and then buy the DLC after you realize you love it."

7849,"
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally,"

7876,"Game is good. 

There are just so many weird decisions about it. The fact that you need to purchase dlcs to run mods that are almost necessary to play the game also sucks.

There also too many runs that just make you despair and bored. Luckily resetting a run is quick but resetting until you get a good run feels like cheating, which creates a problem: Will you continue a super boring run were any room takes an eternity and any boss double that? Or will you reset and ""cheat"" for a good run?

DLCs solve this as more item diversity and more special rooms cause more fun to be had if you know how to get the most out of every floor.

Greed mode is so stupid.

You go to the end with few coins a lot of times because items were bad or you go to the end with a ton of coins just for the machine to break after the 5th one. Why does it need to break. Kinda stupid

So, final verdict: 
Rebirt - 6.5/10
DLCs - 9/10

Will always recommend this game as it really is a fun just, maybe due to its age, has some quirks that hurt it's replayability."

Plus if you want a refund because you can't even play the game you payed for, they won't even refund you the whole thing you bought but only the main game. Which means you bought things that doesn't even work anymore and can't play it or even get a refund for being scammed. You can still play the game without Afterbirth+ but you'll lost everything because the game gets corrupteed. Nice game if you want to spend money on something unplayable after using a proposed method of gameplay BY THE GAME."

8003,"i became a god with tears that were homing missiles and i could kill anything in a snap, died to a blood donation machine. 10/10 would suffer again"
8004,pretty good
8005,"A difficult yet fun game. Is rather grotesque with common themes of blood, gore and unsettling imagery of fecal matter, decapitated enemies, blood, among other things, which are displayed in the screenshots of the game on the store page, see them for more detail on what I'm talking about. Note this is not a con with the game in my opinion, but it may not be for everyone, for me it adds a form a charm and gives the game it's identity as a visually horrifying experience.

Past that it is a very fun game with randomly generated dungeons, items, enemies and bosses. It doesn't require a beefy computer to play so it's perfect for people with lower end computers that can't afford higher end ones. Even without the DLC the game has a lot of content including several endings. As if the game doesn't already have a lot to do and see the DLC's add even more, while I currently as of writing this review, don't have any of the DLC, I will get them in the near future as this game already has become a favorite of mine.

I have yet to run into any glitches, neither minor nor major, the game seems very well made and I appreciate that.

All in all I'd give the game an 9/10 personally, you get what you pay for, which is a fun and engaging game with very good game play and the randomness of potential items to modify your runs gives it good replay value. What keeps it from being a 10/10 for me is the lack of an in game encyclopedia as there are A LOT of items to keep track of and at least something, even a checklist of items that you've gotten previously that tell what they do would be very appreciated as I have a crap memory and going to a wiki can potentially ruins the mystery of the game as you have a chance of spoiling yourself. This point will become even worse once DLC is bought, but for now, the Wiki will do.

TL;DR Very fun, interesting game, I'd recommend giving it a try. Personal 9/10. Radiates unique personality, lack of in-game encyclopedia can be a little annoying but other than that, very fun."

8166,It fun
8167,"On 2/2/22, after 333 hours of gameplay, I completed the 178th and final achievement of base Rebirth. Maybe half of that time was spent finishing about 95% of the achievements, with the other half spent on about the other 5%, much harder achievements. I was 200 something hours in when I learned I could hold the 'r' key to restart a run.

The game was a lot of fun - with the uniqueness of each run, enjoyable atmospheric music, and also learning/unlocking new items+interactions, new characters, new enemies, new challenges, and new floors contributing to the experience. Given the steep learning curve, the wiki is your best friend. There was a point near the end where some of the achievements got tedious, because they required holding the 'r' key for minutes on end in the hopes of spawning an adjacent treasure room with a specific item. I went through those motions mostly because of my completionist ego.

My advice would be go for about 95% completion, as that's the most fun. But your ego might not wanna stop there. Highly recommend the game, the challenge and entertainment value was way worth the price."

8259,Played it a couple times. Pretty fun
8260,"Trò chơi mang tính giải trí cao, đơn giản không quá phức tạp dễ tiếp cận với người chơi.
Phong cách chơi đơn giản từ việc né tránh và tiêu diệt những con quái vật. Độ khó trung bình, không quá khó cũng không gây ức chế nhiều (trừ mấy con lồn nhện con).
Hệ thống item, việc ngẫu nhiên hóa hay việc phối kết hợp các item thực sự có hiệu quả, tạo sự tươi mới trong mỗi lần chơi.
Trang phục của Issac luôn thay đổi khi nhặt được các item cũng khá hay. Lúc chơi tôi luôn tự hỏi Issac sẽ trở thành cái gì :v. Quái vật và mấy con Boss cung hay đấy.

Với cương vị của người chơi bình thường tôi cho 8.5."

Pro tip do all completion marks for the Lost, tainted isaac to beast, lillith to beast and tainted samson to beast.

8349,"Child abuse or child maltreatment is physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver. Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools, or communities the child interacts with.

The terms child abuse and child maltreatment are often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a distinction between them, treating child maltreatment as an umbrella term to cover neglect, exploitation, and trafficking.

Different jurisdictions have developed their own stance towards mandatory reporting, different definitions of what constitutes child abuse to remove children from their families or for prosecuting a criminal charge."

8419,very fun bullet hell-ish rougelike :^D only played 12 hours but i can tell ill most likely play many dozens more
8420,"Shit load of fun content, very fun."
8421,"This game is very good, and very replayable. It is hard but fair. 

First off, I don't generally enjoy ""hard"" games. I got dark souls thinking I might like it since I liked this game - I did not. This game IS challenging, but the steady drip-feed of content that you unlock makes it feel worth it, even if you take a week (like me) to reach the first ending. It has simple rules that it follows consistently - it will not break any rules to make life easier for you, which can definitely be frustrating in instances where you feel like you were completely screwed over by bad luck, but it does mean that there's never any uncertainty of ""am I supposed to be able to do this?"" You know from the get-go that no, you shouldn't expect any help from the game. It's up to you. 

Again, that can be frustrating for sure, but there are a few things that definitely help. 
First off, the game expects you to die - and it expects you to die a lot. The game-over screen is quick and lets you see the seed for that run in case you want to do it again, but it only takes one button press to get to a new run. Dying isn't tedious. On top of that, each successful run is usually only ~40 minutes long, give or take. It's a very fast-paced game, so even though getting very close to the end on a good run and then dying can be very annoying, it's only taken 40 minutes of your life. 

BoI is somewhere in between a true roguelike and a typical roguelite. The only currency that carries between runs is one token to use a specific character, and once you get into the meat of the game you'll be racking up those tokens fast enough that you stop thinking about them. Doing different things in the game allows to to unlock items and characters, and those unlocks stick around. If you unlock an item in one run, then you have the chance to find it in all future runs. However, that does not* mean that you will have it in every run. 

*there are some times when you can unlock a character starting with an item, in which case for all future runs that character will start with the item.

Another thing that both helps and hurts the frustration in this game is how much RNG there is. Especially with all of the DLC, there is a huge amount of content and all of the items you encounter are randomly generated. You will have runs that are so lucky that the game becomes a pushover - some of those runs will be successful, others will have you wanting to smash your computer when you die to your own bomb on the last floor. You will also have runs where you never encounter anything better than a mediocre item. Some of those runs will fail and you'll shrug, and sometimes you'll keep fighting against that luck and have success anyways. If that sounds like hell to you, then this game is definitely not for you. There is no way to avoid the RNG. Conversely, I really appreciated it. Like I said, I don't usually like your typical ""hard"" game, and I might have given up on BoI if it weren't for the occasional lucky run where, even though I was just starting and I wasn't very skilled, I got to taste success anyways. As you learn the game, you'll get better at beating it even without great items. 

Now, replayability. I may not be the most efficient player - far from it - but even having owned this game for years and actually gotten good at it in the last few years, I still only have 68% of the achievements. This game is near-infinitely replayable. There will always be more to do and more things to unlock. That said, none of the unlocks are actually... required? I don't know that that makes sense. You don't need to unlock one thing to be able to unlock a main gameplay thing. Well, except for reruns, but even then that's not a very complicated method. Every stage is unlocked just by playing through the game successfully enough times (iirc), and though there are plenty of things that have absurdly difficult or complicated unlock methods, all of those things are super powerful and completely unrelated to the main gameplay loop. Achievements and unlocks exist for their own right, and I think it's a really good way to go about it. You can enjoy the main gameplay loop and unlock as much or as little of the game as you want. 

One last thing: mods. Play without the external items description mod for at least a while, get a feel for how the game was meant to be played... and then get the EID mod."
8422,It's a good one.
8423,awesome :)
8424,ver good
8425,AGHG8IOQWGH8WHGI8OFEWS
8426,this game is
8427,"The time and effort i have put into this game consists of two eras: part where i knew what i was doing and the part where i didn't. I enjoyed both eras very much and continue to do so. I remember first going into this game and getting overwhelmed by the simplest enemies calling them unbalanced and not fun to be against. This game truly shows the long and harsh learning curve you had to go through by showing you how far you have come. 

       You will always get a lucky run and get a free win but turning a hard run into a good one or pulling through and defeating a hard boss even though your run was horrible is definitely a task that requires skill, experience and ofcourse patience. I see a lot of comments about this game calling it unbalanced (it is) with only -10 hours. The learning curve of this game is steep enough that nearly everyone will go through a phase like that, which is where the patience comes in. You need to go through this game multiple times before you have a propper understanding of it. If you go through the initial dying again and again phase you will enjoy this game... too much. This game will pull you in and not let go because playing a run doesn't take that long and if you ""get good"" they will actually be fun. You will feel like you are experiencing physical pain and you sometimes will die at the end of a run and just feel... like shit. But know that it takes time to get good enough to play some characters and killing some bosses as some characters. Just try to freshen things up for yourself every once in a while and no one can miss the charm of the game. 

       But every game comes with its fair share of why would they add something like this. Before i put the spoiler tag know that i do not find the whole game unbalanced there are just some instances of bosses that arent paced that well and here it goes. 
SPOILERS AHEAD I think we all know where this is going 
1. Delirium: Undodgeable attacks, telefraging, too much health, too fast 
2. Hush: Continuum attack. 
and yea thats about it."
8428,is good :)

8430,its bad dont play it.
8431,One of the best games ever made in the history of human kind.
8432,"Very hard, can be extremely frustrating, but fun and rewarding. I'm not good enough at the game to stand much chance even on a good run, but I plan on 100% the game. I like the art style and I'd kill for the soundtrack."
8433,"It's basically the OG roguelike imo. Very good, very fun, 9/10

Pros:
-Replayability
-Surplus of characters, enemies, and items, among other things.
-Highly modifiable, and it still gives achievements after a certain milestone.
-Good music (even better with mods).

Cons:
-Sometimes the game's bs (part of all roguelikes, really)
-full game is like 40$ (which is fine, given the amount of content)
-Mod compatibility with the game itself is sometimes jank
-There's no planetarium rooms on greed mode. Literally unplayable."
8434,BEST GAME PLS PLAY THIS IT GRRRREEEEAAATT
8435,"Just good fun, been playing longer than it say because... reasons <...< >...> but I purchased it because I adore this little game and have started a duo run with a friend recently to see how having limited items but 2 players changes the difficulty"

8444,"you kill things with your tears and you get to shit yourself, would recommend"
8445,"Never has a game made me wanna kms this badly 

but also have this recipe for a pie:
Homemade Apple Pie
PREP TIME
75 mins
COOK TIME
70 mins
TOTAL TIME
2 hrs 25 mins
SERVINGS
8 servings
If the crust looks like it's getting too browned, take a large piece of aluminum foil and place on top of the pie in the oven. No need to wrap it around the pie, just place it on top. That will keep the top from browning further.
Pies always seem to take longer to cook than one expects. (Perhaps it's because we're always opening the oven to check on how the pie is doing?) The filling should be visibly bubbling, which you should be able to see through the steam vents.

I recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet on a rack beneath the rack of the pie to catch the filling as some of it invariably bubbles up and out over the pie. Makes oven clean-up a lot easier.

Ingredients
3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish)
1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to toss with the sliced apples so they don't brown as you slice them)
1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie
3 tablespoons all purpose flour for thickening
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon brandy , optional (if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe
For the egg wash:

1 large egg yolk
1 tablespoon cream

Method:
1. Peel, core, and slice the apples

2. Make the apple pie filling

3. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)

4.Roll out the dough and line bottom pie plate

5.Place apple slices on top of the bottom crust

6.Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges

7.Brush with egg wash, cut vents

8. Bake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, Roughly 45 minutes to an hour

9. Let it cool for atleast and hour

10. Enjoy!"

8455,"The Binding of Isaac and its DLC expansions are a bit hard to describe and recommend through the lens of the roguelike genre, as it has shaped the genre so much that almost all of its DNA lives on in newer, flashier games. So, here's a few things that it does that most other roguelikes don't, and that keep me coming back to it over any other game in the genre. First off, the setting is very unique. Isaac sees a traumatized child fighting enemies that range from grotesque to gross, creating a very ""ugly"" and creepy setting that seems to contrast the gameplay-focused nature of the game, but Isaac actually happens to have a unique narrative that I find very interesting to analyze and dissect, especially with the additions made by the newest DLC, Repentance (Which, for the record, is the best the game has ever been, and is very recommended).

On a note that may be more relevant to players searching for a roguelike, The Binding of Isaac is virtually unmatched in the variation its runs can have, boasting tens of characters and a hundreds of items that synergize with each other in many ways. Almost all runs of Isaac are balanced enough to not feel like a crapshoot while allowing for the possibility of interesting and sometimes overpowered builds. I find that most other roguelikes end up a little too repetitive or unbalanced, but Isaac strikes a good balance, though one that sometimes causes slow runs for its weaker characters. The gameplay is simple, but not only does that make the game approachable while challenging, it also better highlights the random nature of the runs and the various ways that a player can interface with the possibilities that they're given to increase their odds of a good run.

To end on a sour note, while none of Isaac's flaws are dealbreakers, it does have them: Some runs have or seem to have relatively little agency, and can sometimes be slow or underpowered, which is obviously not too fun. 100% completion is an absolutely grueling tasks, guaranteeing that most players won't get to view certain items or even characters without great amounts of dedication (or cheating). The secondary mode, ""Greed Mode"", is often punishing and repetitive, and required for certain unlocks. 

Regardless, The Binding of Isaac is not only a game that codified the genre of roguelikes, but one that still shines among its many representants thanks to its sheer variety and unique balance."

8472,"this is the best game ive ever played. it makes me really angry which fuels me to get through everyday and issac looks funny as fuck I wish I could squeeze his big ass head. I LOVE BINDING OF ISAAC REBIRTH SO MUCH GAME OF THE YEAR EVERY SINGLE YEAR INTO THE FUTURE AND THE MOST AMAZING BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTFUL PIECE OF MEDIA TO EVER REACH THE INTERNET. I LOVE IT. 
If you hate binding of issac rebirth I HATE YOU!"
8473,"yes
"
8474,"If you can stomach the visuals and setting, this game is amazing. While the outward appearance does make it hard to recommend (it took me years to gather the courage and play this poop, blood and gore infested game), it's also core to the games identity and I appreciate it a lot after having finally played through all endings.

A lot of the fun is built around the mystery of it all (What does this item do? Why can I teleport here all of a sudden? Why is that literal poop walking around on the ground?). If you want to use a wiki and learn everything you can, go ahead, but at least give it a try and play it blind first. Gradually understanding the rules in this weird world is very rewarding, so don't ruin the mystery for yourself.

TL;DR: Best played blind (don't use a wiki), and while it looks hideous, it's also mostly on purpose and has deeper meaning. Highly recommended"
8475,yeah.... pretty good game.
8476,Almost certainly the best game of all time. Endless variety and endless replayabilitity in a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. Constantly updated with free content and bug fixes and paid content at super cheap prices. I've been playing this game for 11 years and I've still never gotten bored of it.

8487,"Old Fashioned Pumpkin Pie

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

There will be some hard things to get used to and the graphics change from illustration to pixel is a bit of a trip but beyond that this game just adds upon a masterpiece. The DLCs is genuinely the cherry on top and that's not even mentioning the ability to mod the game. It will be frustrating and challenging at times but if you love a challenge and love roguelikes, I could not recommend a better game for you. I would go as far as to say that this is the Half Life of roguelikes, it is everything you could want from one and at the same time it's a phenomenal introduction to the genre. 11/10"

this is the binding of isaac

or instead of going to a cave system, you go to a sewer, then a mineshaft, do some minecart shenanigans like its minecraft and then go to gehenna???!?! then your lost dad who left many years ago spends your familiy's life savings or something and then you ascend floors instead of descending, you then go back to your home, and fight a tv static screen dog that shows up out of your tv?!?! then your house is in hell and your fighting this huge ass beast 
this is the binding of isaac

or instead of going to a cathedral, you can go to sheol?? and fight satan?? tf did satan come from, now your fighting his mega evolved version because classic anime plot twist

It's the best game of my life.
If you buy this game, you will never regret it.
There are many reasons, but I don't get tired of it.
Second, the content is abundant.
Third, this is the biggest advantage of the game, the feeling of playing one game after another.
Even if the format is similar, I can't get enough of the items, rooms, and bosses that come out depend on my choice/luck.
So if you're thinking about playing, make sure you buy it!

8697,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

If you're into roguelikes, Binding of Isaac is worth every penny (though don't let that stop you from waiting for a good sale)."

8733,Great gameplay but the developers could introduce other characters besides Eden and Tainted Lost
8734,"yes
"
8735,to lazy to write but good game
8736,"(Note: This review is written taking all DLC into account.)

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a game with near-infinite replay value as you unlock new content with every run, dozens of characters with unique playstyles to play as, thousands of items, and Edmund's signature brand of edginess and dark humor all over it, interlaced with a melancholy and surprisingly powerful story that grows more down to earth the further into it you go. In my experience, Isaac is a great game to play when you just need something to do while listening to background noise, or if you just feel like turning on the console and screwing around with absurd item combinations for a while.

Also, the mods- good lord, the mods. Workshop support requires DLC, but that's a small price to pay for the sheer amount of content and replayability the mods add. I've modded this game so hard that it's straight up stopped working on multiple occasions.

Overall it's a game I highly recommend, especially with all the DLC."
8737,"Endless replayability
Endless content to unlock
Endless fun
Endless reasons to keep coming back to this

If you want a game that you can play for ever and have fun the whole time, this is it.  Probably the best podcast game ever. I have around 2500 hours between this and the original and I could easily get that many more out of it.  Unlocking all the character, endings, bosses, challenges, items, passives, will keep you coming back for a long time, And it has couch coop too!"
8738,Yes
8739,The fact you can die after you beat the game is very retarded.
8740,me when the fart.sfx
8741,why eye sacc always crying ;-;
8742,"the only game where the phrase ""HOLY FUCK C SECTION LETS GOOO"" is an acceptable sentence
"
8743,its aight.
8744,"super hard, so far my fav character azazel (high damage low range but flying is good)"
8745,"This game starts out like a basic top down rouge like but as you go farther into the basement it just gets better and better every item makes you stronger and thanks to repentance Isaac has regained its sense of challenge from og Isaac to wrath of the lamb all the way to repentance. I love this series with all my heart and soul every time you beat it you unlock something new and for a game that was mostly meant to fail Its great! You 100% (excluding daily awards) and are you bored? Well check out the modding community make your own mod! You can tell they put hours of work into it! And for a person trying to learn game devlopment I can say it took a while everyone who worked on it good job (Except Tyroine you racist piece of shit). My final thin is my thoughts. I think this sums it up perfectly ""Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.
You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."" HA!

8846,"I absolutely love this game, its amazing in every single way. I love the mods and the art. 10/10 would recommend."
8847,"The best game I've ever played, no questions asked. The sheer amount of joy, pain, and content that this game has provided me over the years is unmatched, and coupled with the bustling modding scene and mind-boggling amount of unlocks and achievements, it's going to keep you busy for a very, VERY long time.

There's a reason every new roguelike that comes around the block gets compared to this game. There's a reason why Edmund McMillen is such a well-respected dev. There's a reason why tons of people are still playing this game SEVEN YEARS after its initial release. It's just that good."
8848,"I played this a lot more on iOS, which is why my hours on the review seem lacking, but I got through all 16 endings on the original vanilla without DLC, like Afterbirth or Afterbirth+.
Even without the DLC, this game is an absolute blast to play. Quite difficult, but very good for people who want a challenging dungeon crawler."
8849,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaac as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac.
Isaac was simple, and they were both Isaac.
That was, until the day Isaac's Isaac heard a Isaac from above: ""Your Isaac has become corrupted by Isaac! He needs to be Isaac!""

""I will do my best Isaac to save Isaac, my Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again, the Isaac called to her:
""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac! He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac.""

""I will follow your Isaac, Isaac. I have Isaac in thee,"" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac away in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of you.""

""Yes, Isaac. Isaac,"" Isaac's Isaac begged.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I require a Isaac. Your Isaac Isaac will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to me, to Isaac that you Isaac me above all Isaac!""

""Yes, Isaac,"" she replied, grabbing a Isaac from the Isaac.
Isaac, watching through a Isaac in the Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find a Isaac, he noticed a Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac and threw Isaac down into the unknown Isaac below."

8914,"Old Fashioned Pumpkin Pie

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

8917,WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
8918,"This is a really huge game with many possibilities depending on what you do. It gives a good challenge, especially some of the Tainted Characters. One of the only flaws in my opinion is that after a while of playing this game, especially when you have unlocked so many things, the gameplay becomes repetitive, boring, and monotonous. Otherwise, it is still an awesome game."
8919,i kinda like this game
8920,"I love this game i first played it on the Nintendo switch back in 2017 when it first released on the switch. loved it then still love it now. its a better experience on PC first off. i just bought it on PC recently since i got rid of my switch. I'm not good at the game but i do enjoy playing it. On the switch i would play it over and over again, even after loss after loss and starting over after each loss. it reminded me of games i played on my first console ever. the saga genesis. It's older games were like, if you loss you start over from the beginner but in this game items and dungeons are basically random or i guess what you call RNG, i don't know if I'm using that right. It's a nice chill game to just play over and over again. but i recommend"
8921,good gaem
8922,Very fun to play as there's lots of content within the game itself.
8923,"I used to play binding of isaac a lot way back in the day and found myself coming back to it when antibirth came out. However; I have come to not enjoy this game that much because of how unbelievably RNG heavy it is. You have barely any control over how your run goes and it can get frustrating after a while. 

8/10

The item synergies make this game very fun to play besides the bullshit luck it has."

8927,im a dumbass to not have found this game or played it sooner because its the shit.

8933,"My recommendation: buy the first one, play it with no dlc's and no wiki. Play wrath of the lamb god. Get this one and play it with no dlc's

Eventually upgrade, start using wikis. starts using mods.

Hundreds and hundreds of hours of game time and always slightly different play.

only con is the latest dlc was the first dissappointing dlc

I probably realistcly have put in 500+ hours into this but some of the play time was on the old flash version. My whole family plays this game together now."
8934,"This game is pretty good! The graphics are alright, and it's kinda easy. But, one difficulty I have is the random spawn of rooms. Some rooms can be really harder than others, and other you can just walk over. Another things is that some bosses are really harder than others, and some bosses are easy to get their technique. I haven't fully finished the game, but overall I am very pleased with this game! I still literally play it very day. =v="

I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with these words of caution:
-This is a game that you will lose. Repeatedly. Sometimes for reasons that are complete bull and out of your control
-Download the DLCs with caution. Each one makes the game a whole heck of a lot harder with new enemies and layouts and other goodies! I would recommend to play the base game a while first, then afterbirth, then afterbirth+, then finally repentance. In that order and only install the next DLC when you feel you've got a handle on what the game is throwing at you.

With that in mind, this game is near and dear to my heart despite repeatedly drop kicking me."

I'm not a completionist by any stretch but I can see myself certainly putting way more hours into this unlocking new characters and beating the extra content. You do have to get a little lucky to succeed, at least at my skill level, but I don't really mind -- the game keeps just enough info from you to turn every new run into a learning experience and make it feel valuable. No complaints really!"

9016,"Stress: The videogame.

But in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.

All DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.
There are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.

On top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.

If you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you."

I'm 50 hours into the game and have unlocked only about 11% of the items which spawn randomly across each playthrough. The RnG makes the game infinitely replayable, as there are countless combinations of items which can yield unique results when combined."

9048,One of the best games I've ever played. I have over 800 hours and have like 50% of the achievements. super challenging and so many mechanics are never explained. 15/10
9049,good
9050,"Sometimes you get majorly unfair rooms or mystery items that just ruin a run. Or you accidentally run over a spike, forget you're on womb and lose a whole heart inside of a half, or blow yourself up. 

Just a part of the game.

You get addicted to finding synergies. ""What will this do?"" Then curse when you realize that it fucks your entire build.

A lot of my achievements I've unlocked randomly. It provides a rush of dopamine every time because you feel like you're getting closer to God (platinum god, that is).

It doesn't get easier. It gets harder, and it celebrates when it does so.

Is it worth it? I guess that's up to you."
9051,i love this game 11/10 its difficult but rewarding as hell

9070,soy milk sucks
9071,"Before Roguelikes really kicked off as a genre with hits like Hades, Dead Cells, etc. there was Binding of Isaac the Flash game, and by 2014 came Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.  Pretty much the classic and still one of the best roguelikes out there as far as character variety and item combinations/synergies go.  Even without the expansions there is a massive amount of content to go through.  

The game does not hold your hand whatsoever, and there is a good amount of RNG that can make/break a run.  You will die quite a bit and may go through several run attempts before you finally get a good one.  Using resources like platinumgod.co.uk and the wiki for looking up items and figuring out progression is pretty much mandatory, especially for unlocking characters like The Forgotten in Afterbirth+.  

Overall it's a great game that has had some bumpy roads when it comes to the devs deciding to ""balance"" a game that inherently revolves around finding the most imbalanced item combinations.  There's SO much content to work on to where you'll be playing this for potentially hundreds of hours just to get through the bosses and unlock the characters.  Game won't be everyone's cup of tea, but this really is the one Roguelike to rule them all."

The game is really addicting, just by the thought of a rogue dungeon game didn't interest me at all, but as soon as I started playing, it was a ton of freakin' fun, millions and millions of combinations, synergies, bosses, fights, every single thing is just great about this game. I highly reccomend Binding of Isaac to be your first buy if buying dungeon-like games"

9164,"Honestly?

it's pretty good. Not the best, but not bad.

a lot of the mechanics are busted or break if you do a certain something that is some-what common.
(bit of spoiler if you haven't played the game at all)
Some rooms are IMPOSSIBLE not to get hit on if you dont have flight, or free hits. looking at you, blue spike blocks. 15-20% of the items are useless or have limited use. Some are god-tier and will win you a run almost all of the time. Some of the best items/mechanics in game are unlocked via playing for like 50-100 hours, time (as someone that goes to school) i do not always have. Also pretty much a rage game.

But that's from a vanilla perspective, you can mod this game via steam workshop or manually. This gets interesting.

You can remove/stop garbage items from spawning, and same goes for those pesky blue spike rooms.
You can unlock stuff with mods, but they tend to not work. You could also just get a new character to have all-new mechanics (i recommend Andromeda and Bertan), items, and synergies! A lot more cool stuff can be found just in the first 10 pages. Also, for people with bad eyesight or something similar, the 'shop has stuff for you too.

Overall, the game is great. I dont think just playing plain Isaac would be as fun and downloading 50 mods and trying to get to the later floors."
9165,"naked baby game

edit: after hundreds of hours this game is dead to me edmund you sick son of a bitch i love ya"
9166,"Quite possibly one of the best Roguelikes in the genre and a classic. The base game is pretty good by itself, but I also recommend the Afterbirth and Repentance DLC. If you're not a completionist and doubt you'll 100% everything, avoid the Afterbirth+ DLC, it's just bad all around.

If you want to try getting into this game, I recommend that you play 1-2 runs per day or session. You can get burnt out pretty quickly in this difficult game. Playing on hard is optional, as it only unlocks useless co-player babies and transcendence. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for greedier mode as it [i] does [/i] unlock items. Also, do not play with mods until you've beaten mom's heart at least once or else you'll end up disabling achievements, afterwards you can play around with mods all you want!"
9167,"I played a bit of this game on the Nintendo switch, but recently I got it on steam and have really sat down to get good. The controls are easy to learn and the game is hard to master. The rougelike elements of the dungeons and wide array of items leave much space for replayability, and one could easily sink days of effort in this game. I also need to give it props for the story, because the concept and lore behind this game is very unique. The Binding of Isaac is a really neat addition to the dungeon crawler genre, and will constantly put you through a battle of banging your head on the table in rage and confidently coerce you back for more. 9.5/10."

9212,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

9226,Let me get straight to the point... This game is brutal. You will probably be trying for hours just to beat it for the second time (i say second because the first time is a bit easy.) This game is obscenely difficult but in the end you will be proud of yourself when you finally beat it. Plus there is some DLC which adds a ton of content to the game.
9227,.
9228,"Woohoo, I'm a Dead God!

I think this game's only actual design flaw is..... confessionals in angel rooms. Come on, just WHY? How about make the bonus angel chance work for the next floor at least? Or better yet, spawn a confessional at the beginning of the next floor? I hope this was just an overlook and not an intentional design decision.

Also Gnawed Leaf. I think it's just not healthy for the game. You've nerfed Psy Fly already, surely you can adjust the leaf so it's not a boring autowin?"

9238,"Incredibly fun game, worth every penny for all the DLC's. It may be hard for beginners (from experience) but looking up a small tutorial will help a bunch, and really gets the fun started. Tips: Focus on dodging rather than dealing damage, no matter how many hearts you get you're gonna have less total health than all your enemies, so make sure you don't get hurt. (especially if you're losing soul/black hearts cuz then devil deals may not be affordable.) and make sure to put your coins in the donation machine unless there's a really good item on a really good run. or until you have a decent level shop. Final tip is GET AZAZEL, they aren't too hard to unlock (buy 3 devil deals in a single run) and once you have them you'll be able to easily kill mom and make lots of progress, unlocking new items and getting better at dodging."

As it is, it can have some interesting situations and synergies, but the items are varied to the point of being impossible to identify all of them (if you need a mod to fix your game, it's not the game being good). A lot of level progressions are super unclear, and can instantly end your run if you try experimenting with them with no option to continue (because roguelike)

It has some ups but a lot of downs. I'd honestly recommend Risk of Rain 1 instead"
9279,this happened to my friend kevin
9280,Piece of shit Isaac
9281,"This game suck, But in a good way"
9282,"The Binding of Isaac is a really fun roguelite. With hundreds of enemies and items, the possibilities are almost endless. However, and this is it's biggest drawback for me, sometimes it's even more frustrating than it is fun.

While playing other Roguelites (like Enter the Gungeon or Dead Cells, two of my favorite ones), I never feel like the game is unfair. Sure, not all runs are gonna be broken. Some will be much harder than others. But you will have fun in every single one of them. Every item you find will be welcomed, every encounter will be a fair match. Regardless of how lucky or unlucky a run is, you will feel like you have a chance.

The same can not be said about Isaac. Some runs just feel like the game is doing absoultely everything it can to ruin your day. Having 700+ items may seem incredible, but in reality a lot of them are worthless. Or even worse, not even worth picking. Some of the characters are just obnoxious to play, not fun at all. Bossess with scaling armor are bs. Greedier mode is as unfair as it gets, with enemies spawning under you, potentially ruining your run.

Now that I've vented, I'll say it again. TBOI is a really fun game. But you better have patience, for sometimes you'll feel like punching through your monitor and jumping out the window."

9314,good

9316,Only buy it if you're going to play it for a long long time. not just like 2 hours. It's a difficult game at the start but once you get to get used to it it's easy.
9317,"Launched once, then proceeded to crash, and crash Steam, on launch every time since. After like 8 fix attempts, it's not worth the effort."

9326,"At the time of this review I am currently 522/637 achievements deep. I cannot describe the depths of hatred I have for Edmund McMillen and the creators of this game. Not only do I want to perish, but I have relinquished a piece of my soul to this sadistic man. I will not give up, I will never surrender. But, this game has made me question whether or not I am willing to give my first born child (which I will probably never have because I am too busy playing this stupid game to actually understand what being around a female is) for a semblance of the feeling that comes when unlocking an achievement in The Binding of Isaac. Edmund, I hope you're happy. You have forever ruined my life and will continue to do so. 10/10 game, please send help."
9327,"Been playing this game since I was in about 4th grade, in 11th now. So fucking good I swear worth every single penny spent on it."

9334,"After finally beating this game on 1 Save file and reaching 100%. I feel I can write a proper review on this game. This game is challenging,and you will lose. Quite a lot, and the game will be unforgiving and brutal on all aspects,that being said. This game is a solid 9/10 for me,its fun, tells a light story that's relatively easy to understand while at the same time being deep and leaving mysteries left behind. Isaac is a character you end up feeling more and more emotion towards as the story progresses on. The final update (Repentance) wraps up the story of Isaac. But the game is still getting patches and small QOL updates even today. The game is rewarding for skill and punishing for making stupid choices. Absolutely worth the price"
9335,Simply the best game I've ever played. An rpg for the ages
9336,Honestly quite incredible
9337,Excellent game for lovers of the roguelite/like genre.

9341,"i miss my wife

9342,"game's addicting as hell. luckily it sucks shit so not all of my lifespan has been consumed by it 

anyways i'd feel bad for edmund given that the damage stat is such a fundamentally broken thing to balance in a roguelike due to its randomness and shit but then i remember that this was the guy who decided boss rooms should also have a chance of giving you pickups instead of stat ups and also designed bosses like the bloat, monstro II, delirium, etc etc yada yada

also the story is uh, there. it's good if you want to feel like you just experienced Deep Art just because the main character dies in the end because of choices made entirely by his abuser (later on there's an attempt to humanise said abuser btw). it initially gives off mysterious vibes and makes you think it has a lot of symbolism but is actually super clear in a bad way. there's a lot it tells you outright when you didn't need to know but the things that would actually be Cool to KNOW FOR SURE are left up in the air. just for quick reference: if you're going to make a story that makes a critique on religion and various abusive aspects of it you should make sure you don't have conflictive feelings on the whole deal beforehand. sometimes it feels like edmund is scrambling to justify religion in his story when it is literally the reason why everything is fucked.

the game however does have a few upsides: at the start when you haven't noticed how shit what you're playing is you are actually misled into believing it's good. and you have fun. there's also beast route being decent and the final ending in isolation is quite touching (not in the context of the rest of the story, which makes it shine as the pile of garbage it actually is). chest is pretty satisfying when you get there (if you don't get fucked over by bullshit catacombs or necropolis rooms beforehand, or the dreaded double greed fistula room which has ended many of my runs and my friends still insist is actually super easy for some reason), and if you're lucky you can pull off pretty funny shit like that time i killed mega satan with gnawed leaf and big beautiful fly. overall i do not believe edmund is a bad game designer per se and i'm sure his other stuff (none of which i've played :P) is good, because isaac is actually pretty good for a passion project that he did not intend to get big, but at the same time it's evident that isaac started as a passion project he did not intend to get big and that the issues in it just were left to fester for a while until we got shit as severe as boss armour added to try to mitigate issues

anyways if you'll forgive me i'll go 100% this actual steaming pile of basement 1 bosses. thank you for coming to my ted talk

REVISION: oshit i forgot about the random bullshit rooms where you take damage for stupid reasons btw, i mostly play rebirth and just lost a really good run to one of them"
9343,i hate you
9344,Only game ive played for 10+ years
9345,"Isaac's mobile game is amazing. First of all, it is commendable that the game moved the same item to the phone. However, I think it will be perfect if you correct the two shortcomings. First of all, I'm asking for a preemptive measure for the change in the operation method. Unlike computers, this game is too difficult to operate. It's right to use two joysticks, but the operability of these two virtual pads is so bad that I'm very worried that they might be a factor in cutting down the game. And I would like to seriously ask if the bomb should be replaced by the installation of the bomb if you touch the right virtual control pad twice. Other games have good games for convenience itself, so please refer to these games. 
 And secondly, please allow the full facade. The computer can press the f key, but the mobile is so difficult to operate, so please put the full screen as an option. It's more comfortable to watch. The biggest drawback of the current horizontal mode is that there is an uncontrollable section, which seems to be solved naturally. 
I think it'll be perfect if I change these two. 

Please remember that there is someone in Korea who likes your game and can point out the problem of this game. It's good to see you gradually develop. 

Milan and Isaac, fighting!"

9373,There was a movie starring Mel Gibson titled Conspiracy Theory.  In it there was a government program that created Manchurian Candidate style assassins.  One of the quirks of the assassins was they had to buy every copy of The Catcher in the Rye that they saw.... The Binding of Isaac is my Catcher in the Rye from the movie.  I have to buy it on every platform I own.  I love it through the goof times and the bad.  It started my love affair with the games that are tangentially related to rogue genre.

I feel like I could be playing this every day for a year and i'll still have to unlock stuff or discover a new secret. It's also pretty amazing how it manages to tell such a complex story without telling you anything, you just discover it through items or small details on the cut-scenes. I totally recommend it :)"

9415,"Would not recommend the vanilla experience. It can generally be improved with the DLC and downloading mods, but you need to purchase DLC to use mods at all.
Also, purchasing the DLC might also make your game unplayable until you mess around with the files.
After upgrading to Afterbirth, and then again to AB+, both times I had to go into the apps data and delete old resources or the game would crash on startup. That's only the start of my issues.

Even a decade after release, the game is unstable as hell and constantly crashes. Generally there's no error or easily located log which might help you diagnose the issue. Mods which make the gameplay more fun are often incompatible with one DLC or another mod, which the user won't know until they spend hours testing every single mod they might want to use.
I'm now trying to play the Afterbirth+ DLC on my Macbook because Repentance isn't ever going to be released on Mac. Because I have Repentance save data on my PC and Steam Cloud, or because I installed a mod which I can't identify, the game now always crashes on launch on my Macbook. I suspect it's a mod issue, but the only way to figure it out is to unsubscribe from everything and go through one at a time to find the issue. There are no launch options that I can use to disable mods on just my Macbook. I cannot disable the mod with the ingame manager, which would at least allow me to keep using them on my other computer, because I cannot launch the game.
Using the game on more than one computer might be a fringe case, but even just using this game on one computer has already wasted a lot of time playing tech support instead of playing the game. 

I highly recommend Enter the Gungeon for a more reliable and fun experience."

9438,"This game has a lot of potential to be fun, unfortunately the entire repentance update has made many things much harder. You are forced to keep track of MANY different attack and death rattle patterns, and then even when you memorize all of that the game itself has mechanics that can screw you over (And don't even get me started on Delirium). I Love this game and have been playing it for years, but right now? Don't waste your money right now if you want to have fun. Cause you WILL find yourself in situation where it feels like the game doesn't want you playing it. That being said I'm 100% it out of spite now."

9441,funny child cry
9442,"I absolutely adore this game, I've gone from someone wanting to unlock the It Lives fight, never imagining myself ever being good enough to win at all on Hard, let alone with a character like The Lost. But as time went on and I kept coming back to this game, I've realised that I honestly could play this game forever, and that the fun times I had when I first got the game hadn't left. I was still playing the game the same way, challenging myself with things I didn't think I could ever manage, somehow getting an even more overpowered run than last time, or battling all odds and surviving until the Mother fight with no DPS upgrades. I do think the game can be majorly unfair, and god does it tilt me when I waste a good Tainted Lost run, but this game has been so damn good that I end up somehow telling people these weak points about the game as more things I love about it. 'The Binding of Isaac' is the first Rogue-Like I ever played, and I think I would be a complete an utter fool to do anything but recommend it to as many people as possible (which I have done). If you're thinking about getting this game, do it, I can practically guarantee it'll be worth it."

I am still addicted to this game, whether it comes to unlocking new items, unlocking new areas, defeating different types of bosses, and unlocking characters as I go along. I do recommend this game to anyone who loves the combat style of the game and enjoys the deep lore that this game contains. 

P.S. Hard mode is the way to go, and you can only get the option to buy Repentance if you bought the other two DLCs."

9532,"DISCLAIMER: I value consistency above all in games, so the more of a game is centered around RNG, the less I like it. As such, my personal enjoyment of this game is rather limited (hence the dislike rating), but I can see how others might (possibly) enjoy this game.

  Be warned, you will either LOVE this game or HATE IT BEYOND MEASURE and all but certainly flip flop between the two more than once during your playtime.  

  This game CAN be be fun, but, more often than not, it is just CRUEL FOR THE SAKE OF IT (and that's coming from a FromSoft vet).  As in, it will regularly find a way to make a useful thing unusable, unoptimal, or inaccessible, and most of your deaths will be due to some of the most EGREGIOUSLY MISLEADING hitboxes in any game. You can learn how to play around these headaches with enough play experience. However, your patience is all but guaranteed be stretched to its limits, and, at that point, you could've spent that time mastering an infinitely more consistent and rewarding game (like Dark Souls 2.....yes, I hate this game that much).

2 out of 5

  Also, you are required to slog through playing the ""un-tainted"" characters several times each (unless you use the debug console to skip all the excessive busywork) to get to the actually (relatively) fun ""tainted"" characters. (With that said, though un-tainted Forgotten is my personal favorite/least hated character to play, if that means anything.)

  Go watch Tear of Grace on YouTube if you want to get a good example of how this game works and what it takes to stand the best chance of success at it. Brett deserves a medal for the amount of bullshit he's had to put up with from this game over the years (as hilarious as his frustration was to watch)."

9560,It's a neat little game. I like that there are so many Items so not once is it the same game. Only sad thing is that my game tends to crash sometimes but that happened after I installed a few mods so it's probably because of those

9606,"The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a fun game. You explore randomly-generated dungeons and unlock stuff by beating endgame bosses with each character. Every iteration and expansion adds a bunch of new items to try. Get Rebirth if you liked the original Flash version, as this one vastly improves on it, adding a lot of synergies between items, and introducing much more varied room layouts, including impassable pits, narrow rooms, and double- and quadruple-sized rooms. There's now also a possibility for mods, which I personally don't care about much, but there are reportedly some great ones out there, like Antibirth (more on that one later). The graphics have been downgraded from infinitely scalable vector graphics to a faux 16-bit style, but it grows on you eventually. The music has also suffered a downgrade from DannyB's great one to Ridiculon's lame one. Luckily, you can mod Danny's music back in.

A great addition is local co-op for up to 4 players, however in Rebirth everyone who joins only controls a little baby familiar who shares the primary character's attack's characteristics, and borrows from its health pool. It's nice that it's a drop-in feature where anyone can join or leave at will, but a more involved co-op was only added later in one of the expansions.

Now, a word about the expansions. Afterbirth came first, and further expanded on item synergies, added a fun new endgame boss, and a not-so-fun alternate game mode. It also added an alternate layout to the pre-cathedral/sheol floors. Overall it's very worth getting. This is also the expansion where Ridiculon's music started getting better. It only applies for music added in the expansion, however.

Then came Afterbirth Plus, spelled ""Afterbirth+"", which was widely despised for making the game unfairly difficult and broken, by adding portal enemies that continuously spawn other enemies to many room layouts even on starting floors. It also added tiny boss rooms which sometimes made spawning devil/angel deal rooms impossible on top of making boss fights a real pain. Another endgame boss was added with its own floor. The floor literally reuses all previous floors, and so does the boss - it barely does anything new, it just transforms into other bosses in the game. People also disliked the game for mostly adding bad items to the item pool. Skip this one.

The two great things Afterbirth+ did is, it incorporated the popular Missing HUD mod which provided exact character stats and info, directly into the game under the name Found HUD; and it provided a mod API and integration with Steam Workshop for super easy mod installation and management.

Lastly, there came Repentance. Getting it requires you to have Afterbirth+, but it fixes most of its shortcomings by removing bad design choices (no more portals or tiny boss rooms). It also is the integration of the Antibirth mod, which was incompatible with later expansions, to the official game. Antibirth's content is accessed as an alternate path you can drop in and out of, and is very fun, but quite difficult. Speaking of difficulty, the game is made harder by increasing some eniemies' bullet speed on hard mode. Antibirth adds a TON of content, more than tripling the amount of things to do compared to Afterbirth. A lot more synergies and cool items were added, and the new characters are a mixed bag. Some of them are not fun to play, others are amazingly fun. Some of them are very challenging, even more challenging than the challenge character from Rebirth who dies in one hit. The best addition in Repentance is true co-op, which lets up to four players control their individual character and play through the game together, sharing bombs, coins and keys, but each having a separate health pool and items.

In its current state, the game is maybe a bit too bloated in content. It'll take you a few hundreds of hours to unlock everything in the game, which includes defeating every final boss with every character, of which there are dozens. It's a completionist's nightmare. But if you can endure falling into these compulsions and like the core gameplay of exploring random rooms, finding random loot and learning the rules of the game so you can win almost every run and maybe even break the game sometimes, you'll have tons of fun.

If you don't enjoy learning by trial and error what each one of the 700+ items and trinkets do, you should refer to the Isaac Cheat Sheet at platinumgod and the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Wiki. The Extended Item Descriptions mod is a must!"

9623,Good Game :)
9624,"ye
(edit) i wanted this game to be just one of thos meme reviews where i say 2 words then not touch the game ever again... but that was impossible for this game. I love this game so very much and i truly think it deserves a actual review.

The gameplay is remarkable and truly amazing to start off as a little child who can only fight back with his tiny tears, all just to turn into the equivalent of satin.

The game consist of doing a run dying doing a run dying doing a run winning then unlocking a new item. and these item make the boss you were just fight way easier, but.. they bring out a new boss at your face. and now you have to defeat that one like 5 times, as grindy as that sounds its super fun and doesnt feel like grinding that much to be honest

theres alot of characters in the game and once you have beating all bosses as one character maybe you can try playing another character i recommend playing any character when you feel like it and have lots of fun

this is one of thos games where the graphics dont necessarily need to be good for the game to be amazing but with mods this game can get smoother and funnier

11/10 my favourite game"

Definitely worth its' full price for both the base game and the DLC."
9724,"do you like getting the worst item youve ever seen in a run and thinking ""hey, maybe i can work through this absolute piece of garbage and win regardless!"" and then you realize that you in fact, can not work through that absolute piece of garbage item and win regardless and end up dying on the final floor? then youll like this game."

9736,"If not the best one of the best roguelikes I ever played! Game is huge, with a ton of content (+ the content they added in the DLC which is totaly worth buying it!) and infinite replayability. Yes the game is hard but that is what it makes it fun."
9737,What can i say? tons of content and a good sized modding community all in a rogue-like which keeps you coming back for more game-play because of all the content you might be wanting to search for. good recommendation for those wanting a game to sink lots of hours into.
9738,bro the dopamine this game gives me is too high

9760,I'm literally addicted i haven't played a different game in days. 0/1
9761,"While, yes, The Binding of Issac is hard, it's also fun, in my opinion. It's just so addictive. You tell yourself you are gonna quit, and next thing you know you've spent another hour on it."
9762,one of the best games i have ever played
9763,Run away. It's addicting
9764,This game has soo much to it. With mods from the community that don't ruin the game but enhance it you'll have hundreds of hours that you will put into the game and still feel like you haven't down enough. There's so much to unlock that's not shown in the game so most runs you'll find something new to play with. Have fun!
9765,Just spare your sanity and avoid it.
9766,binding
9767,crashed and never started again
9768,"Binding of Issac: Rebirth, especially with the Afterbirth+ & repentance DLC, is one of if not the greatest dungeon crawler(s) of all time. There are so many power ups & quirks each round feels fresh! This game is also INSANELY ADDICTIVE, be warned! I've played probably around 600 hours between two steam accounts & I'm still playing because it's JUST. THAT. GOOD."
9769,it is a very fun and engaging game

"
9789,"After 757h all achievements and 1 complete Repentance file / 1 complete Afterbirth+ file, I can safely say that the game is addicting. It can get frustrating at times with certain unlocks, but it is rewarding when you eventually make it. For fans of Rougelites this game is a must have. Also, mods exist for replayability purposes, making the game harder/easier or changing it entirely. Here is some template i have copied: (but filled in myself)

This game will always be there to give me joy no matter where I am in life, it never gets old thanks to the randomly generated seeds and different synergies you may get with the copious amount of items. To this day, when people ask me what my favourite game of all time is, my mind instantly thinks of The Binding of Isaac. Then the struggle of me attempting to explain what the game is occurs. 11/10"

9952,"A very good roguelike with a massive modding community, has a little bit of everything. Infinite replayability and tons of options. I suggest buying the base game and playing for a bit and then buying the DLC to make sure if it's up your alley. The characters have tons of interesting concepts and gameplay styles. (The Forgotten being my favorite). Always can add mods if you're bored or want something new. I highly recommend it."

9956,"I've played this game for 420 hours now.It felt like a good time to commit to a review.

I've played Isaac since the flash days, and I like it. I would recommend this game, but with a word of caution.

This game is incredibly dependent on luck. Those really hard characters will sometimes feel like you are just holding R until you get spoon bender or cricket's head. I once had a loss streak of almost 200. This game does allow for a decent skill ceiling, though, and enough time and effort towards ""getting good"" can make up for the luck aspect of this game. No matter how good you get, though, one particularly terrible seed can screw up your win streak.

I would add that this game is not very clear. Some unlocks are difficult or nonsensical. Definitely read the wiki (https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth_Wiki) , and as soon as you can, install the External Item Descriptions mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872). At the very least, be prepared to look up everything on Platinum God (https://platinumgod.co.uk/), especially before your first Mom kill.

 It will take time to learn what each item, card, rune, and trinket does.

Story-wise, the game is fine. It's sad to be sure, but after a while you tune it out. Edmund McMillan seems to really lean into how sad the story is supposed to be, or how philosophical it is. I disagree on that latter point, and would recommend just tuning it out; focus on the gameplay. 

Over all, I would recommend it, but would say this is not a very beginner-friendly game. There will be a learning curve, and you will lose a lot of runs to stupid mistakes. Still, it is a very fun game."
9957,Still new to the game but enjoying it so far :)
9958,"I love this game to death. Best rogue like (or whatever the fuck the genre is called) out there. But god damn there is some genuinely asinine game design that keeps getting added and rarely is fixed. It's understandable when a game like this is so big, but I feel some things could've been implemented better.
Some things that I think are bullshit:
• Boss Armor (not as big of an issue now though)
• Delirium (heard he's getting fixed soon though)
• Poorly thought out item nerfs (like restock)
• Poorly designed enemies (fuck those stone guys)
this isn't too big of an issue but having chaos card not do anything to some bosses is kinda cheap
• those rooms where its 30 fucking mullibooms and a bunch of stonies

clearly skill issue

9976,"One of the most well known rogue-likes and for a good reason. The Binding of Isaac proves itself with it's gigantic item pool and a lot of different routes you can take to reach a final boss. The different Characters also offer some change in strategy/gameplay and have noticeable differences between each other. And since each character has different unlocks, you have tons of stuff to do.
The items you gain can synergize with each other and lead to unique effects or give you stats-up, etc.

Most of the soundtrack is good, nothing too overwhelming and fits the game nicely.

The game also introduced a true co-op mode with the newest DLC, allowing you to play together with a friend locally or per remote play at the same time. It works pretty well and the game also adjusts itself to the second player by giving out a second item in the treasure rooms and giving enemies more health.

However, the game also suffers from some flaws.
Some characters/challenges feel more like a chore to complete rather than a fun challenge. Most of the time having a bad start with them just means an insta restart. And some unlocks rather hurt yourself more than actually help you (e.g. haunted chest)
Greed Mode is also a very messy mode, which feels sometimes unfinished or just straight up unfair. The randomness of the waves and where they spawn leads to cheap hits which really shouldnt be in the game. 
At the time of writing this, devil deals are severely underpowered compared to angel deals.

But despite these flaws The Binding of Isaac is still really enjoyable and fun game, with tons of content and unlocks to do and goals to achieve. A good game to pick up even if you're not that much into roguelikes!"

I stayed away from BoI for quite a while simply because of the visuals, shooting out tears didn't sound too satisfying,
but the complexity and variation the system offers is simply unmatched, the amount of items, modifiers, bosses and enemies, is ridiculous.

It even has steam workshop integration with a modding community always pumping out new endless content.

Seriously, if the visuals don't appeal to you, try ignore your initial perception and give this masterpiece a try.

10011,"This game is equally frustrating, difficult, annoying, gross, fun, exciting, and amazing all at the same time.

You will die. Many, many times. But the satisfaction you get at completing a run is worth it. A must for the roguelike fans."
10012,"(This review is based on the full game with all DLC’s)

[h1]By far, the greatest rogue-like on the market[/h1]
…and that's said without a second of doubt. But why? Why in the world where every single indie game developer has to have their unique take on rogue-like genre, one of the OG’s is still at the top? Is it the story? Is it the difficulty? Or maybe it is the replayability? I really recommend finding it out for yourself, but if you are stubborn, then hopefully this review will prove my point.

[h1]General Idea[/h1]
You play as Isaac, a little child that threw himself into the basement under his house, just to escape his religiously lunatic mother that tried to kill him. In said basement, he finds many deformed monsters and bosses that he has to kill with his own tears. On his way, he finds many items, trinkets and consumables that help him defeat tougher and tougher enemies.

[h1]Really dark themes[/h1]
If you ever played a game made by Edmund Mcmillen, you know what I will be talking about.
The main story is really tragic and disturbing. I won't get into details about the endings but they are never even remotely close to happy closures. Every item that Isaac finds, destroys his body in some way or another. And he never actually escapes the basement, he just dives deeper into it. Upon reaching some of the final bosses, your character will look very similarly to all of the monsters you destroyed hundreds of. Every single piece of this game is unsettling in its own way… but at some point, you are just getting used to it.

[h1]Item combinations and synergies[/h1]
One thing that definitely separates this game from other rogue-likes is the amount of possible synergies. Usually some effects and ways to deal damage are overriding each other in other games, however that is not the case here. You can choose almost any pair of the 722 unique and balanced items and they will form a special synergy. That said, not always it will be something you want, sometimes it can screw you over, but the sheer amount of those effects is what makes this game infinitely enjoyable.

[h1]Replayability and mysteries[/h1]
With almost thousands of items, a big amount of unique characters, and 14 different final bosses (that end your run), replayability is absolutely outstanding. Realistically, to fully complete this game, you will need around 600-700 hours. And the best part about it, is that you can discover 95% of things that this game has to offer, in around 200 hours. So there is a choice, are you a hardcore fan or someone who actually has life.
Mysteries are also very good, the game tells you nearly nothing, about items, enemies and bosses. And there are actually a handful of them, some led to special rooms, and some to special final bosses with special endings. Both people who enjoy not having full knowledge about the game, and wikipedia enjoyers will have a very pleasant experience with the mysteries. 

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
I'm a fan of hard games, fair but cruel challenges are always welcome. However this game is surprisingly easy, not to say trivial (considering the difficulty of original flash TBOI this is very surprising)...Unless you bought repentance, then it's a living nightmare. But what did this DLC do? Well, it nerfed almost every single run-winning item, buffed numerous enemies, added alternate paths you can take that make the game way more challenging, added absurdly fairless bosses and many frustrating characters for masochists. However at the same time, it buffed everything underwhelming in the base game, so it basically made the game more difficult but balanced at the same time. Still, repentance is what separates man from the boys.

[b]There are tons of things I couldn't mention here, like character transformations, challenges, daily runs; I highly recommend discovering everything for yourself. The binding of Isaac: Rebirth is just one of the greatest indie games ever made, and nothing ever will prove me otherwise.[/b]

10026,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

10033,"Base game without DLCs is pretty fun, but having invincible enemies you have to just wait for and enemies that exclusively move on angles when you can only shoot side to side and up and down gets tiresome and feels like a chore.

DLCs make the game worse and Afterbirth+ crashes the game a lot.

If you like gambling you may enjoy the item synergies (random item generation), makes the game feel like a kind of gambling rogue light."

10044,"I fell in love at first sight in 8th grade, seeing one guy in my class. It was the middle of the year, too. I never noticed him before that, but one day, I just looked at him and fell. He was tall, handsome, athletic, and really funny. I guess what 14 year olds like. I was obsessed for the next 4 years. Blindly in love. I felt like I was high all the time. I woke up in the morning thinking of him, and I went to bed thinking of him. It did not help that he lived across the street from me. I could not escape him even on summer break or after school - he was always there. I thought he was kind, funny, and I could see he was popular with everyone. And every girl thought he was extremely handsome. I was a wallflower, not noticed really by any boys. But he noticed me in school and that fanned the flames even more.

I have an abusive father. Whenever I would walk through my door after school, my dad would be there, scowling. He is a very cruel man. He would hit me, slander me, make me feel like trash. He said I was gonna end up being a stripper one day because I was so stupid - things like this. My grades were slipping in high school because I was focused on a boy the whole time. I projected everything I wanted in a guy onto my crush bc of my father. I imagined that he was the sweetest, kindest, most romantic man. and honestly… my soulmate. Silly and pathetic, but I guess it was my coping mechanism.

Anyways, a friend convinced me one day to tell him my true feelings. I did, and it was not a fairytale ending. He laughed at me, and said he had no feelings for me. I actually thought he did. There were little signs - but I was 17 and stupid in love. Thinking he was a good person as I was idealizing him for years prior. He told his friends. For senior year I had to tread lightly. I hid from him and his friends. He ignored me completely from there on. I felt disgusting, ugly, unwanted, all of that. I wanted to end myself. He got a girlfriend, hot and blonde, with big… assets. She was also extremely intelligent, going to a famous engineering school. He had a type. My dream man fell apart. And so did my life at the time. I had poor grades, felt ugly, talentless, worthless… I don’t know where he is today, all I know is he is back in his home country. His parents sold the house and moved away years ago.

I’m in my mid-20s now. I know better than to fall head over heels on a man now. It corrupts you, and blinds you. You can’t eat, sleep, study, concentrate - nothing. Idealize them, for what? Only to be let down. Don’t do it. See how they actually are before falling for them, at least 6 months. Have one foot out of the door, ready at any moment. Date other men. They could be a complete LVM.

Learn from me. Don’t ever allow yourself to be treated like that by a man. I joined FDS because… I was tired of being walked on by men. My crime was loving this guy, and loving my dad. They tormented me instead, made me want to end it all some days. Be careful and keep yourself grounded. Thanks for reading ❤️"

Drop money out of poop
Sell your life to Satan
Cry over monsters that live in your basement
Enter in your mom's utero by a hole in the ground
Kill yourself as a fetus inside her
Defeat the most terrible angels and demons
Get killed by a spider

Ten out of ten"

10078,"one of the best dungeon crawlers out there , binding of isaac is an roguelike game where each run is randomly generated, with each of your achievements and accomplishments only adding more to the game. theres like 300ish achievements you can get, almost each of them being an item/boss/room you can unlock. aside from all that, the game's controls are super simple, allowing me to easily play on my laptop whenever class gets intolerable. great game, amazing replay value. dlc is okay, while it does add much more to the game you can do without it really"

10118,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

10125,"This game hurts. Physically and mentally. Everytime I have a shred of hope, this game throws me up against the wall like an american highschool bully and beats me horrifically. Even when I try to stand up, it kicks me in the face and leaves me for dead.

So yeah it's a pretty good game ig lol"
10126,"not enough achievements, 2/10"
10127,"Hard yet fun because of the possibilitys, fun characters and items, plus the modding is really cool. Takes awhile to get used to but when you do, you'll have fun."

"
10172,This game has taken a grasp of my life.
10173,Its fun watching the child cry
10174,"This game saved my life.

I am 2.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
10175,"haha funny isaac go brrr

10252,"One day I decided to ask a friend for a game to play and he reccommended me this. I decided to play about 2 hours worth and somehow ended up with 224 at the time I am writing this. It's a good game and a lot of Bible references such as The Bible, Isaac, Jacob & Easu and all that jazz. The game can be frustrating at times but it can also feel very refreshing when you finally get a good run and destroy everything in your path. Good game, 7/10

The Spiders have unpredictable movement patterns, it's hard to dodge. Hardest enemy in the game ngl

10333,"What a great game,

Let me start with that this is one of the better easy to learn single player games out there.
It is a 2d game that jumps right into the action while you load up your first game.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
- The game is based on floors. You can go to multiple floors to kill an boss on every floor. Once killed a boss on a floor you can go to the next stage, this stage is still in the same run and once killed the boss again another stage opens up and so on. When you get far enough into an run you will kill the ""end boss"". In the beginning this will feel as a great accomplishment. But the fearter you come, the harder it gets.
- By killing an ""end boss"" you complete more parts of the game, you get more boss types, different enemies that start to come into your games, you can unlock more characters to play with and on top of that, more items!
- Once you get more deeper into the game it doesn't stop at just the ""end boss"", you can choose to continue to do certain actions that leads into opening more stages into a run. 
- This makes the game into endless fun because there are so many options, so many items, so many things to unlock and new things to learn.
- Also there are ways to make it more difficult if you want too, you have normal mode, this can be changed to hard, greed and greeder. Greeder is a difficulty you have to unlock by doing certain things. But luckily people on the community already figured everything out so you can easily follow on how to unlock it!
- Unfortunately the game is not so beginner friendly, only its quiet easy to learn and understand how the game and game mechanics work. It will be great fun when you get the hang of it!
- The game gives you 3 save files. They are all starting from 0 and you have to work your way up. This is nice, lets say you are playing with friends and he has to go, you can leave the game and start a different save file. 
Only, you have to start from the beginning again, it only makes it more fun to grind for it again!

[h1] CHALLANGES [/h1]

- The game has a challenges tab. There are quiet some challenges, and by the title you can understand that they are not easy. They require game knowledge and quiet some skill!
- By playing these challenges you can unlock more items. So more things to play with and learn.
- The game also supports custom challenges. By browsing thru the workshop you can find challenges.
These challenges you can subscribe to. Once into the Challenges menu you can easily find where to find these challenges and start your run on that challenge.

[h1] ITEMS [/h1]
- There are so many items you will see at first. You have to learn what all of them do and what effect they give you.
Some are good, some are worse but others are god like! 
Little by little you get used to the items and ofcourse become better at the game!
- The game does involve some RNG into getting good items on your run. This makes it more fun. In the beginning in the game this is something difficult to play with since you don't know what they do, but it also makes it more challenging to use worse items and do get better using those items.
- There are 637 achievements in the game, not all of them include getting new items in the game.
But many of the achievements do! By playing you unlock new items, those items are ofcourse not all good, but many of them are.
- Once you start to understand the items and how to play you start to realise that some items go very good with each other. You can hope for some good RNG and get a[b] GOD[/b] run! This makes it more exiting to play. Once you got that god run, you want to keep playing to get more runs!

[h1]MODS[/h1]

- This game consists so many workshop mods. There are plenty of mods that could make the game way too easy.
As every other game the mods their are funny mods to change backgrounds, give enemies funny skins but also it has mods to show for example what each item does. This makes the game better to understand and much easier to learn!
- Unfortunately you can't use the mods straight at the start up of the game, first you have to clear your first stage until you are able to use the mods you would like to use.
- Once reached the point of able to use those mods, you can subscribe to any workshop, restart the game and you are good to go. The game supports mods so there is a mods tab. You can select the mods you want to enable and to disable into that tab, [b]Great feature![/b]

[h1]CO-OP[/h1]
- The game does not have a co-op system. But it is able to play the game with your friends thru local. So on 1 pc at someone their home. Or you can play it thru remote play.
- The only downside on local/remote play is that only 1 player is able to use the keyboard. The other players that connect or want to join you in real life, have to use a controller. Once you get used to that it is also very doable and a whole new experience!
- The co-op from the ingame part is not that great, only 1 person get a item in treasure rooms, in boss rooms its not always able to get multiple rewards etc. etc. Luckily, there are many mods that you could use for co-op experience that you can enable and disable at any time. This makes it playing with friends more fun and easier to follow the chaos that will be released upon you!
- The unfotunate thing is, once playing co-op on a run, and one of your friends disconnect the run gets paused. 
If that friend has to go you cannot continue on that run without him and you have to back up and start playing on a different save file, otherwise you have to start a new run on that save file and start from the beginning of that stage again.

[h1]COMMUNITY[/h1]

- The game has a active community with multiple discords where people talk about their runs, and how to optain items, or to play co-op with those people.
- The community has already opened up most of the game so if you are stuck at any given point it is able to search around google on how to achieve or get something you want too.
Also the chapters are explained, so if you are ever stuck and think there is no progression, just ask google on what the status is and whats next. This could help you to keep playing for unlocking what you want!
- Thanks too the community there are so many workshops to browse thru! They made this all possible, the community is very friendly and thanks to that there are also many guides. This can also help when stuck.

[h1]DLC[/h1]

- The game has many dlc, but in my opinion they are all worth it. They make the game more difficult by getting more items, unlocking different mobs and other stages.
- The dlc are quiet on the expensive side, but once you buy them, they are really worth it.
- The runs get more variated, more chaotic and way more fun!

[h1]UPDATES[/h1]

- The game updates very often. This can because of bug fixed, new content or updates for your workshop subscribtions.
- Mostly they are from your subscribtions, but thanks to the devs they make new content. The only thing is that most of it is DLC so you have to buy it in order to unlock more content.
- The game doesn't have many bugs thanks to the community figuring out bugs and reporting them.

10334,"It's been 500 hours and I still need five achievements. That alone probably tells you how much replayability this game has. But now I hear you saying ""But Zoe, Isaac is a roguelike! Of course it has A LOT of replayability!"" And you would be right, but Isaac is quite a bit different to other roguelikes! Mainly due to the sheer amount of rooms, items, mobs, transformations, secrets, unlockeables, bosses and endings. 

This game is simply amazing and definitely worth every penny."
10335,"it gud
"
10336,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

10339,"This is objectively the best roguelike of all-time. My 505 hours are not reflective of an additional 700-ish hours in rebirth, and 500-ish hours in the original isaac on another account. Buy this game on sale and enjoy the endless variety."

10397,"You cant find a better rogue like game! Even after 300+ hours on playstation i still find this an amazing game that i had to restart on PC. You still discover new synergies with items and its still a challenging game after that many hours. I will probably play this for 700 more hours.

10401,"I am genuinely enjoying it hopefully i can win one run :)
"
10402,It's the funny game
10403,"This is the most fun and most replayable roguelike game of all time. You could easily put over 1000hrs into this game and not see all of the content. It's full of secrets and surprises which trickle-feed into the game as you unlock them. I would go as far as to say it's a perfect game.

It's a top-down twin-stick shooter where you explore a procedurally generated dungeon, fight monsters and bosses & acquire fun and wacky items which combine together to produce crazy and powerful synergies. Each room in the dungeon is hand crafted and it seems that in the latest DLC a lot of care was made to ensure that the none of the thousands of possible room layouts you can encounter are too frustrating or can inflict unavoidable damage.

It is best experienced with all of the DLC installed. I found that the retrospective changes & patches to the afterbirth+ DLC content that were introduced with repentance dramatically improved the game, so much so that I don't recommend you buy the afterbirth+ DLC without repentance.

This game is very hard, but rewards you for your efforts.

10406,"Isaac and his Isaac, Lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs while his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac. Life was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That it, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac: ""Your Isaac has become Isaaced by Isaac. He needs to be Isaaced"" ""I will do my best to Isaac him my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.

""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""

""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.

Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he Isaac open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and Isaac himself Isaac, into the Isaac Isaacs below...

10524,"After playing Isaac for so long on consoles and now being able to get a fixed repentance experience it is now my favourite game and its definitely worth wasting your life on.

The game is one of the most repeatable games as it always creates new experiences and still manages to be engaging and difficult. I have some complaints as it's not perfect especially 2 specific end game bosses (not spoiling but you know if you've seen/fought em) and some stuff needs polishing but it's good."

Other than that, this game is an absolute must-play for anyone who enjoys a single player experience, or if you've never played single player games much, this is a great start. Awesome item combinations and synergies, great characters, fun gameplay, and a great community behind the game. Not much else to say."

10589,"Pain. 
I never followed Rebirth+ or repentance. So playing this game after only playing Rebirth. Caused me a great deal of pain. It's so much harder now. I thought I was good at the game. But I've been destroyed."
10590,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

10595,"One of the best roguelikes of all time, if not the best. It is deceptively simple and once you begin to unlock more items, learn about the details of the mechanics of the game, and just generally become more aware of what all of the tools in your arsenal can do, it is wildly addictive."

10599,"I've tried so many times to play and like this. I'm a big fan of similar shooters like Enter the Gungeon, Undermine, Nuclear Throne and similar titles but i just can't get into this game. 
The 4-way aiming combined with a ""floating"", slippery movement, of your character makes it feel hard to play in an boring way, unlike the games mentioned above which have a move precise moveset and overall feel to the controlls. 

Don't get me wrong, this game has an original story, unique artstyle and good sound design however it does not tickle MY fancy. 

Would not recommend over other titles, hence the thumbs down."

The game's so relatable 🙂"
10604,"If we are living in the light, as God is in the light,
That we have fellowship with each other,
And the blood of Jesus, his son, cleanses us from all sin,
If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling
Ourselves, and not living in the truth.
But if we confess our sins to him, He is faithful,
And just to forgive for us our sins,
And to cleanse us, from all wickedness.
And so I tell you, every kind of sin is standing to be forgiven;
But blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven!
Impurity, lust, and evil desires.
Don't be greedy!
For a greedy person is a idolater, worshiping the
Things of this world,
Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming!
No temptation has overtaken you, except what is
Common to mankind,
And God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted
Beyond what you can bare!
Fits of rage! Selfish in ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy;
Drunkenness, orgies, and the like!
I warn you, as I did before, that those who are unrighteous,
Will not inherit the kingdom of God!
But if we walk in the light,
As he is in the light,
We have fellowship with one another,
And the blood of Jesus, his son, purifies us all from sin!
All the wages of Sin is death!
But the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ, our lord!
But if we are living in the light,
As God is in the light,
That we have fellowship with each other,
And the blood of Jesus, His son, cleanses us from all sin,
If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling
Ourselves, and are not living in the truth.
But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful,
And just to forgive for us our sins,
And to cleanse us from all wickedness.
Pride! Greed! Wrath! Envy! Lust! Gluttony, and Sloth!
So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you.
Have nothing to do with sexual immorality--
Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit!
All of us have become like one who is unclean,
And all our righteous acts are like filthy rags!
We all shrivel up like a leaf,
And like the wind, our sins sweep us away!
No temptation has overtaken you
Except one that is common to mankind!
And God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted
Beyond what you can bare!
""Vengeance is mine; I will repay!"" says the Lord!
There hath no temptation taken
You but such as is common to man.
But God is faithful, whom will not
Suffer you to be tempted above all!"

But in general it's a super fun game, which provides you with a wide variaty of items that sum up to hundreds of freaky, special tear types.
I recommend this game, because it's a fun challenge for literally everybody, although the graphics might not be for everyone, I find them to be fitting the subject. You can go easy, you can go normal, you can go challenging, you can go overkill :D. Give it a try"

I really like this game, and I don't get why people don't like the latest DLC. I heard that a majority of people didn't like Repentance, said it is objectively bad, and assumed it was horrible, but it is so much better than Afterbirth+.

Here are some pros and cons, but first a little warning: This is my opinion, not yours, so if you don't like what I say in this review, than I understand.

-It packs the game with so much new stuff, like [spoiler]the alternative route[/spoiler], the new art and the new variations of enemies, that weren't only just a different colour and that was it.There are a lot of new bosses, but the  2 new biggest bosses in this update(or should i say 3?) are [spoiler]Mother and ""The Beast & Dogma""(and The 4 Horseman)[/spoiler]. I like the ways to get to those bosses, the [spoiler]ascending part towards Home[/spoiler] was very creative, and the [spoiler]alternative route to get to Corpse[/spoiler] is not insanely unique, but it provides the player with an area which is significantly riskier, but packed with better items. The bosses themselves are good, [spoiler]Mother[/spoiler] is challenging and fun, and [spoiler]The Beast arena[/spoiler] is incredibly creative.

-The new adjustment to items is what seems to trigger a lot of people, but I find it very good, because it makes every run possible to beat without feeling extremely challenging and its making sure that not a lot of runs are very rigged. But still, the game should be hard, at least in my opinion, because I like TBOI: Repentance for the same reason I liked Vanilla Isaac, because of the difficulty. But Rebirth stripped that away, making it an easy game, to easy for my own like. I understand that some players are mad because of the item changes, [strike]items now aren't as interesting[/strike], right? Wrong. I have some very fun and extremely unique runs, not very op, but still fun. I of course have some op runs as well, but they aren't that many. But the thing I like is that the only runs that were a flop, were like that because of me, because of my stupid mistakes. Oh yeah, a loooot of items in Afterbirth+ were useless junk, and Repentance changed that, again a very good thing.

-The [spoiler]Tainted Characters[/spoiler] are either so fun and interesting or extremely hard and punishing. And here I say that its fair to say that some [spoiler]tainted characters[/spoiler], like [spoiler]T.Lazarus[/spoiler] or [spoiler]T.Lost[/spoiler], are hell, but after the new patch, they are playable, but just hard to play. A lot of people are mad that these [spoiler]characters[/spoiler] are not easy, but that is the entire thing. They are meant to be hard.(Still they didn't do it properly before). Their mechanics are a lot of fun to play around it, making you think a little bit more than before when making a decision. The only exception here is [spoiler]T.Apollyon[/spoiler], he is boring.

-The soundtrack is so much better than the one in Afterbirth+, in my opinion, it makes me feel more immersed in the game and the individual soundtracks themselves are more tied to the areas or bosses that they are correlated to.


[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]

-This DLC has some visual bugs, most of them related to C-Section. On a lot of synergies with it, the fetuses will just be invisible, and that is just annoying, especially when there is a bullet hell in the room and you may not see if the fetuses got to the enemy, or if they can act damage to you, and there are some other synergies that can make tears invisible. It doesn't effect the experience that much, because it's rare anyways. It's just a nitpick of mine.

-The fact that [spoiler]Boss Rush[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Hush[/spoiler] are time based is annoying for sure, but the most annoying thing about them is that if you don't have an op run, they are just a pain. This alone isn't bad, but if the game is made so that op runs are a lot rarer, this is a little bit of a problem, but if they weren't time based, the player could have looked for alternative routes to take more items(not necessarily op) and resources, so that the fight becomes reasonable. It isn't the end of the world, more like a bit of a nitpick of mine.

-The fact that this game is very susceptible to crashes when certain mods are enabled, especially with the new characters and all of the [spoiler]Tainted Characters[/spoiler]. Example: When I entered [spoiler]Corpse II[/spoiler] with[spoiler] T.Jacob[/spoiler], with a certain mod that makes farts have the explosion effect and the item description mod, it crashed. I try to enter again, crashed. The run was lost, just because of 2 mods that didn't affect the gameplay that much. In general you should not run into this problem, as most mods are stable, but sometimes it can happen for mods that do not change gameplay, which is annoying and frustrating.

-Bob's Brain, Mercurius and My Reflection are the most and one of the only useful items in this game. Take them every time you see them, especially My Reflection with Ipecac.


TL:DR : The game is full of new interesting items, bosses, areas, mechanics, good changes to items that were already in the game and people that are not good at video game are coping at the fact that Isaac is not a easy-baby game anymore and writing bad reviews like: ""eW, tHis gAmE iSn'T fAiR. nO mOrE oP rUnS. i wIlL bEcOmE bAcK mY mOnEy."".

[i][u][b]In conclusion buy this DLC and this game right now.
Like really, buy it or force a friend to gift to you.[/b][/u][/i]"
10711,playing half of the characters makes me want to cry. 10/10
10712,"its sexy on legs
"
10713,"pretty sex, ngl."
10714,This game is fun <3 love it
10715,One of the greatest indie games and one of the best in its genre. Definitely worth a shot.
10716,Bound eye sack
10717,very fun.
10718,"*looks at my -29 winstreak* yea its pretty good i'd say
"
10719,:)
10720,probably the most addictive game ever made
10721,nice
10722,"No game is ever the same, I played many hours on PS4. There is so much more to the PC version!
Don't use MODS until after you defeat MOM. Read the comments, achievements will still count if you do it right. Turn off MODs for daily dungeon."
10723,"Key features: 500 hours of gameplay......Ya right... nearly 800 hours in and still have a long ways to go. And i have loved every single one of those hours. Sure you get frustrated trying to accomplish some of the tasks set out before you, but when you do accomplish it the feeling is just that much sweeter. This game is LOADED with secrets and figuring them out will give you endless hours of enjoyment.... 

So lets do the math here. You have a game rated Overwhelmingly Positive. Said game takes AT LEAST 500 hours. And the full price is 15 dollars US. Soooo that comes to 33 cents per hour. For something so entertaining 33 cents an hour is a no brainer. 

TOTALLY recommended 10/10"
10724,this game is bullshit
10725,This game has been a blast to play since it came out and it's just got better and better over time. Great multiplayer!
10726,it's awesome
10727,good good game good very
10728,Good game
10729,pain
10730,fun
10731,this game is just good. try it
10732,child doing drugs the videogame
10733,beans
10734,poggers
10735,"repentance is an amazing game with great unlocks and unique paths + bosses
it's extremely extensive, and it'll get you addicted while u try to get dead god

only problem i have with the game is greedier mode, which has a ton of flaws. waves can overwhelm you easily, especially as tainted eve who has a low tear rate"
10736,Great game
10737,"very fun very replayable just an overall good game, so much content i love it
"
10738,Isaac and his mother
10739,"The classic roguelike game, and it has that reputation for a reason. It's really good, all the countless items and synergies between them ensure that each run feels distinctly unique. With all of the DLCs adding in so much more amazing content, along with the many many incredible mods you can get for free, you can get endless replayability. Definitely recommend if you enjoy roguelike games that require some time to learn and master."
10740,This is aRT
10741,cool but don't play on keyboard or it glitches
10742,pretty good
10743,"This game is awful and somehow fun at the same time. It's punishing when learning, but it's very rewarding, and as a Roguelike game, it gets it down right. The main concern I have is a lot of do-nothing items, and it can be infuriating to get 2 health upgrades, a shot speed up, and a shot speed and range up as your items. It's definitely worth learning if you love the roguelike genre, and it is my absolute second favourite."
10744,fuck you
10745,"Yeah I put a ridiculous amount of hours into this game, truely one of the best rogue lites, let alone best games ive ever played. Only downside is the developers reluctance to update and fix glaring bugs that have been a part of the game for ages. I gave up on trying to 100% the game because every time I'd fight delerium he'd just freeze at 0% health."
10746,"it be fun or whatever 
"
10747,Booba
10748,"i dont wanna be free i dont wanna be free leave me in luxeryyyyyyyyYYYYYY if i tried to live as good out there, id have to be a thousandaire this is were i wanna grow old, and i just praying i dont make paroll. cause i dont wanna be free"
10749,is fun
10750,One of the best games I've ever played in my increasingly long life.
10751,Played a bit. It's ok.
10752,global warming
10753,"Honestly in my top 3 games of all time, it’s super fun and you can play for hours and get tons of different stuff"
10754,"First off, I want to say this is VERY fun to play, just a little frustrating times. Second, I love this game, the story, the gameplay, even THE MUSIC. The game is VERY chaotic at times (even though I didn't complete it yet.)"
10755,"Absolutely deranged. Gets better as you play more. 

P.S. I refuse to believe the official explanation of what the vis are. We all know what they are."
10756,it's shit
10757,Great game.
10758,i guess it's alright...
10759,This game is equally awesome as it is frustrating.
10760,Have you ever heard of the small indie game The Binding of Isaac created by Edmund McMillen the creator of Super Meat Boy.
10761,no
10762,I don't like the luck needed but that's the reason why the game is unique so I'm fine with it.
10763,best gaem
10764,"You vs your demons.
And your cat died.
Your mom hates you.
Dad left for milk but never came back.
Only God can save your fragile soul.
And also, your uncle awaits you in the next room. 

9/10 still waiting for Dad to come back with milk."
10765,BEst game ever so good that i don't even own it wtf??? i
10766,What is there to say ? This game is a legend !
10767,g
10768,stupid babiy ahahaha he's BALD
10769,"The best addition to Isaac yet, so worth picking up to play"
10770,I love it to bits
10771,"Legendary roguelike. If you are doubting about buying it, please dont. You will not be disappointed."
10772,I like it
10773,Bad game but play everyday. would not recommend for catcholic people or jews.
10774,good game. can waste time on it
10775,"I may have only 20 hours on this profile, but rest assure I still have as much fun as even more rage at RNG bs. 
Recommended if: 
-you got time to waste
-you got keyboards and controllers to destroy"
10776,Best game on steam.
10777,"Only good with repentance
"
10778,I'm a fan now. Bring on the merch!
10779,Buy it
10780,Still a banger of a game in 2022
10781,fun
10782,Good Game.
10783,"I have Godhead, clearly I have no life... but clearly I'm not lacking enough, cause Tainted Lost still exists and that's just a level of suffering I'm ill prepared for."
10784,Gut gam. Very yes! ;)
10785,I'm on the fence on recommending this game as the release of a new slightly improved version of the game every few years is kind of scummy it's a good rogue-like and it has a very agreeable price point in the end. I enjoy it at my play time probably indicates.
10786,balls
10787,fun
10788,cry about it
10789,"I've played this game since the 3ds.
Still keep coming back to rage because of my skill issues."
10790,bitch ass named isaac kills shit
10791,总是遇到突然加速的bug，也没有拿坏表
10792,cool
10793,yeh its pretty good

10800,AMAZING GAME I LOVE
10801,good :)
10802,meanwhile australia is like wtaf mate
10803,"I played Isaac back when Rebirth first came out and racked up easily 1000+ hours on PS4... Right now on Afterbirth+, waiting to complete it before moving onto repentance. Game is honestly incredible, it's such a fun game with MASSIVE replayability(not even sure if that's a word). I couldn't recommend this game enough, even if you only get the base version, you owe yourself a try at this game. The game is challenging, but keep it at and you'll see yourself improve."
10804,Best Game
10805,"fun game
"
10806,Best played with all dlc and mods
10807,"fun
"
10808,"it's fun to break the game but the game is by design terrible. if you do buy it i recommend modding it at least a little bit for qol and content additions, repentance does allow the game to not feel totally like bs but only sometimes"
10809,"love the game, however it will not play at all on my windows 8,1 laptop. how is that even possible"
10810,I hate this game <3 <3 <3
10811,"amazing, love when bald child is bald"
10812,"I've been enjoying this game since the Flash version, I started with the demo on Newgrounds. I love Edmund McMillen's style shining in everything he creates. This game was my first roguelike and has long been my favorite. Even having completed every secret, I can't help but come back to it time and time again."
10813,Amazing game
10814,"Game sucks, its too hard and its not worth it"
10815,its exactly how i remember my childhood
10816,"Got the urge to play this again, game crashes on startup. I've reinstalled, tried all solutions online, all drivers are up to date, AB and AB+ are both installed, still crashes. Absolute joke."
10817,It's my favourite game!
10818,only game that i've never gotten bored of :)
10819,that child is fucked
10820,THE best game I have ever played!
10821,asdf
10822,tHIS GAME IS AMAZING
10823,I'm not even one month into this game and my Youtube recommended is filled with Isaac videos. I need mental help
10824,This game is very addicting but also challenging. It is really cool to find synergy between items.
10825,This game is sick XD
10826,It's just okay.
10827,Takes a while to complete.
10828,game sucks :)
10829,fun
10830,"i've spent a night or two in this game, seems fun idk"
10831,bad
10832,It's ok.
10833,"It is a good game

"
10834,very hard very fun
10835,👍
10836,"DLC content is locked behind way too many goal posts that are way too overly complicated. Even looking up guides on how to unlock WHAT I'VE PAID FOR is still unnecessarily complicated and is just not worth my time. 200+ hours have been wasted on this game and all I've gotten is a few character unlocks and nothing interesting to make my experience worth replaying. The DLC is clearly targeted to those who have actively played this game since day 1, and for that I do not recommend it for new players. There's more forgiving games than this."
10837,hujowe
10838,2022 was too late to pick up a game like this
10839,Fun Game!
10840,"I've played this game for 42 hours at time of writing this review and I've barely scratched the very outermost layer of the surface. This game is a wonderful experience and has rightfully earned its title as the king of rougelites. It is one of the most fun and engaging games I've ever played. I do wholeheartedly recommend buying the dlcs. I purchased Afterbirth+ and Repentance after having the game without them for over 3 years and my playtime with the game over doubled after 4 days. Great game, well worth the money and more importantly the time you'll spend on it."
10841,"very fun, has a lot of re-playablity and the dlcs are a much have that gives you so much more. The repentance dlc gives you the chance to play with friends which is fun and very interesting."
10842,"Pretty awesome game, it's also easier with a remote."
10843,Its nuts go play it
10844,does play is good
10845,"yes
"
10846,"One time I got a bunch of my little poops to follow me. It was adorable.

That should encapsulate this game in its entirety."
10847,"Jesus Loves You Can't You See, He Loves You and He loves me... Jesus Loves You Can't You See, He Loves You and He loves me... Jesus Loves You Can't You See, He Loves You and He loves me..."

10849,siren hot
10850,I've been playing this for 14 hours and I'm not even 15% through the game yayyyy!
10851,Mario 64 yo. (lol)
10852,"I got a few mods and now the game won't work other wise awesome game, love it 10/10
"
10853,it prity gud
10854,SHIT EVERYWHERE
10855,"The game has endless replay value and, while being quite challenging, still is incredibly fun. ive had the game since 2015 have all the DLC, and have spent way too many hours of my life playing it. Thank you Northernlion for introducing me to the game all those years ago, And thanks, Edmund & Nicalis  for making such an amazing game."
10856,twisted my balls
10857,Pretty gud game. Should buy.
10858,"The Binding of Isaac is the gold standard for roguelikes. It is nearly infinitely replayable, and the interactions between items always lead to unexpected fun. I would not recommend buying the complete bundle if you are a first-time player; instead play the base game first and decide from there."
10859,"After finally beating all the bosses with Isaac, I think I'm ready to play one of the other characters!"
10860,"Nice Christian game, my grandma loves it"
10861,<3
10862,very nicee
10863,"This is the game that actively doesn't want you to play it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will scream, and you will die. It has taken years off of my life and prematurely gave me gray hair. 9/10 I gotta go do another run."
10864,ayy this game pretty okay capiche
10865,"very fun good good game yes yes

edit: i hope whoever made the ultra hard challenge, will step on a  lego brick"
10866,good game
10867,"Ive wanted this game for almost as long as its existed. Now that I finally have it, i'm absolutely addicted.
10/10 would reccomend"
10868,Shit of piece game
10869,endless replayability
10870,Such a fun game more you play more you unlock.

10875,epic game
10876,Overrated as fuck lmao
10877,issac
10878,Its okay I guess
10879,"Good Game. Infuriating at times, but amazing enough either way. Edmund may take our fun away sometimes, but I like the challenge, of figuring out how to break the game's frame rate."
10880,I need therapy
10881,"you either annihilate shit, spend 10 hours trying to kill one thing, or get instantly demolished.
love this game"
10882,I absolutely hate this game
10883,I'm going fuckin insane
10884,This game is awesome. Remove Jacob and Esau from the game.
10885,"Game is just a roguelite masterpiece

TL;DR at the bottom
[h2]Good[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Weaponized tears
    [*]Game breaking combos and item generation sequences
    [*]Neat secrets to discover
    [*]Well known rogue
    [*]Tons of mod support (some [i]very[/i] funny mods)
    [*]Good soundtrack
    [*]Dips
    [*]21:9 Support, though the room doesn't display across the entire screen. Menus and side stats will use up the space not occupied by the screen. Large rooms will use the full screen space. https://youtu.be/kKBq0BNshv0
    [*]Fun fights if you aren't fully incapable of dealing damage or sidestepping 
    [*]Can run on just about any semi-modern machine
    [*]Cool challenge modifiers
    [*]Game seeds are shown + can be entered within the game without any external mods (looking at you Noita)
    [*]Excellent controller support, I recommend controller even though I use MnK for all other games
    [*]Local co-op support that isn't splitscreen
    [*]Game is more fun with DLC, could be a positive or negative. Personally, I think its worth the purchase.

    [*]It is an old game, doesn't have many features of newer rogues such as:
                [list]
                [*]dodge/iFrames
                [*]parrying

    [*]Will die a lot, even compared to other rogues
    [*]Co-op mode is a little jank with item spawning (mods can solve that issue)
    [*]Tons of enemies that have attack immunity and can take a while before they become vulnerable
    [*]Para-Bites
    [*]Round Worms
    [*]Spiders (frequent enemies, including a giant spider boss). I'm not arachnophobic, but they are really annoying to deal with. Get practice with them.
    [*]Game is more fun with DLC, could be a positive or negative. Personally, I think its worth the purchase.

10950,decent
10951,"I know this is probably my opinion and maybe a few others, but personally I think this game is super repetitive and is fun at first, but get super boring after a while."
10952,It is a really good rogue-like that is a decent challenge even on normal mode. It's the sort of game where you can get a good run and time dissapears.
10953,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker. You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It's fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."

10955,"Its Isaac, if yk yk"
10956,"By purchasing this game, you are agreeing to dedicating yourself to a permanent state of purgatory and sweet-ass item pick ups.

It's Covid time. No one has a life anymore.
So go on. Buy it, and destroy all sense of linearity in life"
10957,a lot of the game is very good and challenging. the worst part is definitely a handful of the tainted characters

10980,After playing it for almost 600 hours (most of it offline) I can safely say that this game is amazing and horrible if you like 100% games. It will give you mass of content but be careful because you can become addicted to this game very easily. overall 10/10
10981,"its good

10995,lick lick lick my balls!
10996,epic
10997,"Has someone ever recommended a fabulous manga to you, but warned you that the good stuff doesn't start until chapter 500? Well, that's what this game is.

⭐Ultimate replayability. Beat Mom for the first time just means 0.001% is done in the game. Tons of dungeon rooms, deformed siblings, secrets, item drops, and treasure chests that make each run unique.
⭐Crazy item combinations that can actually break the game.
⭐Baranowsky's music.

⚠️There are too many things that the game itself doesn't explain to you, important things like what each item does. You will die a lot and feel that you have not progressed. It is a game that requires patience, something rare these days. It is common among new players to start saying shit about this game simply because Soy Milk came out in the run. Poor guys."
10998,"Masochist game, die over and over and always come back."
10999,good game

11003,i was peer pressured into buying rebirth complete bundle because i play risk of rain 2 and enter the gungeon
11004,"Honestly I'm just trying to complete this game at this point for the 100%. I know Ed's team is too lazy and incompetent to read all the reviews but this game, as of recently (aka repentance as a whole) needs changes. We already need bug fixes, item buffs and over all fan responses MUST be considered. Issac holds a special place in my heart but I've never met a Dev and team the truly hates the fans more to not listen to the real quality of life changes. The community is the only thing making all these bad runs better, I won't recommend this game to anyone until shit is better. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

11025,great game g_g
11026,"I like the early game where things can still be pretty difficult and u can strategize around your limited resources to get an optimal outcome. The late game gets really boring after a while cause most of the time you just melt through rooms on your way to the exit. It's pretty fun to learn about all the content, but to my memory there are a lot of things that are just slight twists on existing things, so a lot of it isn't as unique/special/interesting as it could be. At least the anticipation of an item room never gets old"
11027,"This game in my opinion is the king of all rougelikes, especially if you're looking for challenge. The journey to unlocking everything is very satisfying, this is one of those games where I can proudly display my achievements that I worked so hard for."
11028,Good
11029,"Jacob and Esau is the hardest thing in the universe. Even Dark Souls, No hit, SL1, Fist only, no dodge, no armor challenge is easier. I can only get to caves 1 and 2, and then I die. It is easier to beat the beast with the lost. 10/10 gud game :]"

11036,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

10/10 would die again."
11053,Good game about christianity
11054,"Very hard game, still fun though, I love the challenge it provides me with. 
I don't recommend this game if you get angry from losing though, if that's the case then you're going to get really angry playing this game."
11055,"Very fun and addicting game, especially with with the other DLCs and Mods."
11056,Its an awesome game beginner skill requirement isi'nt to high. Bridge can be built by both luck and some skill and knowledge of the game would recommend a item description mod with how vast the items are that or pull up a wiki.
11057,"I love it. It's better than classic The Bindng of Isaac.

11058,It's alright I guess
11059,"It is WORTH all the money, repentance is really good too with alot more characters to play witch makes for many more possibilitys. VERY NICE GAME"

11084,super fun game
11085,"I think this is one of those games that you either love and give a glowing review and everyone loves you as a result...  Or you don't like the game, don't have a good time, give it a negative review and get hated on by the masses?

In any case, I have played quite a few games like this over the years, some I liked, some I didn't like.   This is one of those games that I just cannot find enjoyment in.

Every time I load it up, I kill a few bosses and I don't have any fun or interesting builds or items.  Just now, I finished killing my 3rd boss and I had a slight range increase to my default weapon and some pants that made anything I touched turned to gold (but I still get hurt in the process).

Compare that with a game like Dead Cells (which I really enjoy) where I can feel a build starting well before the first boss!"
11086,great game. takes getting used to the playstyle compared to other games but once youve played you cant stop
11087,Imagine building a very overpowered character only to die to a stationary fly.
11088,A classic

11113,"Gra jest lekcją pokory; każda pojedyncza [i]wypierdolka[/i], kiedy [i]wykolejasz się[/i] i musisz zaczynać od początku, jest zarówno denerwująca jak i orzeźwiająca. Gra przypomina, że nigdy nie będziesz w niej idealny, a nawet jeśli będziesz, cóż, zawsze możesz się potknąć i [i]rozbić sobie głupi ryj[/i].

Nawet mając grubo ponad tysiąc godzin znajduję nowe pokoje, uczę się nowych rzeczy, niszowych synergii i poznaję co rzadszych przeciwników - ale i to, co znajome, nadal sprawia dużo przyjemności.
Masterowanie bossów które niegdyś były dużym problemem, poznawanie ich patternów, nauka uników, słabości i innych dupereli to masa frajdy i satysfakcji - mało razy miałem okazję doznać tyle adrenaliny co podczas pokonywania Ultra Greediera [spoiler]Tainted Lostem[/spoiler].

Czy polecam The Binding of Isaac? Oczywiście, ale z pewną porcją soli-
jeśli jesteś indywiduałem, który po dostaniu [i]wcirów[/i] nie poddaje się i brnie dalej (coś jak ""jeszcze jedna tura"" w civkach, z tym że ""tury"" - podejścia w isaacu trwają czasem po godzinie 😅) to zmarnujesz na tą grę [b]BARDZO DUŻO GODZIN[/b], mając bardzo dużo zabawy i czasem wspinając się na wyżyny własnego masochizmu.

Warto? Jak najbardziej.
Żałuję? Nie.
Wbiłbym Dead Goda na wszystkich save'ach? Próbuję 😀

Great game 10/10"
11116,"This is probably one of the funniest Roguelikes out there, it's not too hard normally but it can offer a lot of challenge depending on what's your goal and who you're playing as. It has given me countless hours of entertainment and I can't recommend it enough"

I sadly had to start a whole new profile on my steam account (I used to play on xbox) which i was sad about but then i realized it's still fun to start over and unlock everything again! The new DLC has tons of new items and new areas that keep the game fresh and fun!

11133,"I've been playing Isaac off and on over the course of what feels like the last decade.  I have my own personal style of playing, and my entire house has built up a culture of references and memetics entirely related to the  shared experience of playing this game.  It's made me laugh until I hurt, it's made me angry to the center of my being, it's made me cry tears of joy--I've never been so completely moved by a piece of media that also has as much scatalogical as it does.  

Infinitely replayable, brilliantly inventive, kinda retro but remarkable modern. All other top-down games would wish to be this one.  Rogue-likes could all learn something from Isaac's mechanical design.  Could be my favorite game of all time, because even after 700 hours of play there is still so much in it I can and want to do.  

Thank you Ed <3"
11134,Pain :)
11135,"I had some fun. Decent game overall, but I wouldn’t spend too long playing it."

11152,its pretty alright
11153,"A challenging Roguelike game styled after the original Zelda dungeons, with a heavy coat of Religious-trauma-flavored paint. It's dark and gruesome in visuals and story, and said story follows the indie game tradition of being way too fucking vague. It takes time to learn the game's rules, learning some items do more harm than good and that some things are more worth it than one might originally think."
11154,is yes

11164,"If you like strategy mixed with action, dodging and mechanics, you have to try this one. All the items, synergies, characters, challenges, is a full pack for 1000 hours or more."

11213,"I may have not played this game nearly as much as other people, but I still think this is an amazing game. 

Even after over 8 years, it is still a wonder to behold. There's so much replay ability, and the mechanics of the game have been finely filed down into an amazing experience. Although I have not been around for those over 8 years, I wish I was. 

This game is very difficult, and Honestly I found myself holding the R key more times than i'd like to admit. But In the later stages of the game it's totally worth the struggle. There's so much to learn about this game, the little cosmetic Easter eggs, the lore, and even the stats of items.

The workshop for this game is top notch, There's silly stuff, serious stuff, helpful stuff, harmful stuff, you name it. The community around this game I have never found any problems with, at least the part that I'm in.

This game is a masterpiece that I hope will live a long life. I would reccomend this game to just about anyone. 

10/10, and what I think is a perfect example of what i rougelike is."
11214,"This game is just a blast to play, and it really shines in it's replay ability. They somehow managed to turn like 10 or so main mechanics into a game that takes tens of thousands of hours to complete fully, and it stays fun and interesting! Its not without its flaws, obviously. when switching stages all your cosmetics disappear until you fully change floors, the cosmetics overlap and directly interfere with one another, Some item combinations literally break the game (and its not at all hard to do), some items can literally make (quad shot, fist tears.) or break (soy milk, dunce cap.) a run, and boss difficulty might need to be tweaked to proved a smooth difficulty curve, but those are literally ALL the bad things about this game! You can easily do the same things over and over again and they all feel fun! on top of the Drip-Feed of new content as you play like challenges, greed mode, devil and angel rooms, shops, beggars AND arcade rooms constantly provides you with new content! 

TL;DR You will almost never run out of content to play around with. Buy it now."

I have played this game for over six hundred hours, and I only have a third of the achievements, and still suck at this game. I do love it though, and most of the fanbase from this game is pretty great, if I do say so myself. 5/5 stars, 10/10 from something else, IDK. Definitely worth the purchase, I do recommend that you purchase all of the DLC though. It just makes the game so much better. The creators have done some wonders here."

11362,"(The review is written assuming you own all of the DLC, as in my opinion, it's the best way to play the game.)

Overall Rating: 9/10

General Criteria
Gameplay: 5/5 (Very luck based)
Story: Surface level, not much but there is good amount of lore.
Graphics: 4/5
Audio: 5/5 (but resource packs can allow you to do what you want)
Difficulty: Hard. This can sway very easily depending on the character and items you get.
Mod Support: 5/5 (steam workshop)
Recommendation: Buy it on sale. With DLC is too expensive normally.

Review:
Binding of Isaac, one of the most well known Roguelikes. This game has the unique mechanic of using your tears as a weapon, following Isaac as he delves deeper into the basement, facing countless horrors.

The main appeal to this game is the item count and synergies. There is SO MANY ITEMS. Repentance added so many cool and interesting items that the game feels nothing alike from run to run with just how much can go wrong or right. This does mean it's extremely luck based, but alot of that luck comes from making the right decisions and when to make them. smart planning with what you have at your disposal can make godruns. Or you get screwed over by bs. Either way, its rather fun. Starting with only a few items and unlocking a grand majority for reaching various goals or defeating certain bosses as certain characters.

Speaking of characters, there are plenty. 17 normal, 17 tainted versions of the normal character. out of the 34, 33 of them need to be unlocked over time. some easier than others. Almost all the characters have unique play styles from high damage, high health or using various unique mechanics that only certain characters have access to. The tainted characters are more interesting by default.

Overall, a great game to get into roguelikes with. Can be hard at first, but getting a hang of it won't take too long and going for specific unlocks can be interesting. Would recommend trying it. but only get all of it on sale. the asking price for base game+dlc is too much personally."

11366,very poggerss
11367,yes
11368,Its a fun game that I've liked since i found out YouTube existed. And finally getting my hands on it was the best thing ever.
11369,"it's pretty fun, although pretty hard"
11370,How on god's green earth does this game about a 5 year old crying on demons have so much content?
11371,"It's a great game for completionists like myself. 
Here are my thoughts on the different sets of releases or DLC
Rebirth: the base game is pretty challenging, but it's at least balanced well with what you have to get done in it. What I mean by this is that the hardest challenge is just mega satan. No greed mode, no Delerium, no Hush, none of that.
Afterbirth adds some additional challenges that are reasonable and rebalences some of the harder parts of the base game, namely the lost. However it also added the Keeper who is very frustrating.
Afterbirth+ while in many eyes is just ""oh look they added official modding"", to me it's just another extra chunk of content with mods as a bonus. You can never go wrong with mods! Both characters they added are extremely fun to play and not too difficult to play as.

However, Repentance is kind of like a rusty nail through your foot, the changes it makes hurt and it looks like it's from the past. It goes back through the game that everyone was soooo comfortable with and said ""you know what? This isn't hard enough, let me make it bullshit."" Nerfs fucking everywhere for no reason other than, ""it's too easy"". On top of that there are buffs to the difficulty, just outright. 
-Better quality items show up less
-Bullets are faster in hard mode
-The antibirth path is insanely unfair for 80% of runs that you might want to take there.
-20/20 was already rare enough, why did you make it outright worse.
-Too many goddamn characters

Despite all that, I think repentance is fine. If you get the game you should get repentance for the full experience. Have fun!

Just like a lot of rogue-likes its really beginner unfriendly. You either have to master the game or just get stuck in the first couple of floors. If you'd like to play but don't have the time to master the game and get to know all the items I'd recommend watching YouTube let's plays. I got hooked into TBOI from YouTube. Anyway, I still recommend this game. Its really satisfying to know the patterns of enemies and bosses."

11415,There is a reason that so many indie games are rogue likes. That reason is The Binding of Isaac. No other rogue like I've found has had so much replayability. I sank hundreds of hours in the flash based predecessor and I will likely continue to spend hundreds of more hours into this one. Everyone with the stomach for the squick this game thrives in should play it.

11423,"Simply one of the best games in the industry and likely the best roguelike ever. Very high replayability thanks to the uniqueness of every single run, with hundreds of objects and many synergies, the game pushes you to discover new strategies every time.
The content added with repentance is enormous and represents the true crowning of an already very enjoyable game.

The defects are present and in some cases very (even too) evident, but I think it is inevitable with a product of this size and complexity; nevertheless if they were corrected this game would seriously become something close to the concept of perfection."

11511,"After well-over 700 hours of playtime, i've finally decided to write a review on this game.

The Binding of Isaac is a very simple game at its core: walk around a dungeon, shoot at enemies and find power ups in this up-down view roguelike game. But what is it that makes this game so much different and more popular than the rest of its genre? 

I'd say it's the amount of possibilities each run can offer. This game takes the RNG factor and bumps it up by 200%. There are thousands of possible room and floor layouts, with different bosses at the end of each floor, barring out some story relevant ones, and there's an incredible variety with the enemy designs.

Most importantly, there currently is a whopping amount of 722 items in the game if you buy the Repentance DLC, which will also be randomized each run except, again, for a couple of story relevant ones and items that are specifically tied to certain bosses. The items go from simple stat-increasing boons to very powerful power ups that change the way your attacks behave, with some even acting as double-edged swords. Many items will also have specific synergies between each other, leading to powerful (and sometimes unexpected) reactions between them, which means two items that are weak alone might become very powerful when combined! Sadly, the opposite can also happen, but i consider that part of the fun. In other words, you can have fun by watching how every item interacts with another and feel like a god when you get powerful combos.  

The game also has ways to interact with the environment, such as secret rooms, obstacles that can be manipulated and semi-hidden resources (like money in dried-up beggars). 

In addition to that, there's 34 playable characters who, similarly to items, go from simple stats+starter item shuffles (if you consider Isaac as the default character) to characters with a unique playstyle and properties that will make you feel like you're playing an entirely different game. 

When you combine all of those things, you get a game that will heavily reward the player's knowledge. Infact, even though most of the game is left to RNG, you will be able to make your life easier simply through experience and knowledge, which means even the weakest looking run can be turned around with some knowledge and just a sliver of luck, leading to incredibly satisfying wins.

Mechanical skill also plays a huge factor while playing The Binding of Isaac, as enemies will progressively become faster and faster and fire at the player character in somewhat complex patterns that will make the game will like a bullet hell at times. This means that even though the game movement system is incredibly simple (a generic WASD directional movement), you will need a good deal of reflexes and sharp, precise movements to avoid getting cornered or overwhelmed by projectiles. 

Replayability is the keyword in this roguelike because, other than the incredible variety each run can offer, the game will also reward you for clearing each major boss with each character with new unlocks, in the form of items, new characters and new resources! This means you'll reach 700 hours (or even more) of playtime without even realizing it. As a side note, each major boss will add something to the game's story, which isn't much but it's quite interesting and leaves many things vague on purpose, making it very fun to think up theories on.

The runs rarely being longer than 40 minutes mean it's also the perfect game to play during breaks, and you can also quit mid-run without losing progress.

I think it wouldn't feel right to not mention the incredible workshop support this game has to offer. Infact, if you're not satisfied yet with all the fun content this game has to offer, you'll be able to freely download mods that can either customize your game appearance by improving graphics (or making them more memey) and sound effects or add new characters, items and game mechanics made for the players by other players.

Sadly, this leads to the shortcomings of this amazing game. Basing myself off what i've seen by introducing my friends to The Binding of Isaac, new players will find themselves overwhelmed by an absurd amount of items and enemies they've never seen, which will inevitably lead them to dying at the very first floors of the game. The game does less than the bare minimum to explain pretty much anything outside of the main controls, with very short and oftentimes useless item descriptions. Yup, that's right; if you're a new player you will find yourself in situations where you'll stumble upon an item you've never seen, pick it up and ask yourself ""What does this do though?"" after reading a mildly entertaining item description that actually explains nothing about how your item works. It goes without saying that many new players will find all of this discouraging and might drop the game while feeling confused. Thankfully, there's some mods that help new players without making the game directly easier like the item descriptions mod, which i consider a must for players who just started and don't want to check the wiki after every find or experience the game the old way. In any case, i consider almost every item to be unique and/or simple enough to not warrant the mod or the wiki (except for very niche stuff) after sinking some time into the game.

Another very controversial point in the community regards some parts of the game's design. Most enemies will behave erratically by nature, making it very hard and sometimes impossible, to dodge their attacks. This wouldn't be an issue normally; after all this is what health upgrades are for right? Except there's a couple of characters who will die in one or two hits, which will make you feel like the game is expecting you to be perfect whilst the game itself is not. On the topic of challenging characters, there might be controversial opinions on hard (and according to some players, unfun) characters being tied to unlocks, which will make you feel forced to play them in order to have the full item pool unlocked, but since this is a very subjective topic i'll leave this part to the reader's discretion. 

In conclusion, The Binding of Isaac is a must have for roguelike lovers, but i also recommend it to people who are just interested in a fun game. The hardest part it getting through the ""i've just started and i can't understand what's going on"" part, but if you do, you will be rewarded by a challenging classic that will offer you hundreds of hours of entertainment."
11512,"this is the worst game i have ever played

10/10"
11513,DON'T EVER TALK TO ME ABOUT THE BINDING OF ISAAC!
11514,"Dangerously addictive. Only started Isaac when repentance came out and now I can't stop playing. Good for that RNG dopamine chase, progression that seems to never end, every run is different etc

Highly recommend anyone that likes anything similar to this genre of games and anyone that wants what can be a chill game to pass the time, really for everyone. But expect your gaming ego skill to be smashed if this is your first time trying out a game like this lol."

11544,"This game is a huge success for me because of three factors:  
1) Scalability - the game is very accessible for casual gamers and yet it scales very well for experienced players;
2) Replayability - the game has so many permutations of game style, equipment and character that it provides players with a huge variety of game outcomes to experience;
3) Updates - game developers have gone above and beyond to refresh and extend the game which only accentuates the positives listed above."

11560,"Holy shit (quite literally when talking about this game), what an addicting game. I feel like I have barely scratched the surface at this point and I am nearing the 100 hour mark soon.

11568,azazel crutch
11569," just some a bit challenging and mostly fair game
if you're a tryhard - try flash version of isaac instead 

if you found a bug, there are already a mod that fixes it. And the game updates... Sometimes(but you need to have all the DLCs, this is how the game works)

and there are a lot of dumb, hilarious and actually cool mods in workshop, so even if you have completed the game 3 times you'll(most likely) not get bored. Just don't spend all of your spare time on it ;)"

11575,"LMAO guys look at how dark and brooding i am, it's a dead baby LOL. Holy shit, this game is so fucking disturbing. Look at this; it's a noose item, get it? because the kid kills himself? how about... razor blade item?? Very macabre, very spooky. How about big scary spider that lives in your head and rips your head off when you take damage even?!?! I am so fucking morbid and unique. Get it? Religion is bad, poop is funny. Jesus, I'm so fucking artistic. I'm seriously so fucked up because of my dark childhood; everything in this game basically happened to me. This binding of isaac is just a glimpse into my dark reality. A full stare into my twisted perspective would make most normies simply go insane. Normies, GTFO; this game is only for real goth brooders, you wouldn't get it."

11585,"I recommend this if you want something with a huge amount of content, low RAM and graphics card usage and a small amount of storage required. This game is a little difficult at times, but I personally think it's worth it because of how much fun it is. If you like the idea of looting and defeating enemies then this is a great game to try especially at its price. I don't recommend getting any DLC's unless you really like this game (plus you won't lose anything if you buy the DLC's separate from the main game.)"

11593,"Roxanne Wolf is so hot. Never in the history of gaming has there been a hotter character. She is more than a robot wolf to me, she is a person. She is a little tease but she's basically my wife. The devs know what they did with that wolf. The aesthetic paired with her demeanor make her such an attractive character. Nothing gets me going better than a punk rock wolf chick. Every inch of her is so hot. Her thighs up to her midriff and her eyes. Every inch of her is perfection incarnate. I would save the game and let her catch me just to feel the intimacy between us. I crave more than lustful fantasies with her, I seek deep romantic involvement. The craftsmanship of her character surpasses everything I expected from this game. Her tone of voice and language choice formats her character. The choice of clothes with short shorts and the crop top which reveal her milky thighs and delectable midriff compliment her punk rock personality more. She is my wife, and nothing dissuades me from this"

11637,"Ive been watching content on this game since i was 9 years old, back then rebirth had just came out. Ever since, ive been addicted to issac and its concepts before i ever even touched the game myself i knew every item, trinket, effects, and how to cheese the game in a multitude of ways. Nothing prepares the player for the game itself, as the highs are mighty high, but the lows are sometimes unspeakable. I originally had the game on switch when i was 13 and the afterbirth + boosters had just started coming (17 now) out i had an awesome time trying to beat the completion marks for every character. but now ive recently (since repentance came out) started playing on pc for the first time, between floods and hurricanes, work, and life in general i havent had much of a chance to play the game until a few weeks ago, and coming back now on a fresh save file feels quite overwhelming, and im sure other new players with a working knowledge of the game feel the same, that the odds seem insurmountable when it comes to unlocking every completion mark on 32 characters. but after a few amazing runs in a row i remember why i fell in love with this game, the same way i fell in love with it all those years ago. you wade through a lot of shit, blood, piss, jank, and trash items, dying from bull shit, lots of screaming, and sometimes just staring at your screen in pure confusion, but its all worth the while, when you get into the groove, find some good items, abuse rng, finagle your way to a decent load out. I think that is a big part of issac for a lot of people the entire history of the game can be summarized in just a few words honestly ""lots of shit and sometimes sacred heart"" but one truth holds evident for many. Its not about the destination, its the journey. so to all the new players out there, overwhelmed and confused, kick back, fail a few runs, and become back for that dub."

11672,"This game beats me down to the point that I feel broken and unworthy to receive love in any form. 

Highly recommend."
11673,It's more like a habit than a game.
11674,this game kinda meh
11675,This game copied enter the gungeon. very sad. an alpha gamer like me will never play this game for 65 hours. yeah I get girls and this game gets drool.
11676,I've got over 1000 hours in this game and im still shit at it
11677,fun challenging and infinite possibilities so it never gets old
11678,is good
11679,It's ok
11680,A great retell of childhood
11681,Unforgiving and addicting
11682,It is a game I play. It is also fun and stuff. Stop harassing me to review games thanks..
11683,"i thought it was weird how easy it was to get to what i thought was the final boss. then i kept playing. this game is huge. it was not the final boss.
super fun, ton of stuff to do, easy to lose track of time when your playing. 10/10"
11684,yea
11685,A must play for every christian as myself included
11686,v fun v good
11687,"It's ok, i personally enjoy these types of games."
11688,"yeah it fun I just beat the first boss in this game
"
11689,it good
11690,"holy shit this fucking game is SO FUCKING GOOD. play this shit. its fun, the story is great, its not one of those meta indie games that is saturating the indie market. PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
11691,"Great game with lots of content, many hours of playability and"
11692,fun
11693,"played a bit, gud game"
11694,video game
11695,Its wacky with wacky features. It has amazing unlocks and cool characters. There's so many secrets and so many items that work together to make incredible synergies. hope you enjoy it!
11696,One of the best rogelike games.
11697,super addictive roguelike game with mystery dungeon elements and endless content perfect for short and long sessions since you can pause/save anytime you want
11698,I miss my dad.
11699,roguelike but made really good
11700,"Best Rogue Like game ever after Hades ofc. SO mant combinations , so many funny items and so many enemies and the plot and the story is funny but also has some hidden meanings overall very good game."
11701,You probably won't finish this game
11702,Gud
11703,Good time sink when bored.
11704,GOTY
11705,This game is straight up ez but when u buy the dlcs it will shit on you in a good way tho but this game has bad angel deals so 0/10
11706,"Severe item bloat, challenges that are anti-fun and unlocks that have zero respect for your time.

Unless you're a masochist (like me, but there comes a point when the bullshit is too much), there are other roguelites similar to this with far better design philosophy."
11707,it's alright
11708,Great game with lots of replay value

11718,game is big F U N N I
11719,NO MONKEY THO
11720,Classic
11721,"It can take a while to get into this. There is a learning curve - understand what each perk does, monster acts etc. Even after 200 hours, I struggled - but there is a mod available on the store that simply adds text to tell you what each item does. This greatly helps and I recommend.

Other than that, the game is great. The RNG is brilliant and it is incredibly creative. It doesn't need internet connection so is a great downtime game - although you'll get addicted anyway."
11722,based
11723,"small boy cries at his problems thus fixing everything

so remember when life presents you with problems

just cry"

11763,"Nothing wrong with gameplay or FPS or whatever, just randomly started crashing after I tried to enable some basic API mods now it crashes on startup. The game then hid the mod files from me so I couldn't delete them. Tried every fix, doesn't display in This PC/Documents/My Games, can't delete files now, no mod folder when going to steamapps in Files. Unplayable"
11764,Great game! this bad boy can fit so much variety in it.

11779,child abuse
11780,I can really relate with Isaac
11781,"Definitely helped fill my void after finishing Enter the Gungeon.
My only gripe is that it barely tells you anything about the items. (Mitigated by the internal item descriptions mod)"
11782,It's good.
11783,"this game is genius. the amount of secrets, combinations, 400+ items i dont remember how much of them but this game based around bible and holy and dark that is such a cool topic like when you enter the cathedral and the holy music starts playing you understand that is a powerful place! my favorite version is afterbirth, but i play afterbirth+ its almost the same but good too."
11784,":(

Edit: (shit game)"
11785,fun game lots to do
11786,"v good.

11797,trash game
11798,"Finally reached 1,000 hours in this game. I have been a fan since The original Binding of Isaac and this game is one of my all-time favorites. This is a game I can come back to and sick weeks of my time into at any time. The DLC is worth every penny. Couldn't recommend this game more."

11818,little baby boy cries a lot
11819,Let the hours speak for themselves.
11820,"I've never both hated and loved a game with such intensity at the same time. Binding of Issac is the current king of the Rogue Like genre, with easy to pick up but difficult to master twin stick shooter controls and an endless supply of items, enemies, and characters. Even when you complete the endless hours of new content they've added up through repentance the modding community has a whole library of custom content for veterans that want a fresh experience."
11821,Really good game
11822,fuck tainted jacob
11823,"When I get to heaven and look God in the eyes... I will thank him for breathing life into humanity; my gratitude, however, is solely for the creation of this game, as it has sucked the soul out of my body and the hours out of my youthful years

11834,clueless dev ruined the game with latest DLCs

11843,yes
11844,absolutely great game its extra hard though and has many diffrent endings
11845,deez
11846,"good game, Im 42 hours in and it feels like I just started

11853,boi
11854,"This game is so good, now i can say it, i played it for 17 hours but i played it before, it's a rule breaker game, not like all, u walk between the rooms and shooting without bullets but a tears, but if you pick good  items mabe you shoot laser, i have no reason to stop playing this scary game but add more fun items  ps for new players, dont pick up ipecac when u have bad computer."
11855,very
11856,"Finally, a way to weaponize depression. 9/10"
11857,you'll get addicted directly after your first run

11860,Simply a skill issue
11861,one of the best roguelikes to ever exist.

11869,one word I can describe for this game would be... epic.
11870,I hate this game so much I get shitty/no items at the start but don't get hit at all and no fu rooms. fast forward I get kinda okay items and am getting hit by fucking dingles... 10/10 cant stop playing
11871,good game but when do we get the gun update?
11872,"This game is a legendary rogue lite dungeon crawler. Every run you do is in some way unique and new and this allows for so many new experiences, even though you can replay the same characters. Binding of Isaac is challenging enough to require development of skills and strategy with the combination of fun to keep you hooked for hours. The DLC's each bring unique additions to the base game and enrich the amount of uniqueness and challenge you can choose. I would say this is a timeless classic now that everyone should try at least once."
11873,Best game. Best game. 10/10 - some jewish guy i think

10/10 its good unless you get Breakfast."
11881,"Played this a ton more on xbox. Gonna check out the bible now. Sure do I feel great about spending hundreds of 100's playing this? No, but it got me threw a cold winter I guess. Didn't like it much at first but it grows on you."

11889,"Difficult, Rewarding, Insightful"
11890,"I love it.
This game runs well on both my machines and cloud saves make it a great on-the-go game.
Perhaps the best local co-op game on steam?"
11891,It is very fun! But also challenging. Only play if you're ready for a challenge!
11892,nof
11893,gud
11894,"This beautiful creation of a game causes me to rage quit after meeting my demise to something absolutely out of my control, and I then decide that this game is a huge waste of time.

An hour later I always find myself crawling back to Isaac excited to see what insane synergy I can obtain to crush the boss that just shafted me."
11895,Best rougelike out there. Been playing since 2014.
11896,"Slow progression as you learn the game.

Overall addicting and enjoyable with the plethora of items to obtain/use.

Would recommend"
11897,"I've been playing this game on and off for years, pick it back up every time there's an expansion. I don't know what better recommendation I can give it than my total play time. Everything this game does, it does very well."
11898,The best game i've ever played

11914,"very nice, haven't seem my family for 2 weeks."
11915,"If you have times on your life, don't spend it on this game"
11916,one of the best rogue like games 👍
11917,game is great but little tip for everyone who wants to play this game: do not play blue baby. just dont put yourself through that please god
11918,"i''ve played the Binding of issac almost religiously for years. This game can be practically played forever. Can definitely be played however you wish. Sometimes I play without sound and listen to podcasts or music. The soundtrack itself is grand, but I enjoy it my own way, You can stop whenever. Worth purchasing especially if you like or need distractions. The story can be a bit hardcore when it comes to its themes of religious idolization, child abuse, and mental health. So just a trigger warning."
11919,"this game is a 4 way shooter where bullets are tears
there are many items to upgrade your tears
there are trinkets with a chance to effect your tears
DO NOT PICK UP TICK

11940,"Prolly my most favorite roguelike, lots of unlockable content and replayability.
Has many darker and morbid tones, so not for everyone, but is still a great game nonetheless."
11941,"i feel so incredibly uncomfortable playing this game for some reason, but its why i keep coming back to it. i havent played a lot of it, but i know i'm going to play a lot more when i get deep into it."
11942,"Pure unending fun, refunded it at first because I thought my reflexes weren't good enough but after giving it a second chance I started getting the gist of it to the point I've beaten several challenges, totally recommended especially for those who don't have much time to play games."
11943,"good
"
11944,its okay i guess
11945,"very pog its easy at the start but once u beat ur mother a couple times, then the real pain begins"

11992,"After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy[a] will go over there and worship and come again to you.” 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. 7 And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together.

9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14 So Abraham called the name of that place, “The Lord will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”

15 And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven 16 and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his[d] enemies, 18 and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.” 19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba."

She is a little tease but she's basically my wife. The devs know what they did with that wolf. The aesthetic paired with her demeanor make her such an attractive character. Nothing gets me going better than a punk rock wolf chick. Every inch of her is so hot. Her thighs up to her midriff and her eyes. Every inch of her is perfection incarnate. I would save the game and let her catch me just to feel the intimacy between us. I crave more than lustful fantasies with her, I seek deep romantic involvement. The craftsmanship of her character surpasses everything I expected from this game. Her tone of voice and language choice formats her character. The choice of clothes with short shorts and the crop top which reveal her milky thighs and delectable midriff compliment her punk rock personality more. She is my wife, and nothing dissuades me from this"

Absolutely buy this game, especially if you are into roguelikes, and bullet hells, because this game has got all of that and more."

12055,"The Binding of Isaac is a pretty incredible story of indie game success. Originally released in 2011, it was part of the indie roguelike boom, but its combination of seemingly limitless variations alongside its charming, scatological style and deep cut Biblical references helped it stand above the rest.

Ten years later, and The Binding of Isaac: Repentance is yet another full game-sized DLC that provides dozens more hours of this deceptively difficult bullet hell game.

Repentance doesn't add anything particularly game-altering to the formula; it's not going to win you over if you don't like this style of roguelike. What it does do, however, is add huge amounts of content to the already massive base game (and other DLCS) that is The Binding of Isaac.

On top of that, there's some even more hardcore endgame content, including a series of new, game-breaking characters to unlock. Not bad for $15.
If you're totally uninitiated, let's catch you up real quick. 

The Binding of Isaac is a top-down roguelike that has some elements of old-school action and bullet hell games. Also, glancing at a few screenshots might remind you of exploring dungeons in the original Legend of Zelda. You move between rooms, collecting items and fighting enemies, eventually reaching a boss and descending to a new floor.

It's a simple concept that anyone who has played video games can learn in a hurry.

Things start to pick up with the roguelike elements. As you delve further and further, enemies and bosses get insanely difficult. You must scale yourself in order to stand a chance, and some of the combos you find throughout your runs are ridiculous. You'll put together combinations that make you practically impossible to kill, and you'll shred through even the most difficult of bosses. On other runs, a few mistimed movements mean your health will be taken down by a single foe.

On top of all that, there's a bonkers story that straddles the line between ""This has to be a joke"" and ""Is it?"" You are a child named Isaac (or one of his other Biblically named friends), and your mother is slowly driven insane. One day, when she tries to kill you, you flee into your basement. Or, maybe not. There's a ton of backstory and lore going on here, and lots of little hints at the true nature of what's happening.

Which brings us to The Binding of Isaac: Repentance. This DLC is, at its heart, taking a recent fan mod and sprucing it up for an official release. The big draw here is the endgame content: there is a new ""official"" final area, including new bosses and endings. There are also two brand new characters and a ""tainted"" variation of every character in the game, many of which offer completely new playstyles and wildly powerful abilities.

Essentially, Repentance brings the game's playable character count up to nearly three dozen.

The Binding of Isaac: Repentance also completely reworks co op mode. Instead of additional players joining as the co op ""babies"" from previous versions, Repentance allows up to four people to join in as actual characters. This changes The Binding of Isaac in a huge way, and the screen becomes extremely chaotic.

Finally, there's just more of everything: over 100 new items and enemies, new bosses, new environments, new challenges, achievements... there is a ton of new stuff in Repentance.

That's always been the joy of The Binding of Isaac, though. There is so dang much that even after hundreds of hours of play, you're likely to find new combinations and interactions, unlock new items, and find new ways to slam your head down in frustration after dying during a particularly late-game boss. Things are made even more unfair in Repentance, but the fun comes in finding your own perfect builds to counter the game's steep challenge.
Luckily, not everything new in Repentance is confined to the late game. You start encountering new enemies and environments from the very beginning, though getting to most of those new playable characters takes some serious slaying skills. Unlocking tainted characters and successfully challenging the new final bosses is no easy feat and should provide a challenge to even the savviest of Isaac fans.

It isn't hard to recommend Repentance to anyone: hardcore fans of The Binding of Isaac probably are already sweeping through it. If you've never played Isaac or it's been sitting dormant in your library for a while, grabbing some new DLC and giving it a whirl will suck you right in. 

For $15, you'll add dozens of more hours to an already spectacular game. What's not to love?"

12062,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is the definitive edition of this amazing rougelike dungeon crawler. Kind of. For the fullest experience, be sure to pick up the various DLC expansions, but even just the base game offers hundreds of hours of entertainment. The gameplay loop is enjoyable, and their are more than enough rooms, items, and enemies to keep things interesting on every run. This game is a great entry point to rougelikes, and a time-tested classic for those more familiar with the genre."

12092,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an indie roguelike video game designed by Edmund McMillen and developed and published by Nicalis. It is a remake of the original Binding of Isaac and is an overall better better game than the original with multiple new bosses, items, floors and enemies! This remake of course contains content from the original Isaac title and its DLC Wrath of the Lamb and original content. On its own this game is amazing and is deserving of your money, but it is expanded on even further with its 3 great DLC; Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, and Repentance. This game is addictive and you will sink 100's of hours trying to complete this game. 8/10 The best rougelike ever made."

12102,"Basically a twin stick shooter that takes place in the mind of a disturbed child. Very gross, so don't expect to talk to your friends at work about it.
""What game you playin rn""
""Binding of Isaac""
""What do you do in that game""
""You shoot your tears at poop and aborted fetuses while slowly becoming a sin against God""
Drip drip goes the water cooler.

The main draw of the game for me personally is that all the items you collect combine with each other (for the most part) to make things like The Piss Laser, The Floating Psychic Bone, and The Knife Barrage Move from Castlevania.
Indeed, I collect all items I see during a run just to see what happens. Some players are like, Never pick up these 30 items, I'm like, Nah, pick up everything! You just might end up with The Screen-Sized Sticky-Bomb Coin that is Bright Red for Some Reason.
Except Cursed Eye. Don't pick up Cursed Eye."

12179,This is my most favourite game I have ever played. To the point this game is associated with me. I love the fact that there is a daily run so you can time yourself against others who also play throughout the world. The latest Repentance instalment really has created thousands of more hours of game play. You can play this game for years and still learn something new on each run. It's simple enough to play but can also be super challenging.
12180,great game really messed up graphics i love it

12224,"Addicting, very very addicting."
12225,"The Binding of Isaac is a masterpiece. I first discovered this game when Repentance came out and a Youtuber I watch played it. I quickly became hooked and I have been avidly watching TBOI content ever since. I bought this game a few months ago and I've played it for 150 hours, with the plan to play much more.

If you don't know anything about this game, it is a top-down view procedurally generated rogue-like in which Isaac collects items in order to progress through rooms and floors. There is a boss each floor, and many final bosses (most of which have to be unlocked). The story is quite intriguing, but is purely optional for those who skip cutscenes. 

This game is quite challenging, but once you play for a while it becomes extremely satisfying to dodge attacks you used to die to and win runs you would've lost before. There is endless content in this game, as the progression and unlock system is very long and you can play infinite runs even after you complete the 637 achievements. I find myself planning what unlocks to go for next in order to optimize my playtime, and I am really enjoying the game. 

This game has a lot of Biblical imagery and references, but I don't think it's either for or against Christianity or religion as a whole. I am a Christian and it made me hesitant to play it at first, but I think the message is more ""Be wary of how your actions affect your children"" than ""religion bad"". If the intro cutscene makes you uncomfortable, wait to the Mom's Foot cutscene and after. God is not portrayed as a villain, Isaac's mom is. 

I hope this review was helpful! This is, by far, my most played and most enjoyed game. I hope you enjoy it too!"
12226,WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SHIT
12227,"Smooth, consistent, and fun gameplay. Trying to complete runs as the lost is painful though."

12291,"Too bloody hard with almost zero sense of reward

This review is based on the game plus all DLC

I liked:
+ The disgusting yet oddly cute aesthetic
+ Some of the music

I disliked:
- NO FREAKING EASY MODE
- Damage sponge enemies
- Unrewarding gameplay loop - okay sure, I unlocked two characters - but both of them kinda suck.

I regret spending money on this game, and cannot recommend buying it. If you MUST experience it, try to do so without paying, e.g. Steam Family Sharing."

12293,"it's a pretty hard game, if you're preyyu good at games that have many enimies you encounter, which all mostly have projectiles or just ram into you, this is the game for you. every room in the game in randomly generated by a seed, making impossible to memorize the rooms (unless you have the seed) so this ame is a 10/10 for me"
12294,"This game exceeded my expectations and then some. If you do happen to buy the game, buy it with all the DLCs bundled

There are so many THINGS in the game:

-There are a bunch of stages, alt stages, and alt alt stages.

- 102 bosses and 20 mini-bosses. The main bosses are made very well, and the late game ones have the game turn into a huge bullet hell. 

- If I am reading the wiki correctly, there are over 700 items in the game. Personally I cannot attest to how balanced they are since I haven't unlocked them all, but the ones I do have unlocked fit the game perfectly and make up some amazing synergies. The amount also lends to a bigger variety in your runs as well.

- 45 challenges that are basically gimmick runs. You beat one you get an item. Some are infuriating but you don't have to do them since there is more than enough broken items. But you could unlock some snazzy item that can boost run variety just a bit more.

- 14 characters to unlock along with 3 hidden ones. You can double the roster by unlocking their ""tainted"" versions, where each character plays very differently. 

- Speaking of characters, each and everyone of them have ""marks"" to collect. The marks are the same for each character, and you get them by completing milestones with said characters. For example, if you beat a boss with Isaac, then Isaac gets a mark in the character selection. If you beat the same boss with Maggy, then she gets that mark as well. It's important to note that the marks are also affected by the difficulty they are completed on. Good luck getting all the marks for all 34 characters (normal and tainted combined) 

-Normal mode and Hard mode. Personally, I recommend starting with hard. If things are just not working out then lower it till you get some more item unlocks. maybe even work out some challenges.

-Greed mode is pretty bad in all honesty. Limiting freedom and easily breakable, this mode can either be a boring grind or a boring grind.

-Mods are useful and add a lot to the experience. If you don't want to look up the wiki constantly, then external item descriptions is your savior. Plus some funny stuff and QOL that helps you become back your money quick.

-Misc: 600+ achievements, completing all final bosses, great music, downright gorgeous stage graphics at points, and local CO-OP that functions fairly well.

I once again am asking that if you do buy this game, consider buying all the DLC as well. They each add so much, and are 100% worth the money."

12304,"Definitely recommend this game (or whatever the current version is).   To me its still the quintessential indie action roguelite.  Very simple, but with a lot of depth and replay value.  The art style and story is very Newgroundsy, irreverent, immature, but still funny and interesting.  The rest of the review is just me complaining, but don't let it discourage you, it's a good game overall.

My biggest criticism is that the game really favors a good start.  Once you get a good sense of what the items do, you'll realize that there are a lot of items you just don't want to see early, and consequently there's a really strong incentive to reset the game.

Most roguelikes have this to some extent.  Getting an advantage (e.g., a strong item or power-up) early can usually be leveraged to get more advantages that would otherwise be unavailable.  In most roguelikes, with a good start you can usually breeze through the game.  With a bad start the game can feel crushing and unfair.  I feel like it's a little more egregious in Isaac than some other roguelikes though.

It's not that you mathematically can't win if you don't find good items.  Even with some really bad rolls you can probably get to an ending.  But the game can be a serious slog if you don't pick up some good stuff early.  When you walk into a room with 20 enemies, it's fun to 1-3 shot each enemy; it's tedious to 5 shot them.  Bosses are similar.  Each boss has fairly basic attack patterns, which is fine when you can clear a boss in a minute or two.  Its not so fun when it takes five minutes of holding the fire key and dodging the same attacks over and over because you didn't find any damage pickups.

Other than that, great game."

all the DLC is incremental in isaac, so to buy Repentance (which you should) you need to buy all the DLC before it first. so that's Afterbirth and Afterbirth+
Oh and a lot of people say that AB+ is a bad expansion, so in my opinion, either buy all of the DLC or none of it"

Partially because of this lack of a tutorial, there is a satisfying level of progression."

This most recent DLC added a whole new dimension of progress as well as rebalancing old things that didn’t work well. If you've never played this classic roguelike or have taken a break on it for a while I feel there's no better time to get into it. Isaac with Repentance is my favourite game of 2021."
12441,"well, yeah"
12442,"very fun, and very hard"
12443,best roguelike i have played
12444,damn isaac needs to do a lot of hard work

12457,perfect game
12458,"So far I have played it for just over 10 hours and it just has so much charm I want to keep playing. When I die, I just restart and go again, time just flies by, one minute it is 11pm when i purchased it, the next minute it's 4am and I am now going to be late for everything the next day! I clearly have barely scratched the surface, I just went to buy all of the DLC's and Steam asked me to review it.

I know It has been out for some years now and I am late to the party, but all my friends are enjoying watching me Stream it for them, and they all like to try to inform me on different elements, often leading to my demise!"
12459,Sztos gierka
12460,can i have HOLY CARD
12461,one of the best 2D games out there
12462,"I love this game so much, so many things to do and the story is actually nice. You can't get bored while playing Isaac."
12463,"Edmund McMillen, You litte F**ker You made a sh*t of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker"
12464,"Edmund McMillen, You litte Fυcker You made a shlt of piece with your trash Issac it’s fυcKing Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker"
12465,its ok ig
12466,"I've bought it on every conceivable platform I own. It melts my pc, my lap top, my playstation, my switch, and at the end of the day my spirit too. I would buy it on a Samsung smart fridge if I could. I would buy it on my dog. I don't have a dog, but I'd get one if Isaac was playable on it. I want to upload my consciousness and become a part of a DLC for this game."
12467,"Every run feels different and fun with the different combinations of powerups you can pick up, some are hilariously OP and some will ruin your day (Many of which makes you change the way you play). There's a lot of RNG involved in getting good stuff for your runs, ultimately general knowledge of the game gives you a better edge than skill alone which probably looks like this:
Knowledge: 70%
RNG: 15%
SKill: 15%
It suffers the same learning experience as chess wherein to get good you'll need to learn what happens behind the scenes and how the game works in general, once you figure that out it gets easier such as knowing where to find hidden rooms for each level or when to or not take some risky choices. Learning this on your own without assistance is very taxing but rewarding if you're up for the challenge but once you're hitting a -100 winstreak you should probably reach out for help.
If you aren't ready to commit to learning the game then I suggest you stay away from this one because you'll most likely not get anywhere."
12468,"This game is awesome, the randomness and the pgs make it the best"
12469,3/10
12470,yeah its ok
12471,its ok

12477,This game is absolutely amazing!
12478,funny crying baby kills monsters with face water while birth mother commits post birth abortion. Also religion. In summary game fun

12481,"the game's pretty much infinite and filled to the brim with acheivements to unlock and characters, and even the tainted ones have a challenge to them. 10/10 would recommend. :)"
12482,game good
12483,"This game is the gold standard of twin-stick roguelites.  Often imitated, never duplicated.  Sorry your shots don't go diagonally (note: I invite comments on this review telling me the two items that can make your shots go diagonally).  The music's good, the DLC is all good (except for the bad DLCs), the systems all interact.

This game is the Michael Jordan of twin-stick roguelites, the Top Gun of twin-stick roguelites.  Play it or, I dunno, continue living in a cave?

Warning: Game has super mature themes like poop and child death.  If these themes upset you, you're too mature for this game, please don't play it.  Buy it, but don't play it.

The creator of this game is an idiot, as well.

10/10 Legendary"
12484,Iz good.
12485,"Solid game. Unwieldy controls, irritating enemies, limited resources to understand it, yet i still very much enjoy it."
12486,even though i have nit played this game as much as other people i can confirm that this game is amazing.  everything so far from the art direction sound design and music is phenomenal. I would highly recommend this game if you like rouge likes.
12487,very good
12488,"I enjoyed the items that are obtained and their immersion into a feeling of UNLIMITED POWA. Each run allows for a new perspective and different experience with its randomly generated dungeons. Binding of Issac has wonderful ominous waltz soundtrack.

The only draw back is that some runs give you absolutely useless rng and your run can be ruined from a string of bad draws."
12489,After 10000 playthroughs you end up forgetting how disturbing this game's premise is.
12490,one of the guys poops and that's pretty funny
12491,"Great game, you can be a child again, literally."
12492,I love the item mechanic and how they come together to create a stronger weapon than any of the individual pieces.
12493,It really makes you feel like the Isaac
12494,"It's extremely good. I put about 600 hours in, 500 of those after Repentance. If you feel it's difficult, just keep playing. You'll get a lot more tools, and Repentance is in general a vastly better game than the previous versions. Thanks for all the fun, Edmund!"
12495,"fun
"
12496,very pog
12497,Play the game or else
12498,"They have true Four Player co-op (in the DLCs I think) and it's a great addition, fun to play with friends."
12499,"Very fun, great sense of progression. Can become tedious if you get further into the game."

12502,Has the world seriously become so indifferent to pain and suffering that twisted games like this are now fun? Anyone saying this is art needs to see a shrink.
12503,funi
12504,Every single game is different and enthralling each time. I absolutely love this game and unlocking new items throughout my progress
12505,"When I first picked up Binding of Isaac, I had lost interest in it after a bit as I had thought the gameplay wasn't my forte and would be to hard for me to get used to. Eventually watching streamers play it brought me back to give it another go.

And thank goodness that I did, as once I got the hang of it, I started enjoying the game immensely! I enjoy the art, the music, and the challenging and constantly growing gameplay which gives you a good reason to keep progressing. Then the mods the community make add a whole new level of content that make the game more immersive.

Binding of Isaac is certainly one of my favorite indie games for multiple reasons, and I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."
12506,my blood boils and steam rushes out of my ears whenever this game is brought up.
12507,"I'd say if you love & hate rouge-likes, this game is the definition of a roller coaster of emotions.
At one point you'll be killing monsters left to right.
Then die to a piece of poop.

Anyways 9/10 just doesn't have the reference I'm looking for."
12508,"I love this game. It's good, I'm just bad. Would buy."
12509,"loved the game but now i need help.
It not says isaac.ng.exe is not responding and now it turns into a blank black screen, anyone know how to fix this?"
12510,I have sank far too much time into this game... and I absolutely love it

12526,"Super fun, endless feeling content, extremely satisfying and cool. Def a must have game! Repentence is absolutely worth the money as well."

12530,"I got this game for the first time about 2 years ago. Too young to think cracking games is no good. At this time I had no idea of what I had just got in my hands, and that is why today I'd like to * repent * of my action and sincerely hope to be forgiven.
Would recommend 100%, pure masterpiece.

also now I'm bald."
12531,Literally the worst game I've ever played. Absolutely hated every single minute of it
12532,"rip and tear with your tears

12533,bought whole game half off for da christmas sale its good
12534,I have no idea how I haven't left a review on this game honestly if you are interested in rogue likes and some how you have been living under a rock for the past like 7 yrs then you need to play this absolutely brutal game! The challenge is amazing and the replay ability is next level!

With near endless content, surrounded by incredibly challenging game play, and a pinch of community hated garbage to add just that little hint of human imperfection. I would recommend this to anyone unfortunate enough to hve lived this long not knowing this game exists.

12556,good
12557,isaac sus
12558,"Y'know I like rogue titles, but at the same time there is a finite order or combination of things.
The Binding of Isaac will always be a dungeon crawler that I enjoy. At the same time, I feel I've seen pretty much everything. I for one may be a glutton for punishment, but repetition gets old real quick. 
Quite frustrating to work so hard to get the treasure room, only to be given some random active or a niche passive. 
Literally had a run where I got useless active after active. By the end I was pretty SOL against mom, besides being tanky.
My loss meter will never be positive again, and that is fine and dandy.
Its the same formula over and over again. No matter the character you choose. All with one little quirk or addition that doesn't change really anything.
The RNG is so finicky; either you have a good selection of items and goodies, or you have s'hite items and scarce goodies. Or maybe one good active or passive and everything else useless.

At the end of the day, its's a good game, that's about it. Also, Love Maggie and Lilith.

12563,Endless replay value as you never have the same stuff and it seems you'll never unlock everything. Always one I come back to when i want to play for a short period as it's easy to do a few play throughs and then stop.

12607,"If you are looking for a bullet hell dungeon crawler with easy access, this is the game for you.  Through all my years of owning and playing this game, I can safely say that this game has kept it's grip on me in terms of replay-ability and a sense of freshness.  I picked up the game in 2015, and throughout all the time I've owned it, I still enjoy playing it A LOT.  Even if you think you've seen it all, this is just the base game.  With the three additional DLC's (Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, and Repentance), you will be opened up to a completely different world of Isaac.  Each pack brings you new and diverse bosses, a huge roster of new items, brand new areas to explore, and even an additional game mode!  And even if you feel the game becomes repetitive, there's so many characters to play and explore with, each one having their strengths and gimmicks.  If you're on the fence about whether the game will be worth it or not, it's definitely more than worth it's price, as it's an amazing labor of love, while also being an overall outstanding game :)"

12623,"TBoIR is one of the best game I've ever played, i love how the items combine, the complex lore and all the thing you can do after you beat mom, normally after you kill the big bad in games like these it loses its appeal but TBoIR really adds enough content to keep it fun"
12624,I like
12625,i just got this game and all of my friends hate me because i keep getting all of the best items on the first floor
12626,"Isaac and his Isaac, Lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs while his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac. Life was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That it, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac: ""Your Isaac has become Isaaced by Isaac. He needs to be Isaaced"" ""I will do my best to Isaac him my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.

""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""

""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.

Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he Isaac open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and Isaac himself Isaac, into the Isaac Isaacs below...

The Isaac of Isaac: Isaac of the Isaac.﻿"

12634,"A broken child finds his way through a living hell. Turn your suffering into strength and delve deeper and deeper into the world of Isaac. Discover multiple paths with endings that are all tied into a single narrative, new characters, and near endless combinations of items and strategies. At times punishing but not unfair, Isaac is a rewarding experience that encourages player knowledge and experimentation.

Some games are just so good it is hard for me to put it into words, and as such I can't help but feel that any review I could post would be wholly unworthy. Don't let anything keep you from playing this masterpiece, you are only missing out.

The DLCs are great and well worth it. The base game alone already has an insane amount of content but the expansions more than double that content. Certain expansions had rough launches but these issues were fixed soon after."
12635,True pain
12636,"bought afterbirth with rebirth, now buying repentance, good game"
12637,"After finally 100% this fantastic game, I can finally add my own two pence into the hat.

This is truly one of the best games ever made, using the same shell over and over again, but still feeling fresh.
practically glitch-less, this game will test your brain, from the basic Isaac, to the elusive Lost. Every round will be different, Even with the funny references from other games by Edmund McMillen, like Triachnid, to Steven.

I cannot recommend a game more than how I recommend this beautiful masterpiece."

12649,"Dear Eddie,

Well what is there to say?

You started as a young lad on a documentary, sketchbooking your way to a game called Super Meat Min.

From there, you opened up the old Adobe flash, and made a little ditty called Isaac. Some called it Zelda, others called it Eddie's Special.

Fast forward 10 years plos plos, here we are. A finished product that they will send in orbeez to a moon base one day. Not because it is a dopamine delivery service. But it is a dopamine story service. The stories in Isaac are all around you, if you believe.

Edwin, thank you for making a canvas of a game, that allows pogs to be thrown at it from every angle, and no matter who is looking at it, they see something different.

Some call it tinted, we call it tainted.

Thank you for the masterpiece. It will always be remembered in our horts.

If you have never played this game, and like fun things that are fun, you owe it to yourself to give it the old spin of the D6....plus you never know what you may end up with, which is part of the allurance.

Love,

R Key"

12673,"So here's the shtick kid, Ive played Dead Cells, Dead Estate, Gungeon, Hades, Noita, Risk of rain 1 and 2, Slay the Spire and undermine and out of all the roguelikes ive played ive enjoyed Isaac the most out of all of them. Im not saying the rest of them are bad because tbh all the ones I listed are great games, But Isaac started off as a flash game and has went a far way from it. I don't have many hours in the game but I absolutely love the amount of content in this game, and the workshop/mod integration makes it even better. 

If you're a fan of roguelikes and for some reason haven't played this one yet, please do, its so great. I even bought it for my girlfriend as her first game and shes obsessed with it, the art style is cute, the gameplay loop is fun and stays fresh and the music slaps aswell (except for the depth for some reason which has this ringing noise that literally makes me feel like im going crazy)

10/10 game all the way"

but GOD DAMN do i love it. 10/10 my favourite game of all time"
12677,"Amazing game if you like dungeon runners. I went into it not knowing much and I really liked the body horror and religious themes, creates a spooky atmosphere where you can become a super powerful satanic underling or a grotesque monster!"
12678,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.
You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."

12680,"I'm going to be honest, Issac was the reason I got into gaming in the first place, seeing my dad being so caught up into this simple yet complex game made me wanna play games. And today I bought Rebirth to relive those moments, and boy was it nice. Highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into the roguelike  genre, along with Risk Of Rain 2."

I will admit, it can still have its times of fault where the game hordes resources from you, but once you get around to having an insane build for any character on here, among the many to unlock, it is an absolute joyride definitely worth your money and replay-ability."

12728,"One of my favourite indie games and overall a really fun time. This game has TONS of items in it with EVEN MORE combinations and synergies so you can play this game hours on end without getting bored. The first couple DLC's really didn't help the game all that much because they didn't buff the bad items, they just added more. Repentance however, does add more items but also buffs some really bad items and nerfs some OP items such as brimstone. This is REALLY good and helped me get back into the game since it is now more skill based and less luck based."

12756,"Inconvenient controls, cannot shoot diagonally (wtf), cannot shoot with mouse (forced to use keyboard for that). Too pixelated (too low resolution), even on high resolution the game is simply magnified, too little content can be seen on the screen. The fight system is clunky. The whole look and feel of the game is basically gross and repulsive. Did not recognize my gamepad on PC.

I do not recommend it. Compared to another roguelike game I played earlier for several hours, this is just a child's toy.

Refunded it while I had the opportunity."
12757,good game no cap
12758,"If it wasn't for me being a broke ass 14 year old when this game released who rocked a pirated copy for longer than they care to admit; my steam profile would EASILY have at least 1000 hours logged by now.
And none of those hours feel wasted... even when I accidentally pickup a build ruining item (i'm looking at you Soy Milk) or spend 45 minutes on a run to die right before killing the final boss; I still find myself coming back to subject my brain, body and soul to this gauntlet of bullet dodging and RNG.
To some it might sound like torture to want to play a game that can be so grueling at times; but Isaac is my go to game to unwind for whatever odd reason going on almost 8 years later. It never feels repetitive. I mean sure the mechanics are generally the same like with any game; but every run I get some weird different combination of either great or dogshit items and it's always a fun clown fiesta trying to figure how the fuck I'm gunna make it out of the basement (almost usually) on the skin of my teeth with the tools (or lack thereof) provided.
Sure, there's gunna be some trash runs were you play like absolute garbage taking stupid/unavoidable damage or get horrible RNG, but when you get a grasp on how some of the items interact with each other (or just have platinumgod.uk open in another window like I even still do cause after ALL the time I've put in I STILL have items/achievements I haven't gotten), and get a feel for some of the enemies; you no longer feel like the weak crying boy running from your mom who first entered the basement, you feel like now this bitch better start running from you! 👿 
Definitely one of my favorite games of all time (legit have an oil/canvas painting of Isaac and some of the OG bosses on my wall, I revere it that much). I could go on and on, but what it really boils down to is; if you love RNG, Bullet-Hell or Roguelike games; this is totally the title for you! 
(Also gimme all the hate for being a pirate, but if it makes it any better; I own the game and all the DLC on both Steam/Switch now because I loved the game so much. Fr felt like I owed it to the devs to grab this game twice after all the time I played on the arm for so long)."

At first it refused to load and made me update my driver, reboot my pc, then disable and re-enable my GPU to get it to launch. After it launched, I was able to make it to the second room before it keylocked my computer. I closed the game but only unplugging and re-plugging my keyboard gave me function back. I tried it four more times before I decided to refund it.

Generally a good game, I like the rogue elements. Being able to go around finding trinkets that give you all sort of upgrades & findings gold you can use to buy even more trinkets from shops you find throughout the game feels very rewarding, It's extremely fun.

Played a lot other games from the series, Such as the Vanilla binding of Isaac & Afterbirth. But this one remains my favorite. 

It never REALLY gets repetitive, considering the amount of characters & trinkets there actually are in the game. There's hundreds among hundreds of items you can collect throughout the game.

I wanted to kill myself within the first week of playing it! I fully recommend it if you've got some time & money to spare. It's completely worth it.

Abilities
Enhanced Strength: While lacking in agility, Gaston is shown to possess a tremendous amount of physical strength, evidenced by his effortlessly lifting a bench with three adult females (the Bimbettes) on it, as well as holding it up with only one hand. He later effortlessly rips off a stone ornament from the castle to use as a makeshift club during his battle with the Beast. The fact that he can fight and knock back the Beast is also quite impressive, given his size. Still though, compared to the creature his strength is inferior.
[10:41 PM]
Skilled Marksman: He is also able to fire his blunderbuss with pinpoint accuracy, noted by LeFou proclaiming, ""Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!"" This, however, was briefly contradicted in the Marvel Comics, where he manages to miss a rabbit despite it being fairly close by. In addition, he has proved that he is a skilled archer during the climax at the castle.
[10:41 PM]
Stealth: He is also shown to be skilled at stealth attacks, as implied in the song ""Gaston"" with the lyrics: ""No one's slick as Gaston,"" and confirmed when he manages to stab the Beast in the back while the latter was distracted with joy that Belle returned, even though he had to climb up several areas to reach him.
[10:41 PM]
Skilled Tactician: As noted above, despite his otherwise revulsion to the concepts of reading, getting ideas, and overall intelligence and intellectualism (specifically for women), he is shown to be a somewhat skilled plotter, having come up with the blackmail idea. In addition, he also had decent enough observation skills to pick up the hint that Belle may have had feelings for the Beast just from a few subtle clues late into the film.
[10:41 PM]
Skilled Manipulator: He is also very good at manipulation; after discovering that Belle is in love with the Beast, he uses the villagers' ignorance and prejudices (as well as his own popularity) to rally them into killing the Beast. Despite this, however, he ultimately shows himself to be very reckless regarding his planning. This is especially evident in Gaston's reprise where he loudly divulges in a crowded tavern enough key details about his blackmail plan to have all but ensured that everyone knows his true nature (though most of them still went along with it anyway).

12851,I Suck
12852,it good
12853,"Buy every DLC if you want to play this game. Rebirth is good, but Repentance removes almost everything that was bad in it, adding way cooler stuff as well."
12854,Dungeon crawler style gameplay is really fun and incredibly addictive. Touching story that is conveyed through the items as much as cutscenes. The game manages to strike a sort-of balance between luck and skill but leans more towards luck. (Like some bosses and floors are brutally difficult or unfair if you don't have good enough items) Overall awesome game that can be played for hours on end.
12855,i hate this game
12856,I like it

12872,"Time to dump on everyone's apparent favorite video game I guess.

The new save experience is soul sucking, perhaps by design. I understand that the appeal is that you put 10-20 hours into it to unlock enough content to begin bending the game systems over your knee, but that doesn't actually mitigate the fact that on first boot, this is simultaneously the least satisfying twin-stick shooter you will ever play and the single game which encapsulates why people who don't trust ""rogue-likes"" do so (bad fortune leading to needlessly resistant experiences, only offset by the [i]chance[/i] of getting a good go at it and making a bunch of substantial progress all at once). The ""piss and crap"" aesthetic also wears on my eyes personally. The humor could serve to be more subtle or tasteful. Apparently there's lore, but I can't engage with it because zzzzz.

I don't write this with any imagination that I'm smearing the games' reputation. I just don't like it. I bought it as part of a fairly generous 20$ bundle at the beginnings of ye plague times. It's probably worth whatever fraction of that amount that it makes. I'm not sure it's worth more."

12878,"Way harder than people like Northernlion and Sinvicta make it look, but also very rewarding to get the hang of.

Pros:
-Intuitive gameplay
-Very challenging
-Mod support
-Cool soundtrack
-Fantastic artwork and visuals
-Very retro inspired dungeon crawl
-Cool variety of playstyles and item interactions

Cons
-High skill threshold and barrier to entry
-Some unlocks are very tedious
-I have lost entire days to this game without realising it
-Highly addictive
-Random items can lead to some absolutely awful runs

Definitely recommend this game to anyone willing to put in the time to play though. The first few hours feel like bashing your head into a wall, but eventually you learn that your head is harder and you go crashing through, then the game is suddenly way more fun than it has any right to be.

Also, Repentance is pretty good."

Wot I liked
- Lots of classes;
- Lots of items and powerups which are visible on your guy and change the game drastically;
- Sickening nightmare of a child;
- Various monsters;
- Various bosses;
- OKish controls, you usually die cause you've made a mistake.

Wot I disliked
- Getting damage on touching all enemies is lazy;
- I expected more.

To sum it all up, initially I didn't like BoI at all, but then I gave it a go and - it's a decent bullet hell roguelike."

12912,"Isaac and his wocky lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his wocky watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's wocky heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's wocky replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's wocky replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's wocky heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's wocky begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his wocky burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

12933,"Gra wybitna. Podkoloryzowane wyobrażenia z dzieciństwa autora w grze typu rouge-like. Rozgrywka nieprzewidywalna (w najnowszym dodatku), gameplay wciągający, niezliczona ilość synergi i wiele innych atutów. Ale o grze. Twoja rozgrywka zaczyna się pierwszym runem tytułową postacią, ""Isaaciem"" masz wyraźny cel: ""Zamordować Starą"". Na każdym piętrze znajdują się pokoje z przeciwnikami oraz pokoje specjalne. Do tych drugich wliczamy pokoje: z przedmiotami (treasure roomy), sklepy, boss roomy i wiele innych. Po pokonaniu matki zyskujemy prawdziwą grę w której można odblokowywać nowe piętra, przeciwników a także postacie. Gra godna swojej ceny nawet za dodatek opłaca się zapłacić."
12934,"Infinite replayability, great fun, y'all know what BOI is about"
12935,"This game will piss you off beyond belief. But it is fun and always something new, I have 50 hours and have barely seen ANY of the game, like I haven't even scratched the surface, I have barely seen the surface. The game is great and will always pull you back. It has a serious learning curve, which turned me off of it for awhile, but it is always in the back of my mind. 

Only problems are the deaths, sometimes it is really not your fault, and that can be super aggravating, like if multiple troll bombs spawn, you can only hope they do not hit you. And the game is completely unpredictable, 90% of the enemies move in completey random ways, it is genuinely impossible, by design, to predict it. So it can be frustrating. But overall this is a classic and would be stupid to pass up on.

TLDR: Sometimes unfair, absurd amount of content, rage inducing, addictive. 
8/10"
12936,mfs don't know what to do when you hit em with that boo hoo
12937,One of the greatest games in history.

12941,"Small Baby Cries at Poop, Turns Into Mutant Freak"
12942,Biblically accurate roguelike. 10/10.
12943,pain
12944,This game's developer is incompetent. He can't implement a simple working steam cloud funcionality. I've lost over 500 hours of progress because importing a save file is beyond his abilities.
12945,"so i have never played this game on my PC before but the game whats me to write a review? unless steam knows i played it on Xbox? anyway the game is very fun and challenging and the different builds you can do is so fun. would recommend getting the DLC it just makes it better.
EDIT: i bought the game with all DLC its a good buy"
12946,yea
12947,good $QW$
12948,change religion with essential oils and you have the story of my life
12949,Very entertaining with epic lore
12950,VERY GOOD
12951,"this game is amazing

see i was wondering how this game worked and why people have so many hours but i now get it.

unlike enter the gungeon which i think was my first rogue like and then nuclear throne had 1 ending if i am not wrong this game has 22. so you have to beat the game aka all levels and final boss 22 times and i guess it gets harder and harders but after than idk what else you can do tbh.

i also noticed that game is ez you just need a good rng and even a bad player can win even with issac thats who i play atleast.



i saw there won't be anymore updates so i do wonder what the next game will be but i did not think this game would be this good tbh.


good game


i really did not realize how much content this game has and the all dlc bundle is so worth it, i will have a lot of fun."

13130,"The ""original"" best roguelike in existence.
infinite hours of fun, chaos and struggling for survival,
various difficulty levels,
very controller friendly.

not for casuals (at all), unless youve already played for 200+hrs.
most people use an item cheat sheet or mods, because the sheer number of items and item combinations is astonishing.
very difficult to get back into after not having played for a long time, couldnt bring myself to do it.
frustrating at times (especially for veteran players) but you should be fine if youve never played this game before."

13193,Great Game
13194,Does anyone know how to get repentance as a DLC on its own? Its not allowing me to buy repentance without buying afterbirth and afterbirth + with it.
13195,It's okay.

13200,"Fantastic game. Tons of replay value. I highly recommend getting all the DLC but there's still nearly endless replay value from the base game.

Be warned that it's quite difficult (or maybe I just suck), and very RNG based - the items you get in each run are completely random, and you will sometimes get a load of boring or not very good items in a run. But the game doesn't punish you in the slightest for bailing on a run and trying again if you get a boring one.

Runs last 25+ minutes. My average is about 30-50 and that seems to be the average for most players. If that sounds too long, don't worry - you can pause a run, quit the game, and restart where you left off.

If you don't like things to be too difficult, I suggest not buying Repentance until you're good at the game abd complete all achievements with each character. Repentance is harder in many ways than the base game, Afterbirth, and Afterbirth+.

To sum up: Very fun, very addictive, very hard, very replayable."

Edit: after hours of wiping random files to get it to work, i have found that if the game launches, goes full screen, then crashes before the opening sequence starts, then you need to wipe the files under C:/Users/(User)/Documents/My Games and wipe the corresponding TBOI files, then re-acquire them.

Whether it's grinding for unlockable items, trying to earn every single achievement, or just seeing the many different and interesting ways that the hundreds of available items can combine and synergise, Isaac keeps you coming back. Again, and again, and again, and again, and again. You might set it down for several months out of frustration, just to come back and play it regularly for several more. You might praise Edmund for adding a ton of new content and then curse him mere minutes later for nerfing your favorite item. And somewhere along the way, you'll forget that Isaac is a naked baby in a basement crying at flies and piles of poop, because you've realized that Isaac is so much more. Isaac is you."

I haven't played this game all that much but I will make another review once I have played for a longer amount of time.

The items and lore bring so much to the game, the interactions between items are incredibly fun, and you'll quickly develop a favorite character out of the now 34 characters you can have access to.

To some this is absolutely a positive, as it really extends the gameplay, but as someone who is coming into it extremely fresh I found myself constantly dying because I couldn't figure out what the items did or which I should choose.... unless I looked it up. But for me, any game that requires I constantly have the Wiki open so as not to end up screwing myself over is doing something ~wrong~.

Again, take this review for what it's worth: I'm also the type of person who loves puzzle games so long as they explain the rules (Talos Principle/Portal) but hates them when figuring out the rules is part of the puzzle (The Witness), so...."

13326,"Ultra greed (the final boss in greed mode before greedier mode) is a very epic boss. Why? There are many reasons why Ultra greed is an epic boss. 1. He has a very cool design. Although this doesnt affect gameplay it still makes the fight more enjoyable that fighting the same blob every single room. 2. He has a unique mechanic of spawning coins. The coins are not hard to destroy by the end of a decent run if you’ve been collecting some damage (which you should). The healing mechanic doesn’t even heal him for that much if you are fighting him correctly, the enemies he spawns are one hit (you can shred them with azazel and Lilith), and the bombs are easily avoidable and thats even if you let any of the coins survive. 3. His attacks are also very interesting but easy to dodge. He has a spin attack which shoots coins and a stomp attack which doesnt let you get close. Although these attacks dont do much they are made effective by the chaos that should be caused during this fight because of the items you should have picked up (this point will probably be brought back up later). 4. His health. Ultra greed health is not a problem. If it is then you did not pick up enough damage upgrades during the run. You can easily get him down to a quarter of his health before he starts to spawn health coins which once again are not hard to destroy. He had to have a lot of health to make him feel more difficult to fight against compared to the other bosses you have been previously 1 hitting during the rest of the run. It also makes the run pay off as you can unleash your entire arsenal upon him which is extremely satisfying. 5. I forgor what I was going to say here. I will try to rember. 

Conclusion: Ultra greed is not meant to be played against like a normal boss. The fun of this fight revolves around the mass amount of items you have gathered to create so much chaos on your screen. The payoff of using all these items to kill Ultra greed while coins, tears, and orbitals are flying all across your screen gives a feeling of satisfaction to the player that makes them want to start a new greed run to create an even crazier build for your character. Maybe you find laser x and quad shot or you use Lilith with car battery. Either way you run should be very crazy and contribute to your fun. Therefore, if ultra greed is not fun then you do not have a fun and interesting build."

13415,"Люди делают кучу вещей, когда им нечего делать. Скучающий мозг начинает искать новые источники дофамина и находить их, порой, в очень странных или спорных источниках. Некоторые начинают качаться, некоторые начинают читать, некоторые смотреть сериалы, гулять, и так далее. Меня же ожидало отличные 2 недели карантина без возможности выйти из своей камеры содержания [i]вообще[/i], а в распоряжении были только ноутбук на целероне и телефон. Поэтому, я, прям как в старые добрые, окунулся в сферу инди-игр по новому. [spoiler]Не то, чтобы я оттуда выныривал[/spoiler]. И вспомнил, что существует игра, на которую вы сейчас читаете этот обзор. Покупка не заставила себя ждать.
Сразу хочется оговориться, что эта игра делится на 3 фазы. Каждый из этих этапов мы рассмотрим отдельно, потому что мое отношение, как игрока, к этой игре отличалось разительно в каждый из периодов.
Сразу же хочу оговориться, что мое мнение касательно этой игры не 100% истина, так как в ней куча субъективщины.

[b]Фаза 1. Он еще не знает[/b]. Знакомство с игрой и открытие всех локаций/персонажей. Я только купил игру. Слышал я о ней исключительно из игровых в чатов в дискорде и у Альбино. Было ничего не понятно, но очень интересно. Количество и вариации предметов, а также их синергии очень радовали глаз и душу, а локации были достаточно щадящими для нового игрока по типу меня. Ничего не предвещало беды. Но вот, я одолел мать, открыл сердце матери, убил уже его 5 раз, мне уже вот-вот начало становиться скучно, и игра вдруг выдает мне достижение ""Everrything is terrible!"" и о том, что игра стала сложнее. Ну и ладно, думал я, никаких проблем у меня с этим не возникнет. Но вот, спустя примерно 100 часов я открыл всех персонажей (Почти), открыл все доступные локации и началась фаза под названием...

[b]Фаза 2. Боль.[/b]. Теперь ты похож на героинового наркомана. Игра тебе говорит - ""Видишь ли, игрок, тут такое дело, у каждого персонажа есть листочек, на котором отмечены все боссы, которых ты убил на том или ином персонаже. И за каждым из значков на этом листочке скрыты разблокируемые предметы. Ну ты понял, что я имею ввиду. Страдай"". И ты начинаешь страдать, потому что наружу вылезают самые [i]интересные[/i] приколы этой игры. Давайте я вам перечислю несколько примеров.

1. Есть такой интересный персонаж, как Т Джейкоб. У него обуза в виде постоянно летающего за ним братца (В моем случае, сестрички. Спасибо, что для Айзека существуют моды). И это нечто первый раз задевая тебя, превращает тебя в духа, дохнущего от одой тычки, а на второй раз просто убивает. В одной из локаций за тобой гонится призрак, который имеет такой же ИИ, такое же поведение и [spoiler]такой же хитбокс, лол[/spoiler]. Это громадное нечто сносит тебе всего одно сердце. Знаете, в чем отличие между твоим братцем и этим призраком? Твой братец с тобой на протяжении всей игры. И еще он оооооочень мешает уклоняться от пуль. Но при этом наказание сильно больнее. Почему? Загадка.

2. В игре есть персонаж, который по сути, призрак. Он умеет летать, у него пули летают сквозь стены, у него есть святая мантия, которая блокирует один удар в каждой комнате, и так далее. Его альтернативная версия немного посложнее. Но, это самый честный персонаж в игре. Ты, как бы, говоришь - ""Эй, игра. Давай так. Я получаю все вышеупомянутые преимущества, но к тому же, у меня вообще не будет падать предметов на защиту, хорошо?"". ""Хорошо"", - говорит тебе игра, но забирает у тебя святую мантию. То есть, ты с ней договариваешься показывать максимум усилий, а она тебе не мешает это делать с помощью предметов. И вот, ты очень аккуратно пробираешься сквозь 5 локаций, потому что ты хочешь комнату с ангелом. Тебе упало не очень много хороших предметов, но ты держишься. И вот, победив босса, ты заходишь в комнату с Ангелом в надежде получить что-нибудь стоящее, и ты получаешь... Библию. Знаете, что делает Библия? Дает полет на одну комнату. Персонажу, у которого этот полет уже есть. На этом функционал этого замечательного предмета заканчивается. Я знаю, что там его немного побольше, но я думаю, если человек смог открыть Альт. Лоста то у него не будет никаких проблем победить мать и без какой-либо помощи.

3. Мое любимое. Вот, ты на этом злополучном Альт. Лосте убиваешь Мега-Сатану. На любом другом персонаже ты после этого получаешь что-то, что качественно улучшает твой геймплей. Например, конфессионную, особую монетку, карту, спавнящую 1-20 красных сердец, и так далее. Наверное, за одного из самых сложных персонажей тебе дадут и награду получше, да?
На этом моменте я в первый раз удалил эту игру.
Мне дали сундук с призраком внутри.
Давайте представим аналогию.
Вы хотите победить в каком-то очень трудном соревновании. Вы потеете, через кровь и пот пробиваетесь к лучшему результату, несколько раз проваливаете попытку, но в конце концов достигаете долгожданного результата. Но вместо того, чтобы получить какую-нибудь грамоту, которая поможет вам в школе/универе/на работу, вы получаете примерно 5% шанс того, что в яблоке, которое вы едите, будут гвозди. Будет ли это яблоко отличаться от остальных, чтобы его можно было обнаружить? Да, оно будет немного тускнее. Будет ли оно вкуснее, ведь ты тратишь больше усилий, чтобы его съесть? Нет, не будет. Спрашиваю лично Эдмунда МакМиллена, а нахуй, спрашивается, оно тогда нужно? Я может, в геймдизайне чего-то не понимаю?
4. Режим жадности. Про него даже говорить не буду.

И таких нюансов набирается просто огромное количество за время игры. И вот, наконец, ты закрываешь все листочки на всех персонажах и начинается фаза под названием ...

b]Фаза 3. Наконец-то веселье[/b]. Только после того, как ты открыл все, что хотел открыть, только после того, как ты закрыл всех абсолютно ублюдских персонажей, наконец-то, ты можешь делать все, что угодно. Количество комбинаций просто поражает воображение. Разнообразие противников радует глаз, звуковое сопровождение - просто бомба, особенно в альтернативных уровнях. Но когда ты понимаешь, что для того, чтобы наслаждаться игрой, тебе пришлось потратить 400+ часов, на душе становится очень странно. С одной стороны, ты это заслужил. С другой стороны, а надо ли было тратить на это такое количество времени?
И вот теперь этот вопрос вы должны задать сами себе, когда вы собираетесь купить эту игру. Если вы готовы терпеть буквальные плевки в лицо от нее, если вы готовы принимать ее издевательства ради поистине замечательной музыки, огромного разнообразия и челленжа, если вы готовы потратить ради нее огромное количество времени - то эта игра для вас. Если же вам нравится, когда игра не держит игрока за грушу для битья, то я тоже рекомендую вам ее взять.

13416,wow only 26 hours? i'm already inlove with this game
13417,one of the best games i played in a while.
13418,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's greatest strength is in its replayability.  You have a wealth of characters, items, powerups, room types, enemies, bosses, hazards, etc. to unlock, and the way these can combine or clash with each other means a new surprise every game.  I have 10 hours played and just 3% of the achievements. 
 Each game may be short, but cumulatively there's a lot of depth.

Rebirth is a substantial expansion to the original on all counts.  However, to my eye the art takes a step backwards in one regard.  The original's art was made in a vector/Flash style, and Rebirth applies a simple algorithm to scale up this art.  Even with the filter, the result is inferior in full screen mode.  I would've liked to see redone, HD artwork throughout.

Potential buyers should be aware that Isaac incorporates gratuitous cartoon blood & gore, scatology, drug use, satanism, and body horror inspired by birth defects and other diseases.  If your tastes are compatible with all that, I think you'll enjoy this atypical, abundantly replayable RPG."

And The secrets and difficulty mode, characters and challenges also daily challenges and updated patches ,Etc makes the game last longer.

13466,"ohn Cena is a professional wrestler, actor and television personality. Calling himself ""The Prototype,"" he captured the UPW title in 2000. In 2001, he signed a contract to work at Ohio Valley Wrestling. Cena claimed the OVW heavyweight title in February 2002, then made his WWE debut that June. Two years later, he took the United States Championship. The wrestler has since expanded his brand through the release of a hip-hop album and appearances on TV and film.

Early Life
John Felix Anthony Cena was born on April 23, 1977, in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the second of John Sr. and Carol Cena's five boys.

At an early age, Cena showed a passion for sports and working out. By the time he was 15, he was a regular gym rat and after graduating high school, Cena headed off to Springfield College in Massachusetts to study exercise physiology and prove his worth on the football field. At Springfield, Cena turned himself into a Division III All-American offensive lineman and team captain.

In 2000, the new college graduate left Massachusetts despite his father's wishes, seeking a new life in California as a bodybuilder. It wasn't an easy transition for the 6-foot 1-inch aspiring star. He had just $500 in his pocket to make it across the country and get settled. To make ends meet, he folded towels and cleaned toilets at a Gold's Gym in Venice Beach. Since he couldn't afford an apartment, he shacked up in his 1991 Lincoln Continental.

Foray into Wrestling
Cena's turning point came in early 2000, during a casual conversation he had with a wrestler at Gold Gym's who encouraged him to take classes at Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), a former World Wrestling Entertainment developmental company.

For Cena, the suggestion of making a go of it as a wrestler was not an entirely outlandish idea. His father, John Sr. (a.k.a. Johnny Fabulous), made a living as a wrestling announcer and businessman. As a kid growing up in suburban Massachusetts, the younger Cena spent many hours glued to the television set as he watched his wrestling heroes such as Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior and Shawn Michaels go at it in the ring.

As a wrestler himself, Cena's ascension was rapid. Calling himself ""The Prototype,"" the ambitious Cena captured the UPW title on April 27, 2000, in San Diego, California. Over the course of the next year, Cena drew the attention of WWE executives, and in 2001, the young entertainer signed a developmental contract with the company to work at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).

WWE Debut and Champion
Cena captured the OVW heavyweight title in February 2002, then made his WWE debut that June when he signed up with the Smackdown roster. Just two years later, Cena took home the United States Championship, defeating The Big Show in March 2004 in Wrestlemania XX.

In the years since, Cena has notched many wins and titles. In 2007, he became the first wrestler to ever come up victorious against Edward ""Umaga"" Fatu.

Along the way, Cena, whose good looks and sculpted body inspired the nickname ""The Marky Mark of Wrestling,"" greatly increased his celebrity. Like Hogan, Cena proved that his showmanship in the ring translated to success in other venues.

TV, Movies and Music
Through the production wing of WWE, Cena starred in the action films The Marine (2006) and 12 Rounds (2009), the latter featuring the wrestler trying to save his girlfriend from a gang of terrorists in New Orleans.

Album: 'You Can't See Me'
In addition, Cena, who has long had an affinity for hip-hop culture, became a recording artist when his rap album, You Can't See Me, hit record stores in 2005. The recording debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 15.

'Trainwreck'
In 2015, Cena received critical praise for his acting skills in the hit comedy Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow and written by the film's star, Amy Schumer. Cena played Schumer's muscle-bound but sensitive boyfriend. “I got my chance to throw my sense of humor out into the world, and at the same time play this hulky guy who’s a softy, which in real life I’m a very emotional guy,” Cena told Business Insider. Later that year he appeared in the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler comedy Sisters and had a small role in Daddy's Home.

'Blockers,' 'Bumblebee'
Devoting more time to his screen pursuits, Cena in 2017 co-starred in the war film The Wall, voiced the titular bull of the animated Ferdinand and rejoined Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg for Daddy's Home 2. The following year, he enjoyed a prominent role in the raunchy comedy Blockers, before returning to action fare with the Transformers spinoff Bumblebee. Cena then joined Keegan-Michael Key and John Leguizamo to play a trio of wildfire fighters flummoxed by unruly kids in the 2019 family comedy Playing with Fire.

'Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?' Host
Also in 2019, it was announced that Cena would host a new version of the game show Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?, a gig previously belonging to comedian Jeff Foxworthy. Prior to its debut in June, Cena pointed out the similarities between entertaining audiences as a wrestler and as a TV personality, and said the latest version of the show would focus more on the kids than the adult contestants. 

Personal Life
Cena married his girlfriend, Elizabeth Huberdeau, in July 2009. In May 2012, Cena filed for divorce, allegedly shocking Huberdeau. Their messy separation played out in the media, but they eventually settled in July of that year. 

In 2012, Cena began dating fellow WWE superstar Nikki Bella. On April 2, 2017, he proposed to Bella after they defeated The Miz and Maryse in a tag team match at Wrestlemania 33. Cena and Bella ended their engagement in April 2018, and briefly reconciled before it was reported that they had again gone their separate ways.

The following year, the wrestler turned actor began dating engineer Shay Shariatzadeh. The pair was married in October 2020.

13482,"Highly Reccomend for people who want to play a game for more than 5 hours trying to beat it, theres so much content and everytime you play its different. Definately a good purchase"
13483,Retrolike indie arcade game that one never finishes discovering. Filled with lil puns at every stage and ideal to vice your self for hours as well as for short lapses of time. Extremely simple to grasp and probably ideal for young and older players (yes kids and adults might enjoy it just as much).
13484,haha tears go brrrrr
13485,Very good gaem
13486,Good game.
13487,I love this game!
13488,we've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.
13489,"I should have way more hours in this game than Steam tells me I have, I played the hell out of this game many years ago when I had little to no internet access. With this game and its earlier flash counterpart, The Binding of Isaac has given me a constant joy in video gaming, and it's something I come back to frequently in hopes to one day 100%. It's a daunting task, but it's enjoyable any time I do get the golden run that leads me to unlocking a new achievement, where every single one offers up a new unlock for the game.

Isaac features countless hours of replayability and is packed to the brim with content, even for the base game. Including all three expansions, you're looking at an insane amount of characters to choose from, thousands of items, trinkets, and consumables to acquire, and a variety of enemies and bosses to encounter, all on top of an expansive array of increasingly difficult floors, with multiple different branches you can go down for multiple different endings. It's a lot, it can be overwhelming, and at times it definitely is.

I like the game's unlockables, options, and all of its potential for fun and busted builds, but if there's one criticism I had to give it, it's that it presents you with so much stuff by the end, there's a lot that you'll end up tripping over and forgetting about, especially if you're a casual player and you don't look into the fan wiki for nuances, synergies, detailed descriptions, and so on about all of the items and their vague descriptions. The game has explained itself a little better over the years, but you'll be in the dark about so much stuff, [i]including[/i] some of the unlock conditions for later content, unless you choose to look it up. Despite that big criticism, the game is still thoroughly enjoyable and I would absolutely recommend it regardless.

Another huge pro to this game is its active and highly diverse modding community, which features mods that range from QoL improvements, to graphical tweaks, meme content, custom characters, and even complete game overhauls or fan expansions. All of that, with the base game and its expansions, makes for one huge and memorable experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend this game, absolutely, ten times over."
13490,"Its a fun game but holy shit, This game sucks"
13491,"So long, and thanks for all the unlocks"
13492,"Before the last major update, I would have strongly recommended this game. I played it for 575 hours, got 100% of the achievements, played the dailies frequently... This was my favourite game, it was hard, but fun and rewarding. But with Repentance, much of what I liked about the game is gone and I cannot recommend it anymore.

The game is now too damn hard and not fun anymore. There are now tons of barely avoidable damage, like instant damage rooms or cheap enemies that hit you no matter what. The new paths are not fun at all, you can barely see anything in some rooms filled with traps even with full brightness (and curse of darkness is now the worst curse...). Many items were nerfed on top of that, including devil items. Breaking the game, which was one of the coolest thing you could do in this game, is now almost impossible... Now, unless I get a game-winning item early on, I just know I will not survive the new paths."
13493,why am i baby

13503,killing your mother has never been funnier!!
13504,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."
13505,I originally got this game for free on Playstation Plus. I needed another copy.
13506,best game ever i don't care what sinvicta says.

13521,"F up game, but fun. One of the best rouge-likes there is."
13522,"I originally bought this game for the PS4 7 or 8 years ago. I played it daily until I had unlocked almost everything and then gave it a break for a few months. Then one day I realised that it still had some play left in it if I went in and did the daily challenges and I started playing daily again. The whole franchise came on sale in Steam, including the newest expansion which I never got for the PS4. Now I'm replaying the whole thing including new unlocks and challenges and enjoying it as much as always. Buy this game and all it's expansions. You won't regret it."
13523,nice game very fun and a high variety of synergies
13524,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a tough and remarkably replayable roguelike indie game. It was, in fact, my (and many others') first game of this genre! The game uses many concepts that it shares with other roguelikes (ex. progressing to different areas, perma death [you lose all items after you die in a run], ridiculous story) but it's still unique in many ways. I honestly wouldn't have stumbled upon the game and therefore the genre hadn't I been such a keen Super Meat Boy (a game of the same authors') fan back then.
You can play with many different characters once you unlock them and boy that IS difficult. If you're a fan of throwing your PC out of the window, then I found a perfect game for you! The game also has a whopping 600+ items to unlock and that will keep you occupied for hours and hours. Beating the game once makes you unlock new areas and new items and once you think you beat the entire thing, you're left with the reality check of the game telling you ""it's not over yet"". I really do not want to spoil the names of the characters nor the areas, even though most of you have probably heard of them. 
You know, if I were you, I'd probably buy this game RIGHT NOW and not wait for a sale because I'm telling you, this game is worth every penny. Scroll down the reviews and see people having 3k+ hours in-game time.
The DLCs, I advise you to buy later on because if you start out with them, the game will be waaaay too hard. Trust me on this one, please. They add a GAMEFUL amount of content.

Great no ""thinking needed"" shooter with a surprising amount of depth.  Lots of replay and constant new things to find.  

Reminds me of broforce; same spirit type of game.

Just wish you could carry people a bit more in couch co-op like in broforce/mario/etc...  Co-op is fairly punsihining now. (typically I play couch co-op with people that are not good)."

13557,"I have been playing this game for 400+ hours on my Nintendo 3DS, 200+ hours on my Switch and over 150 hours here in Steam, so, yes, I can recommend this game!
You need a lot of patience, skill, frustration tolerance and will to beat the game. Every playthrough makes the game harder.
Sometimes it feels like Dark Souls on steroids."

13559,"I'm writing this while listening to a pencil sharpener. Kill me.
"
13560,"If you've never played a rouge-like before, I'd say The Binding of Isaac is THEE place to start. I'd recommend this game to anybody really, especially for those who are achievement hunters. This game takes so many hours to collect and complete everything it has to offer. As of right now, I have 592 hours on this game and still haven't done everything on every single character. Runs in this game are always interesting, you never know what items you'll find or what new synergy you may get between two or more items. In any encounter that results in death, the death almost always seems fair, it always seems like the players fault which is a good thing. The game is difficult to a degree, some runs will be challenging due to bad RNG and others will be busted beyond belief, my friends and I always show off what new synergies we've managed to come upon in a run. There is story to be found in the game, its a simple one that you'll have to figure out, but if its a story game you're looking for I wouldn't recommend BOI. For every other reason besides story though, I'd absolutely recommend this game."
13561,"really fun 
"
13562,"I wanna kill myself but its still a good game :smile: :thumbs_up:
"
13563,"Endless replayability, loads of characters, and powerful items to unlock"
13564,"TLDR; If you are looking for a roguelite you can dump time into, buy this game with the dlcs. (ESPECIALLY REPENTANCE, THE NEWEST DLC)

This game is probably the most consistently good roguelite on the market, being one of the first of the genre. While the game is good without dlc, getting all of the expansions really fleshes out the game and about triples the content in terms of stages, items, enemies, characters, endings, and secrets. Not to mention that this is a game that one can spend hundreds of hours on and still not even achieve half the things to do."
13565,It is indeed a good game
13566,"The Binding of Isaac is like gambling except you aren't gambling with your money, you are gambling with your time. You will not enjoy the runs where it's slow and you unlock nothing and fail, and you will never get the time it took to fail back. You will enjoy the runs where you unlock a bunch and succeed. The difference between enjoying a run and not enjoying a run is up to random chance. Sure, you could know the plays and all the items too, but your micro game will never be perfect, and that is assuming the pieces to making a play in this game even show up in the first place. This game respects the time you put into it only if you are lucky in that time, in addition to knowing what you are doing. The mechanical enjoyment of this game is its depth. Making a play feels good because it is good, it doesn't just give it to you every time, its actually a rarity to pull it off. Using elements of the game to take the upper hand when there is so much benign chance put against you feels great, because it is. The space of this game's synergies across the bloated item pool makes hitting the jackpot special. Sure, it might suck a lot of the time, but catching a break in this game feels like the planets have aligned."
13567,"great game, You will never have the same run twice. NEVER."
13568,;)

13594,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was simple and they were both Isaac. That was until the Isaac heard a Isaac from Isaac. Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac. I will do my best Isaac in my Isaac, Isaac's Isaac replied. Rushing into Isaac's Isaac removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again Isaac called to Isaac. Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac, he needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac. I will follow your Isaac I have Isaac indeed, Isaac's Isaac replied. As she locked Isaac in his Isaac away from the Isaac of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. You've done as i have asked, but i still question your Isaac to Isaac to prove your Isaac I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac. Yes Isaac, anything, Isaac's Isaac begged. To prove your Isaac then Isaac, I require Isaac your Isaac will be Isaac, go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac. ""Yes Isaac"", she replied. Grabbing Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac watching through a Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around as Isaac to find Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac hidden under his Isaac, without Isaac he flung open Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac and through himself down into the unknown Isaac below."

13627,"This game is amazingly addictive. Sometimes you get an incredibly lucky run with the best item synergies, while other times you're barely hanging on to a thread dodging shots with a mediocre build. The modding community of this game is something else entirely, it's huge, it's big, and it's full of memes. 10/10 Easily, I wouldn't sink 150+ hours if it wasn't."

13641,i feel like i got way more content than what i payed for
13642,this is one of the first rougelikes I have played and man this game has kicked my ass so much and I love it. It's so much fun and there are so much cool mods for this game as well!!
13643,"Лучшая игра, что тут говорить"
13644,yes
13645,it is just perfect
13646,"After letting this game collect dust in my steam library for 8 years, I rediscovered it and now i'm addicted. There's smth kind of relieving about the contrast between the cute artstyle and its dark themes. It's dope as hell.

Also, I'm a simple man. When I'm spending time playing games, I just wanna drop in and play right away. Story can be great and all, but I just wanna cut to the chase and get to playin. Isaac delivers just that. There's so much replayability. So many things to unlock and discover with each run feeling different from the last ( especially if you have the DLC ).

The game can be pretty fkin hard and unforgiving especially if you're not very familiar with twin-stick style games, but it can also make you feel like a god that can vaporize anything's existence if you get some nice item combinations goin on. Seriously, sometimes you might be in a room shootin your useless ass peashooter at a damage sponge for an eternity, or you might one-shot the final boss. You might get some dogshit runs, and you might get some godly runs. It's all part of the fun.

I like to go into this game expecting the world within it to treat me unfairly at all times, cause that's what it feels like when I get really far with a fun build and then I die to a little smiling poop sprite dashing across the screen. 

I have crippling depression haha

play co-op with me"
13647,alright i think im gonna stop playing gn
13648,Definitely YES!!

Unless you are religious, in which case, your mom will tell you that you're going to a not very nice place... which let's be honest, your chances of making it into heaven are slim no matter what."

13655,"Уникальная игра и сама идея геймплея. Куча предметов, зон, боссов, врагов и всевозможных моментов. Игра постоянно реиграбельна, даже после получения всех концовок, достижений и предметов. Без wiki игры и модов на понимание сути предмета, игра с самого начала довольно тяжела, чем и берёт игрока. Советую к ознакомлению. 

Плюсы:
- Графика. (Приятный пиксельный стиль). 
- Саундтрек. (Хороший и не надоедающий). 
- Оптимизация. (Всё на высшем уровне). 
- Реиграбельность. (Игра бесконечна и полностью рандомная. Каждое новое прохождение, это новый секрет в копилку игры). 
 
Минусы:
- Отсутствие онлайна режима. (Ремоут плей только в помощь). 
- DLC. (Считайте, что покупаете демо без всех DLC). 
- Оконный режим. (Возможно, у меня только такая проблема, но если игра в окне, то мышь перестаёт работать как и в игре, так и в Винде. Если в окне включить Ремоут плей, то перестаёт работать всё, Стим, Игра и Винда. Сущий ад начался, как Исаака в окне запустили…)

13670,"its a really fun game with a lot of replay-ability and depth, I dont own any of the DLCs but theres still so much in the base game itself. this game is very easy to pick up and put down any time of the day, so its a great game for people who struggle with ""committing"" to things if that makes any sense. you don't have to stress about playing perfectly when you play, there's infinite runs and they are all unique.

I recommend this game, but, maybe not if you are prone to getting angry at video games."

13746,"Fuck this trash Isaac game, it sucks."
13747,The original TBOI was one of the first games I ever bought on steam. This shit is a classic.
13748,"Might be my favourite game ever. Also, f*ck the bloat :)"
13749,ive had this game installed for 24 hours
13750,"this game single-handedly ruined other rogue-likes for me because of how good it is, probably one of the most replayable games in existence and keeps staying fun throughout the whole way, has an interesting story and amazing music, everything about the game is just perfection(bloat and tainted lost can go suck it)."
13751,Its a good game.
13752,fuck
13753,gud
13754,"Absolutely one of the best dungeon crawling rouge-like games of all time. Endless hours of fun, thousands of synergies between different items, and with the possibility of a god tier run in the back of your head, you are constantly encouraged to keep playing"
13755,"Isaac is a great game, and it always has been. I played Rebirth when it came out in 2014, bought Afterbirth and touched on it when it came out in 2017, bought Afterbirth+ for Switch and got 1000000%, and then bought Repentance on PC and caught back up there. I've played this game for years and watched countless hours of content on the game. As a roguelike with thousands of different items, monsters, floors, room layouts, synergies, and mechanics, it kept its charm and allure all the way through, and kept me coming back for more.

Repentance almost doubled the content, adding in twice as many characters, over 100 items on its own, 2 new completion marks for each character and interesting paths involved with those endings, and enough bug fixes and changes to absolutely wreck a dev team. The amount of love and work put into this game over the last 7 years is just astounding, and can't be overlooked. Repentance is clearly the definitive version of the game, so I won't cover each previous DLC.

When Repentance came out, I waited for it to drop on Switch before buying it, but then decided to buy it on PC in August 2021 instead because the Switch port was taking quite a while. I knew my work was cut out for me, as I had been watching Isaac content for years, playing it every once in a while, and finally getting 1000000% in Afterbirth+ on Switch, leaving it alone for the longest time and leaving my PC progress in the dust with just a bit more unlocked than base Rebirth released with. Picking the game back up on PC meant trudging through the unlocks of all previous DLCs on top of the brand new ones. For whatever reason, I decided to go for every unlock in order -- starting with Isaac, then Magdalene, then Cain, and so on, then the Tainted versions of each character. This made it so that some of the very strong items unlocked with the harder, later characters were not available to me until the end of the game. I don't regret my choice, as it gave me a very in-depth look at each character one at a time for me to learn how to play and enjoy (or not).

I don't remember if I was determined to go for Dead God when I picked the game back up, but I know I committed pretty early on. I started following a streamer (Dan Gheesling) who set up a challenge to complete the game by the end of 2021. By the time I committed to the challenge, he was far ahead of me, but I caught up eventually. I played the game for hours a day to make sure I could complete it, checking how many achievements were left and how many days were left and deciding my pace from there. As I got achievement after achievement, the pace got smaller -- 3 achievements a day, 2.5 a day, 2, 1, .3. Looking back now, I think I've put in about 300 hours since I picked it back up, playing as much as 20 or 30 hours a week. I finally completed on December 9th, 2021, with my last few runs being dedicated to just picking up the items I hadn't yet seen. I think that now I've completed it, I'm going to take a long rest from it and play some other games. I was told to uninstall it, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. First of all, I'm not sure my stats will be saved (the progress obviously will be), but more importantly, the game holds a special place in my heart. After all, it was one of the first few games I ever bought on Steam, and one of the top 3 in terms of hours of gameplay. I will admit, though, that I'm glad it's over.

To say the game is without flaw would be a blatant lie. The overall aesthetic of the game and the topics covered -- namely, blood, poop, and other disgusting things -- are less than desirable, but I think they work for the game. The original concept of the game has some pretty specific parameters, and I think Edmund McMillen and the Isaac team have done a fantastic job creating the world around the original game. However, there are some characters, challenges, bosses, etc. that are just not fun. I don't care if a character is *hard*, as long as they are fun to play. Most characters, while sometimes giving me temporary grief trying to get some final unlocks, are fun and, despite a bout of rage that might come from a death as one of these characters, I can't help myself from just starting one more run. A -35 win streak while trying to grind out T.Lost unlocks is outweighed by the chance that the next one could be a broken run that destroys even the final bosses. Characters like Tainted ???, on the other hand, are just not fun in my opinion because the mechanic introduced is not conducive to good runs and removes an otherwise ubiquitous mechanic (bombs).

I could go on all day about the different runs, combinations of items, interesting mechanics, ways of breaking the game, and my horribly encyclopedic knowledge of every item, trinket, enemy, boss, character, etc. all day, but suffice it to say, the game is very good. It's fun, it's challenging, and it's got a certain appeal that made me want to complete it in the first place.

Now I think it's time to finally put it away. Thhank you, Isaac."
13756,"This game definitely is one of the best indie games I've ever played and I recommend for everyone to give a try. There is so much content that you will rarely ever get bored. The combat is very challenging for new players so if you have experience in games where you dodge lots of things, then this game is good for you. My brother recommend this game to me, and I loved it ever since then."
13757,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.  Isaac kept to himself, downloading mods, and crashing his game, as his mom watched virtual anime girls on the internet.  Life was simple, and they were both happy."

13793,"As someone who has been playing since the original flash version and as one of the very few who have 100% completed the game, I can say without a doubt that Repentance really completes the overall package and truly finishes off the story of Isaac.

It's by far my favorite game of all time. A true masterpiece. I just can't recommend it enough."

13796,"The most fun you can have playing a video game while not having fun, for all of the right reasons."
13797,"this game is pain, but it's good pain."
13798,"Quick Description:
-The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is one of the most infamous and successful Indie games ever made.  From it's humble beginnings as a game that was destined to fail - to a game that would sell millions of copies and spawn a complete remaster and 3 additional dlcs.  Edmund has outdone himself once again w/ this masterpiece.  I never played the 2011 og Binding of Isaac, but I now have played Rebirth and all 3 dlcs.  I'm 10 years late to the party, but have loved every minute of my close to 65 hrs of playing this incredible roguelight dungeon crawler.

*Notes:
-I bought Rebirth, Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, and Repentance all on sale last month for about $35.  I played Rebirth for about 15 hrs, Afterbirth for about 10 hrs, Afterbirth+ for about 5 hrs, and Repentance for about 35 hrs.  I unlocked a bunch of characters and completed over 100 achievements, but am probably still just scratching the surface of what this game has to offer.

What's Good:
-Good lord is there is a ton of content!  The best games in this genre offer a ton of late game content, but I would be stunned if any game on the market offers as much as this game.  It will probably take at least 300-500 hrs to complete all of the achievements, get every ending, unlock all characters, unlock every item, and complete every player's post-it note.  I've heard that you have to do this on 3 different save files in order to get the true 100% completion, which may mean that it could take way more than 500 hrs to finish.
-I personally think that BOI has the highest highs of any roguelight out there.  Fun factor is a bit subjective and sometimes can be difficult to explain.  This is an area that this game absolutely shines.  Every single run is so fun and exciting.  I'm always bummed when I lose, but I'm just as eager to fire up another run.  It's so easy to hop back in start again.  There is so much variety in every run, and it's really fun seeing what sort of crazy synergies you can put together.  I am yet to have 2 runs that feel similar, which is pretty crazy after 65 hrs.  
-Another strength of BOI is how easy it is to learn the basic mechanics.  The barrier of entry for new players is really low, which makes this a great game for less experienced players to try out.  There is no jump, no dash, no roll, and no advanced mechanics.  You will shoot tears as a projectile, move around and avoid enemies and hazards, and unlock passive and active powerups.  That's pretty much it from a fundamental standpoint.  
-Even though this is a really easy game to learn the basic mechanics, it has a crazy high skill ceiling.  You will be given almost no information starting out.  Some of the pickups have both positive and negative effects, so it's not a guarantee that every pickup will help you.  You will need to memorize every enemies attack patterns, learn where all the secrets are, learn how to efficiently use your money, and memorize all of the item descriptions so that you can end up w/ the best synergies for your current run.  
-Every DLC has balanced the base game a bit more.  I found Repentance to be the most balanced version of the game and my personal favorite.  No matter which version you play, you will still get some insanely overpowered synergies that are really fun to use.  I very rarely ever felt like dying was anyone's fault but my own.  Every once in a while, you will be on the frustrating side of rng or variance, but I found this fairly rare.
-I really love the art design and overall look of this game.  It's a very simple dungeon crawler inspired heavily by old school Zelda games, but it has so much charm and hand drawn creativity.  Every upgrade changes your characters attributes as well as aesthetic.  You will evolve into a freakish monster, badass angel, or something in between throughout your runs.  All of the character animations look great, and the bosses are especially impressive visually.

Could Use Some Changes:
-If you are hoping for a game to hold your hand and guide your every step, then this is not the game for you.  It's intentionally ambiguous and wants you to learn by experimenting and exploring.  There is a sense of wonder at the start of every run.  The story is both bizarre and vague at times.  I consider these things strengths, but not everyone will agree.
-BOI is far more volatile than the other top tier modern games in this genre.  There is way less variance in Enter the Gungeon, Hades, or Undermine for instance.  This game has the highest highs I've ever experienced, but there are also really low moments.  Completing Greed mode to have the Greed donation machine jam after only placing 5 coins is heart breaking.  Nothing is more brutal than dying right at the end of a run, but that is always a risk in this genre.
-The setting and story is not for everyone.  You will deal w/ really controversial subjects such as religion, incest, gender dysphoria, abortion, and tons of poop.  None of this matters to me, but some may be uncomfortable w/ this material.

Thoughts:
-I really can't believe I waited so long to try this.  I was very skeptical b/c of the cult-like following that this game has accumulated over the years.  Let me tell you - it lives up to the hype!  I have played some amazing roguelights over the last few months, but none of them are as fun, challenging, engaging, and addictive as this one.  I was not planning on buying all of the DLC's, but I was 100% sold within the first 4-5 hrs of playing Rebirth.  I didn't expect to play 65 hrs before writing my review.  I have a feeling that before it's all said and done, I'll have several hundred hrs in this masterpiece.

Consensus:
-Best of the Best (Tier 1 and makes up 5% of my reviews).  This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Hollow Knight and Celeste are my two favorite modern games, and both games that have changed my life in really profound ways.  I think BOI is my 3rd favorite modern game, and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend to every Indie fan out there."

I would recommend this game to anyone who has never experienced a roguelike game before and is looking for a new challenge. My advice would be to take your time getting into the game as for novice players the first encounter can seem very daunting, however with time you will start to realise what a master piece of a game this is."

13890,this game makes me throb
13891,"Please fix Tainted Cain on Console. And on steam for that matter. I understand wanting to balance the game by making the recipes random, but this isn't a competitive game. You don't have to ""Balance"" anything. And if you are going to make the recipes based on seed. At least make it consistent between PC and Console. Tainted Cain is unplayable on Console."
13892,its good i guess
13893,Best game ever...
13894,"Simple but effective gameplay with LOTS of unlockables, achievements, and challenges to make sure every run has a meaning. An absolutely fantastic soundtrack with great enemy designs (Monstro being a personal favorite of mine), and lots of characters to choose from so you're more than likely to find one that suits you the most. Just be warned that this game does not hold your hand and is quite difficult, so be prepared to sink some time into this game if you have hopes of making it far.

The only criticisms I have about this game is the lack of checkpoints (but that's more of a dungeon crawler issue than a Binding of Isaac issue) and the fact that most items, cards, and trinkets only have flavor text instead of an actual description on what it does (granted this issue is fixed with a mod but I do still wish that it was baseline).

Overall, an absolutely fantastic game for the dungeon crawler genre and just an overall great game. I highly recommend it if you're up for a challenge."

13905,Orsome game
13906,zica me converteu ao candomblé
13907,this is definitively a game
13908,wow
13909,Always losing to poop. It's kinda great.
13910,YES
13911,"I've been playing TBOI since the first version was released. Given how simple it is at first glance it's outstanding how much hours I've been playing it. There's a number of different dynamics and achievements that make every run different from another. I've also been playing it with my gf with the co-op mod. It's really something.

And though it is in fact complex and require some level of concentration, it's the only game I feel like playing casually just to do something while I listen to new albums.

It really deserves being in everyone's library.
About Repentance I still haven't had the pleasure to buy it. I certainly will, though it seems sadly a bit heavy on the specs. But I don't blame it given how much the mod will add to the game."
13912,"What can I say? ""Over 500 hours of gameplay"" and they already got me there, but still thirsty for more!

"
13913,this is a fun game you can keep playing so many ways to make a run and so many bosses
13914,"Issac is really fun and you can almost never get bored of it
"
13915,bery much aids
13916,hehe
13917,ys
13918,Best pain I've been in
13919,"Dis game good, big fun."
13920,Vine boomed a store clerk in Tesco so I could afford a happy meal
13921,Lots to unlock. Much fun
13922,"Best roguelike ever! Incredible amount of content and item combinations.

It can be challenging at first but once you know the enemies and items its very rewarding.

I would recommend to also buy the Afterbirth DLC."
13923,This is a very good game if you don't already have it you should get it
13924,"When you are daily bored, this game is perfect to fill the void."
13925,pretty good
13926,buy it fool
13927,One of my favorite games of all time. I love the idea that items can come together and make new effects that way. This is my second favorite game to pass time.
13928,yes
13929,Crybaby
13930,"This game is like CBT, but kinda fun."
13931,"So much to do and earn, that I gave up early and went home."
13932,"wtaf, just a bad game, why did i get the game and dlc for $15 ahhh. One of my few bad steam buys, avoid this one at all costs unless you want to sink 200 hours into it before it even begins to get intresting. Bunch of bs smh"
13933,"Finally someone who cries as much as me :D
also fun"
13934,"good dungeon crawl 10/10
"
13935,very good game
13936,"Still not tired of this game.

Also something something Edmund McMillen you little fucker."
13937,it's indeed a game
13938,yes
13939,The only game that messed up my sleep schedule
13940,"cry on doodoo 10/10
"
13941,is good
13942,"it is a game

WASD or arrow keys, i dont remember to be frank

pretty good, i think, dont remember

its okay, i hope.

i recommend, i think

yes"
13943,The best rouguelike i have ever played every run is different and unique. The amount of different enemies and bosses along with synergies between different items is what makes this game great. Repentance has made this game pretty challenging with tweaks to enemies and simply tougher tainted characters and end bosses so its not a cakewalk. However if your down for a bit of a challenge there is plenty of content and fun to be had here. I find myself coming back to this game often to continue the slow but satisfying item unlock grind. I cannot recommend this game enough.
13944,epic
13945,fun
13946,g
13947,just all out fun. can keep me entertained for hours at a time
13948,i like playing as a traumatised child thats a pill addict
13949,"eh, rip off of minecraft, you can break blocks and kill monsters."
13950,one of the best games on steam
13951,good game
13952,Hate this game
13953,ha ha bible go brrrrrr
13954,"This is my favorite game of all time by far. While it's not something you can play on repeat for hours due to the higher chances of a broken keyboard the longer you play in a single stretch, it's such a great game that's different every run you play. The DLC's aren't *needed*, but they add so many layers to the game, I'd highly recommend. BUY THIS GAME!"
13955,Pretty good. Might play it some more.
13956,If you like challenges and rouge dungeon games with unique character skills THIS IS FOR YOU. I hate everything so if  I recommend this to you is because it is something for everyone!
13957,"e amuzant cum se joaca cu sentimentele mele jocu asta
"
13958,THIS GAME IS AMAZING unless ur a shitty Karen christian
13959,good that's all i have to say

13962,bellissimo
13963,PEAK GAMING BUT ACTUALLY FUCK DELIRIUM LIKE OMG IT MAKES ME WANT TO KMS ITS SUCH A SHITTY BOSS AND ALSO BLOAT OMG BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS PEAK GAMING
13964,"I don't even have this game, why can I review it.
Still 10/10 would buy

edit: i bought it"
13965,baby shoot poop 10/10
13966,"One of my favorite games of all time, would highly recommend!"
13967,this is just like touhou but for mentally ill people
13968,when you give mom a headace
13969,The item combinations are so fun to explore.
13970,good
13971,Haha silly child cries at biblical horrors generated from schizophrenia and a heavily religious household
13972,It's uhhh pretty good
13973,does not crash on the laptop and its atually fun. REALLY FUN. although it may be challeging but thats why it is fu.
13974,Love it when the kid passed a kidney stone and started spewing fetuses with gigantic swords that melted satan in seconds
13975,de bingbong of i suck reberth is qool i very liek
13976,Very fun game until you play jacob and essau
13977,I lost my soul
13978,"I'm currently at 136 hours in Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and I have 100+ hours in the original. On the surface this series is a simplistic roguelike with basic controls and a low skill cap. After playing for a few minutes, you'll be quick to understand that this game is much more complex. Collecting items upgrades your character, seeking out secret rooms can benefit you greatly but at a cost, every floor gets harder. Can you overcome your setbacks or have you fallen down too far to get back up?
This is by far my favorite game to pick up and play and it has never failed to pull me in. 15 minutes turns into 45 in the blink of an eye and I've never been disappointed in this nostalgic, charming, obscure, never-ending festival of failure and frustration and ultimately success. I am certain The Binding of Isaac is not for everyone, but I imagine those who don;'t care for this wonderful challenge have not given it a fair try. The team who developed this fantastic game have certainly treated it with so much love and respect and their efforts have translated to the highest degree.
Buy this, try this, cry because of this. Pray to RNGesus"
13979,"Very nice, mother dies 10/10"
13980,great time passing game and its very unique with its story i love these types of games and this is probably one of the best dungeon type crawler style game
13981,"incredible game, addicting, rewarding and fun 100% recommend"
13982,hehe crying baby
13983,"very cool haven't played much but some bugs needed to be fixed, stinki"
13984,its pretty sick
13985,pag man game literally tons of content + not  that much money to buy super underrated game
13986,is good game what more do you want from me
13987,"long story short, your mother is a motherfucker"
13988,Edmund McMillen you little fucker
13989,"I have beaten Mother without mods so many times, but the achievements won't enable, it is driving me crazy."
13990,I like the game
13991,"games challenging, bullshit randomization but thats my luck, storys neat when you dig into it...

but what the hells up with titties on the workshop?"
13992,love it
13993," this is a game that is game, highly reccogame"
13994,"good
"
13995,"Game crashes a lot upon startup, and validating integrity of game files always shows 2 files missing but never fixes the problem. You need to reinstall the game every time this happens, and from what I've researched it happens to a lot of people.
Regardless of the ""workarounds"" to this (like disabling firewall, or cleaning registry, etc.) it's not acceptable for a game this popular to have such rudimentary failings."
13996,good game
13997,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
13998,I hate this game
13999,very good game i would recommend this even though i don't play it often it is fun when i decide to.
14000,"A great game overall, fun bosses, cool storylines, keeps you engaged over tons of hours and theres always a way to progress so it never gets old. (until you get dead god that is XD)"
14001,is very gud
14002,Northernlion sent me here.... He's bad tho

14008,cool game
14009,got cursed eye and it made me want to tear out my larynx. highly recommended!
14010,hard
14011,I love seeing all 500 hours of content on youtube that i cant access because I haven't made this game my career.
14012,this game man you love it & hate it but damn does it have some fun mixed in like a person 21st stuff of fun but some regret
14013,"While I don't agree with some of the changes made in the latest updates, the game still has an enormous amount of replayability even after getting Dead God achievement on 3 files."
14014,"I love how on some runs the game basically just hands you a free win while on others you have the luck of someone who was born without arms and just get the absolute worst things ever.  
10/10 would recommend again"
14015,There is enough of content to feed whole universe.
14016,This game is a black hole that sucks you in and never lets you go. I can't say if the game is good or not because at this point in time anything I say can be misconstrued as stockholm syndrome. But yeah fun game give it a try super fun.
14017,This game keeps on giving.
14018,COOL
14019,its a real cool game. so neat
14020,This game makes me want to die.
14021,The replay ability makes the game worth a purchase.
14022,"Yep, and yes. But also for sure. Definitely."
14023,I can stop whenever I want. I don`t have a problem. You have a problem. What do you mean addiction?
14024,good game
14025,"hard yet managable, constant fun and always random"
14026,it's okay I guess
14027,"Quite possibly One of the greatest roguelikes out there.
it's great, [strike] except for when i have to play T.Cain, Jacob and Esau. T.Jacob, and like half of the other characters in the game, or when i have to fight delirium, or when i look at my win streak, or when i play the game in general [/strike]

10/10 would reccomend"
14028,good
14029,Local Naked Toddler goes into a basement to kill satan. 666/10 best game in existence.
14030,"400 hours of my life that I will never get back devoted to playing a game about a child which uses it's tears to kill horrid monsters and it's mother as the final boss.  I'd say it was worth it, 12/10"
14031,'You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters' - Leviticus 26:29
14032,good gam
14033,"Very fun rogue-like. Objectives and unlockable items give you a reason to keep playing. A lot of care went into item interactions, so no two runs are exactly alike. Lots of final bosses with all the DLC, I would recommend picking it up along with the base game. (Afterbirth+, Repentence, etc.)"
14034,A medium yes
14035,Great game!
14036,-
14037,Just play it
14038,i hate this fucking game so much
14039,"This game is hard and has a habit of testing your patience. This is something any new player should know right off the bat. Aside from that, the story is beautiful and the different enemies, items, and combos can be seriously entertaining. I woulds definitely recommend The Binding of Isaac not just because of the game itself or its game-play, but as a great example of what a rouge-like should be."
14040,this game is shit dont play it please i need help please
14041,Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill...
14042,good
14043,Super fun it started off as a goof but now i cant stop playing
14044,i had this game taken away from me through means out of my control for a week and i was experiencing withdrawal symptoms. 10/10 would get telefragged by Delirium as Tainted Lost again
14045,"grind
"
14046,"Illegally pirated first, worth the purchase."
14047,good game very fun :)
14048,"This game is so addicting, after you grasp the rules and basic understanding you will never stop playing"
14049,it's aight
14050,"So much to do in this game and you don't have to pay 60 dollars for it. That is just the base game, the dlc have added so much more."
14051,C O O M

14063,"Yo era un niño pequeño
y disfrutaba de la vida
convivía con mi madre
en la cima de una colina
jugaba y dibujaba
diversión era mi esencia
sin dolor preocupaciones
la edad de la inocencia.
Mi madre pasaba horas
frente al televisor
solo programas cristianos
y referencias a dios.
nuestra vida era sencilla
Ambos éramos felices
hasta que una voz llamo a mi madre
y dijo algo terrible.
""Tu hijo esta corrupto
y tu misión es rescatarlo
de todo elemento del diablo
debes despojarlo"".
""Hare lo que me pidas
señor de mi vida
librare a Isaac
de su alma corrompida""
Mi madre me ha quitado
todo lo que poseía
mis juguetes, mis dibujos
y la ropa que traía .
Nunca dio explicaciones
y jamás volvió a hablarme
pero se comunicaba
con la voz perturbante:
""Isaac todavía
sigue ligado por demonios
que confiese sus pecados
y aléjalo de todo"".
""Hare lo que me pidas
señor de mi vida
librare a Isaac
de su alma corrompida""
¿Mama porque haces esto?
Devuélveme Mi vida
éramos felices
y ahora sufro cada día
por favor deja ya
no lo escuches mas
pero de igual manera
hubo un mensaje final:
"" Has hecho lo que he dicho
pero cuestiono tu devoción
probare tu fe hacia mi
con una ultima petición
Ve a la habitación de tu
hijo y mátalo
(Ve a la habitación de tu
hijo y mátalo)
(Ve a la habitación de tu
hijo y mátalo).
""Hare lo que me pidas
señor de mi vida
Librare a Isaac
de su alma corrompida.
Entonces un cuchillo
carnicero ella tomo
fue corriendo hacia Isaac
que estaba en su habitación.
""¿Mama que estas haciendo?
¿Por qué quieres matarme?""
Gritaba desesperado
cuando la veía Acercarse.
Entre llanto y locura
y a su desesperación
una puerta trampa
bajo una alfombra encontró
sin pensarlo dos veces
la abrió al mismo tiempo
que su madre
ingresaba a su habitación
pero Isaac se lanzo.
Se sintió a salvo
pero nada es sencillo
ya que algo extraño
sucumbía en todos lo pasillos
se acerco a una puerta
y lentamente la abrió
y repentinamente
con sus hermanos se encontró.
Todos endemoniados
y deformes lo miraban
con impulso vengativo
a muerte lo atacaban.
Isaac no lograba comprender la situación
sus lagrimas de pena
son su ultima salvación.
Un pequeño que su inocencia perdió
una madre que por fanatismo enloqueció
una marca eterna
que conlleva a una cadena
de desgracias y falacias
al poder de la iglesia.
Un pequeño que su inocencia perdió
una madre que por fanatismo enloqueció
una travesía
de enfrentar a los temores
y vencer a aquel villano
que tiene tu Propia sangre"
14064,"This game is the worst, most difficult, most excruciating, most depression-inducing, most anxiety-filling, most painstakingly ""grind"" session-ness, most annoying game in the universe. AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT. This game is the definition of unlimited content, endless opportunities, and never-ending fun. I love this game to bits no matter hard it gets or how much there is to do in the impossible journey to 100% the game. Thank you developers for setting an example of how to make a really good difficult game, how to continuously add content and update the game yet never allowing it to get stale or repetitive, and thank you for loving the game as much as all the players do. <3"

The gameplay never got boring and I think the game is paced extremely well. If you are a fan of roguelikes I heavily recommend isaac and if you have no experience with roguelikes this is a very good starting point."
14137,The game is a fantastic rougelike with so many incentives to continue playing and learning more about the game.
14138,No other game has captivated me and kept me coming back like The Binding of Isaac. I have played thousands of hours over multiple platforms and nothing compares. For me it is the perfect balance of challenge and reward. If you are looking for a game that you can return to endlessly then look no further.
14139,I approve :D

14173,Epic :)
14174,Very fun with plenty of replayablitiy.
14175,isa
14176,It's relaxing. Daily challenges also encourage a bit of competition in terms of high scores or speed runs which I like.
14177,"Just like in real life, I enjoy crying when my mother tries to kill me!"
14178,"Endless replayability and it never gets stale since you're always unlocking stuff, plus if you unlock everything just start another save file and do it again"
14179,For me I just sit back a relax while playing through runs.

14186,infinite gameplay and no repetitiveness
14187,its a good
14188,issac more like eye sack
14189,"The Binding of Isaac. Rebirth, Afterbirth, Etc...

What more is there to say? If you've played any of it at all, you'd know its a good game.
It's a great time sink. It helps to train you to accept repeated failures as a process to
getting better at the game. It is a bit difficult for those who have lost touch with their
reaction speed, admittedly, but its still fun. If you have seen any videos of the
game online at youtube, you'd have more than enough of an inkling what the
gameplay is like.

One full run is bound to be a lot like any other, and yet endlessly different.
I haven't bought repentance yet but I fully intend to once I get the last few items
cleared off my collection list. RNG makes getting some items very difficult
with more and more items in the list after all.

Aside from that, not much else to say. I like the game enough that taking my
time to finish every part of it is something I think is quite reasonably high on
my list of things I want to do for it, which is rare for most games to me.

...Anyway if you haven't actually seen the game at all, just watch someone
play a round or a few in the game and that should give you a good idea of the
shenanigans you can get up to in it. Don't watch too much though, as half
the fun is discovering combinations for yourself.

One complaint I have is that some of the more secretive aspects to unlock in
the game are difficult to figure out on your own and using the wiki to resolve that
feels a bit arbitrary but oh well... It is still a great game."
14190,This game is trash
14191,"I think this game is overall pretty good. Its bullshit, like most rougelikes and theres pretty much no in-between in this game from ""fighting for your fucking life barely making it from room to room"" and ""casually strolling straight through bosses."" But that's just a thing that happens in roguelikes sometimes.

I really like the character variety. A lot of the characters are extremely unique and requiring a completely new way to play the game. The tainted characters are all pretty well designed as well with a few exceptions. But some of the characters are really fucking boring. Both versions of blue baby and most of the older characters without their unlocks like isaac cain and laz (please change laz he's so fucking boring)

Some room designs are actual cock and ball torture and are just. The worst whyyyyyyy

I like this game tho, good time sink when you're feeling lucky"

14216,"This is one of the best games I own. Replayablitiy 10/10
The latest dlc has had a MASSIVE impact on the games polish and content.
Many overpowered Items have been nerfed but in a way that makes them still viable.
THIS is what I like to see in a developer. Don't abandon the project, keep improving, make it even more beautiful.

Get it in a sale, it's more than worth its price. The port for the Nintendo Switch is also very good.
It's a fun game and it doesn't matter wether you've got only 10 minutes or 4 hours in a session.

Also: Do yourself a favor and unlock the items on your own instead of getting a 100% save from somewhere else.
It's worth it. And you won't have less fun. Promise."

14247,"this game is hell, and has made my mental health worse while grinding to greedier mode. 10/10 amazing game"
14248,"This is my favorite roguelike game, hands down. I'll warn you though, you will need to purchase the DLC in addition to the base game to have a proper experience. I'll follow that up by saying the DLC is easily worth the extra money, basically functioning as entire additional games with the same mechanics. It's great!"
14249,Fuck this game
14250,"WONDERFUL ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS, BEAUTIFUL, EVEN. might just be my favorite indie game of ALL TIME atm I swear I can't stop playing and playing It's like a god damn drug but MAN it's good shit. Even with luck being heavily involved it doesn't hinder you too much most of the time and it's p lax on you so you won't get too much bad shit in your run. So with enough skill you can beat ANY run no matter the luck so it's completely fair! Luck can be fucking HARD to perfect but MAN edmund hit the good spot right then and THERE. seriously you should get this game AT LEAST base but you also should get the expansions if you can since they make the game MILES better with balancing improvements, quality of life fixes and additions, and so on. Awesome fucking game imo"
14251,Probably one of the best things I've played
14252,"fun stuff bro, modding community makes it amazing"
14253,"This was a pretty good game, well, at least when I could play, it was good, but at the moment, struggling to start the game since it crashes as soon as I press ""Play Now,"" but i was always a fan of The Binding of Isaac series, so i'm not too upset about it. Over all, was such a great game when I could play it."
14254,i hate
14255,fav game
14256,crying baby in basement with glasses>infinite monsters
14257,"I'm giving this a Negative review entirely for Repentance. Oh, Repentance. I was looking forward to you so much, only to find out that Breadmund secretly hated his fans. I guess working on the same game for years or something fosters resentment.  Why do I say this? Take everything fun about the game up to Afterbirth+, and throw it out the window. Every fun combo? Gone. Good items? Nerfed. What do you get in return? Very, VERY minor buffs to items people never used in the first place. And don't even get me started on the new item weight mechanic. Before, if you played right, you were sure to get at least one really good item that could help carry an otherwise mediocre run. Now? Good luck finding anything decent in anything less than 10 runs, unless you're the hyper hardcore type who thinks that you should be easily able to beat the game on base starting damage. Even with the updates, the game still feels like it's fighting me whenever I try to enjoy it, and the only way one could enjoy it is if they're the hardcore type who wants everything to be as unforgivingly hard as possible. 

There's a few fun characters, but it's only a matter of time before they're nerfed into the ground to because they're actually fun to play, and not pull-your-hair-out frustrating.

Honestly, if you get this game do NOT get Repentance. Everything else is super fun and enjoyable (2000+ hours and counting here) but Repentance takes a dump all over that in favor of 'muh difficulty,' and not even in an enjoyable way. (Seriously, fuck fighting Hush with base damage. What the hell, Breadmund?!)"
14258,I cannot describe how much fun I have playing the binding of isaac. In all honesty this carried me throughout my school years. Grade A game. Would continue to play... am going to continue to play.
14259,"it is good ive been on lvl 1 for 3 hours !!!
"
14260,It's a game that's incredibly deep and arguably one of the best of the past decade. You should play it if you somehow haven't.
14261,"gud game

14262,This is one of my favorite rogue-like games. Different play-through every time.
14263,The Binding of Isaac series is a really fun rogue like game with simple controls. You always have new item combinations to find and try. The art of the game is amazing in my opinion.
14264,Very poggers
14265,10/10 Game literally flawless there r no bugs and its just a good game that will pretty much never get boring there is always something new to do especially if you buy the dlc pack (afterbirth afterbirth+ and repentance) definitely recommend the DLC's  they r 100% worth it.

14275,haha naked kid go brrrr
14276,"What can I say.    its Isaac.  Its been around for over a decade.

Simplistic gameplay and easy to learn rules that slowly unwraps the hidden complexity within.

An enemy blew up near a wall and a passage that wasnt there opened?
Why does this rock have a different color and an X drawn onto it.
What the fuck even is a planetarium.

That and several hundreds of items that you most likely are not going to be able to remember what they all do even after 400 hours of playtime. Items that give way to broken combos that destroy entire screens in glorious displays while you laugh. Either that or you find that mirror and ipecac is horrible together.

My point is.

This game is awesome and will give you hours upon hours of entertainment....   now with splitscreen coop (also works 
online trough steam playtogether)"

14331,yes
14332,"Now that I have gotten every achievement in Isaac (again) I find it appropriate to finally review it. My review will include my thoughts on the base game as well as its expansions.

Rebirth when it came out was one of my favorite games. I got 100% and played almost every day. While the Roguelite Isaac formula keeps the experience fresh, I was looking for more content...

Afterbirth while not perfect overall had more to like than to dislike. The extra content had me going for many additional hours.

Afterbirth+ I frankly just did not enjoy. A lot of the content at launch was just a step down from previous iterations. The new end boss, Delirium (while still kind of broken) was the final straw and led me to take a break from Isaac, having never completed the additional challenges of the DLC.

Repentance as of November 2021 is by far the best expansion Rebirth, nay Isaac has ever gotten. Not only is the new content incredible and expansive, but it also solves many of the problems I had with old expansions. The new characters, bosses, floors, and items are all peak Isaac design. Even after the laborious progress of getting 'Dead God' I still find myself coming back to the game for a run a least once a day. 

With Repentance, The Binding of Isaac has furthered cemented itself as one of the greatest Roguelite games and personally one of my most cherished and favorite games of all time."
14333,"Totally not a review to gain 25 XP for a virtual badge to further gain useless virtual items. Eh, good game :^)"
14334,Poor thing... get him out of that dungeon.. can't you see he's crying :(
14335,"A game that can be replayed almost endlessly. The controls are fine too, progression doesn't feel choppy either. Good game in general
"
14336,Good game. Me like.
14337,"Somehow, some way, they keep managing to bring the game back to prominence time and time again. To me, it's a solid testament to the quality of the game's core, as well as the sheer draw of its dlcs, spotty as they can be at times. From official dlcs to fan mods to workshop items, the game keeps growing in ways few others ever did, and ever will. Now, if only they'd give a price cut to said dlcs for those just now descending into the basement below..."

14352,falta daño
14353,"Isaac... where to even begin with this game? It's now a decade old, and that means despite being a fan for over half its lifespan there's still history to it that precedes my mere... 6 or 7 years with it. The original Isaac is both a revolutionary game that reinvented the concept of a roguelike for the modern age... and a weird, gross experience full of poop and dead babies. Created as a product of one of the indie scene's most brilliant and famed minds... and also his messy history with a closed-minded religious family. Isaac is many things, and that's perhaps why it's endured so long - there's nothing else like it, nothing else COULD be like it, for it contains multitudes. Mostly of dead babies. I cannot stress enough how many dead babies are in this game.

It's also a Flash game, and even back in 2014 that made it unsustainable. This is the version that's actually still playable!

[u]Rogue-like?[/u]
Yes. I know the term is heretical nowadays, with the even vaguer term ""roguelite"" invented to delineate ""pure"" roguelikes from actionized ones, but frankly that's too pedantic even to me, a pedantic porkchop! For those unfamiliar with the term: Rogue was a turn-based game from the early years of public computing that set you in a randomized dungeon every time you played, with a single death starting you from the beginning, everything newly randomized. Anything using this combination of permanent death and random generation is thus a ""Rogue-like"". Isaac combines this with twin-stick shooter gameplay and a Zelda-inspired framing, for a unique experience.

[u]Shooting what?[/u]
Tears. Isaac, a six-year-old boy whose mother has gone into a murderously insane religious fervor (or so it appears), must navigate his basement utterly unarmed - projectile crying is his sole means of offense. This is actually more consequential than it appears - Isaac's tears have velocity and momentum, and which of the four directions you fire in paired with your speed and angle of movement can substantially affect where your tears go. It's an awkward mechanic at first, but after a few hours of play, these controls should be second nature to you, allowing for elaborate bank shots and slingshotting tears past their apparent range.

Speaking of controls, please use a keyboard. This game was never designed for controller, and it uses a great many buttons - even more with certain mods that add more buttons or split actions tied to the same button in vanilla. But, mods are a topic for later.

[u]Items[/u]
The heart and soul of just about every dungeon crawler, what items Isaac manages to scrounge up massively influence the outcome of a run. Every floor ends in a boss room, which will give Isaac a raw stat upgrade - spoiled milk for ""Breakfast"" to increase his health, torn family photos and eyedrops to make him cry harder (thus increasing his rate of fire), belts and wooden spoons to increase his speed... it is here that much of Isaac's dark humor is seen. Clearing a floor without taking any damage to your red health will reward you with a Devil Deal, where you can sacrifice red health for immensely powerful items like Brimstone and the Contract from Below, or refuse them for a chance at an Angel room later, whose items cost nothing but are somewhat luck-dependent to get. Each floor also contains one locked treasure room with a guaranteed item that tends to affect the way Isaac plays more substantially - activated items like health generation, temporary invincibililty, and other useful effects limited by both room-based charges and your single active item slot, and passive items that affect everything from tears (Poison? Boomerangs? Explosives? Lasers? All 4 of these at once?) to your bomb supply (Firebombs? Cross-bombs? EVEN MORE poison?) - and one shop, where money can be exchanged for goods and services, by which I mean utility items like maps and compasses and resources like health, keys, and bombs. There's other rooms - arcades for gambling, Curse and Sacrifice rooms to give up health for possible rewards, Challenge Rooms to fight for rewards, The Seven Deadly Sins as mid-bosses - but those aren't guaranteed. Trinkets vary from situational to stupendously powerful, but you can only hold one. Consumables include cards and runes with consistent effects, and pills that do something different every run, good or bad - either way, each one is single-use. Eventually, in the lategame, these item sources all start drying up, forcing you to make do with whatever you have against the final few challenges...

Isaac's many items all interact in unpredictable and oft confusing ways, but the chaos is part of the fun - especially in the later versions, where almost every effect can be used together for absurd combinations.

[u]Meta-Progress[/u]
Possibly Isaac's most important and influential innovation. The idea of maintaining progress between runs in other prior roguelikes was generally limited to ""here's a box you can shove items into that persists between runs"" - nothing on the level of Isaac's system of achievements and unlocks gating both vast power and increasing challenge. It's deceptively simple on the surface, to the point you wonder why nobody did it before - beat the final boss for the first time, unlock an even more final boss, but also powerful new items that can appear in all future runs. Beat that final boss, unlock even final-er floors and bosses and even mightier items! Beat those, and you're still not done - beating the increasingly many final bosses as all the characters unlocks many more items, with a convenient sticky note for keeping track of each character's feats! Speaking of characters: get lots of health, unlock the slow but resilient Maggy. Amass money, unlock the gambling-focused Cain. Avoid being harmed for a while, unlock Samson, whose rage at pain makes him mightier. There's a lot of characters, and the later one was added. the more complex they tend to be. Despite the run-based nature, the many goals to pursue means there's always a goal to work towards - even 100% completion can just be an excuse to start anew on the other two save files! Speaking of goals...

[u]Choices[/u]
Isaac has a lot of possible destinations to pursue. Even after Mom is slain, you still have choices - descend yet further, and challenge Satan on his home turf? Ascend to the Cathedral, and fight more angelic foes? Kill her fast enough, and Boss Rush awaits. Greed Mode flips the gameplay on its head, substituting exploration with wave-based combat for money, used to buy items to prepare for a final fight. I'm running into spoiler limits, but know there's many surprises in store for anyone who dares the challenge. Furthermore, Isaac innovated other kinds of choice...

[u]Rerolls[/u]
Isaac's other most influential invention, and the most unprecedented by far. Upon defeating a certain angel with a certain dead baby, Isaac himself goes from the ""balanced but dull"" character to starting with the mighty D6, a humble six-sided die that can turn any active or passive item into another one from the same item pool - turning the game's worst items from disappointments into a chance to gamble for something much better. As the game has grown, more and more ways to reroll things have been added - the D20 for consumables, the D8 to reroll your stats, single-use Dice Shards to mimic other dice effects once, the D4 to reroll everything you have - it's limited compared to games that have come since, but still many ways to change fate.

[u]In conclusion...[/u]
Isaac is a magnificent game that I feel a deep personal connection to. Space limitations mean I can't even begin to discuss its expansions, active Workshop modding scene, or my analysis of its piecemeal story. If you're unsure, I implore you to at least try base Rebirth, a cheap buy regularly on sale, and get the complete package later. You'll not regret it!

Unless you get Bob's Brain ten runs in a row. You might regret it then."

The only game where being a crybaby pays off. Worth every single penny.

Protip: mods do exist for this game, like adding QoL to your game with item descriptions,... ."
14373,"Man, I don't even know where to start with this game... there's a billion things to do and they're STILL not done! Play this if you're willing to lose a few hundred hours of your life to the filthy pit below Isaac's house.

Yeah, this was for the Steam badge or whatever. It's not a true review, but I hope you'll play the game. Absolutely worth it for the price compared to the yearly AAA junk."
14374,I played this game a lot with my brother and we enjoyed the game a lot! Decided to buy the game for myself just to show support to the developers of the game.
14375,haha funny blue baby poop
14376,"El tremendo juego, tenis horas de entretenimiento (y enojo), distintas mecánicas de juego las cuales cambian por cada partida que juegas, nunca va a ser la misma partida sin importar las horas que juegues, y demasiados logros para completar, aparte de un lore y animaciones que te dejan así como :0"

14384,"Amazing game that has given me endless hours of fun. Whenever I don't have a huge amount of time to get into something, this is the perfect game for me to spend some time on."
14385,i like this game. lots of poop and babies. u should play
14386,"I've followed this series since it was a flash game and while I enjoy it more on my nintendo switch as it has easier controls it's great to see the amount of love and effort put in to the game from it's creator to the community that keeps it alive, I definitely recommend this game to people who're new to a rogue like style game and enjoy this style game if you haven't tried it out already give it a try as it's definitely worth your time."
14387,very cool very nice

14398,.
14399,"Hard not to recommend this game. Even as someone who never played a roguelike before the first BoI game, this is still one of the best games I've ever played. I've also purchased it on I think every available platform, though the Steam version is the best available. 

The DLC is incredible, however I am pretty pissed that they refuse to support Mac for the FINAL DLC, after supporting Mac for years and years now. It's a huge dick move, honestly."

14401,"Cam de kkt, ratia joc ∕ lipsa de dudui imi afecteaza viata barbateasca careia ii lipseste din ansamblu atingerea ierbii.

Singura solutie care mi-a mai ramas este sa ma pocaiesc la Babi si sa nu mai zic ceva vreodata de strabunica lui Lucian."

14421,"Even as you pour countless hours into this game dying to the stupidest means of damage, you can't help but start a new run right away. This game provides countless hours of fun with each run feeling more unique than the previous one as you unlock more and more items to either make your runs easier or make you wonder why you even unlocked that item in the first place. Either way, this game is extremely addicting and I highly recommend if you're a big fan of rogue-likes."
14422,Good game. You can spend a lot of time playing it.
14423,good :)
14424,ok
14425,Totally worth the price.
14426,Endless suffering 10/10
14427,"Take it from someone who played almost 200 hours of this game. It's absolutely amazing and worth the money, hours of fun and sometimes frustrating game play."
14428,Very fun game and a big introduction to dungeon delving games. 10/10!
14429,great game super fun
14430,"This game will make you cry tears of joy when completing runs. While watching Isaac suffer through the depths of the underground, players themselves gain more and more skills trying to complete the run. Each new character provides a new challenge, the learning curve is really friendly to all types of players. This game had allowed me to rediscover the love I had for gaming. Legitimately is one of the best games out there. 
"
14431,"One of the best roguelikes you can play. It's staggering amount of content allows for so much replayability and can keep you going for hundreds of hours without having unlocked everything there is. The DLCs add so much to the game that honestly they are well worth their price. Yes, it can be hard and frustrating at times, but it will never keep you bored. I'd also recommend checking out the workshop and mods for this game, there are a lot that improve the game (fixing aspects that might be annoying to you) or adding new items and content that will continue to make you be interested in the game even after you have unlocked everything there is in the base game. Amazing game and I absolutely loved my time spent playing it."
14432,One of the best games I've ever played!
14433,"Loved the original Binding of Isaac game, and this remake makes it look awful in comparison.

The Repentance DLC is the best this game's ever been, I played it multiple hours every day until reaching 100% completion, 2 months after its release. It added a LOT of amazing new content, as well as rebalancing older items."
14434,gud gem
14435,"Awesome game, tons of hours of fun"
14436,best
14437,Worth the pain
14438,
14439,"It's a very good game and altough the gameplay stays pretty much the same, every character offers a different play style. Each completed run unlocks something new so it never gets boring."

You made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it's f**King Bad this trash 
game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a
cow on a trash farm you sucker"
14441,"The Binding of isaac: Rebirth (and it's dlcs) is a very fun an entertaining game. It offers a rogue-like dungeon crawler (and very ill minded) experience. No two runs are the same, every single time it will be something unique, randomized. The fact that this game got released in 2014 and it still gets updates, big content filled ones, till the very day is just amazing. I can only recommend this game to anyone."
14442,Pretty good
14443,.
14444,Sadness ahead but in a good way. Tough but fair. This game will leave you frustrated or jumping up with an adrenaline rush when you finally get through the boss you’ve been slamming your head against for days. The fact that this game is relevant and still being updated after this many years is a testament to the love the devs have for little is save (is love the right word).
14445,very gud
14446,Fun and challenging game perfect for anyone looking for a rogue-like platformer. With an amazingly wide item pool the synergies are never ending thus making the player eager to find them all!
14447,is good
14448,Ha ha isek go brrrrr

14456,"Amazing game, highly recommended."
14457,"No matter how many times you reaching end-game, you will keep playing for item, trinket, co-op unlocks.
Plus with mods support, the game are much better each playthrough.

Well deserve."
14458,"I've played this for years, please help"
14459,Always come back to this game even if im not an expert at playing it. Always my go to game when i don't have anything else to play.
14460,Amazing soundtrack and with gross yet somewhat cute characters. The game is very addicting since every run is different and with numerous characters/items to unlock.
14461,Addicted to this game! Lots of fun!
14462,dude i love this game
14463,baby
14464,i cant stop playing

endless hours of enjoyment (sometimes)"
14468,
14469,fun if you wanna spend the time to unlock things
14470,This game is hard to play at first i recommend you watch SinVicta on YouTube to learn about the game. It it really fun
14471,i hate this game
14472,"Played this game since it came out, and it has had a lot of ups and downs, when afterbirth came out, it was great and and fun. Afterbirth plus came out and it was not so good, but they fixed it, made mods work with achievements, and was fun to play for a while. Then repentance came out, and I think it was amazing when it launched, a lot of other people thought it wasn't that good, (For some silly reasons like NERFING BRIMSTONE????). but at the end of the day it was fantastic, and in my opinion the best dlc to release for this game. This is one of my favorite series ever made, even since flash Isaac came out. Thank you for this amazing game and I hope to see more in the future like the new board game."
14473,one of my all time favorite games.  Difficult but extremely rewarding.  Perfect for picking up and dropping whenever you have time to play
14474,honestly set a standard for rougelikes
14475,"absolutely amazing, just hard enough and some amazing visuals as well as numerous weird yet cool enemies, also plays very well."

"
14481,"Despite the high difficulty at times (sometimes fair, sometimes not so fair), fairly high amount of bugs in the current version, and sometimes awkward controls (way too many things use the drop keybinding), I have a lot of fun with this game. It's been a long time since I've played DLC-less Rebirth so I can't confidently recommend it alone, but with Afterbirth+ and especially Repentance, I can't recommend it enough."

14489,ok
14490,"Grew up playing the Flash version of this game and I vaguely remember breaking this game a lot, but I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't love this game to death, Thanks Edmund."
14491,"With repentance's release, this game earned my ""Labor of Love"" nomination."
14492,"Fun game but you have to buy every dlc to get any workshop mods, which is fucking dumb and annoying."
14493,"I definitely don't have a crazy amount of time on this game, and I'm pretty sure I haven't even seen 1/50's of what the game has to offer. But I've gotta say, with the amount of room types, enemies, bosses, items, and so on, you're bound to keep playing if games like Isaac are right up your alley. The devs are still making updates to the game and it's what keeps the game alive.

On another note, fuck Bloat. 10/10 :)"

14502,"Straight up my favorite game.  Usually I'll get sick of a game after a while and not play it for an extended period of time before getting the urge to play again (e.g. Minecraft, Borderlands, Fallout, etc.) But this is the game I play in between.  I never get sick of this game because of the level randomization, different characters, and different paths to follow to the end.  I will recommend this game to anyone and everyone."
14503,How did he do it
14504,"good game! i use it as a timewaster on discord when chatting, or just when i'm bored. endless possibilities, love it."

14546,by far my favorite game ever
14547,"Always something different, and it's co-op."
14548,"The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that has a special feeling to it. It feels like this game has captured lightning in a bottle as it truly is an amazing entry to the rogue-like genre. The base game is extremely good providing an amazing amount of content and replay-ability that will satisfy anyone. However, the DLCs this game has to offer even including the hefty price tag do truly add and expand upon the game in variety of ways. They all together add up to one of the most content packed games I have ever played. I have just over 400 hours at the time of this review and I am not even close to finishing unlocking everything. Although unlocking items is not essential you do have to achieve various milestones to progress the story which does not take as long in comparison with about 80-100 hours to unlock the full story (DLC included). With how jam packed this game is with great content it is up there as one of my favorite games of all time."
14549,Amazing game!
14550,yes
14551,"Great game, now even bigger"
14552,"it is fun
"
14553,The developers really care about this game and continue to improve it. A lot of replayability!

14569,"Gut Game
"
14570,'s good
14571,"I'll admit I wasn't the biggest fan of OG Isaac, so I was hesitant about picking up Rebirth. But my God, did this game turn out good. Beyond the metric ton of new content, Rebirth also feels more accessible in a lot of ways, which is only a good thing in my book. Perhaps part of the reason is the new game engine that runs at a steady 60FPS.

In addition to engine-side improvements, Rebirth's pixel art style feels a lot more polished, and the soundtrack is chock-full of great tunes that complement the experience marvelously. All things considered, Rebirth delivers a very entertaining package with enough content to keep things exciting for many hundreds of hours.

Also, Soy Milk rocks my socks off."
14572,Top Tier Depressing Gameplay and Story 10/10
14573,The game I ALWAYS come back to.

14586,!
14587,"I love this game for the sheer amount of content and depth in it. Every time you play is going to be different, different items, different bosses, different rooms, and the way progression works in this game is by familiarizing yourself with which items to prefer, how to use them, the drawbacks, and whatever synergies there may be, and holy mother of god there's so many. At first you start small with only 6 floors to complete and an itty bitty item pool, but every time you make it to the end the path gets longer, more varied, and each variation unlocks another item you might find the next time you play, and we've been getting new content since it was launched. I love it."

14603,I abhor video games and having fun that is why I keep playing this game after getting all the marks 6.5/10
14604,Repentance has made this game instantly over twice as big. Can't wait for the final release of it to come out.
14605,I love this game so much. Not the best at it yet but im getting there. you think i would be betteer with how many hours i have in it.
14606,very good game
14607,"This rouge-categorized game is so much fun and its so entertaining with the endless amount of questions to be left behind after each phase of the game, an endless amount of wonders, so much to explore and with each passing final boss beaten, there is a question. What will happen next? Will this get harder? How much left is there to be explored? The secrets and characters are well thought but hard to find, and overall, this game is amazing. Especially if this is just rebirth, as of right now there's afterbirth, afterbirth+ and repentance."
14608,"I lie awake at night, imagining how productive my life could have been if I hadn't gotten this game."
14609,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.
You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."
14610,"Many people have mixed feelings on repentance but imo is the best dlc for the game. sure it adds some harder enemies, mechanics and reworks many items for balancing. However ultimately provides many unique items, characters and boss fights that can make you godly without relying on the same build every time. plus mod support which can make the game the way you want it."
14611,You'll get good items and then get killed by some dumb shit. Fun game play loop!
14612,fun
14613,The shooting's pretty clunky but I feel like it adds to the charm. I've just had a lot of fun with this game :)
14614,"This game makes you feel like you are the best player in the world, but then on your next run it makes you feel like complete trash. Like, I am talking, throw me in the dumpster and set me on fire because I suck at this game. 10/10 would recommended this game to other people."
14615,game's been out forever. you can easily put 50-100 hours into it without realizing. plenty of mods to keep things interesting. this is one of the best roguelike games ever made.
14616,I have always loved Binding of Isaac and the Repentance DLC was such an amazing addition
14617,Tainted Lost makes me want to end myself
14618,"is pretty cool guys but it will make you a little angry at times, the mods make it all the better :)"
14619,Different run every time! Decently challenging without being stupidly hard. Fantastic items ranging from absolutely useless to insanely overpowered and fun. The interactions between different items adds an entirely new level to every run too! One of my all time favorite rougelikes.
14620,"While it's not the most balanced game, it's still pretty fun."
14621,"game is good

14626,fun
14627,"Fantastic game. I saw my friend Nick playing this freshman year of college in his dorm, wonderful guy. I transferred and we sadly lost touch but I'm sure if we really wanted we could get back in touch and be peas in a pod again... anyway! He showed me the film Requiem for a Dream and this game, and I absolutely love it, as evinced by my near-450 hours of playtime. Binding of Isaac evolves like few games are able to do, in my opinion. Where games like Rocket League, TF2, or Super Smash Bros. enthrall you off the bat with their gameplay, Binding Rebirth challenges you for a bit--to some this may serve as an unfortunate cut-off point--before booming like a gold rush with new features. Having not played any other true roguelikes I can't give a precise comparison, but for me this game evokes the scope of Minecraft or Breath of the Wild, the gear development of Ratchet and Clank, and plot themes that set it apart from rational day-to-day life the way Kitten Cannon blew my mind as a kid. I'm deeply grateful to Nicalis and Edward McMillen for this distraction, this lovely memory, the mindwarper that is The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

Also, not to knock the original score, but this game is best played with a user-provided soundtrack, podcast or music or otherwise."
14628,"fun game
"
14629,this game is the bane of my existence. 11/10 hell yeah

it wont end..."

14637,Cry about it
14638,I'm amazed at how after all these years after the game was first released I'm still not bored with this game. Just the amount of variety in this game shows why it's one of the most famous Rouge-like games.

14646,Decent
14647,Its good
14648,Hours of rage and tries after tries but the joy of unlocking something new feels so freaking good
14649,If you're suicidal this game might just nudge you off the cliff.
14650,repentance is really good. lots of hours of gameplay to be had.
14651,"I think what I liked most about this game is how easy it is to play, but there is always room for complexity. You can just pick it up and start shooting baddies right out the gate and play it as a classic run and gun. Or, you can try to min/max your build through your run with a wide array of items. The enemies can seem a bit, same-same from time to time, but there are still a few that will catch you off guard. Only real complaint would be that since it is mostly RNG, sometimes it can feel like the RNGods want nothing more than to piss in your bowl of Cheerios. Like, playing a full run with almost no items whatsoever, or just getting only items that are more con than pro. Other than that, it's a great game and I would highly recommend it."
14652,this game copied my irl name

14671,The game is amazing and with the new repentance update it has brought a ton of new mechanics and new characters and items. i really recommend this game
14672,"I'm terrible at this game, but I will always come back to a quick playthrough to unwind. Also steam play co-op finally runs smooth."
14673,"I looked for silver and found gold.

And then I rerolled that gold into some milk.
"
14674,"I think that this game is great. Smooth FPS, good graphics, difficulty progression, etc. But as much as i love this game it can get extremely boring after a while. Unlike the original Rebirth is way easier, but maybe its because i kept getting bad items in the first one. I recommend buying Afterbirth at least, just to increase the difficulty. Even though all the DLCs together really enhances it. Somehow The Binding Of Isaac manages to always keep the Newgrounds charm of the original, with almost no cares in the world about how dark their game can get. Along with that it also manages to have an almost impossible to figure out story line that just keeps getting more interesting. The characters for the most part are unique in their own ways, changing your game every time. Every single time you play you never know if your going to get an extremely good run, or extremely bad. Either way i would recommend it."
14675,Now i suck at 60 fps
14676,"cool game

cool game (x2)"
14677,best game 2021

14684,"pretty cool, also has a jesus theme if thats what you like, good for ALL ages, give binding of issac to a 3 year old, trust me they have so much fun"
14685,Been playing this game since 2015 when I got it on PS4 for free. Unlimited replays.
14686,BLOAT IS A PIECE OF SHIT
14687,Pretty gud.
14688,"Game good, me bad, that's it"
14689,good game
14690,"7/10. The Binding of Isaac is a game that is based off random generation for each seed, and you have to fight to win the game. It's super fun, and it's honestly one of my favorites. I'm totaling over 550 hours including both my Switch and PC accounts. Full review below. I'm marking it as 7 because it's extremely difficult, and while very rewarding to win, it can be soul killing to lose over and over.

I think that the Binding of Isaac is not for easily sickened or faint of heart people. It's a lot of peepee poopoo humor, and lots of arcade style blood and grossness. It's lots of fun if you enjoy that stuff, as sometimes the enemies can be fun concepts of normally gross topics (like colostomy bags).
There's also a lot of innuendos throughout the whole game, many of them having to do with biblical references, or old sayings that refer to abuse and neglect.

-- PC Requirements --
I don't think Isaac really requires an amazing PC to play. I would definitely say that older graphics cards may struggle a little with the latest DLC or with harder levels. This is because sometimes the game can struggle with rendering all of the tears, flies and other entities in the game. This can cause a bit of lag sometimes. I experience this occasionally when fighting bosses like It Lives on my GTX 1660ti. I personally don't find this to be too much of a bother, because all it does is slow down the game to a manageable pace. It can actually make it easier to beat bosses using the lag. Once the lag ends the game doesn't try to 'catch up' so you don't have to worry about going hyper speed and running into bullets and taking damage.

☼ Graphics ☼
I personally love the pixel art that is featured in this game. There is an option for rounded edges, but I don't like it. It's an option for you if you're into that though! I think that the graphics in the game while simple are a development of multiple layers. Ed pays a lot of attention to the background of the game, and uses that to set the stage for the rest of the enemies and items to come. In Afterbirth and Repentance, you even get a 'moving' background in a way where a filter is applied to the background in the Womb to cause a 'flowing' sensation to the eye. I really see this concept shine when you get into later unlocked chapters like the Cathedral or Sheol.

♬ Music ♬
To be honest, the music is probably one of my favorite parts of this game. It's not gonna be some cinematic masterpiece with lots of variety like Skyrim, or AC Black Flag and other games known for their music, BUT I think that stereo headphones in this game will truly provide you a better experience. The mixing in this game is pretty amazing if you ask me, and if I partake in some jazz cabbage, I can just put my headphones on, close my eyes, and listen to the symphony of discord that was created to accompany this artwork of dissent into madness. Each chapter comes with it's own set of music to match the background, enemies, and mood of the game. Fantastic work by Ed and his team.

☠ Difficulty ☠
This game is easy to play, but pretty difficult to master. It's the only bullet hell I've ever played, but I've died... countless times. Actually, no, let me check - 316 times at the time of this review on my PC account. I'm not going to go check how many times I've died on my Switch account lol. 
If you want to see someone who I feel has truly mastered the game, I recommend watching Sinvicta play Isaac on youtube. Man has pretty much 100% the game (which is actually extremely f***ing hard, you have to do it on all three save profiles), so I suspect he easily has over 1000 hours in the game.

§ Bugs §
I've only encountered 1 or 2 bugs AFTER I bought Repentance DLC. I never experienced an issue with Afterbirth+ DLC. The issues I found with Repentance was that once or twice, if I had a certain item combo, in a very specific level, and used it in a very specific way- the game would hard crash. I could go back to the level I was playing, and it would put me back in the previous room. I could essentially repeat this over and over if I wanted. I reported the issue and haven't seen it since. Highly unlikely you would ever experience this bug.

☯ Story ☯
The story is technically very short (you get the entire origin story every time you start the game. Don't worry, it's skippable). The rest of the story is unlocked in Endings. You unlock the different endings as you beat different 'final' bosses throughout the game. I think in total with Repentance DLC, there are 15 or 16 different endings. 
If you wish to go further and beyond, then technically you unlock a smidgen of story with each item and achievement in the game. All items and achievements are innuendos, allusions or references in some way or fashion. Some of them are from an older generation (my dad told me about the item ""Latch Key"", and its references which were a common phrase in the 80's). Others are a touch more modern, or are just straight biblical references. It's cool in a way, though. Most of them are bastardizations of the stories many religious groups tell. It's very cool if you can look at it objectively.

⚔ Gameplay ⚔
Gameplay is frustrating as hell, but it's rewarding when you actually win. Each game is a 'round' in a way. You earn items in that run, you play a different floor map in that run, you fight different bosses in that run. All based off of the seed for the run. If you die, you start a new run. So you never really 'keep' anything you collect in a run. Some unlocks will give your characters starting items, though.
I cannot tell you how many times I have had a really good combination of items, and then I get hit by a stray bullet and die. So many times. I've come to just lay on my floor and pout underneath a blanket any time it happens.

۞ Game time / Length ۞
Each run can be as short as a few minutes. Depends on how long you can last against the enemies. The longest run I have ever had (which was a combo that allowed me to just stand still and wait for the enemies to come within range so they would die) took me about an hour. That's because I went all the way to the final boss for that floor and beat Mega Satan with it.
The reason I also marked that the length can be extremely long, is because the playability of this game extends that long. You can unlock new characters, new items, new chapters, new stories, and always find pretty much something new every time. New combos, new enemies, always something.

$ Price / Quality $
I personally think this game is worth full price if this is the style of game you enjoy. I've bought it twice. Once for Switch (Afterbirth+) and then again on PC when I heard they were releasing Repentance. 
If you can get it on sale, then do it (because saving money ofc), but I honestly don't think you'd be missing out much if you can afford it for full price."
14691,very good i've liked the game for a long time now
14692,Fun game that is challenging and has huge replay-ability.
14693,I play it
14694,brimstone is good
14695,ISAAC BIG FUN
14696,"Really good, you should get it"

In summary: Poop funny"
14698,good
14699,dont do it
14700,Cool game. Easy to sink loads of hours into plus good looking graphics
14701,"My favorite and most played single player Game of all time. An unthinkable amount of content that keeps you coming back over and over. An immense amount of items, enemies, floors, synergies and characters that make every single run unique.

You think killing moms foot with a charge beam coming from your mouth is awesome but kinda weird?

Try letting your aborted fetus shoot its own little fetuses which bounce around like billiard balls and shoot heat-seeking scythes that are connected by electricity and create black holes when hitting an enemy."
14702,Pretty fun
14703,Epic

OBS: the remote play together works, but it will lag if you live like on another continent, but that is just connection issue, not the game itself."
14709,Classic game with great replay value. Loads of goals to work towards and hours of game play without getting bored
14710,Addictingly delightful

14716,"Terrible game, terrible devs, wanna smash my computer and kill myself. 180 hours into this piece of shit, and probably 1800 hours more on the way.

10/10 would play again, and again, AND AGAIN.....AGAAAAAINNNNN......AARRRGGGHHHHHH"
14717,"This game probably has the highest replay value of all of the games in my library, I mainly don't have that many hours in it because I played more of the original and it is a very frustrating game. Altogether though, this game is one of the most polished games I have ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of roguelikes. 9/10"
14718,"If you enjoy rogue likes pick this gem up. I don't like a lot of rogue likes but this one really did it for me, each run being leagues different. With tons of items and abilities. I love it."
14719,"This game is great! Best roguelike ever made. It takes a lot of grinding, skill and luck to unlock everything, but it is not a problem for me. At least there is progress. I love the artstyle and story. I prefer playing with mods, which are amazing, so that I can have a great understanding of the game and more content to play with. 

This game is 10/10 for good game experience."
14720,I always come back to this game when i am bored
14721,"Very fun. So much fun. A ton of fun. Lots of fun.

Game is good."
14746,GAME GOOD
14747,Game crashed right as I unlocked dead god 10/10 would 100% all 3 save files
14748,It's a great introductory roguelike that still has quite a bit of challenge for the more experienced players
14749,"where to start with this game, its an absolute gem, I love just killing time on it and playing it here or there, its absolutely a bunch of fun, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a  game that's a little harder, but still manageable if you learn it"
14750,YES PLEASE!!!!
14751,I will never become back by money
14752,Love this game
14753,YES!
14754,I like it.
14755,"No review can do this Masterpiece justice....this is Indie GOLDEN standards
This game pulls in slowly and weirdly at start....but once you are in mother's grasp....YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE"
14756,"An improvement upon the original in every single aspect. Graphical style, music, content, characters, replay-ability, and most broken or useless items have been fixed and improved. Extremely challenging and fun. This is by far my favorite rouge-like game out there. Recommended!"
14757,i have never screamed so loud at a video game and that has really opened my eyes
14758,"I only have about 9 hours in this game, but DANG! Every single moment of this game has been exciting and fun and I've never gotten bored - and I don't even have the DLC yet. this game easily has hundreds of hours of playtime and so much more with the DLC from what I've heard. This is probably the best $15 I've ever spent"
14759,yes
14760,Based but cringe.
14761,steam told me to review this game so... good game
14762,Fun stuff
14763,"Best game ever! My favorite game! A game that I always go back to when I have time. I didn't like Repentance DLC at first, but after I get used to it, I really love it! Repentance bought so much new content and it makes Issac playtime even longer!"
14764,HH
14765,"Really wished I've played this sooner, probably one of my top picks for one of my favorite games for this year alone!"
14766,this game sucks.
14767,The best game ive ever played
14768,Yes...
14769,G
14770,"A great game with hours and hours of replay ability. Every playthrough is familiar, but unique. The updates to the game add on more content and new challenges to beat. If those get boring you have community mods to use and play as well"
14771,good
14772,just a really challenge-filled game. highly recommended for players who are ready to rage on the spot at any time during gameplay.
14773,Perfect autism grinder
14774,"One of the classics of indie gaming and more specifically rogue-like, but still the best game in that genre for me. It might be not as flashy in a few aspects as other games like Enter the Gungeon and in some ways it can even be simpler than them. But for Isaac that becomes a strength, not a weakness. Tons of replayability and a ton of stuff to unlock.

The release of additional DLCs over the years kept expanding the game, with none of them needed to enjoy and play the base game a lot, but each one adding enough content to make them worth, especially Repentance"
14775,yes
14776,I've barely touched the surface of the content of this game and it's already offered a lot. Definite buy.
14777,"go deep, find joy"
14778,SHIT POOP
14779,"Aye, get it!"
14780,"Ah yes the funny cry poop baby ,very good 10/10"

14782,very good
14783,Trash Isaac
14784,"It's good, should probably get at least the Afterbirth DLC with it but the base game will still entertain you for hundreds of hours."
14785,I literally do not understand how anyone can have fun with this game. So fucking stupid. lmfao
14786,A fantastically difficult game with amazing dark humor intermixed with incredibly low brow piss and shit jokes. It is a personal favorite of mine for it's deep religious imagery and critiques as well as the personal inspiration put into it by the devs. An essential for any fans of the Roguelike or bullet hell genres
14787,AJAJAJAJJAJA
14788,great game. almost perfect. 11.5/10
14789,The most memorable rougelike of all time.
14790,11/10 relax
14791,"Fun, not as good as afterbirth"
14792,It's just more of the same weird nonsense generic shit. Much better similar games exist. It gets a pass from steam users though because it's meta fo and they are all meta fo. Just look at the first two screenshots on the steam page and notice its actual microsoft paint effects.
14793,"lo odio, me encanta"
14794,good game.

14875,"Honestly, I'm writing this review for a Steam Awards Badge, so as you can tell, I picked The Binding Of Isaac for Labor of Love award, and for a good reason.
Okay... so hear me out... Repentance is a good DLC afterall!
When the DLC was released I didn't really care about the nerfs. On top of all new things that Repentance added to the game, it was nothing really. The most frustrating thing about this DLC was how the game suffered from bugs and softlocks. And Edmund fixes most of them in the recent patch. 
So in the end, The Binding Of Isaac was a good product, and is even better now. Edmund McMillen, well done!"
14876,I have spend way too many hours of my life playing this game and I'm not even mad <3 Always a go-to for me!
14877,"this game takes all of your time
worth it
After playing for another almost 400 hours, I finally do have some things to say. 
[h1] Only continue if you know the full story, this includes: Rebirth, AB, AB+, and Rep [/h1]

The pixel art style they took with the game is definitely great. It is alot better, sound effects aswell, and many things polished. Sure, the game still relies on RNG on many many runs, but once you start progressing and killing story bosses and unlocking items, everything gets weirder and a whole lot more fun. The game does not tell you anything, all you know how to do is, move, attack, bomb, and use items.

[h1] The Story Bosses [/h1]
[b] Last Chance For Spoilers [/b]
Of course, there are many ways to finish a run. You have to do certain things in order to unlock more story bosses, and the final story bosses are where the game shines. Except for one, nobody likes Delirium.

Mom - Definitely easy to understand, but a hard fight upon the first experience. You can learn the attacks and champion variants easily.
Mom's Heart - Final Boss of the Womb, it can be a pain upon the first experience and couple of fights, but the pattern is easy to understand.
Satan - First phase, annoying. Second phase is just the stomp like Mom's Leg.
Isaac - Just a simply bullet hell, hard to do upon a first fight/ experience.
Hush - A timed one, you have to get to and kill Mom's Heart in less than 30 minutes, A pure bullet hell fight.
??? - Basically another Isaac bossfight, a whole lot easier though.
The Lamb - Not as bullet hell, but be a whole lot more weary on where you go and make sure to pay attention.
[b] Harder Story Bosses [/b]
Mega Satan - Requires two items to get to, and is also a pure on bullet hell.
Delirium - Mimics other bosses, but with much harder attack patterns and is usually very faster.
The Beast - Final Chapter, and the horsemen are even better.
Mother - Annoying and seemingly impossible the first couple of attempts.

[h1] Items And Miscellaneous [/h1]
The items in this game has been expanded greatly. There is some type of item bloat, but a majority of the items have better use than others. The use items have been expanded aswell with an R Key item that sends you back to the start with your whole build. Now for the characters:
There are 34 of them. 17 that are normal, and usually play the same and 17 ""Tainted"" characters that all have a very unique mechanic. They are all usually creative, and sometimes the normal characters have their own unique mechanic but it is very uncommon. The challenge characters are also a fun time to experience.
Now, if you do decide to take the toll, and go for all achievements. You will have to defeat everything, with every character, and pick up every item. It will be a whole lot of time, but it will be worth it in the end, depending on what you think."
14878,One of the games I've given most time in my life.
14879,"Yes
"
14880,Still waiting on that delirium rework
14881,Затягивает
14882,this game is very good indeed hmmmmm yes child murder
14883,not much to say.. i just love it and i think everyone else who played it loves it too!
14884,"Fun game, it will eat all your free time"
14885,E
14886,The more I play the more I like this game. Every single run is different after more than 500 hours.
14887,it's simply as good as roguelikes get
14888,good game
14889,"It's a great game, but it can be difficult at times but when you have a good synergy it can be game breaking. 
I love the fact that every run is different and unique. The only thing is hate is that with the new update the donation machine has been made useless after filling it up."
14890,A game definitely worth playing if you have the money for it
14891,good game

14899,Very good
14900,Extremely fun and addicting game each run is completely different with new items and floor layouts. Would recommend the game to people who like bullet hell and grinding type games. Fighting Ultra Greed and Delerium make me die inside.
14901,nice work isaac
14902,"i've played this for 8 hours because i am a no life and enjoy every bit of this game, it is one of my top tier games and if i would sign a contract to play this in a dark room with 1 lamp to play this i would."
14903,"Probably one of the best roguelikes I've played, well worth the price if you're into them."

14922,Really an excellent game
14923,"A simple game that follows the formula of the original Legend of Zelda but develops it into something unique, fun, and extremely engaging.

14939,"Just an all time classic in its prime with the new döcout right now
"
14940,Why it so hard to 100% complete?
14941,"Of all the hours that I have played the video game I can say that it is: the most addictive, difficult, entertaining and fun game that is one of my favorite games of this and the following year."
14942,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."
14943,eyesic binder
14944,yes
14945,“my favorite synergy is painkillers and xanax”
14946,"This is by far the most flawed game you will come back to again and again, there are so many flaws that should break the experience, crashes, bugs, unfair final bosses that incentivizse constant restarts, and yet I come back. This games has more fundamental flaws than near any other I have played, but It's still a game I play and enjoy. Binding of Isaac, is a game worth playing, and while I would recommend playing some of it's contemporaries more to other people, if you like rogue likes, the sheer amount of content will keep you engaged for a long time."
14947,Big man try kill u
14948,kinda cool game i guess idk doing this for the badge lol
14949,Amazing game. Tons of new content.
14950,"I have over 700 hours in this game and there is still more for me to experience. Needless to say it's very easy to get your money's worth in this game. It has a lot of kind of ridiculously accurate depictions from the most famous biblical stories right next to even more famous internet memes. One game could be 3 hours or 3 minutes. Skill only applies up to a certain point, you have to get lucky or get dead. Keep the wiki open because there is no way to remember what all items do.

Sometimes I suck so bad at this game that I get upset and have to take a nap. Make sure you don't have high blood pressure before picking up this game, your eyeballs might pop out of your skull. Although that does increase your damage output, it's not without it's downsides. The reason this game uses tears as bullets is because you will be crying until you have about 200 hours in this game."
14951,This game is very addicting. So much to unlock. So many achievements. It's a great game on top of it. Makes time fly.

14956,"If you want to get this game and all the DLC (and you do, there's little reason to hold off), then you'll be paying a little over $50. It's very much worth the price, as long as this is the kind of game you'll enjoy. If you're not sure, try out the base game, as the integral experience does not change much throughout the DLCs.
Have fun."
14957,i hate this game
14958,its very hooking game (Y)
14959,To this still one of greatest accomplishments in Roguelike video games - that build and continues to build on its original premise. Its great
14960,"«Alea iacta est!», but it's not Rubicone, only Isaac's d6."
14961,"This game is the goat.

I mean sure, you do need all of the dlcs for the full experience but this game is a never ending package of content.

Repentance made this game 2 times bigger, not only by the amount of items but the amount of synergies and details, like really small details you never expected to work and its just really cool to see, im a sucker for those kind of stuff.

Either you only get rebirth or you get afterbirth AND repentance, Afterbirth isn't good alone, its playable but they kinda jinxed it with this one, thankfully Repentance fixed tons of their past mistakes, the devs have also stated that they plan to fix delirium and rework the void (one of a few afterbirth mistakes)

All in all, they did a really great job with this game and repentance, you will definitely get your money's worth with this game, unlike most triple A games."

14989,"Highly recommendable, basically the definition of replay-value.
This has been my favourite game for several years and I still love it.
Although it can be a bit frustrating at times, this masterpiece of a game will teach you to keep on trying until you succeed.
It is unexpectedly rewarding to get new achievments and unlock new items or features.
Each character is unique in its own way with a completely new gameplay experience.
The amount of synergies between items in this game is tremendous and (most of the time) can lead to very interesting runs.
Thanks to the randomly generated run-seed each run is fated to be mesmerizing.

I've put countless hours of gameplay into this game now, and I can assure you if you buy this game, you are in for an experience you won't forget. The binding of Isaac: Rebirth is definitely (in my eyes) one of the if not the best rogue-like games ever created, a hard recommendation from me.
Overall 109/109, would complete at least two times again :)))))))."

14999,"It starts of so simple. Just learning the mechanics, enemy behaviour, the cryptic item and trinket effects. Then you get a god run. You unlock some new characters. You unlock more levels after defeating Mom so many times. Then it clicks. That realization. The ""moment"" if you will. The moment you see what is ahead of you in this game. So many ending, and characters to get them with. So many challenges to unlock more items and consumables. It just goes on and on and on, waiting for you to unlock all its secrets.

15005,This is a great game that makes you occasionally question your sanity.
15006,It's good.
15007,"This game is a difficult but entertaining roguelite bullet hell. The number of items is staggering and the amount of challenges will keep you playing for a long time. If you liked the first Binding of Isaac, you will love this one."
15008,"Awesome game, loads of content, updates corrected most of the issues.
 Isaac is really a deep game, although the base gameplay is simplistic, it talks about very dark yet very real issues such as Religious Extremism, or Child Abuse, and more!
You can also simply go for the gameplay and ignore the entire lore, and the game is still tons of fun; but beware, the game is not that easy."
15009,"I would have never thought after all my years of living that I would love a game as much as I love this one.
I gave Flash Isaac a try after getting my ass kicked in Enter The Gungeon because of the similar styles and it was also collecting dust in my steam library. It was all down hill from there.
It's definitely a game you're going to have to put some time and dedication in and through all the blood, sweat, and tears you'll find that this game is just a gem. 
Endless gameplay, awesome community, mods, and so much more.
If you're looking at reviews for this game or you see this right now, I need you to stop and buy this mf already. I can write a whole as novel on this game but no one wants to read that. 
I need you to put this game in your cart, download it, and then kill your mother already."
15010,My save got erased because of steam's Olympic game...my button pushing on xbox controller went into binding of isaac at the same time. didn't find out until it was too late. rip.
15011,Buy it.
15012,"this game gave me hypertension





would play again"
15013,"Infinitely replayable and the recent patches have made things even more fun! If it wasn't for the need to whittle  away at an ever growing steam library, I would have way more playtime than what I have currently. Edmund please bless future runs."
15014,"One of the best roguelites, even after all these years."
15015,gud game

15017,This game is more addicting then drugs
15018,"Never did a game make me feel so much emotions. While playing isaac you can experience all 5 stages of grief, overwhelming joy, despair, hope, depresiion and much more! You hate this game so much, but you cant stop playing it. The best ""regret all your choices"" simulator. Have fun playing all 34 characters(including all dlcs) featuring: a ghost that cant handle more than 1 slap per room, another ghost who cant handle even a single tap on the shoulder, a child so angry that he cant die, a character thats a literal embodiement of anybody with an annoying little brother, multiple character who encourage masochism and a living corpse that has acquired the power of [b]capitalism[/b]. Overall the game is pretty fun while having a ton of replay value, so if you like that this game is just for you."
15019,"It's a little hard to get into, but if you like roguelikes, you'll probably like this"
15020,omg so gud
15021,I've always enjoyed playing this game and with true co-op it makes it that much better when playing with friends!

15023,"The Binding of Isaac was a game I bought at full price (I want my damn money back) mainly because Cyberpunk 2077 turned out to have been overhyped and thus wasn't as good as I thought it would be (no endgame+ as of this review). So I chose this game to play because I wanted to see if I was a closeted masochist (still undecided) and the game is admittedly somewhat... fun. So why wouldn't I recommend it? Well...

The lore of the game is kinda depressing but to be honest I don't really care about it. The actual thing I care about is the constant nerfing in this game. A certain unlockable character was recently nerfed so bad he became RNG trash. An apparently great item that only appeared every once in a while was nerfed because no fun is allowed. The donation machine was nerfed for some reason (probably some idiot complained about this somehow being OP). I could go on but you get it. I would have never bought the game if I knew the people behind it f@#$ing nerfed everything because they feed on the tears of their fanbase.

Yes I am salty but I paid a lot of moneys for this game that I regret buying in the first place. I will not become back my money (because I have too many hours on this game so I can't refund) but I am not going to buy the sequel if it gets made."
15024,extremely re - playable  with a million fun synergies to try out
15025,Nice Game sss

15032,"Look, it's Isaac, it's [i]the[/i] roguelite that singlehandedly kicked the genre into the mainstream. The publisher has its problems, but the devs and designers absolutely deserve the few euros that buy you literal thousands of hours of playtime, even without any DLC. If you enjoy roguelikes, this is the one."

15061,hundreds of hours still lovin it
15062,ok
15063,This game has kept me coming back for years. Worth full price.
15064,"I started playing the first Isaac back in 2013 when I was 14 years of age.
I continued over the years and always came back, enjoying (mostly) every moment of the game.
Each run is different and the variety of characters, items, rooms and challenges is what makes this game stand out.

The modding community is awesome and allows for even more fun than the game already is!
Repentance is the best expansion that a fan like me could've asked for and I am so grateful that the journey ended like it did.

Whether you are a long-time roguelike fanatic like me or are just starting to get your hands on this genre, trust me, this is a perfect way to start your journey.
This is money well spent."

i also want to bash my head against the wall whenever i'm done with a run. sometimes in a good way.
great game reccomend it

But if we confess our sins to him, He is faithful,
And just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us, from all wickedness."""
15138,It gud
15139,"Amazing game, very well made, sprites are amazing, fights are amazing, just overall a really good well thought out game."
15140,"In my opinion; The Binding of Isaac: Repentance is the best rougelike, even to this day.
Ton of content.
Good difficulity. Characters range from easy to bullshit, but are still fun.
Great soundtrack. Just wish they brought Glitched basement from anti-birth
Great visuals. Repentance really did a number on this.
Amazing amount of synergies. Best and most amount of any game.
Great community mods. Both high quality and great meme mods.
One of the best communities of any game. Never had a bad experience with other community members.

Overall i give this game a rating of: I will become back my money / @edmundmcmillen you litte f**ker (10/10)"
15141,"I'll never get rid of him.
absolutely my favorite game, 100% sure. I got almost 1000 and never get tired.
Gameplay: Difficult at first approach, especially after the last expansion but with infinite possibilities to overcome it. Many secrets and alternative routes not to mention the achievements and elements to unlock;
Graphics: very simple yet well-kept, the 8bits will never go out of style;
Soundtrack: Creepy at the right point and now (small spoiler) voices have also been inserted at certain stage in the game;
Controls: I personally play from the keyboard, but if you want to play with a friend and he or she will need the joystick you will still have an excellent feeling of the controls.
Light to Install and quick to play.

Lots of secret characters to unlock, countless bosses, alternative paths and items and upgrades that will make each run unique and different from the previous one.

Rated 9.4 / 10"
15142,Game has such immense replayability and a vast amount of unique content. Art is well suited to the games style and has you questioning your sanity and morality at various points. Thoroughly recommend to all!

15159,It's good because inbetween wanting to crack the screen you unlock stuff
15160,I like Isaac
15161,"The Binding of Isaac is a game that I have spent a long part of my life playing even if my hours aren't all that high. It's one of the staples of the roguelike genre and has received many updates over the course of its development with possible plans to add more content even after the games' supposed final DLC Repentance released. The gameplay is simple, but the gameplay loop is addicting with every run varying with the many items in the game. The final DLC adds an insane amount of content in its own right with many new characters, items, bosses and floors. This game is definitely worth a try if not for its charm and reputation alone, and yes, I am writing this for badge progress for this year's 2021 Steam Awards. That aside, please play this game, though be wary of how much time this may consume, it's definitely very addicting if it clicks for you."

15178,I hate this game pls play it
15179,You MUST play this. Binding of Isaac is genre defining: it's the best rogue-like there is in my book. It is addicting and has insane replayability. The amount of secrets to uncover is mind boggling and there will always be something to unlock or work towards every time you start a new game. Highly recommended!
15180,It's good.

15204,Good game even though I suck.
15205,"Very great game,i love it with a passion."
15206,"the binding of Isaac is a game that features Isaac our character, but did you know this is the prequel to the prequel of the joker as Isaac is betrayed by his mother who is a puppet of society so Isaac kills his mother as she gets what she deserves and then he kills Satan for a check mark and then we move on the next character who is also Isaac(still joker) this goes on for about 800 hours..."
15207,hmmmm
15208,PACE PICANTE!!!
15209,"fun game with infinite replayability where in each run you either:
1. eat shit and die
2. get op as fuck and one shot everything"

15211,Yes
15212,Best game ever.
15213,"i like it, very fun

15215,It's good.
15216,"I fucking hate blue baby

Update: I also hate Jacob and Esau"
15217,The run™
15218,"Finally finished (for now?) with the arrival of the 1.7.5 and 1.7.6 patches. It's been a long, slow road, but Repentance was so massive and so expectation-shattering that Isaac has more than earned my 'Labor of Love' vote for 2021.

If you've somehow made it this long without playing this and you're looking to get into it, there is a MOUNTAIN to climb in challenges and achievements. But if you love roguelikes, this beloved remake to one of Steam's all-time kings of the genre will be worth every hour and dollar spent."
15219,"Absolutely outstanding roguelike. Probably my favorite of the entire genre. Thousands of things to do, tens of thousands of items to unlock and millions of combos to try. If you have even the most remote inkling of an interest in roguelikes I highly suggest you check this one out! 

- Nominated this game for Labor of Love in the 2021 Steam Awards -"
15220,An amazing game with infinite replayability
15221,"One of my favorite games ever. There's a learning curve, but once you start getting the hang of the hundreds of items it makes your runs much more exciting. Every run is different and it can keep you entertained for hours. Also great if you want a quick gaming break in between school or work. Definitely recommend!"
15222,"This game is amazing but it also answers the question, ""Can there be too many achievements in a game?"" The answer to that question is yes, oh my god yes."
15223,best gam evr
15224,not bad!
15225,"Amazing game, I can cry at domestic violence and deal more damage because of it!"
15226,Every time I die in the game I want to pull one of my teeth out. It's pretty fun. 10/10
15227,sick(ening)
15228,"Writing this review for the 2021 Steam awards, nominating this game for the ""Labor of Love"" award. I'm nominating this because The Binding of Isaac: Repentance released in March of this year but I can't nominate that specifically so this will have to do.

The nomination feels only fair though. My reasoning is thus; The original flash version of Isaac released over 10 years ago at this point. Rebirth released in 2014 as a ground up remake of that  the version which was straining under the weight of all the additions it received over time. Rebirth was a solid remake in that regard and between then and now Rebirth  continued to receive various updates and additions in the form. These took the form of Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ but towards the end of those releases it started to feel like the creative well was running dry. The Afterbirth+ booster packs released in a fairly janky state and were relatively light on content and were pretty much just mediocre overall. At this point any future expansions seemed unlikely.

Then the fan community started to gain traction and a few prominent fan expansions rose from that scene. One specifically, Antibirth, received official endorsement, support and integration into the main game as the expansion now known as Repentance.

I never played the mod Antibirth so I can't really compare it, but I will say that Repentance completely surpassed my expectations in terms of both quality and content. And this is considering that it launched with several features, mechanics and items missing which the developers are still in the process of fixing and improving. Even in that state it surpassed all my expectations, and seeing how many of these features have been fixed it continues to impress.

I've played this game for over 700 hours and nearly half of that was spent just tackling Repentance content, and I play this game purely with purpose, mostly achievement hunting, and to get that much time out of a game like this and it rarely if ever felt boring speaks a lot to its value for money. You could, and many do, just play this for thousands of hours on self motivated runs or challenge attempts to increase that value proposition even further.

I know some people felt like Repentance ruined a good thing by changing things up a little too much but honestly, after the dust has settled it's clear that most of the changes were needed and the game has indeed benefited greatly from them.

Not to say the game is perfect, there are still several key parts of the pre-Repentance era that went unchanged but there have been various promises that these will be looked at in a future. If the same amount of care goes into addressing those parts of the game then things can only get better for this game.

So yeah, a real Labor of Love for what started as a quaint little flash game over 10 years ago. Very few games get to live this long, to really see their potential truly realised."
15229,Great game.
15230,"There's so much replayability that I don't even know what to say about it, and then there are also a ton of mods that go from QoL additions to balancing changes to even more content to plain cheating. It's a work of art featuring babies crying on poop. ART."
15231,it's pretty good
15232,fun
15233,"game sick, butt go fart"
15234,get
15235,Played so much of this and every run feels different. Newest expansion really breathed new life into the game

15237,omg the bible referenced the binding of isaac holy shit
15238,amazing
15239,Super fun and relatable.
15240,One of the most fun games to learn and play. Sometimes it may feel unfair but other times it's just really enjoyable to learn and play.
15241,yes :thumbsup:
15242,Very good

15248,the best game
15249,"Love the game, never had me bored :D"
15250,Still haven't unlocked even 1/3 of the achievements and items. I'll probably play this 'til I die.
15251,"Isaac is a rogue like, so every play is different;
Isaac (the original) is a game who exists since 2011, so there's tons of thing who slowly came up in updates;
Isaac is a game who rewards the player for mostly everything, so is either easy and hard to achieve everything
Isaac is a game who first you play for entertainment and then to kill time…
Isaac is a game where you'll spends years unlocking everything, but just for fun

So, yes, buy it, it's somehow endless"
15252,"i suck absolute ass at this game but it keeps drawing me in somehow

edmund get out of my head"
15253,Good gaem
15254,"I've played this game for a few hours or so, it's alright."

15258,The game I'll never 100% but will always play.
15259,I will not become back my money :)
15260,"Great game!
Easily one of my favourites, that i keep coming back to!"
15261,Cry
15262,Great game. Drives me nuts but I love it.
15263,"Despite playing for an absurdly amount of time, I've yet to unlock everything.  This game consumes my soul."
15264,"Honestly The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of my favourite games, mixed in with all the DLCs added to it, there is thousands of hours of content  in the game.
The game will kick your butt sometimes but when you get a few great synergies between items, getting OP runs is what makes this game fun.
There are a multitude of characters to choose from as well, some really easy to win and others super hard to get wins.
The game is quite hard to get into without knowledge of what everything does, but there is mods and many websites to help you understand what every item does!
Buy this game"
15265,good
15266,very good game
15267,"It's an endless wealth of gameplay, and Repentance manages to add even more twists into it's formula. The quintessential roguelite."
15268,The most complete roguelike you'll ever play. A masterpiece
15269,It makes me want to play die but its fun.

15285,"One of the best Rogue-likes I've ever played. Each DLC is worth the money, especially Repentance."
15286,THE BEST INDIE GAME
15287,"If roguelikes werent already named after a game noone remembers, this would be the game that would define the genre the best. Its a pretty good game to play while listening to prodcasts or videos if they arent too exiting like technical talks or other stretched out videos you woudn't listen to oterwise."

15300,"This game is nuts, I definitely do recommend this to everyone."
15301,"It's been nearly ten years since a friend gifted me this game (or rather, its predecessor), and unless KIlburn decides to add some more characters in the future, this week marked the end of my experience with it.

When writing a review of a game 7 (or 10) years after its release, it's hard not to get a bet wistful with the retrospective. The mutual enjoyment of this game kickstarted one of my relationships, and then it nearly did so a second time. I watched people hack the riddle of The Lost mere days after Rebirth's premiere. A year later, the secrets of the expansion were guarded by a proper ARG, and I saw it unfold in real time on reddit and twitter. I saw Edmund McMillen, Isaac's designer, becoming a family man, nearly quitting gamedev, and returning to it. Over the years, this game, which started as a throwaway project for Edmund, became something akin to symbol of indie gaming itself.

In many ways, this journey over the years was as much part of the experience as the games themselves. I feel a bit sorry for the people that only now start their journey with it. Last year, as part of replaying Flash classics before the technology's discontinuation, I played a few hours of the 2011 original. Vanilla Isaac seems more cohesive, a more visceral a creepy experience better communicating the themes of an abusive childhood and resulting nightmares. Compared to it, Rebirth is much more ""arcade-y"". It plays smoother, the graphics are cleaner... but something was lost in the translation. Over the years, it has become an even more different beast, and now Repentance marks passing the torch to another developer, who pours his vision and ideas into it. In a way, it transformed from a metaphor of childhood to one of parenthood, of releasing your child into the world."
15302,yup
15303,"CLASSIC. very fun, buy immediatly"
15304,Is amazing it keep getting these huge content packs. Have been playing since the flash days and it just gets better.
15305,One of the best games I have ever played.
15306,Beautiful and fun. Highly recommend to every kind of gamer.
15307,A game I'll never stop coming back to
15308,This is a good game.
15309,Stupid baby man cries about it.
15310,Is gd
15311,"Out of all games where you can cry on faeces and have money pop out, This is the best one."
15312,"stupid fun, give it more than a few attempts and youll be addicted"
15313,good
15314,it's ok
15315,"Simply one of the best pieces of art ever published to the steam store. 

Outstanding Story/Lore
Great Game-play - Potentially hundreds upon hundreds of hours to unlock every item
Amazing Soundtrack

Everyone should try this game, no question
"
15316,"This game can be frustrating at times, but it is still an amazing game, and it gets even better with mods.
If you are looking for a Rougelike to play this is definitely the one to go with."
15317,FITS of RAGE
15318,really good game.
15319,"Great game, would recommend"
15320,"This game is so incredible, I poured way too much time into it but I won't ever regret my decision. It cured my dog autism and ressurected my hamster. Life peaked with this game and it can only go downhill from here. My last moment on this earth before the grand AI take over will be playing this game.
I'd **** Edmund as a gift for bringing this masterpiece to life."
15321,"This game brings me lots of pain, but in a good way!"
15322,Good !
15323,Cool game
15324,"Where to begin with Issac? it's hard to believe that it's 10 years old, but it has stood the test of time. From all of the new updates, DLC's and community staying with it, i believe it is one of the best rouge like games out there. There is nothing more satisfying than having a ok run then becoming a hyper god of death with to most insane group of items. Another thing that made me love this game is the mods. I haven't had this much fun with mods since l4d2. It also helps that there is so much to do in the game, and as much as this game can be really annoying sometimes, it always leaves you wanting to beat it in the end. 8.5/10"
15325,"This game is disturbing, filled to the brim with secrets and unlocks, and hard as hell. Definitely recommend. I also recommend not looking up anything, if you can help it, figuring out what items do is part of the fun."
15326,"What is there to say really. This game is really, really dope,"
15327,one of my favourite rougelikes with lots of replay value especially if you have the DLC.  Defiantly worth picking up!
15328,i hate this game especially when im playibg it.
15329,"fun, classic"
15330,My hrs on record = my review!
15331,great
15332,"The game is good, I'm just not good at playing it"
15333,big pogs
15334,Never gets old. Infinite replayability. Very nice!
15335,YES
15336,"Still one of the best indie games i've played. However it also kills your sanity slowly due that single item that ruins your perfect run. Plus with Repentance, adds lots of new content and sinergies, yet got a lot more harder. Worthy game? For sure."
15337,+1
15338,ezy
15339,Its GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
15340,Good luck Isaac! Luck can help you.
15341,"This game has sucked so much life energy life out of me it's unreal, my friends don't talk to me anymore and my family doesn't even recognize me; anyways 10/10 one of the best Roguelikes ever made"
15342,"I hate playing Isaac, it's awesome"
15343,easily one of the best rouge likes I have had the pleasure of playing
15344,"What can I say about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth that hasn't already been said?

It's the definitive rogue-like game. It's got a million things to hate about it, but it's got a billion more to love.

There will be times when you've hit your limit dealing with the game's shenanigans, like running into a room with 6 champion bonys and losing your devil/angel deal, but there will also be times when you're having more fun than ever before, clearing out rooms in a single shot and showing that end-game boss what you're made of. What I'm getting at here is that the game is a lot of fun, but it has its moments where it frustrates you beyond reason. You could argue that all rogue-likes do this, and you'd be right about that, but I feel like Rebirth is the most abusive in that sort of relationship.

The DLC is a strange batch. Repentance is, in my opinion, the best iteration of Rebirth, and is well worth the extra price, while Afterbirth and Afterbirth Plus are whatever at best, though you need them in order to get Repentance anyways, so I guess it doesn't really matter all that much.

(Also, the game has good workshop support, and a plethora of awesome mods that range from quality-of-life improvements, silly re-skins and sound replacements, and entire expansions worth of custom content.)

Long story short, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a fantastic rogue-like, the definitive of the genre. It is a very fun and very frustrating game at the same time, but it will always have you coming back for more, for just one more unlock, until you've gotten them all."

15346,yes.
15347,bao
15348,"Best game i ever played
"
15349,"Isaac and his Isaac, Lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs while his Isaac watched Isaac broadcasts on the Isaac. Life was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That it, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac: ""Your Isaac has become Isaaced by Isaac. He needs to be Isaaced"" ""I will do my best to Isaac him my Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, Isaacing into Isaac's Isaac, Isaacing all that was Isaac from his Isaac.

Again the Isaac called to her: ""Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to Be Isaac off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac, and confess his Isaacs."" ""I will Isaac your Isaacs Isaac. I have faith in Isaac."" Isaac's Isaac replied, as she Isaaced Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac.

One last time, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac Isaacing to her.

""You've done as I've Isaaced, but I still Isaac your Isaac to Isaac, To Isaac your Isaac, I will Isaac one more Isaac of Isaac."" ""Yes Isaac, anything."" Isaac's Isaac Isaaced.

""To prove your Isaac and Isaac, I Isaac a Isaac... Your Isaac Isaac, will be this Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac as an Isaacing to me to prove you Isaac me above all else.""

""Yes Isaac"" She Isaaced, Isaacing a Isaac's Isaac from the Isaac.

Isaac, Isaacing through an Isaac in his Isaac, Isaaced in Isaac. Isaacing around his Isaac to find an Isaacing Isaac, he Isaaced an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he Isaac open the Isaac, just as his Isaac burst through his Isaac, and Isaac himself Isaac, into the Isaac Isaacs below...

The Isaac of Isaac: Isaac of the Isaac.﻿"

While most of it has been without assistance I still feel this is probably one of the best rogue like/lite games you can play.  Course I played on console first, but couldn't carry over my progress. Simple to play, impossible to master? Maybe just really hard to get a ""perfect"" run, but once you do, you'll save the seed."

Has some mild issues in the mid-completion state, some runs feel snowballs that turn into avalanches and allow for clears without any thought, other runs offer absolutely nothing and can be incredibly frustrating and unfair... but it's a roguelike, what do you expect?

15488,"This game makes me feel so much pain yet so much joy. The game is super intricate, every DLC is super worth it, and while some bosses (FRICKIN DELIRIUM) are a bit bs, but the great thing is THAT'S THE POINT!! It's a game of pure skill while also rng being a major factor, with some runs never getting off the ground while some become more insane than you could imagine from a game like this. It's truly a work of art, and if you aren't too affected by some darker themes and enjoy roguelites, then this may be the greatest one out there."

Easily the best game about a child suffocating in a box. Would recommend."
15502,"I value replayability and variety in my roguelikes, and in my opinion no other real time game does it better. There are so many unique powerups and the ways that they combine is extremely interesting, and the way that the game gives you more and more tools to play with over time keeps it interesting pretty much forever. However, I would not say that the moment to moment gameplay is fantastic. It's a little dull and can feel cheap or unsatisfying at times. Basically, if you're looking for a great roguelike this is one of the best, if you're looking for a well put together game this is maybe not what you want."

15504,"Very fun, lots of content."
15505,it's better than among us so it's a 10 out of 10
15506,"Not gonna lie, I can't keep count of how many times I died because of bs RNG or millisecond decisions you have to take here and there. However that didn't stop me from continuing and pushing on. And all of that for those juicy achievements and a nice spot on my profile page.

After I had finished Afterbirth+ and gotten all of those achievements, I was extremely relieved, hoping to never ever touch this god damn game again. However, when Repentance dropped and I couldn't resist the urge to purchase it, I was also met with a new set of achievements. On the verge of deleting my Steam account, I decided to go through with the horror that would await me. 

At first I thought I just had to complete 2 new characters entirely, plus 2 new completion marks that got added for each character. Didn't seem like a big deal...

Until my friend told me that EACH character had a ""Tainted"" version, requiring you to complete those characters ENTIRELY as well. He told me I couldn't do it, so I tried to beat Repentance as well.

Absolutely no clue how many 100+ hours I pumped into those new characters, one thing's for certain: 

F*CK PRE v.1.75 TAINTED LAZARUS AND JACOB & ESAU. The newest update made them possible to actually play and thank f*cking god I didn't have to spend 200+ more hours into those characters alone.

Furthermore, I enjoyed my time with most new additions :))

10/10 game. if you got suicidal thoughts, don't pick this game up

"
15522,"This game has a lot of different options and ways to play. The multiple characters and modes allow gameplay to feel fresh even after a hundred hours of playing. The hundreds of different items and millions of different builds make each run interesting. 

The game is a bit difficult, especially to newcomers, but I think after playing for a while you can definitely get used to it. The one thing I have an issue with is that it is sometimes difficult to understand how to progress in the game. However, I am aware this is a developer's choice for progression to feel unclear sometimes."
15523,shit tons of shit.
15524,"I've played every itteration of the game with and without mods, Rebirth, the og flash version, Antibirth, Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, and now Repentance. This game has been with me for a very long time and I've been in love with this game for as long as I can remember. It is my favorite rogue-like ever and i implore you to play this game yourself. It's had its rough bumps with Afterbirth+, but its overall completely worth evry penny."

[hr][/hr]

[b] Part 1: Introduction. [/b]

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the best roguelikes ever in the industry (Thanks to Edmund McMillen). In the game you will see many unique bosses, items, characters, procedurally generating locations and much more that you will find yourself during the passage.

[b] Part 2: Difference from other games of a similar genre. [/b]

Unlike other roguelikes, this project has a deep history of its creation. Most of all I remember that in the game each passage is like a new one and this causes excitement in you, because you think: ""[i]What will happen next?[/i]""

[b] Part 3: Impressions of the project for 500+ hours [/b]

My emotions simply cannot be conveyed after such a long time in the game (It speaks for itself). So I recommend this game to everyone for passing, because a lot of content has appeared in it since the release."

This game is charming in a way unlike any other, with enough content to make your head spin. Seriously, I play like 2 good runs and I have 25 new achievements, it's awesome. Can't recommend this game enough, but I'll try anyway. Buy it, for real, it's that good.

15642,"This game is too hard. I don't recommend it if you're a baby gamer like me. I only got this game because it featured a baby named Isaac. I didn't expect there to be so much violence. And poop. It is still my favorite game, somehow."
15643,I have sold my soul to this game

15653,"one of the best
"
15654,meh.
15655,"The replayablitiy of this game makes it extremely addicting to play. Whenever I'm bored and can't find anything to do that clicks with my attention span, I end up finding myself on this game completely winging it since I have like no idea what half of the items do. Modding community makes this game infinitely more fun and hilarious. 
This game series is a classic that has an extremely intriguing underlying story to it and I highly recommend playing it if you're looking for something strange, albeit incredibly entertaining to pass the time. Who knows, maybe you'll want to 100% the game like I want to.
10/10 IMO Definitely worth getting into, especially if you like putting together puzzle pieces of story information!"

В Крестовом походе приняли участие четверо самых могущественных европейских монархов — германский император Фридрих I Барбаросса, французский король Филипп II Август, австрийский герцог Леопольд V и английский король Ричард I Львиное Сердце. Также союзником европейских монархий выступил правитель Киликийской Армении Левон II. Третьему Крестовому походу предшествовал захват Иерусалима Саладином в октябре 1187 года."

I love this game with all my heart, just for the little moments, the synergies, overcoming the ""ULTRA HARD"" challenge despite all odds, and so many more small things... The DLC have only made it better, this is one of the best indie games of all time."

"
15705,So much replayability
15706,"Incredibly fun and addicting rougelike dungeon crawler that presents players with a unique experience for every run. Each character provides a unique way to approach your run, and each item may change how you decide to play. The humour and references aren't obnoxious and the music slaps. While I still have much more to experience and achieve, this is likely one of the best indie games I've played with seemingly endless amounts of content on Rebirth alone. I will unintentionally end up spending hours on one floor just gambling in the arcade to try to collect more trinkets and items. 9/10 (wish there were a few more tracks as the music can sometimes get repetitive)."
15707,Surprisingly addictive.
15708,great roguelike with an interesting theme

15741,if you can't see your character during a fight it means you're winning
15742,"You will never leave... DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!! It is imperative that you do not play this game as it is known to cause addictive tendencies at the expense of your sanity... you will continue to say over and over again ""One more run, ONE MORE RUN and by then you should abandon all hope... for the statement that you made... was made HOURS AGO. There is no escape.... THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BUT ISAAC, (also I would recommend this game, I would recommend this game as it is actually one of the best games I have ever played)"

"
15744,eung
15745,"Eh It’s alright, I guess"
15746,I put off playing this game for entirely too long and I regret that now. Hopelessly addicting with satisfying strategy and game play to match. I can't recommend The Binding of Isaac enough for fans of rogue-likes.

"
15748,pretty good

15769,ThIs Game IS REALLY REALLY GOOD CUZ YOU NEED TO KILL YOUR MOM HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA
15770,"played over 450 hours, cant get enough LMAO"
15771,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of my absolute favourite games of all time. No other video game have I pumped so many hours and effort into with the goal of completion. And even now, standing with my full completion achievement, the game still has new and exciting runs and combinations that I've never seen before. With each expansion came more and more things to do, ways to play and challenges to overcome, and I had an absolute blast. Even with the ones that were so hard they felt like pulling teeth, hahaha. 

The game is hard as nails, and takes practise and knowledge to get through. It rewards exploration and experimentation, and takes the sheer randomness in it's stride, with each run completely and wildly unique. It's a gold standard of a roguelike and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody looking for one (and somehow hasn't seen this behemoth on the horizon already).

Just... Don't shoot for full completion. Learn from my mistakes. Go outside. Hug a tree. Smile at a bird. Drink some pond water. Please."
15772,"Worst game I've played, my sanity is gone"
15773,It's ok (some tainted characters and non tainted Jacob and Essau are pain in the a*s)

Ok thats it"
15788,The game makes me keep playing it

15791,"You can spend hours and hours on this game! Lots of fun, and very challenging."
15792,poop
15793,Amazing
15794,yes
15795,"750 hours on Steam + ~500 hours on Switch and today I've finally finished this game. The Binding of Isaac is a masterpiece and one of the most intense emotion rollercoasters I've ever experienced. Shout out to Edmund McMillen (though I will become back my money), _Kilburn (ty for all the hard work on patches!) and all the other Antibirth devs, Ridiculon, Mudeth (!) and Danny Baranowsky! Thank you for this unforgettable time. I will be looking forward to any future updates and projects!"
15796,I fucking hate this game.
15797,game good steam please stop asking me this
15798,hi good game buy it
15799,Cain meta.
15800,truly one of my most favorite games. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone
15801,goog
15802,isac
15803,"I would heavily recommend this game, its very fun to play even if this is just rebirth, by itself. repentance DLC recommended because it adds way more content but this game is amazing"
15804,l
15805,pain and suffering
15806,"You should get this game. not much else to it. if you like games where you could have ultimate power from hell or heaven and smite your enemies into nothing... then this is the game for you. 

ps. Repentance is the best upgrade to this game in my opinion"
15807,
15808,"best game 10/10 i would play that again,matter of fact ill do it"
15809,This game is okay.
15810,"Great game!!!
I will not become back my money"
15811,"so many hours of fun
"
15812,hate this game
15813,Everything
15814,Boring.
15815,"Small child kills shit for half an hour then dies to some bs, would recommend"
15816,I LOVE THIS GAME
15817,"This game is hard. If you're prone to throwing controllers, be warned that this might make you do so.
Sometimes it seems like the game is against you; you don't get consumables, your items are trash, etc.

But now and then you get good stuff. You have more money than you can spend. You break the game, take it by the scruff of the neck and wipe the floor with it until it's so shiny you can see yourself smiling in the reflection.

Now and then the most difficult bosses die at the press of a button. If you're lucky, you might one day go so far as to actually crash your game when it can't render all the amazing stuff your tears do, as your damage skyrockets, your enemies melt before you and the game just goes ""Nope."".

And that, my friends, is what makes this game worth playing."
15818,"When i first started watching youtube videos of this fantastic creation, i was a tad interested but i didn't quite understand the depth and inevitable ability to drag you into the rabbit hole of synergies and strategies, this comes as no negative towards the game and its absolute power to have insane replayability, honestly buy this game, buy its DLC, get immersed into the laws of Isaac, thank me later."
15819,Best star star star **** game of all time!
15820,GOOD GOOD
15821,"I enjoyed this game by myself and with friends, truly a good game"
15822,"Okay, first off, my 390 hours in this game on Steam at the time of this review is incorrect. I have played well over 1000 hours on console and Switch as well. 

Now for the actual game......


I f**king hate this game, don't purchase it if you want a happy life."

15829,"Cry, Mald, Cope, Seethe
"
15830,"One of the best roguelike, just buy it. :)"
15831,Prime example of a replayable rogue-like
15832,It's pretty aight.
15833,its alright
15834,"Mucha caca, recomendado"
15835,50+ hours.........and 1000 more to go with this unending nightmare of child abuse. it is a must play!
15836,"Best game it is very challenging and completing everything seems impossible but it is not if you out the hours into it, it has the best workshop. The game idea is very original, the characters are great and I like the religious references. I would recommend even if it is at full price, truly worth at sale price."
15837,die. so much.
15838,its like gungeon but different
15839,"hush makes me want to commit coin flip
"
15840,play it
15841,"Edmund McMillen continues to keep the Binding of Isaac series alive with an unending stream of new items and characters.  If you love a good rogue-like and occasionally have 20-30 minutes to spare that can turn into an hour, each iteration of Isaac is more addictive than the last.  You'll come to love certain items and hate others, and eventually you'll find out why you were wrong and why the strong ones are weak and the weak ones are strong.  In the end, you'll find out that you have no idea what you know about this game and you'll love it."
15842,500 hours in and I'm only 30% done with the game
15843,"the game is great fun, with replayability being the main point of the game. mod support is A+++ and when i play the binding of isaac the last thing i want to listen to is the binding of isaac"
15844,Good.
15845,I've never been in an abusive relationship but I imagine it's pretty close to this.
15846,cry on poop the game: rebirth
15847,IF YOU WANT A SECOND LIFE YOU HAVE TO HAVE BUY IT!
15848,It's good ol' rogue-like fun. Buy it
15849,Masterpiece.
15850,"good, until it's not"
15851,Good
15852,lost further sucks but less
15853,This game makes me hard.
15854,"The Binding of Isaac is one of if not the best rogue-like games out there. The amount of content is too much for your brain to comprehend, the difficulty is challenging but fair, the story is simple but good and the game is just fun and addicting. to get the best experience of this game, you have to buy the DLC's, the last and best one being the Repentance Expansion Pack DLC where they added so many new enemies, items and more. I swear you will have a period of time where you only play this game for weeks just trying to beat all the final bosses or at least trying to find out how. The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, especially with Repentance, is just phenomenal game through and through. If you like roguelikes, it's worth the money, trust me."
15855,Fun game. V.good
15856,"this is my most played game on steam by a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG shot. worth it, especially with the dlc's"
15857,game broke less then 1 min after
15858,"if you want to neck yourself best game 10/10. if you value your life then dont play 
"
15859,yeah
15860,its kinda good i guess
15861,The game that defined my love for the roguelike genre for the last decade. It's my eternal favorite.
15862,yis v nice 10 oudda 10
15863,YeS.
15864,really nice how it is randomly generated... You can keep on playing this game again and again... over and over..
15865,fun but also painful
15866,Issac funy dance
15867,This game is great love the style I am just scratching the surface of it. It reminds me a lot of my life as I am also bald and have troubles with the devil.
15868,mmmm  dio
15869,good
15870,"This game is very painful at some moments, been playing since AB+ and Repentance ramped up the pain by 100x. But oh my god is it good at making the player feel good for accomplishing shit. You don't know how good this game can feel until after you see 2 completed Lost sticky notes. One of my all time favorite games ever, stop reading reviews, buy it."
15871,I don't know why but this has become my life and i like it
15872,"Great game with a constant challenge, it is similar to the older Zelda games in that you are always in a dungeon."
15873,The Binding Of Isaac is hands down my favorite game. Its in my opinion the best rouge like ever.
15874,"EVERYTHING, except Repentence not being able to be played on IOS"
15875,fun
15876,"blue baby more like blue balls i have mutiple  ..........
"
15877,baby man cry on poo
15878,"Extremely good game but the possibility of getting a run that's disgustingly broken + the overwhelming number of fun items to unlock makes this the ultimate ""just one more run"" roguelike, so beware if you value your free time."
15879,IT'S GREAT
15880,i hate this game
15881,"Extremely fun and addictive, definitely recommend"
15882,qe
15883,This game makes me mad every second run and I almost broke my monitor once.... Great game 10/10
15884,good game
15885,"You're [strike] Mom [/strike] Mum, speaks to the big dude upstairs and tries to kill you... it's the same as before, but better with more death and stuff."

15893,It's ok. Can entertain you for a an evening or two.
15894,umm.. i have to much hours in this
15895,It is fun : )
15896,it's pretty good
15897,It's a classic for a reason.
15898,"so i have been playing isaac on my mac for over 130 hours, and recently i haven't been able to open it and its not because of the system requirements (i've checked) so does anybody have an idea of whats happening"
15899,Isaac should man up and stop crying. My mom beats me everyday and I dont cry about it. Nerd.
15900,yes
15901,I have owned this game since the day it came out. Straight out of the gate i was blown away with how far it come from the original flash Isaac. I've poured my blood sweat and tears into this game going through the stages of grieve over a lost amazing run or experiencing every emotion under the rainbow when i win a run. Even now 7 years after it came out it still doesn't get old. If you're into dungeon crawlers i highly recommend cause in my personal opinion no other game in the same category comes even close to touching the binding of Issac in terms of the crazy amount of synergy's and items in general. the possibilities in this game are endless with over 700 items how can you ever expect to see it all. 1000 hours in and i feel like I've barely scratched the surface. I highly recommend  giving this game a shot. It's one of my favorites of all time and you can easily see how much effort Eddie and his team put into this.
15902,"game removed black fly :)
"
15903,"An absolute banger. Cheap ass game for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of new, fresh gameplay. Everything modern games should strive for. I've owned this game on multiple accounts and platforms, so don't let my hours posted here affect how you view my opinion, buy it already."
15904,Bad
15905,great game lol
15906,1000 hours of pain and praying to RNJesus. Still worth it.
15907,i hate this game; 10/10.

15929,"Many hours spent on original flash Isaac, many spent on Afterbith+ on PS4 and after many years not playing, I'm back on the Isaac train with the release of Repentance. It's like a brand new game for me after having not played for so long with so many new items, synergies, rooms, biomes, bosses, enemies, it's good to be back, Isaac."

15960,"I was in the very stereotypically early 20s gamer affliction of not being able to enjoy video games anymore until I picked up this bad boy

+This game genuinely rekindled my ability to enjoy video games for longer than an hour
+LOADS of replayability
-you die a lot
-my girlfriend gets angry at this game a lot and she takes it out on me by verbally abusing me and comparing me to very ugly enemies found only in this game 
-i have since broken up with my girlfriend and she still compares me to monstro and the bloat very regularly

Hard 10/10"
15961,"The Ultimate Time waster, 637 Achievements, 34 characters, 100+ Bosses, and 500+ Items. What's not to love? Every run does not feel like a copy of the last, unlike certain roguelites that lack the amount of variation TBOI has. This is definitely a game for the achievement hunting type, or if you just enjoy literal CBT in video game form. Amazing game, Egg McMuffin and the crew outdid themselves."
15962,this game sucks dont reccomend
15963,"Nothing like it out there, frustrating, hard, seemingly endless amounts of unlocks.

But just about every room is fair, the controls are simple and accurate, and you can do some bonkers stuff when you get deep enough in the game details.

This is what you get with a decade of fine tuning, adding items and fixing bugs, the most complex dungeon run game in the world!"
15964,i put so many hours into this game for the game files to crash on me twice and i loose all my progress and i contact the people that made this game and they dont even reach out to try and help would not reccomend this game to anyone becasue it will waste your time
15965,It's aggrivating fun.
15966,"Bought the base game, got a lot of hours on it, then got the DLCs and those were worth it too, its arguably the best roguelike I've played and even when I get absolute bullshit powerups it doesn't hurt to reload and try again, I almost forget that it was intentionally made to be punishing"
15967,sad boi
15968,I love this game i love issaac isaac is so fun fuin ufn i love it so much i play it lots its very fun i am going tfor all the achievements then I am takinga rbreak from this game but EVERYONE shoud buy and buy dlc very fun

15974,"Very fun and enjoyable game with endless amounts of synergies and runs. I have been a part of the fanbase since 2013 and started playing in 2018, I have watched hundreds of videos and reviews of the game. My one problem is that my game will no longer start after this latest update. I have uninstalled then reinstalled my game, and I have also uninstalled all of my mods. Other than this slight problem 9/10 game."
15975,"clueless, mald, cope, repeat"
15976,Veddy good
15977,just bad and cant even mod it
15978,"I have been playing the Afterbirth+ DLC for about two years on Switch now, and i just got Repentance earlier this week.This game is an experience unlike any other you will ever find on Steam. The  endless possibilities throughout the base game cane be even further extended through the amazing modding community, which allows endless amounts of complete entertainment. The ~$50 you will spend on this game is worth QUADRUPLE its value in pure fun. Trust me, you wont regret buying this game."
15979,"Took me a little bit to really get into, maybe half an hour or so, but after that, this game is really fun."

Game always crashed once or twice every three hours but since the last update it happens regularly every 15 mins or till you pick up certain items (In my last run Items that generate health). So until that gets fixed, it's a real pain to play. So please Ed, fix your game"

15996,Everything is awsome
15997,fun
15998,"I love Isaac

"
15999,"The Binding of Isaac is a very challenging, highly addicting rogue-lite that is definitely worth looking into if you enjoy the  genre.  It has a high replayability with hundreds of unlockables, multiple characters, and multiple final bosses. The gameplay is kind of like a cross between the original Legend of Zelda, and a bullethell type shmup. If any of this sounds like your cup of tea, definitely check it out --- it's worth it. You will definitely get your money's worth. My only issue with the game is that there is a balancing issue, with some item combinations being game-breaking, and others being game-ruining. That, and it is filled with bloat (no, not the boss), such as having to 100% 3 files to get the final achievements. Other than that, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone curious. Grab all the DLC expansions for the best experience!"
16000,"I used to love this game, and played it all the time, but unfortunately this game just seems to get worse with every DLC and every update. The developers seem to have some weird obsession with making the game less fun as they remove more and more item interactions, and ""fix"" things because they don't like how the community plays the game. I get that they want to make the game hard, but removing item interactions because they were unintended, and the community likes playing that way seems petty to me."

16006,"Just an amazing game! It's not an exaggeration when I say it's the game I spent the most time with in all of my life. Every run is a diffrent experience. It's a great game that you can always come back to. Only downside is that it requires a lot of time to really get the best out of the game, but that does not mean that the time isn't very well spent!"
16007,"Countless times I facepalmed so hard on this game.
This game is pain all  through out.
Good game!"
16008,"I created my steam account *solely* to play the OG Isaac and waited excitedly for the remake. That was 8 years ago. I was 14 years old. I am now 22 years old. Why am I still so bad at this game? How does anyone get good at this game? It feels like there's endless things to do and unlock and it's pretty hard to get bored of it since there's always more, especially if you suck at it, which you likely will for a long time!"
16009,"this shouldn't be good but this is unfortunately the best rougelike ever
no other game in the genre replicates how satisfying and impactful items are here"
16010,bread
16011,A great game if you like it when random stuff happens both in and against your favor. Tons of replay value and unlocks will keep you coming back for more.
16012,"Played this game for only 3 hours so far, endless pain and endless fun"
16013,video game
16014,good game
16015,Hell yeah
16016,Many tears
16017,Seriously one of the best OGs roguelikes out there in my opinion. This game offers a lot of challenges with acceptable difficulty and simple gameplay that can extend with your own strategies and meticulousness. You can spend a lot of time into this and won't get bored easily because there are tons of different items and synergies that every new run feels unique. Definitely a must pickup if you love the roguelikes genre.
16018,Do you hate yourself? play it
16019,"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
"
16020,"I got this game about 4 years ago, and when i first got i thought it was pretty boring. but when my friend got it i ended up playing it more, and more, and more until i absolutely LOVED the game. all in all its really fun"

16037,cool
16038,it's good
16039,"I want to still love this game but with every dlc comes new ways to piss me off. Up to afterbirth+ the game I felt is was great. I could still beat the game with a bad build and I didn't feel cheated when getting hit. However, with the new repentance update which I was unfortunate to purchase, everything sucks now. You still have have the same gameplay of binding of isaac but now everything is worse. Normal was the hard mode in afterbirth+, hard is a whole new thing in repentance. The most recent update is what killed the game for me. Donation machines are useless so going to the shops is borderline useless now. Imagine spending hours putting 999 coins in the donation machine to use but once you use bombs, that is it. You can no longer gain more money based on how many bombs you have. Devil deals aren't worth it anymore for any character but good luck getting an angel deal because it rarely gives it to you anyway. Every new item hurts your play through rather then benefits it, and all of the amazing items were nerfed heavily. You'll have more fun sticking toothpicks through your eyes."

16068,ISAAC... AND HIS MOTHER
16069,"The game used to be challenging and fun, but more and more the creators take everything fun away from the game. If an item is strong, expect it to get nerfed in the next big update. A good way to get more items? Expect a nerf. Anything that is beneficial to the players AT ALL will be nerfed in the future. The creator really must hate his audience, as this last change is OVERWHELMINGLY awful."
16070,"I have many more hours than 3 from playing on console and i'll say... this game could be banned under the Geneva convention law of ""Unnecessary Suffering"""
16071,"SO MUCH FUN! Never gets old 8.5/10 since there are graphical issues when mixing certain items, also don't get if you don't like gore!"
16072,"This game was fun, but had balance issues.
That was until repentance came along.
I'm at 800 hours as of writing this-- I promised, years ago, to write a review if I ever ""somehow got to 800 hours in this game.""
I was expecting it to be a negative review- one talking of a boring cycle of repetitive gamebreaks.
Then Repentance came along.
Even without Repentance, this game was fun, sure- but now? It's a goddamn masterpiece. It deserves it's place in gaming history."

16087,"yes
"
16088,"Great game getting slowly killed by nerfs.
Trying to balance a game that SHOULDN'T be balanced, mainly by nerfing every single good item, mechanic or character, will just kill the overall fun."
16089,funny poop monster
16090,good
16091,I hate this game. It's often times openly hostile to the player in some pretty wild ways but I cant stop playing it so I guess try it? Just uhh be ready for everything to be terrible

Would highly recommend."

16132,I hate this game. 10/10.
16133,"Very good game! Kind of difficult for a beginner, but very re-playable."
16134,"I'd recommend the original Binding of Isaac over this. It's cheaper and better. The art style is better, the balancing is better. This remake (even without the tons of expansions) is just filled with so many pointless new items, rooms, and bosses. New content is just forced into the random pool without any actual consideration for whether the inclusions will improve the game or not. It just muddies the well considered design of the original."
16135,"Such a great game. Unique builds, nice modes, many characters and endless fun.
Not my type of game but enjoying it!"
16136,lol
16137,"fun,yes,mods fun too"

16156,sus
16157,"This game is addictive.  Loads of fun, very replayable.  Only issue is that it can be very grindy, and RNG can suck sometimes."

16178,this game is the literal definition of love hate relationship
16179,"This game is Really fun! Every time you play its a new experience. There's Hundreds of achievements to get, so start the grind. This game is one to try so I recommend it. The game has so many bosses and each seem cool and new. This is definitely one of my favorite games out there."
16180,Good
16181,Jesus approved!!
16182,Shit of piece
16183,"One of my favourite games of all time. I still haven't gotten all the characters (yet) and am only a fraction of the way to completing all achievements, which I intend to do.

If you like roguelikes, hunting achievements, or experience a dopamine rush when you find a good item in a video game, you'll probably like the Binding of Isaac.

The music is also amazing, and the artstyle is great, if grotesque."
16184,Is addiction healthy?
16185,The game is super fun. Really easy to pick up and start playing whenever. There is a great storyline and the various combinations of items add a lot of cool RNG to a very simplistic game.
16186,This is a game you can easily pour hours into and not get bored.
16187,absolute fantastic game very addicting and very creative challenging game. easily one of my favorites to play in  my spare time.

I'm over a 1000 hours into the game and still have so much content to unlock, mainly because I'm bad at the game but over all 10/10 would recommend. amazing art style and the community is full of talented awesome people, loads of mods make the game even better again if you get bored of vanilla. Love it xoxo"
16239,fun

16251,Tainted Jacob is a balanced and fun character to play!
16252,I could watch this kid cry all day
16253,This game was so much more than I expected it to be.  I have played for nearly 40 hours and am still having a blast.  It is extremely addicting and very easy to start over after you die.
16254,shit's whack
16255,"My day be so fine

16257,I cant believe they turned a twitch emote into an entire game thats crazy
16258,The moment I realised i was murdering living piles of crap with piss and tears was the moment i realized i was going to stick with this game.
16259,Best game about crying on poop in a basement ive ever played. 11/10
16260,It's okay.
16261,soul sucking rage and infinite replay capability. #1 go to game when I have nothing else to do.
16262,"Honestly just a great game overall. There are tons of different items, all with their own unique effects, and tons of items that have synergies with other items. The variation of different characters is also great because it almost lets you chose your own play style. I'd definitely recommend getting the game to anyone who enjoys rogue-like and bullet hell games"
16263,"Binding of Issac is one of my favorite games. It is easy to play it for half an hour or half a day despite the type of game it is. It's always exciting to explore the randomly generated floors and get so many different combinations of items and trinkets along your adventure. There is always something new that I'm learning as I play and that feeling of not knowing everything despite being 240 hours in is still great. The art style is simple and effective. I never get bored with all the different types of enemies I'm up against. With so many endings, its exciting to keep trying different paths. This is the first game I am excited to go after achievements because of the reward system, with each achievement you unlock more items you can find.

The only negatives I can give to the game is the multiplayer is a bit iffy. I love the multiplayer don't get me wrong, but it sucks that the extra players MUST use controller. 

Still 10/10 game."
16264,"Very fun game. Will steal your soul and time, and can be very frustrating at times. But you always come back,"

16269,The most accessible roguelite there is in my opinion.
16270,"Best Game EU West
"
16271,very fun
16272,"If you enjoy Rougelike games, this is a must play. The replayability is super high for this game, and I don't even have any of the massive DLC's yet. Yes there is a random factor to runs, but I feel like that adds to the fun. Getting to flesh out your build and having items that work well together is very satisfying. If you like games like Enter the Gungeon, you will love this. 
"
16273,it's swag as fuc
16274,oh my god so much poop and blood 10/10
16275,"Fun, mildly frustrating gameplay that keeps every run new. what's not to love about that?
"
16276,"Very awesome game. Countless hours of gameplay as there is so much to be done in the game such as beating the game with every character, Different gamemodes, lots of Challenges and hundreds of achievements to get for the 100%. I highly recommend picking this game up as it is will be a fine addition to your library"
16277,"This is Edmund McMillen opus magnum, a true masterpiece that will hook you for hundreds of hours. No two runs are the same, every character is unique and has its own very distinct feeling. Getting to know all the items, combinations, chasing new unlocks, exploring the tale of Isaac... Just try it on your own, the only thing you may regret is the time spent in the basement."
16278,pills
16279,This is by far the best roguelike game out there. Better with controller also imo.
16280,good
16281,shit inmuy moputh
16282,"Love the game
Don't buy it for the sake of your own sanity, but if you do, download my mod. Thanks"
16283,"I've played this game for 2,400 hours (Xbox and PC) and have loved every second of it. Of course like most games, you will probably experience an annoying bug or glitch in the game once or twice before beating it in its entirety, but overall it is a great experience. Playing since the release of Rebirth on Xbox, I have experienced so many changes to this game and accept many of them when thinking of the bigger picture of balancing. I do think the newest additions in Repentance include some of the hardest characters and floors but none of it is impossible. It has raised the skill ceiling of this game and if you are willing to put in the work, this game is a replayable, quality experience worth your money 10x over."
16284,good
16285,IM ANGRY AND WANNA KILL THE DEVELOPER. but in the good kind of way
16286,Just an amazing game that is difficult enough to challenge you but not impossible. Soooooo many unlocks :)

16297,"This game is great! 
only gripes are the sound bug where dross has no music the fix on the discussions thread does not work and birthright does nothing for a decent amount of the cast its a fun game but it needs some patches and its somehow on console now which is wild to think how they just dropped it like that imagine the dross music not being there when you were playing this on the switch I'd want to become back my money after that"

16306,7/10 showed me how to fucking die for a cookie and poster
16307,One of the very few games of 100% completed it and I still plan to play for thousands of hours to go if you’re having with my play data is so low it says back in after birth plus I decided to transfer my progress from my previous version two theme for mod support in the upcoming repentance so I use the debit card to give me the achievements I had might’ve been a bit buggy ever since repentance is launch but A few problems with external issues and a handful of bags that make the game a bit more annoying than it should be isn’t a dealbreaker for a game I love it’s a bit expensive but just wait for a sale if you can get it for like 50% off it’s definitely worth the price

16337,bery oice
16338,A very addicting rouge-like game where the dlc isn't insulting and the mod support is greatly appreciated. I have a lot of time spent on afterbirth+ on xbox and waited until now to finally get a gaming laptop and buy the complete version of isaac. i cant wait to unlock everyone again and get the new characters as well! Isaac is a great game even when the rng tries its best to screw you over.
16339,"One of, if not the best, rogue likes out there."
16340,"1000+ hours on PS4... 500+ Hours on Switch... 

Then Repentance came out on PC... And here we are. Now to go back to the consoles now Repentance is out on them too. This game is crack."
16341,this shit sucks
16342,one of the best rouge-likes ever!
16343,this game is fun if you hate yourself
16344,"Edmund McMillen you little f**ker

But for real it's a pretty good game"
16345,"Лучший рогалик из всех, в которые я когда-либо играл."
16346,"TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a brilliant but dark dungeon-crawling roguelite.

This game, along with Hades, brought me back into the roguelite genre, something I am grateful for. I never thought I would enjoy a grotesque game where you play as a child who uses their own tears as a weapon (that sounds really horrible now that I write it down), however this game surprised me by how addicting it really is. The enemy and boss designs are creative and unique, and the combat hasn't grown stale.
--FINAL VERDICT--
[b] 9/10 [/b]
Fun, addictive roguelite, and a memorable one at that."
16347,Pretty good roguelike. Would cry again.
16348,"haha funni poop
"
16349,"Dang this game is amazing, the lore too."
16350,"Hey guys fun fact, did  you know that the creator of The Binding of Isaac had a cool ARG event thing in his game? Well now you do! And I'm going to explain all you need to know about it! Okay, so first lets talk about the start of the ARG. In November 2014 Edmund McMillen released The binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This was a remastered version of The Binding of Isaac made on newgrounds.com. Of course people were excited and not too later after the community managed to find a secret character in the files of the game. After that it was just common knowledge that there was a secret character with a complex unlocking method. That was until Edmund released an expansion pack for the game. This was called The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth. After people went searching in the files again, the community was disappointed to see that there was nothing cool. No secrets, NOTHING. But they did release a new gamemode called ""greed mode"" and the community quickly beat it. And after they beat the boss (Ultra Greed) a donation machine was next to his body. People dumped all of their extra coins into the machine they realized that they could not put any more than 109 coins in the machine. Keep that number in your head it WILL be important in the later part of the story. Even if you played another game on greed mode you could not put any more coins into the machine. A lot of the items in the binding of Isaac that were related to money also were kind of broken and you could not really use them at all. So, Edmund released an update (109 hours after) that fixed all the bugs. he made a small change to the icon for the achievement where you donate 999 coins to the machine (formally known as the generosity achievement). It looked like some code of some sort. Some people decoded the code and it said 108 69 82 66 101 73 76. That series when converted to ASCII code becomes lERBeIL which led to a picture of the secret character from before, (known as the lost) eight human figures, and a quote from the bible. People soon realized that this was a reference to a movie (the lost boys) and their next stop was on the Santa Cruz boardwalk. People dug out a picture (in real life) of a drawn picture of a missing poster of Isaac. It had a phone number on it But there was three missing digits. Of course they put the last numbers as 109 and called it. It directs you to a voicemail that says, ""Hello [???], I am your [???]. I know what you came for, but I need to hear you ask me."" people reversed the ??? and it said ""Isaac"" and ""father"". On November 13, the voicemail changed to saying this, ""Christ calls, generous gods don't guide history forever. [??????] (whispered) We need to go deeper."" As you can tell, they decoded the ??? and they got CC GGDGHF KG HFFEBG People decoded that and found coordinates to the building Santa Ana with building number 109 and they found a loose pile of change. They finally dug out a figurine of the keeper from the binding of Isaac and on that figurine was a twitter account with the password on it and on the twitter there was a comment saying, ""The community unlocked... Something Hidden!"" and thus adding the keeper character into the game. I hope you enjoyed and were informed about the history of the keeper in The Binding of Isaac and his unique backstory. (oh yeah I might have left out some stuff idk I'm dumb)[also i find this very interesting I don't know about you though""]"

16375,"This game is awesome. I have played for over 645 hours and counting and it is still hardly getting boring. There is a large roster of characters to play as, and hundreds of unique items, lots of challenges, tons of different bosses and enemies, insane amounts of synergies there is hardly any limit to what can happen. I play on an old mac and was unable to play repentance due to the window restriction on it, but I liked the game so much that I spent over $100 to purchase windows software and then $15 to buy the dlc and it was worth every penny. The community is thriving, and every week there are tons of new fun mods on the workshop. This game is just pure fun. So far this is the best game I have ever played.

16383,"Friends keept recommending this game to me. 
I didnt  like the setting. (I dont like it today too)
But I was so suprised by the Gameplay.
Binding has so much bosses, items, hidden rooms .....
This was my first rouge-like game.
After this i licked blood to the genre.
Its one of the best rouge-likes ever made and i can say this, a person which is the setting/szenario of the game one of the most important things.

16384,"Is good

16387,cool
16388,I wish I had dlc :(
16389,The Binding of isaac is a great indie roguelike. I personall enjoy this game due to it randomly generated runs and all the different synergies with different items
16390,"I really love this game, a lot. I really did. But at exactly 155.0 hours it crashed and does not let me reopen it. ive uninstalled it, switched computers. completely deleted all files and reinstalled the game from the ground up. but nothing. and I MEAN nothing works. so its a great game, but. dont plan on playing more than 155.0 hours honestly"
16391,"I bought this game after having watched hours and hours of isaac content, and knowing the effects of most of the items. If you come into this game blind, expect a steep learning curve as you learn item effects, and if you don't, its just as fun as Northernlion or Hutts makes it look. Strongly reccomend it"
16392,Cry
16393,"I've had this game for many years on my PS Vita and it has always been a favorite, these expansions are great and I love not only the gameplay/game but the art as well as the community. Also Four Souls is great and Super Meat Boy if you like the artistic aspect of this game. This game is not only easy to learn but its addictive nature will have you coming back for years even after you master it. Lots of potty humor at its finest."
16394,"swiftly approaching 2000 hours of combined playtime on console and pc, and the game is still incredible. buy"
16395,Fun. Dark.
16396,A very skill based/RNG Rogue like game that is genre defining and the replay value is the best i have ever seen in a video game before!
16397,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That was, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac. 'Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac.' 'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac', she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below.

16403,"This game has so much to offer, so much to do, so much to complete. It's hard to not find anything to do. If you are bored playing the normal mode you can play stories or look to achievement hunting for other unlocks. There are times when you feel like you are on top of the world when you get lucky with good items. Other times feel like you'll never win and you want to punch Edmund in the face for making the game.
The only real downside is that the game can feel reaaaaaaaaaally repetitive. Other than that, completing the game is satisfying but VERY time consuming. If you have the time to put into it, it's worth."

16442,"I don't like the base game. I find the fact that there's barely any in-game info about the items. Because of the lack of info, I am not happy when I get a good item (because I don't know which items are good), and I felt frustrated when an item breaks all my synergies.

HOWEVER, the dlc fixed all my issues. Seeing my stats made it really fun (hehe number go big). Also, mods fixed my issues with in-game info on the items, shame that they were not compatible without the dlc."
16443,horrible. play it.

16531,10/10 one of the best games
16532,"TBoI manages to still be a joy to play even after opening up to the same cellar layout for the 10th time. The complete randomness of items, floors, and even rooms themselves allows for unique and interesting runs despite using only the same 40 or so assets. This game is the godsend birthchild of roguelike taken to the extreme, where almost nothing you obtain in the game stays, providing a unique challenge every run and, funnily enough, being even more fun when you come to terms with the fact that nothing is permanent, so don't be afraid of taking some sillier risks just to get an achievement or do something you thought would be funny to show off to your friends. An incredibly easy game to get into with basic controls that even a fetus could play, and even has a story to get behind if you're so inclined, it is an indie legend and a must-have for any action and roguelike fanatic."
16533,Best game ever if you don't mind losing 30 times in a row.

16544,"This game is the definition of a classic rogue/dungeon crawler, played the game over 2000 hours including console playtime.

Eventually decided to re-buy it on pc, I keep coming back for a couple more runs to achieve more completion marks. Played from vanilla state of the game till the most recent expansion repentance, repentance even made the game harder and adding more content which I like.

Pros:

- High replay value
- Challenging
- Graphics and design are pretty unique
- Music feels jamming
- Story is one of it's kind

Cons:

- Game might be too hard and not for everybody
- Since repentance DLC, it came with some additional bugs and glitches
- One run can take you up to 1h+
- One mistake can ruin your entire run"

16547,One of the most challenging rouge likes out there. Just rebirth on it's own is good but getting afterbirth just adds in items that are completely useless. I do really like the game though don't get me wrong. It's also fun to see the other achievements your friend have gotten. So for all of this I rate the game a 7/10. Good job

16576,"base isaac is pretty good, more items is fun but the new dlc enemies and bosses are hard to enjoy for me"
16577,"Probably one of my favorite games of all time now. The best procedurally-generated rogue-like dungeon-crawler that I've ever played. Plenty of item combos and synergies that make each playthrough unique and enjoyable, even if luck sometimes plays a huge factor. The story is pretty gruesome but is enjoyable and love the way it ties everything together. Fuck Delirium though that guy sucks.
Hope anyone who reads this has a wonderful day. The universe just is, and so are you."
16578,This game is an absolute masterpiece!!!
16579,"Good Shit, love breaking the game"

16581,deffenitely reccomend this game is so fun and is goot to chill with it
16582,AMAZING GAME. Never gets old and every run is always different kind of a hard game
16583,"if you like dungeon crawlers this is the game for you as solid as it gets simple as that.

"
16584,Very good game with lots of weird yet logical synergies with the items. The soundtrack is also great.
16585,Gud cry boy
16586,Very good game
16587,i like crying kids
16588,"Good game, fun to play"
16589,so many achievments for fun and endless gameplay and then mix that with mods and you get a game that will last a decade
16590,"This is perhaps the best game I have played in my life so far. 
And I know that my take is subjective, so I'll outline the things that shaped my opinion below:

______PROS______
> A bottomless well of content and item synergies. Being a procedurally generated dungeon crawler, no two runs will be exactly the same, and although there is definitely strategy to the core game-play and a skill ceiling that you can aim for if you want to get really good at the game, you can also just get extremely lucky with your floor and room layouts, room payouts and items to get a good run and have a good time.
> Getting a good build feels like winning the lottery. I'm at the point where just looking at a JPG of a good Isaac item will make dopamine rush through my brain. I am probably going to get a Brimstone tattoo soon for dopamine-on-demand.
> A diverse range of characters and play-styles, especially those added in Repentance, the Tainted characters who were refreshing to even veterans of the game who had already completed it in the Afterbirth era. (Ignoring a few of the roster)
> The themes of the game were and still are very interesting and unique. Where else are you going to find a rogue-like that manages to tie in the themes of a religion so well with the ideas of an unstable household and a child's wild imagination and sense of humour.

______CONS______
> Sticky Nickels have appeared in the Basement
> You unlocked Tainted Lazarus
> You unlocked Haunted Chests and still have Tainted Lost completion marks left to get
> Edmund McMillen, you litte f**ker. You made a sh*t of piece with your trash Issac. It’s f**king bad this trash game I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker.

______TLDR______ 
If you are a fan of the rogue-like genre or are thinking of getting into it, it is in my honest opinion that this will be the best experience you could hope to have with it, and I cannot recommend it enough. Despite the price tag now with all of the DLC, it is truly worth it for the amount of content and replayability that it provides. My road to Dead God was one of the most challenging and rewarding experience I've had with video-games and even if you don't plan to get that far with Isaac, it is still definitely fun enough to enjoy casually. A very good game."

16592,One of the best games I've ever played. very worth the buy and the time sink.

Might be because it's largely gambling.

Insanely fun but man can it get hard later on, but I feel like the difficulty curve is okay, it just takes some getting used to. Rng can absolutely ruin or redeem a run but skill can carry you pretty far despite the rng mechanics. Take it a little slow at first and keep cool and this game is a great way to spend an afternoon :). I'd say only pass it up if you get tilted easily."

16626,Hahahah life goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr but go play the game it's fun
16627,"This game is pretty good, since it has a lot of content without the DLCs and if you include the DLCs there is so much, overall it's pretty good since there are many unlocks you can aim for and goals you can complete with the multiple amount of modes with normal and hard mode being the default game there are also greed modes which are round and money based and really fun. There are also challenges that give unlocks that are very fun to play with in the normal game modes and the game itself is easy to modify. This game would most likely require more than ~300 hours if you have the DLCs to complete it fully which allows you to have a lot new discoveries.

Not really recommended if you are religious."
16628,FUCK THIS GAME *keeps playing*
16629,"I fucking despise this game, stresses me the fuck out and gives me anger issues"
16630,good game lol
16631,fun fun fun indie
16632,"I've been interested in Isaac for a really long time, I even tried it once and found it so confusing to even grasp the basics of this game.
But after a while, watching YouTube and creators like Hutts, Albino, Tjoe and many others I finally decided to not only buy the main game, but buy all the dlc's. I'm still clueless about how progression of the story goes and it's still a bit confusing, but this time I fell in love with this game. So many different situations, combos, items, it's just overwhelmingly good.

If you are trying to find THE rougelike, this is it.
If you don't know the items and find it confusing, install a mod. (Same goes for every little part of the game)

This is a great game. It has content for thousands of hours. Want challenge? -Here you go, a lot of in game challenges and modded challenges. Don't like the difficulty? -Install mods to highlight tinted rocks, for example. Not enough content? -Are you kidding me? And even so, there are thousands of modes that add new characters, levels, items, list goes on,"

16693,isac
16694,Its very fun and no run is the same. Thats just me talking about the base game. If you add mods to the mix the game becomes almost infinite fun.
16695,It's realy good game
16696,"Update: It updated we all gucci now

Update: I can play again! Dunno why!

However:
Updates have virtually stopped- not sure if the game is supported or not. Update was promised months ago- and silence. 

I love this game- most of my playtime came from console before I de-yuck'ed myself. Probably well over 200-300 hours total.

Repentance, honestly, has become a needed staple to the game, as all DLC has. So, this review is on Post-Repentance Isaac. Yeah, it's a DLC for a DLC, but these are essentially baseline expansions to the game.


Further balancing NEEDS to be done, and it is just...not. As mentioned, updates have stopped. If you like mods, one of the most anticipated and well made expansions are awaiting a small update/patch that is, for all we know, never actually coming. 

In my 200-300 hours, I have never been the type to give-up runs and restart over and over until I get a strong start. Isaac was a game that, even under crappy RNG, was still pretty fun to try a run. However, there are some major drags introduced in repentance that make anything BUT a strong start an absolute slog to play. I now find myself restarting, over and over, until I get an at-least decent first-floor item- and that's a shame, because I am bored to death by floor 3 in most cases.


Repentance added and modified a TON of items. Which is great! However, 80% of them... are useless. Then, another 5% of them will actually ruin your run if you unknowingly pick them up. 5% of them are only useful in very specific circumstances/characters, and... you get the point. On top of that, they have nerfed some of the most fun items from Afterbirth+. 

Now, I don't know if I am just major unlucky- but I often reach Mom's big fat meaty leg with not a single damage-or-range-or-health boosting active/passive. This is challenging....and boring. Nothing is worse than hitting one of the massive rooms with 15 very easy enemies that are an agonizing time waste to hit with pea shooter tears (I'm looking at you, headless little hoppies). 
This is not hard- it's an annoying time-waste, and you will encounter this scenario NONSTOP in repentance- and it really rips away at your enjoyment of the game, run after run after run after run. 

Repentance adds some great rooms/floors/enemies/progression- but does not supply the items needed to enjoy them properly. This is a big, big shame- and balance is needed. However, it does not appear to ever be coming. Many months ago, they promised an update and announced Merch- in the meantime, modders could have rebuilt the entire game in the amount of time we've waited for this update. 



Please- update yo game and work on that balance. I don't want it made easier. I just don't want to spend 10 minutes in single easy-peasy rooms, no damage/tear/range boosts, and with tear-sponge enemies that actively avoid tears lol."
16697,endless fun
16698,a
16699,"рандом.орг за 1к рублей, спасибо"
16700,it is cool
16701,bloat can go f*ck himself
16702,Stupid retarded kid goes to cry about it dumb little chigbard fligdard
16703,yea
16704,"The Binding of Isaac is a Rogue-like that allows you to go through several floors of f*cked-up as Isaac. You run around, and shoot tears at enemies, picking up coins, bombs, keys, pills, tarot cards and power ups (both active and passive). As you play, you can unlock up to 33 additional characters, each starting off with something different than Isaac, and creating new ways to play the game.

It's biggest factor is the replayability this game will offer. Each playthrough gives you new floor layouts, enemies, bosses and power ups for you to use. Many of the power ups can often combine with each other to create powerful synergies, some can even be game breaking and literally carry you on a run.

On top of the normal game, there are 2 additional gamemodes: Greed mode is a enemy rush that spawns several enemies. Each wave dropping coins that you can use to buy a random array of pickups. Challenges offer over 40+ challenges that make you play the game in a different way, using combinations of items that can make the game harder, or give you an idea how certain combinations work.

With Repentance, the game is open even further with 2 additional final bosses, 3 new floors, several new enemies, and so many powerups that add even more options for you to try out.

My only biggest gripe is the amount of powerups in the game. There are over 600 power ups in the game, making it hard to remember what does what. I've personally had to install a mod to tell me what each thing does.

Other than that, the game is fun as hell. With so much replayability, you can easily get your money's worth if you are into this sort of game. Give it a shot!"

16784,"It's an amazing experience. Over and over again.

I played since the very beginning and still am. This is THE Roguelike. It has tons of different items with crazy synergies. So many unique characters, each with their own fun and sometimes challenging playstyles. An untold amount of unlocks, with great replayability. Every run, no matter what game mode or challenge, awaits you with new surprising experiences, whether they're good or bad.
On top of that it has neat pixel graphics with many little details.
And if that hasn't been enough to convince you that this is the best roguelike ever created (probably for eternity and beyond), I should tell you that the huge modding community is giving you almost everything you're missing or want to adjust and additional content of all kinds. From just sounds or cosmetical changes to very extensive ones which are almost like free DLC'S.
You can even play it together with friends online and local.

Finally found a fitting way of putting my admiration and love for this game into words. Definitely my favourite game of all time."

16809,"This game is easy to learn and super fun! Its difficulty spikes, but the game never gets old because no two runs are the same. I own this game on nearly every console; my hours are closer to 1800 cumulatively and I still haven't seen everything. The music is insanely good and over 30 characters with the DLC means there is a lotto master. This is one of my favorite games ever made."

16813,It good
16814,"Over the years, this game has become my favourite game of all time. The game just sucks you in, in all the best ways of course, and it is one of the most re-playable and interesting games I have ever played.

I'm Addicted and every day I play and its countless hours of fun. I didn't even like rouge-likes but this game made me a fan of it all.

eh. the games fine I guess. Kinda shit. lol"
16899,IT DO BE A GOOD GAME
16900,"I love this game when I have a bit of time to kill. It can be a quick game, that when you leave the screen in the middle of a level, it saves your spot. Or, you can be like me and continue to spend an hour and a half at a time just grinding to get to the Mother boss level. I have had this game on Xbox and now PC and I would continue to purchase it if need be. The one con that I have with the game, and it could just be me, is that when my xbox controller dies when using it on my pc, the game pauses (not a problem) but then, once reconnected, I have to restart my game as it won't allow me to turn on the controller and un-pause. But it still saves my spot, so a minor inconvenience i suppose on my part."
16901,"High replayability, really fun gameplay, also great to play in between."

16928,"Rebirth adds several new elements to the game that long time fans will disagree with or have issues with. As a person who has played BOI from the release date I can say I am just happy with the game receiving new content regularly, and if I wanted to play with the base game elements/monsters I would just play the base game. Overall still one of my favorite games of all time."

16941,"Its a fun game, and the second you get used to one mechanic it throws another 3 at you, keeping you challenged. One thing I would say is if you are starting out, immediately start at hard mode, it will work out for you better in the end than starting at normal."
16942,"i personally havnt played afterbirth of afterbirth+ so i started right off with repentance and honestly being introduced to repentance first was honestly the most fun experience ive had yet, the game is (somewhat) more fair and balanced (greedier mode sucks though) and honestly its fun overall. i enjoy this game to its fullest and wish that other people find this game just as fun as i do."
16943,"very fun indie shooter, good storyline and fanbase. i do recomend the more updated versions but this is cheaper."
16944,"Its a good game, only if you put a good amount of time into it. Most of the cool items are either locked behind a pay wall or unlock like the D6 and Repentance"

16973,"The Binding of Isaac started out as a flash game in 2011. Created by the man, myth, and legend of the disgustingly creative mind of Edmund McMillen. I only got into Isaac recently following the release of Repentance in March, just because it looked interesting to me from watching a streamer that I follow. Thanks to pokelawls, I was instantly hooked into the the world of Isaac. Now, may you keep in mind that I always knew the existence of this game, and I actually considered getting afterbirth+ for the switch when I got one back in 2018 but I did't go through with it. I feel that this was the perfect time to get into the game since Repentance introduced a cornucopia of new items, reskins, bosses, etc. Never had I been so intrigued and excited to dive into a new game before! On a funny note, when I first started, I had no clue that there was even content beyond killing Mom (in depths 2) lol. Beginning to feel overwhelmed from all the unlockables post Mom I started researching tips and tricks to fully understand the game. I would progressively learn about tinted rocks, secrets rooms, devil deals, angel rooms, alt floors, planetarium chances, alternate boss paths, and so much more... There was just so much to unpack! 637 achievements in total, 34 characters, over 716+ items and consumables, 102 bosses, 25 areas/floors, 196 different enemies AND Steam Workshop Mod support!!! This is literally the most bang for buck you can get on all of Steam. You will have to legitimately dedicate hundreds upon hundreds of hours to 100% this game if that is your interest (Which is the only true way to beat the game). Now, to talk about the difficulty. There is loads of controller breaking moments you will face, and I really mean it. If you have played one of Edmund's older projects, Super Meat Boy, you will get about the same rage or more when playing this game and that is why the whole meat and potatoes of this game is to build your loadout of decent-OP items. There will be a lot of runs where you get absolute garbage, meh items and the best runs which happen to be when you stack OP items. That is why I cannot express how much fun and satisfying it feels when you get amazing items on top of more amazing items, then getting to absolutely melt enemies and annoying bosses within seconds. It's such a great feeling I don't any other game has provided to me. Also, it is extremely hard to call this game lazy even though there is a few things that bother me about the design of the game that are likely unfixable, to name one is the FPS lock at 60, yes, I know it's a really minor gripe but I would like to atleast play at 144hz to fully harness the simple but, beautiful sprite art. Anyways, this game also happens to encourage me to start create mods on the workshop! I made my first ever (with effort) mod into the game and I plan to make so many more! Another thing I love about this game is the community. The very thing that makes this game thrive and feel so alive (For it being a 7 year old game). This community is so filled with memes and shitposts (I love it). I always check the workshop daily to see if another amazing mod has been uploaded for me to play with! I always said that being able to mod games increases the livelyhood and replay value of games by 1000%. Having countless useful convenience mods and meme mods so easily accessible is just so great! It's been a while since I found a game that I can fully dedicate to on a consistent basis. It will be quite difficult to top a game like this (unless a sequel is made) on my list atleast. Of course, only having unlocked all tainted characters and 2 fully completed characters, I plan on completing the game and putting in for what will hopefully be hundreds of more hours. Edmund McMillen, you creative fricker, I will not become back my money anytime soon. I cannot wait for your future projects! Thank You."
16974,"Binding of Isaac, the only game where you kill your mother and then enter the womb and kill the fetus in there. It's a pretty dark game but I absolutely love the hell out of it. I have the achievement Dead God because I love it  unquestionably I absolutely love it. After I got Dead God I'm still playing to this game it quite literally never gets old. They update Repentance still to this day. Its my favorite game without any doubt, sure a Clotty is never fun to fight against but that's whats fun about it. Ever since I got rebirth I've been loving rougelikes. So should you get it? Well that is mainly up to you but YES YES YES you should get Isaac. It may start out boring but you'll never regret getting it."
16975,"450 hours and the game is still enjoyable!
+Ambient sounds and soundtracks are too good to be true.
+Mechanics are simple (so as ""meta"") and pretty easy to get used to (although you WILL struggle more and more after each successful run).
+Game's breakable in a good way. You can literally demolish every mob in each room on each level just by 1 mouse click. Highly enjoyable.
+References to bible, other games, probably to your own damn life too.

Overall highly recommended."

16992,"Please remove hosts from the videogame, breadmund"
16993,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That was, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac. 'Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac.' 'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac', she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below."
16994,"This is one of the most fucked up and sad games I have ever played. Like, yeah it's pretty funny if you have potty humor or find human mortality funny, but it's just really fucking depressing. I have played games that have made me sad before, but this game just gives me an impending feeling of dread for no reason at all. The ending is really good, and so is the secret ending if you get Repentance. It is possibly one of the best games I have ever and will ever played. What are you waiting for, Christmas? Buy the game."
16995,i hate this game
16996,"good
"
16997,Me likey
16998,"Played a few hours, could use some more content in my opinion"
16999,"An actual, pure, untainted Roguelike. 
A lot of the more popular roguelike/lites that have come out recently have always had a degree of levelling up or becoming stronger between runs; say Hades for example.
Isaac is the simplest form of Roguelikes but there is an undeniable amount of complexity to its systems.

The items are the main power spikes in this game. Not XP, not outside of run purchases but pure items and of course, skill.
There are so many unlocks that you'll always have something to aim for if you get bored of just doing runs for the sake of doing runs.

Easily the best, purest and most complex roguelike out there right now. Theres a reason this is the standard for roguelike today.

The lore behind the game is also quite interesting, a lot of bible imagery and inspirations drawn from there. 
The sheer number and variety of items is absurd, granted they're all not great but they all have their place with synergies.

If you're unsure about it, get rebirth first and then slowly add the DLCs if you enjoy the game. Although the DLCs add a lot of content, they also somewhat make the game more difficult."
17000,j
17001,fun very replayablity is amazing great rouge like
17002,dear god just give me a damage up please
17003,"All I ever do in this game is die and yet I can't seem to stop myself from coming back. The procedural generation in this game seems like it would get boring, but there's such a massive pile of content that I've never actually felt that way. This game is good at being the kind of game you can pick up and play for a little bit, forget about for a few months, and then pick it up and keep on playing without being confused about where you are or what you were doing, although I suppose that trait is probably not unique to this game and is just a byproduct of being a roguelike. The craziness of how you can combine the items you pick up is my favorite part, and I'm afraid I've been spoiled to the roguelike genre by playing one of the best ones first."
17004,it's aiight
17005,So the little guy cries because his parents suck
17006,It's okay I guess. Some of the challenges are a little frustrating but it has a ton of replay value
17007,its ok i guess

17009,goooooood
17010,great game
17011,this game can be really hard in the beginning but the more you play the more fun it can be. But it seems like you need the DLCs for much needed game fixes.
17012,When the uh is uh and um

17023,kid cry :)
17024,"The remastered version of the game that started the indie roguelite craze.

Absolutely PACKED with content and unlockables, this game keeps on giving for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours. 
And c'mon, it's a game where you play as a naked crying child who's fighting monsters, demons, and poop (lots of poop) in the effort to stay alive and defeat his mother. 

Banger game from some banger developers."
17025,"Solid game, playable for hours. Always a game I come back to.

17028,gud
17029,"What can I say? I suck at this game, but it's friggin fun."
17030,It makes me feel like im accomplishing something
17031,"I love this game. I own it on Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and now pc. I don't have the DLC tho"
17032,It cool
17033,"Ah yes The Isaac of Binding, such a peculiar game. So strange despite not ever playing it my steam account says otherwise."
17034,"Isaac is a great hard roguelike, emphasis on hard.

There's mods to make it easier if you're really struggling and there's good replayability but please take care to note that this is a bullethell and it's difficult to get past.

I'd recommend only playing Afterbirth+ until you get used to the game and then playing Repentance.

All the bosses and endings are pretty interesting and the game has no shortage on things you can do or go for.

Good luck to you if you get the game."
17035,addicting after the first 10 hours or less into the game
17036,"It's charming in a grotesque manner, and despite the clunky mechanics, it is one of the quintessential roguelikes which you'll be playing through if you're on a pilgrimage through the genre. Alongside Gungeon and FTL, it caps off the trinity of 'old-school' roguelike/roguelites before modern improved titles like Hades, Slay the Spire and Into The Breach entered the scene."
17037,"ביבי המלךךךך

17055,"So I bought The Binding of Isaac for 3 main reasons
[olist]
[*] I like to collect games
[*] I like to grind achievements
[*] I like indie games
[/olist]
I owned it for around a year before buying the afterbirth and ab+ DLCs about a month before Repentance was released and I actually started to play it.

I originally got interested in the game because my brother had introduced me to a YouTuber named ""Sinvicta"", (who I still watch regularly) and I was amazed at how much content there was to the game and how it could be broken.

When I started playing the game, I knew I wasn't going to be good at it but I didn't realize how much learning actually goes into the game if you desire to be good at it. (Now I know some mods basically get rid of this learning factor, but when I started I had no idea that Steam games even had workshops)

Now I will admit that the game was pretty boring to me starting out. I wasn't dedicated to learning it and overall I thought that I had started playing too late into the games lifespan and there was just too much content for me to handle. But I pushed through this anyway because I really wanted to be good at the game and able to grind all the achievements.

The game (if you aren't using mods like I wasn't) took me around a month to get constant at, and that's because you don't start with the game fully unlocked, which is something I really appreciate. Now I was also watching Isaac videos all the time everyday, and that may have contributed to the speed at which I learned, but I don't know.

Once you get constant at the game, it's just a matter of what you want to do and how you want to play. I personally am a completionist and like to unlock everything in the order that I feel they were meant to be unlocked, and this has resulted in me grinding achievements a lot slower than other people, but I don't really mind that.

I have 500 hours at the moment and 300 achievements, (which is a little under half of them at the release of Repentance) and I haven't broken the game once yet, (outside of the occasional crash from my old pc) but I'm still having a blast playing this game everyday. It does get a little boring from time to time, but I always just end up taking a small break and then coming back to it.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who's into indie roguelikes and grinding achievements.

Again, the learning part isn't really an issue anymore because of the workshop, so if you do end up buying and playing The Binding of Isaac then I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"

17064,"Easily the best roguelike game I have ever played.
"
17065,"A great and super addictive game. That i can just sink hours into and never get sick of it. The visuals of the game is great and very unique giving it a personality that a lot of rouge-likes don't have. 

I love the absolute insane amount of items and effect that just make every single run feel different. There are just too many items, power ups, item synergies to learn and secrets to find that the replay-ability of it is just great and is very much worth its value."

Super fun and challenging and non-commital/casual so you can smash out quick runs or grind challenges to your hearts content.. Also i don't feel super upset if i fail since its pretty easy to just start a new run. Super easy controls. etcetc worth it."

17109,"wonderful. I actually have an addiction to this game, its a roguelike like no other."
17110,"This is just my opinion but I think this is my favorite game ever. I absolutely love the art and music of this game as well as the seemingly endless amounts of replay value. Difficulty is kind of weird sometimes, It can be extremely easy or very hard but that all due to that fact that its a randomized game. Other than that I have no problems with it."
17111,"morbid and dark just like my sense of humor, Ed you've made a great game.

P.S. good soup"

17126,Good Gam By Ed
17127,"Edmund McMillen, thanks for giving me a crippling roguelike addiction, you little fucker. I hope you in your next time a cow, on a trash farm.

In all seriousness though, I love games with replayability, and this hits everything. You will not run out of things to do. [i]You will not.[/i] Between getting cracked builds and playing characters that die in one hit because Edmund McMillen, there is an endless supply of content. Get the DLC, the game is not the same without it. Repentance (In addition to the other DLCs) triples the content and adds so much more to the game. I’m 250 ish hours in the game, and I’m not even close to completing the game (100%). Say you do actually complete the game. Now do it again on each save file for the achievement. 

Thousands of hours later, you must be asking: “How is there more content if I have each save at 100%?” Answer: MODS. This game has workshop support, and a very active community of modders. [i][b]You cannot complete the game.[/b][/i]

Once you go Isaac you can’t go back. [b]There is no escape.[/b]

17137,"I've already played a ton of the Switch port but decided to get the Steam version too 'cause I just love this game to death. The gameplay is incredibly difficult and addicting, the art direction is priceless, and the music slaps. There's so much here that you'll be playing for hundreds, if not thousands of hours and still be discovering new combinations of items that break the game in a fun way. 10/10"

Be warned it's pretty hard and has a lot of content. 
If you're a completionist stay the hell away from this game because it has 637 things to complete/unlock on 1 of the 3 save files alone and for the full completion it requires all 3 save files to have all 637 achievement."

17191,"Pirated antibirth 4 years ago and was the joy of high school. 
Replay wise feel like its lost its touch, the new items, item reworks and nerfs (hella fuckin nerfs especially brimmy) made the game less of a game and more of a sweaty try hard game to make a run work.
Even with that in Repentance it's still a real enjoyable game, takes a long time to get the good items tho imo.
Antibirth+ was like a solid 8/10 couldve had some items repentance has
Repentance is a solid 7-8/10 the item reworks, nerfs and changes are real ass but the other tweaks, fixes and items i feel make up for it and add to the replay value of this game.
In conclusion Fuck you Edmund made me waste like 4 years of my life on a game that doesnt care about me"
17192,"good game, me likey

17213,For the price of the game it is so good that it makes almost every other game to shame even with out the DLC it has more content then a lot of games sides from gta but even then this game is cheeper then it so go buy it if you have £11 to spend. (or on sale for £5)

The hard challenges keep you playing and the absurd amount of synergies is crazy. I don't know a better rouge-like game. Plus with the mods for the game you could play this for forever. 100% recommend."

17252,"If you're down to pay $60+ for a rogue-like that's about on par with rogue-likes that don't cost that much, go for it. Rebirth is not a complete game, and has a variety of hitscan rooms, unwinnable runs, and a variety of poor balancing decisions that fill 95% of the game, while you wait for the 5% of the time where you're actually having fun.

17286,"This is hands down one of the best games ever made. Certainly the best Rogue-like I have played. If you're going for 100% completion it can be extremely difficult at times, but for a skilled gamer it offers constant reward in satisfaction and fun, (if you are willing to put in the hours to improve.) For the casual player it will be very difficult at first, but there are ""easier"" characters you can play as, (such as Magdeline, Judas, Bethany or Azazel), who will help carry you through your first runs and get you used to the enemies/rooms/bosses. The new tainted characters, once unlocked, offer some very unique playstyles which can be extremely challenging at times, and also extremely broken, powerful and fun! The game's RNG is generally forgiving, and 95% of runs are winnable (at least with standard characters). Items are well designed and there are SO many fun synergies and combinations, such that every run is completely unique. The story/themes and art are devilishly dark, grotesquely gory and will provide good eye candy for those who enjoy the macabre (not suitable for Christians! lol). The game has a few issues, and it feels like they released it a little too early as there are a couple of unfinished/unimplemented items/interactions, but hopefully the next update will address and resolve these issues. 

Overall, It takes some practice and patience to get good at this game, but I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and I highly recommend The Binding of Isaac to everybody who enjoys Rogue-like games. This is definitely in my top 5 games of all time!"
17287,With repentance it really hits you in the feels.
17288,The best roguelike game ever made.
17289,Cry about it
17290,e
17291,i've been playing this game since 2013 and i still suck at it.

17297,It's okay I guess
17298,"Being a huge fan of Rogue-lites/likes for years, I hadn't heard about Isaac until shortly before repentance launched. However, I've put ~2.5 hrs per day into this game since, and it's quickly become my go-to game. 
It's simple gameplay makes it an 'easy to learn, hard to master' game, but the time you put into it will likely be very rewarding. Some of the most fun items in the game take a fair amount of luck and skill to achieve, while other you *might* have unlocked after 1,000 hours of gameplay. 

The item effects and synergies can be unpredictable or self-destructive, so learning the game takes time. The difficulty basically scales with how well you can dodge and learn enemy patterns, with more powerful items unlocking as you progress (making runs potentially easier in the future). Highly, highly recommend"
17299,Gets good after enough suffering
17300,Just a great game tbh

17365,"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript
Voila! Finally, the Bee Movie script is here for all you fans of the Jerry Seinfeld animated movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you'll have some Bee Movie quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?
And swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle. Better than Farmville, anyway.
Bee Movie Script
  
  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

17379,"A very addictive roguelike that has some sort of charm i did not see in other roguelikes that I've played before. Truly unique, with hundreds of hours worth of content, you wont be bored when playing this game. I recommend getting all of the DLCs when possible for this game since it adds a ton of content. Truly the greatest roguelike of all time."
17380,"Fun dungeon crawler. If you've never played one before or don't like them, I still recommend giving this a try."
17381,A decent indie game. With amazing DLC and storyline. With Afterbirth+ and above you can install mods!
17382,"don't even read, just buy it"
17383,Amazing game! It is one of my favorite games of all times.

You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."

17405,"Wanted to 100% this before I reviewed it, and here I am. Play this game."
17406,"Great game
"
17407,"After 150+ hours on the original game and a hundred or so more on the 3DS version of Rebirth I finally bought this on PC after Repentance launched this year. Funnily enough the new DLC isn't ported to Linux yet so I lost myself playing Afterbirth+ for 30 hours waiting for the new levels unlock until I noticed it and switched to Windows (Repentance Linux port plz). 
This says a bit of just how much Isaac has to offer, from beginner players getting gud, intermediate players like myself honing their skills, learning new ways to play, discovering the potential of once ignored or hated characters and taking on hard challenges, to advanced players that can achieve impossible hitless streaks and breaking the game after 100%ing it.
Be warned, though, this deal with the devil can take as much of your life as any MMO or MOBA if you choose so. 
You'll feel like a pro-gamer dodging a bullethell boss with one heart left, God himself shredding through that same boss with godlike powers, ragequit dying after gambling some blind item that ruined your run and curse Edmund's lineage for ""balancing"" bullshit many times through it - and you'll enjoy every bit of it."

17424,"With every update my runs have gotten progressively less fun, in the name of ""balance"", 90% of runs are just trash, and the item pool is so diluted with maladaptive bullshit that every new item you see you have to pause and google in case it'll ruin your run. The game itself is fun, but the balancing have made enjoyable runs 1 in a million. And anytime an item is viewed by the community as strong and fun, the creators hear ""too strong and makes the game easy"". Now because of their crusade there are only maybe 50% of items that are actually worth getting, most offering little to no benefit at all (yay brother bobby), with a good 10-20% being items you would never take outside of extremely situational runs, and the other 30% being completely useless.

I used to love this game but playing it feels like the game is actively trying to punish you. It goes out of it's way to ruin your runs in weird ways that you should never expect. If you get this game, expect to have to google interactions and mechanics for hours, since they cant seem to find any semblance of consistency or transparency there."

17433,"Really fun game, I don't know what I can say that others haven't, really. This game is packed with RNG goodness, from randomly generated dungeons to randomly spawning items and upgrades, to anything else you can think of.
It's got a great ""pick up and play"" kind of thing going for it, so even if you feel bored but don't have time to invest into a big game at the moment, you can just pick up Isaac and do a run."

17462,"it's the best game ever, everything about it from the enemies to the characters and different abilities and items..... the story-line is also amazing...  it's beautiful truly one of a kind game and I would recommend it to all humans on this earth. blam."
17463,Sus game
17464,"As someone who loves ETG i can really appretiate certain parts of this game (and really hate other parts)

PROS---

*for one thing the graphics are simple and nice. it can run on most machines at monitor refresh rate
*theres alot of achievements...like alot alot. they advertise the game as a 500+ hour game and that doesnt suprise me one bit
*workshop support. thats always something i wish ETG had (i know it has a mod loader). its somewhat active of a community and theres quite a few total revamp mods for the game


cons--- 

*its kinda confusing as to what i need to do sometimes in order to unlock new items or characters. theres very little help as to what you need to do in order to get like anything
*similar to last con i feel like theres a lack of direction (not from like a story side, but from a like this is what you need to do next). i always felt like ETG did that really well while still letting the player figure out secrets and hidden bosses.
*the 4 way directional shooting hurts my head all the time. its not like a full on con, it just upsets me
*i feel like the rooms feel kinda cramped, even more so when you get unluck enough to spawn into a room with it covered with rocks and poop, making it hard to move (and shoot enemies in 4 directions)

overall? 8/10. just buy the stupid game. its 15 dollars AND has DLC. theres no real reason not to. it has soemthing for everyone just has some cons that at the end of the day make it its own game."
17465,Great rougelike dungeon crawler
17466,"Good Game I like, but the fact that you have to donate 879 coins to machine to make the lost playable is not fun"
17467,Wakey wakey bakey shakey succ mi nuts pu$$y
17468,"I just caved for the DLC as of writing this review. It's still amazing without DLC.
edit: played 298 hours since this review and still unlocking stuff. the DLC is worth it."
17469,i got killed by a shit good game
17470,Strongly recommend. The controls are smooth and the aesthetic is unique and it feels like a roguelike. There's a lot of fun content to learn and explore with a very rewarding and very complex powerup system with so many crazy combinations. Watching people speedrun this game is something else.

17484,"This game has been requested alot, and I think it's about time I review it. This game has a fantastic, dark and brooding storyline, and interesting gameplay. This game is hands down the Best Rougelike Game if not the Best Game ever made. Compared to other Rougelikes like Neon Abyss and Enter The Gungeon, this game has infinite replayability and so many amazing characters.
This game gets a 1000/10, I wouldn't trade this game out for anything else.

17494,"Repetitive. Most of the fun comes from slowly working your way up through multiple runs, and seeing what you've done marked out on the title screen, and unlocking more and more items through the game. Modding is hella fun. Sense of progression is hella fun. Having broken runs is hella fun, and overcoming a shitty run is also hella fun. Not for everyone, but those that enjoy it will love it."
17495,"very fun, and when you just wanna screw around after seeing tear of graces old videos or albinos videos or some other TBOI players videos you can just turn on the debug menu and dick around for however you want

17765,THIS GAME IS DRAINING MY SOUL
17766,"FOR FUCK, The range on the whip enemies is a bit much"
17767,"Binding of Isaac, bears one of the great sins of modern gaming upon its shoulders, underdeveloped and frail as they may be.
This is yet another game that put zero effort into communicating with the player. It views the player as an obstacle to overcome, not a person who wants to enjoy themselves. You will never see an in-game item description. Your stats are 'explained' with a simple pictogram, and that is only viewable from the pause menu, you'll have to figure out what it all means on your own, or consult the wiki.
And that's all the solution the developers saw necessary. Open another tab, and stop playing to read the wiki every 20 seconds. Why should they bother explaining anything? That's more effort on their end! Instead, the community should figure out everything by themselves. The controls? Unexplained! Items? Unexplained! Map icons? Go Fuck Yourself, they're unexplained! And even if you bother memorizing the wiki, it won't help you when clearing a room drops the loot to an inaccessible spot, such as in the middle of a pit you can only traverse with flight, one of the rarest abilities. And if that loot is much-needed health? Eat shit, asshole! It's still gonna be inaccessible! 

I will not praise a game, that purposefully sets out to make you feel like a fool for trying to enjoy yourself.
If I wanted that experience, I'd go play Last of Us 2, where at least the devs have the integrity to admit that Fun was explicitly left out of the design process. 

I will not praise a game, that puts forth no effort, into helping a player into the world. If I wanted that experience, I would play a game that has been in Early Access for 5 years, and is still improving, like Escape from Tarkov. 

What I will praise this game for, is the accurate depiction of a zealot, following their god without question. 

Otherwise, finish your fucking game, developers."

defiently a better experience as the whole bundle but still has hours upon hours of content in the base version of the game too.

repentence dlc defiently adds a great amount of extras alongside mod support which lets you add to the fun further with community created content. After the recent updates the dlc has only gotten better with continued love and support"

17792,"The Binding Of Issac might be the first action roguelike and it gained a cult following for a reason. The art style is gorgeous, the music is haunting, the power ups are inventive and just countless. But sadly over all those years besides numerous DLC's there wasn't made any changes to the core game and its mechanics. It has clunky controls. The enemies has too much health and their hitboxes are tiny. Which makes the battles unnecessary long and just kills the replayability for me."
17793,This game is absolutely incredible and has almost infinite play ability

17828,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures, and playing with his toys, as his mom watched christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above;
""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""
""I will do my best to save him, my lord"" his mother replied, Rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.
Again, the voice called to her; ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world, and confess his sins!"" ""I will follow your instructions lord, I have faith in thee"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room, away from the evils of the world.
One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of god calling to her; ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you""
""Yes lord, anything"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice, your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room, and end his life as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else""
""Yes lord"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.
Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the basement, hidden under his rug.
Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below."
17829,why are we born just to suffer?
17830,Very fun. kill mommy
17831,"I played so much and still have so much to unlock.
One of the most popular roguelites/likes on the market with multiple characters to choose from and HUNDREDS of items to unlock.

17888,"When my friend told me to play this game, I diddn't wanna play it. I was like ""ahh no please I don't want to play this"", but what do I say now. I have nearly 200 hours in this game, and it is still fun. So if you're searching for a great indie-game (which isn't multiplayer so you don't even need friends) I can definetly reccomend this game. 
In my opinion one of the best games out there and the best indie-game I've ever seen.
By the way, Edmund, fuck you for making such a shitty game :)"

17911,"Isaac's strength is it's replayability: there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of different item combinations that can drastically change how your playthrough goes. If your an achievement hunter, you'll certainly enjoy this game, as there's tons of them. Good time killer as well. Give the game a try.

Base Game Score (Rebirth): 9/10"

There are a lot of achievements and even if you are not going for a 100%, there are ingame markers to show how much of the game you have completed. 9.9/10 cause of recent nerfs to certain items that did not deserve it (god head)."

17978,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an extremely fun roguelike game that makes each run seem unique. It is certainly one of my favorite games and you can easily spend sooo much time in it!
17979,I probably have over 100hrs in this. I've had it for years and just got it on steam not to long ago. Its such a fun easy game to play with so many Items. I don't think I've ever had the same run twice in the hrs I've played.

17996,This game is quite honestly a masterpiece! Truly thats all I can say and I hope everyone buys this game and experiences what I have.
17997,f
17998,"This game is a great experience. It is definitely difficult and require a good amount of time, retries and careful observation at times, but if you're willing to put that time in, it can quickly become the best game you've most likely ever played. The story is amazing and emotional and not laid out for you, it requires your own thought and perspective, making each of the 22 endings (if you have all the dlc) unique and exciting. The game is fast paced, combat heavy, bullet dodging, full of twists and turns and secrets and thanks to the rng element, every run is different every time. The insane amount of characters, endings, hundreds of items, secrets, bosses and enemies really makes this game never feel dull. I will be playing this game for hundreds of more hours in the coming future and might even try to 100% all achievements. It surprises me each time i unlock something new of discover a new area because there are times i find myself running through the same floors wondering what i need to do to get something new, but boy when you do finally get it, prepare yourself for a goodie bag of completely different things to come along with it! 

That's just the base game, there is greed mode which is wave after wave of enemies you can fight through and eventually get yourself to the Mega Greed boss (and eventually Ultra Greed once you play enough to unlock ""Greedier"" mode). It is eventful, jam packed with things to kill and projectiles to dodge and items to try. The sheer number of different builds you can make in such a short time is incredible. 

Each mode you play can unlock things for the base story, other modes, and even new challenges to try! Challenges being set characters and builds you start with, each with their own unique twists to make it hard to beat, or even just some wacky fun stuff. You can even build on top of them to see how powerful they can get, or change it entirely depending on what you find and how you use it.

Regardless if youre playing casually for fun, to grind endless things, or a pro attempting to do some crazy things or challenge yourself to the max, this game is for you. It's for everyone given you can handle dying a handful of times when you first start.

I hope more dlc content, a new isaac sequel or even a new game from this development team comes out in the future so i can enjoy even more amazing content. <3"

If you can get past its absolute grodiness and macabre motif then you'll be in for easily the best rougelite out there. Even the base game will warrant you hundreds of hours.

18050,Absolutely annoying and a curse to my soul. It is extremely fun but slowly becomes the thing tying you doing from continuing in life. This game is quite literally impossible to 100% completely. It is the worst game of all time and I really hope I could kill the developers. All in All 10/10 game would recommend

18128,this game ruined my social life and destroyed my mental health
18129,Yes.
18130,It's reminiscent of oldschool Legend of Zelda style dungeons with gameplay that keeps you on your toes. Items require strategy upon use and it helps to exercise your memory because not every item is necessarily a buff. They ave debuffs as well which can add a challenge.
18131,The best way to cry in life!

18195,"Honest to god one of the best games I've ever owned, the procedural generation and progression of unlocks provides hundreds of hours of playtime.

18241,chef's kiss
18242,One of my ALL time favorite games. There are so many amazing combinations of items. May be the all time best rogue like I've ever played. I haven't even scratched the surface of the tainted characters yet and have 500 hours of game time. If you're looking for a game that you can spend hours mastering and has extremely high replay-ability then you've found it. Big suggestions for new comers is the item description mod. This will help you learn the hundreds of items faster.
18243,gaming like a gamer
18244,I hope this child is ok
18245,"Generally a good game and an Indie Classic , but later expansions and bosses - especially Delirium - just show how the devs went on like ""Screw the player, just throw bullshit at him and call it hard lolz"" and it ruins the general fun I am trying to have with the game. 

Yes it's a challenging and sometimes satisfying experience, but some stuff feels like ""hope for good items or just screw you"" by a LOT. 

"
18246,fun as hell but u will rage a lot.
18247,"Wonderful game. I always thought I'd never be into a roguelike, but this one changed that for me. The lore and concept in general are very intriguing (albeit, dark). Probably most people don't play this game with religious commentary or ideas about abuse/its effects in their mind, but for me it adds to why the game is so fascinating. Aside from that though, the game itself is an absolute blast. The progression feels like a good pace and is rewarding. The more you unlock, the more every run feels like a brand new game. It's so fun to experience this game over and over again because there's always a new, wacky way to win or try something different/absurd. I honestly feel like my words can't really do justice to how fantastic this game is. Would recommend to just about anyone."
18248,This game is massive.

18251,"A fun game to play with friends. I recommend it. While you're here, Please enjoy this pie recipe:
Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 brown sugar
4. 1/2 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples -peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double crust pie
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F ( 220 degrees C )
2. Combine butter , white sugar ,brown sugar, water , cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside
3- Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices
4. Roll out top crust into 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 ( 1-inch ) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie,coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ) and bake until the crust is golden brown , the caramel on the top is set and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing"

18262,"Superb game, every time you die you get set back to the start, the further you reach the more items and the stronger the items you receive are. It really feels every time you are just trying to delve just a tad further into the unknown.

Game starts off relatively easy but the more times you beat it, the more harder the game gets from unlocking new end-game bosses to unlocking new alternative floors. It really help keeps the game fresh and consistently challenging throughout. I've played for 177 hours and I've still only unlocked 209/637 steam achievements.

May the RNG gods be on your side."

The new items are pretty cool and a few of them have the same game-breaking feel that the old (now patched out) ones did.

Repentance is a mixed bag. Killed some of my favourite items, but also made items I would never ever pick up viable. Starting to really love it. I still think AB+ was the golden era, though."

18282,good
18283,Its like Dark Souls but for pimps
18284,everything
18285,I hate that I love this
18286,"So I waited for a good two weeks to review this after purchasing. I wanted to have some actual gameplay to base my review on. Overall, I'd probably recommend the Repentance expansion, with a few warnings.

So first, the Pros. The game itself still plays just like Isaac did in Afterbirth+. Same controls, Slightly upgraded graphics (Hearts pulse, some enemies have upgraded sprites, etc) and similar room shapes, with a few new setups. I like the idea of Spike Rocks - crossing a gap becomes more of a consideration, and not just an automatic thing. Having some new enemies and bosses to learn is pretty fun as well. There are a few new items with interesting characteristics.

Now for the cons. First off, if you aren't prepared for it, Repentance is a pretty rough step up in difficulty from Afterbirth+, and not just when playing on Hard difficulty. Even on normal, enemies have faster fire rates and some move faster, or more often. I was frustrated enough early on that I almost reverted my install to an Afterbirth+ version. But I stuck with it.... It's not impossibly hard, just harder. Prepare to lose a few more runs early on, especially if you aren't already pretty practiced at playing Isaac. Second, there are many items that bring very little that wasn't already in the game. And the game seems intent on giving those items. Again, and again, and again. I can't count how many times I've gotten Supper, 4.5V Battery, and Booster Pack already. Granted a little health and some cards are great, but Supper is just a re-skin of old items, and I'd like to see more new.

My only other rant is that runs seem pretty rigged. Maggy runs often end up with speed down items, Blue Baby (???) gets a ton of red hearts, etc. The exciting synergies that broke the game occasionally are much more rare. 

If you're a bit masochist, then Isaac: Repentance is probably right up your alley. You'll die a bit more, but the wins you get feel more rewarding. But it's not a necessary expansion to enjoy Isaac."
18287,Punishing but addicting!
18288,fajna
18289,yea
18290,super cooll
18291,"It is a game. A game with mechanics, visuals, sound, and a control scheme. Some people will like these things. Some won't. I do. There is a possibility that our two perspectives on what we find entertaining may be symmetrical and you would find enjoyment from this experience."

18298,"[h1]The Binding of Isaac is a game that I will hold close to my heart until the end of time[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
Ever since my purchase of this game on the Christmas of 2015, I have loved this game. To it's ridiculous synergies with items, to the unique quirks of every character, The Binding of Isaac is a game I am still to this day, finding out new things to discover. 700+ items and 188 trinkets makes this game seem like it had ever ending combos.

Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, and Repentance have improved this game for the better, yes, it's more money from your mother's credit card you're stealing for more content, but it's content that is worth unlocking and discovering within the game. Every dlc will add 2 or more characters and they somehow made them more and more unique every dlc than the last. Characters like the Forgotten, a skeleton who swings a bone and can switch to a soul like counterpart who shoots tears.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2607918827
I bought the game a few months after the dlc Afterbirth released, so I didn't have just the Rebirth experience, I didn't know Afterbirth+ was a thing until probably a month after that one release in January of 2017, but Repentence was the dlc I was truly excited for. The fact that it was a collab between the Antibirth (a Rebirth mod) devs and the Isaac devs, it was truly something to be hyped for.

Like I have said before, the characters have their own uniqueness to them all, by uniqueness, I mean by comparing them to the base character of the game, Isaac. He's the foundation for comparing to other characters, (unless you're Lazarus, then your quirk is dumb). Now, with the addition of the selection of tainted characters with the Repentance dlc, there's more than 30 characters to play as throughout your playtime.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2607920946
[b] From this point forward, I will be addressing the game by ""Isaac"" [/b]

Actually playing the game, Isaac is very simple, just reach to the final boss and beat them, then go to this new final boss and beat them, then beating them 9 more times, then- Alright, there's a lot of final bosses, mostly because there are multiple paths you can take in this game. Some paths are shorter than others. You have to figure out the secrets of the game to get to further paths and more unlocks. Now, from this being a rougelite, once you die in the game, it's all the way back to the beginning. RNG is a main play in this game like any rougelite, getting random items, random enemies to go against, getting random trinket, and so on and so forth. A lot of the gameplay of this game is remembering how enemies work and memorizing which items to what. With 700+ items, 188+ trinkets, and 431+ enemies and bosses, you'd think you won't remember everything right? Well, just spend over 500 hours like me being addicted to this game and you'll memorize stuff in no time. 

[h1]Repentance[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[b]This segment isn't going to be long, I just wanted to separate this dlc from other 2 and the base game.[/b]

Repentance was the most hyped up dlc for this game without a doubt, with the flop that was Afterbirth+, this one was going to be promising. With so much content on the way, and all of this excitement, who wouldn't? Unfortunately, we had to wait 3 YEARS for this dlc to come out. There were a few reasons why, but you do your research on that. The point is, those 3 years for me at least, were worth the wait, this dlc added so much to the game, even more than Afterbirth+ post all of the booster packs they released. This was big. This dlc made the game harder in every aspect. It's a lot more of the challenge to completely break a run, which a lot of people were very angry about, but for me, I respect it. I now don't feel the urge of trying to break the game every run I have, I actually want to play the game normally. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
This game is great, and you can't change my mind. It's a challenging experience that I will always hold close to my heart, with it's completely dark plot, to the agonizing pain of dying so far in a run, it's great. Now give Edmund your money, right now."

18300,"Broke my keyboard 
10/10"
18301,"This game sucks, absolute 10/10"
18302,Gud
18303,"Truly the biggest waste of time I've ever played. Even on hard, the game's difficulty is trivial EXCEPT for a couple of rooms that are at this point all but scripted for you to take damage, and in turn for you to reset 'cause of tilt. The man who designed some of these enemies should think of other career choices when I have to stand there holding left arrow at an enemy for 20 seconds because the monster has 4 forms before fucking dying. The only time you actually take damage is when youre so bored you lose focus or get spawned in a room with 10 fucking bulletspamming enemies or the bullshit telefragging bosses. 
This game sucks and I regret spending my time on it especially when I know I will return to it because of its appeal, but I preach to you; DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."

18358,"[b]One of my favourite Rogue-Lite.[/b]

The ton of unlockables not only make finishing the game a long and arduous task, but also give it unlimited possibilites of what could happen every run. Skill is rewarded with some characters and features, but not being the best player shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game.

CW: There are some pretty heavy topics in this game, mostly related to childhood (neglect, abuse, divorce) and death, some pretty brutal. Do not expect a good ending. (actually, there is [b]one[/b] now, with the latest DLC out)."

18365,"Fantastic game, I was initially put off by it because of both the art style and the way in which your tears shoot, but once I got used to it, I realized the sheer amount of content this game contains. Although there's no way I'd ever come close to finding everything there is to know about it, this is definitely one of the best roguelixes out there. It's probably the most replayable by a long shot due to the sheer variety it offers. Fantastically designed with only some minor complaints here and there, Isaac is definitely worth playing."

18395,"[b]Important note for anyone considering a purchase:[/b]
I HIGHLY recommend getting all the DLC available (Repentence, Afterbirth+), as the game changes greatly from DLC to DLC. 

Without a doubt one of the greatest rogue-likes of all time.

What makes this game so unique is all of the personality injected into it from the creator, somehow portraying some shockingly dark and stark topics, represented through gruesome displays of viscera, and making it funny and endlessly re-playable."

The replayability of this game is insane, and every run is different; there may be some general strategies that you'll follow between runs, but each time is unique. Trying to get every ending with every character has been an excellent way to spend time so far, and I'm looking forward to finishing up with it soon. The amount of enjoyment/mileage you'll get out of this game once you start properly sinking your teeth into it is insane. Do check some gameplay ahead of time though; the art and general messy, gross visual style isn't something for everyone."

Hades and Enter the Gungeon are great and came close for me, but the sheer amount of content and synergies in the game are unstoppable, especially with repentance going above and beyond by adding more items, bosses, and even adding more than double the amount of characters to the game with tainted characters. Kinda weird to introduce to friends tho cause everything just looks so disgusting if you aren't used to seeing it"

18490,"An amazing game that has infinite length and depth because of it's supreme modding community. Thematically, it is definitely unique and the amount of lore is apparent and deep without being overbearing, despite lending itself admirably to the game's general aesthetic and play. Overall one of the best if not the best game I have ever enjoyed, and for a very good reason. I recommend playing with all DLCs, but if you can't, pirate and install the Antibirth mod, which will show you a glimpse of what is possible in the game and hopefully make you buy the real deal. Absolutely stunning game that has such a charm."

18530,"This game is like a soft and familiar, pillowy pair of arms that embrace you after a long and hard day. They're welcoming, quick to alleviate you of your troubles. Their fingers comb through your hair like vaseline smeared teflon. You are home. You are relaxed. Your breathing remains calm, steady and full. But the arms then tighten around your chest. It's a bit harder to breath now. The fingers that once so tenderly caressed your locks now link each other like flesh gears. Tighter again. 
""This game was supposed to calm me down!"", you think as you thrash wildly against the grip. Your pulse spikes and throttles your chest. The arms are now cracking your fucking ribs as you let out muffled screams into the ambiguous body. Blood drips down your chin as your lungs pop inside your inner cavity like Bezo's own brand bubble wrap. Your brain roars for oxygen but you can't get any as the lungs that once took it all in are clogging up your trachea. The figure throws your body down and stamps on your fucking head.

What was once a warm embrace has ended with your head being caved in. Blood is everywhere, your ghost is thrashing into the clouds where you shall sit in purgatory, asking yourself why you would trust an embrace so warm, but all the same one you never deserved.

What I just described is what playing The Binding of Isaac truly feels like.

And for that I cannot truly recommend it enough. I fucking love this game."

18553,"the binding of issac is one of the best dungeon crawling games I have ever played. if you consider old style games, without extreme graphics or large maps, progressive stories and lots of general work put into the game's making. the binding of issac is simple, but good. the game mechanics are addicting. the gameplay itself is short but fun. you can quit anytime, and are encouraged to play multiple playthroughs. even the people who are complaining about the game in the reviews played like 1000 hours. which is exceptional even for triple A games. since those tend to focus around profit despite the amazing graphics and music. don't get me wrong, the music is also great. fits the setting well, and I even listen to it when I'm doing other things. like reading or playing other video games. it's almost as good as the dark souls soundtrack. anyways. the game is good. it doesn't take long to start, or play, there is no commitment to any story or characters. there are no goals, unless you pick a challange, but you do get rewarded. 

you do not have to play much. but you CAN and WILL play it for a long time. because it's fun and addictive. the randomness alongside the insane amount of content and challanges will keep you occupied. and that's before completing the dlcs, or getting all the playable characters. I personally prefer azazel since my mc almost always makes deals with the devil and it saves time. anyways, a good buy. worth your time. honestly much better than all of the mobile games I've ever played, except maybe other old school games like pokemon which was honestly good despite being so childish and iconic. yeah, major replayability for single player. very popular. up there with undertale in popularity."

18565,Best game I've ever played. I already had 500 hours on Xbox but playing this on PC for Repentance is the best!.
18566,yes spend all money i'm a broke wait... hol up who wrote this script
18567,cum
18568,"Repetance is both the best and worst addition to The Binding of Isaac. The new items, synergies and QoL changes are very welcome, but at the same time it introduced a lot of bugs that I've never seen before in past DLCs. For example if you get a deadly combo that clutters your screen with tears, RIP your run. The game WILL crash if you hold the shooting button for too long (around 5 seconds), so getting combos such as Trisagion + The Parasite feels like a punishment.
I have a feeling that most of these issues came from the addition of what used to be the Antibirth mod. Firstly the game simply drops native Linux support in favor of mod support, which by itself is not a big deal since the game runs perfectly on Linux using Proton, but it was likely a workaround to accomodate Antibirth into the main game. Which says a lot about how ""well"" coded this thing might be. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Antibirth or whoever is behind it, but I feel like a mod should have stayed as a mod. You can't possibly ""glue"" a mod into an actual, fully-fledged game without running into issues. Code refactoring is possible but difficult at this point which means a slow death for this otherwise amazing game."
18569,is nice

18601,"this game has lodged itself so far into my cerebral cortex that i see in isaac references. i go to church with my 'isaac pogs for good items' mod installed. every time my preacher brings up the book of revelations i shout and scream at him that its an active item with a 6 room cooldown, gives you 1 soul heart, and a horseman for every first floor boss. usually i get kicked out and now i am banned from any house of the holy. 

10/10, game fucking sucks"
18602,"This game is broken. I try to play and the game shows a character, the one I choose. I can not play this character though, I have to press start to actually bring in a character I can play. The original just stays there like an AFK character making the game impossible. I tried restarting the game multiple times and have tried using a new save file, nothing works"

18632,monsters in the dungeon tech-x is s-tier
18633,you know.... I think its a pretty good game.
18634,a lot of fun until you hit a plateau of achievements you don't want to do or characters you don't want to play as but that doesn't happen until like 600+ hours in
18635, I've been playing this game since it's early days and I still love it now as much as I did then. 100% reccomend!

18663,10/10 game
18664,holy fucking shit
18665,"It's a biblical themed dungeon crawler.  There is a LOT more to this game than what you see on the first dozen (successful) playthroughs.  This game is ridiculously difficult at first with a steep learning curve which makes each win feel so rewarding.   As you unlock items and get familiar with synergies (and items to avoid), the game gets more strategic.  You will find yourself praying to RNJesus (RNG can be a bitch at times).  Secrets, super secrets, and challenges.  Deal with the devil, take your chance on eating some random pills you found in moms purse.   The real reason I play is probably because Isaac is the only one who cries more than I do."

18736,"Really good roguelike with very good replayability.
I'd say that it's one of the best roguelikes that I have played and I still haven't explored everything that this game has to offer.

Edit: I now have 100 hours on this game along with Repentance and I love this game. There is so much gameplay and replayability. The game also supports mods and that's always a very good sign. One thing I don't like about Repentance is that it's still unfinished, but I hope that it will be finished some day. I plan on getting Dead God (Getting all achievements), and I hope it will get even better after that.

So Yea... I got Dead God after about 300 hours. I pretty much tried to speedrun it and got it quite early comparing it to some other people. Right now I don't have any plans on starting a new Save File, I did install a lot of mods and now I'm playing with random characters and doing completely random runs.

I definitely recommend this game!!"

18838,A perfect roguelike with years of polish and rebalancing added on top. The game focuses on exploring procedurally generated dungeons looking for treasure items that change how you play and fighting bosses before advancing further into the dungeon. Game is cool.
18839,its fun
18840,"Great game, very fun to play and depending on your items can be quite the challenge. The synergy of some items is very fun and whit the DLC´s there is a lot of content to unlock and keep you busy. i strongly recommend the game."

18848,"Very Good Game,
I don't have the game but I can write a review about it
I dunno how the fuck I am doing this but is a good game
I know"
18849,"Arguably one of the best rouglelike game on the market. Vast amount of content, excellent story and art direction."
18850,"edmundmcmillen, you little fucker"
18851,It's good
18852,Best game you will ever play. Hands down.
18853,is very good game
18854,it are fun
18855,I'm on a losing streak of 829
18856,trash game with it's shit isaac
18857,"Kid cries tears at grotesque beings.

10/10"
18858,"On surface level, this game looks very shallow in its gameplay. But, if you play it for a little bit, you will come to realize that there is so much more to this game than just beating mom. Beating mom is like the tip of the iceberg for this game. I have enjoyed this game so far and am expecting to enjoy it for the rest of my playthrough."
18859,One of my favorite games of all time.
18860,"fun but the spiders

why the spiders"
18861,"The Binding of Issac has been one of my most favorite rogue-likes ever, and will possibly always be my favorite of that genre. I had just gotten into it due to my boyfriend introducing me to TBOI, in which he also loves dearly. With it's fair share of lore, potty humor, and many more cringe-inducing things, I have fallen in love with it. I am looking forward to the TBOI: Four Souls card game, because of how genuinely obsessed I am with it. Thanks Ed Mcmillen!! I will not become back my money! :^)"
18862,"If you like dying lots this game is pretty fun
"
18863,it's good
18864,It's good
18865,This game turns you into a manchild who cries and wines for the smallest of reasons. Great game
18866,so cute my scrungly <3333 double tap when
18867,We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty
18868,gud
18869,e
18870,This game is just awesome!
18871,I suck at this game but its fun
18872,Haven't played that much but from what i saw its kinda good.
18873,this is a good game its fun but its very hard
18874,This is the best fucking game of all time. This is literally the best thing I have ever spent time doing. I am going to miss the birth of my first child because I'll be getting my win streak up.
18875,"Help me, I am playing this game with someone that is actually driving me nuts, like bonkers, totally fucking insane. Please send help he smells bad too,"
18876,good.
18877,AMAZING SO FAR!
18878,I think the binding of isaac is an amazing game. It is fun to see all the new unlockables that you work so hard for. I haven't played repentance yet but I have heard that they nerfed and buffed most of the items which got read of my only problem.
18879,yes
18880,amazing
18881,"well is isaac, I need to say more? some people hate it, a lot of people love it, me? I have over 190 hours of game legally, I have it on the switch and I played over 1000 hours since antibirth so yeah , I love this game. I recommended it? yeah, is not for everyone, but if you like a challenge, and enjoy the roguelikes this is a must."
18882,Isaac go bbrrrrr very epic
18883,it makes me sad but I like it
18884,"Love this game, got introduced to it by my cousins one time on his laptop and i just loved it immediately, here I am maybe seven years later still finding it so fun and such a good offline laptop game for traveling."
18885,this is not a video game this is a full time job
18886,Great game. All the DLCs are worth it as well. My favorite roguelike game along with dead cells
18887,yes
18888,Damn these kids sure are naked
18889,"This game did as it promised; left me in a bind. I used to think, after the Rebirth DLC, that is had lost a lot of its enjoyability. Since then, they have released only positive and replayable content. Big thumbs up. Poor Isaac, sad story :(."
18890,This game will fuck you in the ass and you will still love it
18891,very good game
18892,E
18893,"This game is my favourite roguelike ever. It's a combination of 2d zelda dungeon exploration with wacky items and an over-arching dark religious theming. Buy all the expansions because they add so much content you don't want to be without.

Pros:
-Sometimes you carry the run, sometimes the run carries you. Not every run is an instant win but neither is it a guaranteed failure.
-A game can be said to be a series of interesting decisions. Isaac manages this perfectly by having those decisions impact you constantly. Do I spend a bomb to chance a secret room? Should I use this key for the shop or this chest? Do I want explosive tears even though it may kill me?
-Hours upon hours of content. I'm at 250 hours currently and I'm only about 66% done.
-Strong theming. Isaac is about the mind of a delusional, abused child who's highly religious. The areas, items and characters all reflect this. I've never seen another game do anything like this
-For every run you have to consider which route to go down or which item to unlock. Do I try to take Isaac down to Satan or should I up to Cathedral for a chance at defeating ???. Each character has a different unlock for each endgame boss, most of which unlock cool new items themed for that character.

Cons:
-Edmund (the creator and lead designer) sometimes overdoes it on the difficulty. There's two characters which die in one hit and two that cannot gain more than 3 HP. Some of the challenge runs feel hugely unfair and require you to luck out.
-Lore is vague so you'll have to look it up
-Item descriptions are vague and could get you killed if you don't know what it does. Install the mod External Item Descriptions after you beat Mom once.
-Initially the game is very complex and almost every item has nuances to it. Watch some gameplay first before getting stuck in.
-The unlocks you need to go deeper into the game are confusing. You must defeat [spoiler]Mom's foot, Mom's heart (x10), Satan (x5), Isaac(x5), Lamb, ???, Mega Satan, Hush(x3), Delirium, Mother and finally Dogma and Beast.[/spoiler]
-Some of the newest expansion is a bit broken and unfinished but this is all coming soon."
18894,this  literally happened to me
18895,must play and then cooopppe.
18896,"It is good as Hell (see what I did there? It is a Christian game and Hell, you get it, right?)."
18897,"I think this is a great game, I really enjoy it a lot, Bluebaby is really funny and cool."
18898,"No bigger self confidence boost then being constantly killed by something...

UGLY."
18899,"quite simply, just the best game i've ever played. it's a game made with replay-ability in mind. it has an amazing, beautifully crafted story. no one run is the same, with its amount of unlockables and generated levels. after 300 hours, can still say its beautiful."
18900,Best game in the genre
18901,nice
18902,fuck this game
18903,"This is an absolute YES when it comes to rogue-lites. As of time of writing, I've played 100h, on the dot. I have only got a 3rd of the achievements in these 100h, I have not fully finished any character yet, I have not unlocked a character who is known for its 2 hit a room difficulty and I have not even gotten to the Tainted versions, which are the base characters with a new quirk to how you play them. If you like a game that will take your time and fucking eat it for breakfast this one is for you. Anyone with any love for rogue-lites should try this game, PERIOD. 

And even if you do finish the game 1001%, there are community mods that get you new characters, new items and new challenges and more stuff to do that I don't even know

P.S - This is a pretty good game for the in-between waiting games, E.G, you're waiting in queue for another game or you don't have time for a long time commitment or even you got time to game for 1h, you can confidently slide in a run."
18904,"Game is insanely challenging but incredibly fun. Haven't found anything like it.

Even after 420 (nice) hours in this game I'm still finding ways to use items or get hit.

Plus the modding community is hilarious and full of memers. Strongly recommend if you like Risk of Rain or if you like roguelites."
18905,"This game is a drug, I've studied this game more than any class I've ever taken in all my years of high school.



10/10 don't ever buy this"
18906,Fun game wanna buy DLC's but cant atm
18907,get gud
18908,"Funnily enough this game is super fun, maybe its something in me that likes to see small children suffer and cry on poop but thats for a therapy session"
18909,cute game uwu
18910,I LIKE THE VIDE O GAME also Lmao looka t how long ive played for 69 hours thats Funny
18911,total banger
18912,I found this game while looking through youtube years ago. I immediately got the xbox version. I got a few expansions but the newest one was taking too long so I got in on my computer. I like this game so much I also got it on my switch. This game is so good I bought it 3 times. Get this game. It's addicting and challenging.

18928,This is the best. Jus' sayin'!
18929,yes daddy
18930,fun

18932,"game very good
"
18933,Its a really fun game i recommend watching videos before playing
18934,"Got Dead God.
Good game.

Edit: Got Dead God twice. Great game."
18935,"Its unfunny on how bad this game is .Recommended, would waste hours more."

18942,Great game but why isn't Afterbirth Mac compatible I want to do crazy shit with poop
18943,ty northerlion
18944,good game about murder and abortion and deadly tears..... it's pretty fun............ there's also divorce
18945,I pee on crying babies. its hot tbh.
18946,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? It's a REALLY good game for poor people. Thousands of potential hours for a pretty easy cost. The more you play, the more unlocks you get, so each play feels unique."
18947,I want my 443 hours back
18948,I play to much of this game.
18949,every single friend that tried to get me into this game is gay now
18950,good
18951,nice
18952,good
18953,I loved it

18988,Pain

19000,A classic for all rouge like fans to play
19001,"Played it since 2016 and still loving it.  loved unlocking all characters and streaking for 3 years before repentance hit. Ive been frustrated accomplished and still suprised by this game.  I have no negatives. maybe the remote play is laggy but apart from that this game will be in your library and you will keep coming back.
"
19002,SO much replayability! One of my favorite games
19003,i-saac at this game
19004,"It's an incredibly diverse game with a lot to explore. What's nice is that a lot of the mechanics in the game are hidden, unexplained (except online by other users)."
19005,GOOD
19006,Do you like a challenging rouglite? sweet ass synergies? Biblical refrences? Then this is the game for you!
19007,I accidentally unlocked all the achievements before the new update when I transferred my save. Now I have an unrealistic amount of achievements for the time I put in so far. Gotta say that line still holds true for spending hundreds of hours and getting nothing. I hate this game. Would recommend
19008,funny baby goes through literally hell and heaven just to die
19009,sex niffa
19010,One of my favorite games. It offers thousands of hours of unique game play. Worth every penny.
19011,one of my favorite games
19012,eh its alright
19013,"This is honestly one of the best purchases I've made on steam.
I love everything from the art and humor to the dark undertones and story. Almost every item interacts with every other item so each run is unique, bosses are difficult but fair (most of the time) and each playable character comes with their own unique challanges and powers.

I will not become back my money"
19014,"this a good game i like it a lot and if i like it your going to love it
"
19015,"An incredible game about crying babies, blood and gore."
19016,"quality - 10/10
gameplay - 10/10
story - 9.5/10
variety of characters - 11/10
bosses - 10/10
repetitive - not that much
boring - no
fun - yes yes yes"
19017,"It is good, i guess. Don't know exactly, cause i barely played it"
19018,"cool game
"
19019,"lost majority of my life to this game
not sorry"
19020,epic
19021,epic game so much cool
19022,good game
19023,"It's hard as hell when you start but watching streamers like Lethalfrag made me better. But also get yourself the item identifier mod, just makes you avoid useless memorization"
19024,good :)
19025,"It's a pretty good game, it's not easy tho."
19026,its alright i guess
19027,"amazing game, the graphics are so cool i almost died, i am dead, but i will admit that it's quite hard, but i love putting the time to get really far in the game, 10 out of 69"
19028,Young boy cries his way back into his mothers womb to kill her from the inside out. Wholesome christian family fun right? right....?
19029,Who leaked my childhood trauma?
19030,Child learns about cruelty of life - Hard Mode
19031,its the best roguelite ever made
19032,Good
19033,"I guess after playing for 1000+ hours on Steam and another 500+ hours on Xbox I should review this.

The game is not without it's flaws but for some reason I keep on coming back for more. For me, it is a fun game I can just zone out and play for 30 minutes without having to think about much.

Having mods on PC makes it possible to have some of the minor annoyances fixed.

All in all, with over 1500 hours combined on this I would probably recommend it for people that like this type of game."
19034,very fun
19035,"No se por que este juego es tan turbio, pero es extremadamente adictivo pasar muchisimas horas farmeando items y los 700 logros que tiene masomenos, desde que pusieron el aftherbirth + jugar en dificil es otro mundo, ta dificil la cosa che pero lo podes intentar si no queres perder el pelo claro esta, aun asi farmear boses e items para hacer increibles sinergias es clave aprobao."
19036,yeah this is a good game
19037,its isaac how can you not like this game
19038,bussin
19039,Hard
19040,i cant play well but atleast i enjoy dieing 3000+ times
19041,the games just good man like honestly losing money not playing
19042,The best rogue-like.                     Fight me
19043,"700+ hours in and still have a blast playing. The DLC's are worth it, and Repentance gave so much more replay value. Game great."
19044,Good Game
19045,it's pretty good
19046,.
19047,"Someone once described the appeal of roguelites as ""Grinding an RPG without the time investment."" That's exactly what the incentive behind The Binding of Isaac holds. You constantly, chronically start as a downtrodden character, thrust into unimaginable hell, and need to quickly, calculatingly and confidently made decisions to get through some of the most disgusting bosses imaginable. It's the seven layers of Hell strewn with poop, and a twisted tale that somehow weaves even darker with each incarnation. Through the final DLC has landed, the draw will never dissipate: you're always ready to take another stab, competing against yourself and, on occasion, the world, in seeing how quickly you can bring this lonely boy to the end; whether that be a happy ending or not is an entirely different subject."
19048,This is one of the greatest games I've played due to the infinite replay value and huge amount of challenges and unlocks. There are so many different ways to play and the story is beautiful. I love every bit of this and was the best 15$ I've ever spent. Nothing else even comes close. I would say this is a must buy if you are into hard and challenging games.
19049,good
19050,thicc milf thighs
19051,isaac
19052,Good game but i suck balls at it
19053,300 hours and i still cant find quad shot

19058,"Incredible game, incredible story, incredible painful last second bossfight deaths."
19059,"its good
"
19060,i like
19061,It's pretty good
19062,its fun but challenging
19063,epic
19064,"This game is worth much more than the price it asks for. I bought it before it had most of it's expansions and it was great then and it's perfect now. Unique ways to unlock characters, a mix of fun and brutal challenges, co-op now, mod support, an intense amount of un-lockable items, and much more. In fact, im 300+ hours in and im still not completed the game. Personally would argue this is one of the best games ever made."
19065,fucking awesome game 10/10
19066,Yeah it's alright
19067,Trash buggy game
19068,11/10 would cry again
19069,The binding of Isaac is a great game with a lot of fun mechanics
19070,"Game crashes upon launch with the Afterbrth+ DLC, no error message is given so I don't know why it's crashing"
19071,Good game.
19072,"play it
"
19073,it good game
19074,"this game will keep you hooked for months, it will feel like bs sometimes but keep at it, it's so worth it.

19075,a
19076,I like dying
19077,very depressing game but 10/10
19078,videogame equivalent of self harm
19079,funny church bad game with poop would rage at bad rng again
19080,lots to unlock hope you like a grind because oh boy do i
19081,much fun yes
19082,"It's illegal how good this game is.
I would 100% recommend this game and for all the people wondering if they should buy the dlc, you should.
The base game has 10 characters, Repentance brings it up to 34 characters. PLEASE play this game, you won't regret it!"
19083,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
19084,d
19085,pretty cool.
19086,isaac
19087,"Much better than AB+; though again suffering from the ""new things should be even more difficult"" effect."
19088,Pretty fun :)
19089,why dat mf eye sac always cryin 😭😭😭
19090,fun game its hard at first but the more you unlock the more fun it gets
19091,pogger!1111! fri bindig of isc segs mod!11!!!
19092,This game is gross. I don't mind the p**p and p** but the mom yelling at me makes me sad so it ign 0/10
19093,"Great game, helping me get through school."
19094,"its a great bullet ""hell"" (reference)  if you like a chalenge you will like this game"
19095,One of the greatest games. ever. in general.
19096,Good
19097,"This game is practically legendary among rougelikes, and for good reason. It's only now after owning it for years that I've gotten into it, and I think that's in part due to the updated co-op that makes my friends really want to play.

The mystery and wackiness of it all is part of the fun, in my opinion- Those who want to know exactly what they're picking up are probably going to have a wiki tab open and find the learning process pretty tedious- Not really my style, but there is practically no ceiling for how busted your builds can be, so there IS an incentive to learn the synergies down to a hair.

It's just the dungeon crawling vibe that me and my friends were always looking for, so take my approval as a game in general, but ESPECIALLY cooperatively now."
19098,Incredibly diverse game filled with tons of secrets. Highly recommend for any fans of dungeon crawler rogue-likes. This is the pinnacle of the genre.
19099,"This game makes be so unbelievably angry, but I can't stop playing it. I die to edmund's bullshit again and again, but I keep coming back an hour later. Pro tip, don't try to full mark lost and tainted lost as your first two full marks like what i am doing, you will hate yourself for it."
19100,I downloaded a mod that turned a boss into Thanos. This amused me greatly. 10/10
19101,"This game took a little while for me to get into--I wasn't really trusting the process that the item unlocks rapidly compound to give the game its depth. Somewhere around the third hour it all started to click, and now I can see why some people choose to delve into the whole 400-500hr experience. I expect to have this installed for a long time as my go-to ""chill out"" game, similar to how Slay the Spire has been for me in years past."
19102,"Come for the gameplay, stay for the story <3
"
19103,"Pretty fun a bunch of characters and things to unlock!
just got to get the marks...
one mark... two marks... threee marks...
so many marks ahhahahahahahahh 
dont play if you wanna stay sane"
19104,Its very fun and cool
19105,One of the greatest games of all time.
19106,"Edmund McMillen, You litte F**ker You made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker!
"
19107,"I have approximately 600 hours playtime, if that doesn’t tell you something i dunno what will.
 One of my fav games, countless synergies, playstyles, combos, achievements and so on. You won’t get bored.. that’’ for sure.

19108,"I die a lot! 
[b]10/10[/b], I highly recommend it!"
19109,fuckin pog ass game
19110,"As angry as this game can make me, I believe it to be one of the most interesting and fun roguelikes out there. The game is very upfront about how random your success will be, but accidentally shattering every rule set in place has never been more fun. The enemies are disgusting and fascinating, each item is unique, and there is so. Much. Content. But, there is no Monkey Game Mode, so I have to give it a three out 100."
19111,"kewl

19112,Edmund mcMillen you little fucker. you made a shit of peice with your trash isaac its fucking bad this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a COW on a TRASH farm you sucker
19113,"Good
"
19114,"very good game, lots of content"
19115,Perfect game
19116,"As much as I liked this game, and did appreciate the new repentance update, as it added many items, synergies, rooms, and enemies, its just not as fun. I find myself disliking the new game changes more and more every time I play whether it's that the new update wasn't fully flushed out or there are just rooms intended to fuck you over unless you've broken the game, even on runs where I beat mega satan I'm annoyed by the game. Plus the nerfs to the devil room by having at least 10 trash items that nobody would ever want to use really diminishes the rewarding aspect of not taking any red heart damage on the floor and earning a deal."
19117,"The game is pretty fun, but it sucks having to buy every DLC, just to get the new hot thing."
19118,i hate this game

19163,Best roguelike game ever
19164,I have played for 666 hours and I recommend this game.
19165,"This is one of those games that you get on a whim and play religiously for a month and then abandon it, only to come back to it. It's a good game."
19166,Wonderful game. I am a beginner but I really enjoy it (as difficult as it is). :)
19167,Highly recommended
19168,fuck

19174,wow
19175,"wow this is really cool
"
19176,"the replayability of this game is amazing, the price is quite a steal for the contents it offers
"
19177,A fantastic roguelike that will likely take your hundreds of hours to fully experience the entire game. and it will be fully worth it.
19178,yes
19179,Addicitf
19180,I will become back my money.
19181,This game makes me wanna have a abusive mother with messed up religion mental status along side my dead cat guppy. Great game would cry again
19182,"Not balanced at all, been playing for almost 200 h and i have to wait days to get an actual good run."
19183,"If you like rougelites you will probably like TBOI. 
While being fairly RNG heavy, it still sports good gameplay, a unique artstyle and hours of fun."
19184,Yes
19185,The best Rogue-Like game ever made. And also the best сoсk and ball torture game.
19186,Very cool B)
19187,"This game is one of the best roguelikes ive played, the variery in monsters and items are insane (if you have all the DLCs) With a total of 714 items and 196 monsters this game has a lot of combos and playthroughs to be experienced. The items have been made in a way that almost all of them work together to make cool and/or powerfull combos that can help you finish a run."
19188,good game
19189,"The Binding Of Isaac Rebirth is an amazing game, probably one of the best games ever made."

19203,"It's litty one of the only games I'll play since I'm so picky. I see people saying the game is too hard to learn and repentance sucks and all that, but I never had that issue even with repentance? It's not like I've played the game a huge ton so I dunno. (Ignore those people to they just suck at the game /j)"
19204,niceeeee
19205,"very fun
"
19206,It is a grinding nightmare of hell that is a challenge and good for any completionist who likes to beat their head into a wall.  It is really fun but can be frustrating depending on if the randomness doesn't go your way.

19215,yep
19216,"awesome game, dont play if you have a life tho"
19217,"This is the right way to do a rougelike. It's fun. It has the perfect atmosphere. It's hard as shit, but not impossible. And it captures the perfect element of chaos in every room. Love it. Give it a try."
19218,One of my favorite Roguelike games of all time. This game is filled with thousands of hours of content that make every run feel fresh and fun.
19219,.
19220,good
19221,Its a good game that can keep you entertained for many days weeks months or even years and it has its flaws but overall a great game.
19222,"please someone help. i'm addicted, malding, and i fucking hate this game. please let me play anything else. i keep coming back to this awful game."
19223,EDMUUUUUUUND
19224,"Should be renamed to The Restressing of Isaac: Investment because god help your soul if you are a completionist. If you’re not, you’re going to have fun. If you are 100% focused on getting everything done, Edmund will drag you into the deep water and try to drown you with its content. There is a learning curve, a BS curve and a RNG curve that will burn away at your precious hours of life that you have on this earth. 

10/10 experience. Fun and exhausting."

19226,Haha baby shoot tear legend of zelda
19227,"fun, rewarding, and punishing. sometimes it really kicks you in the ***** and other times you are the god of the universe."
19228,Good game! Very Epic!
19229,"After playing this for over 500 hours via pc and switch, I've come to the conclusion that it's impossible to get bored of this game. There are always new things to discover and unlock, and the amount of depth the game has makes it very easy to get immersed in."
19230,its good but i accidently replaced my save file with the rebirth one and now its gone
19231,is good because it has poop
19232,Buy it if you hate fun and/or yourself

19238,"if I will kill myself soon then know that playing tainted Jacob and tainted Lazarus was a factor in that decision. Some of the worst ~150 hours of my life.

19242,I have really liked Rouge lite games and this is one of my favorites of what i played with the many opportunities the game gives you to get crazy powered up while also having runs that will kick you down like crazy but nothing every seems unfair. I just finished a normal Issac run and beat the mom boss and have so much more content to do so if you are worried about the game being small don't be. All in all i think i have found my new addiction of a game
19243,eye sak is baest gem
19244,Amazing. So many hours put into it & still not bored :)

19251,10/10  would rage an play again <3
19252,"This game is likely the pinnacle of the roguelike genre. Definitely not friendly to beginners though. This game will bust your balls and spit in your face while you're down, but if you can keep getting back up, eventually, you'll be kicking the game in its own nuts."

19261,its good ig
19262,it sure is a game
19263,THe game is really fun but it takes skill to play
19264,Hard and sometimes frustrating but fun.  Do not play if you have issues with Christianity getting potshots taken against it.  Or Christianity portrayed as a force for good. Or dark humor.  Or horrifying monsters.  Or deals with Satan.  Or Televangelists being insulted.  Or Bumbo (you monster).
19265,"This is my favorite game of all time and I would recommend anybody to at least give it a shot if they know someone who owns it or is interested in buying it. I have at least 1000 hours on console and the first purchase on my new PC was this game. It has infinite replayability. You will experience the highs of hilarious and broken runs, and the lows of the game trying to make you lose your hair. 10/10"
19266,eboye?
19267,"Look at my number of hours, now look at my % of trophies unlocked.
This game has by far the best gameplay-per-dollar ratio of any game on Steam, and for that alone you should buy this game. The fact that it's an amazingly fun and iconic title just makes it unfair to compare it to other games."
19268,"I need help with this game i cant run it and i tried everything i could to fix it so i just need someone to either explain how or literately make a video

Edit:
My god, it's been 200 hours from my previous review. I've still got shit to do. Stuff to see, to experiment. This game is a masterpiece. I love this game with all my heart. The Lost might've broken my hard drive, but he'll always have a spot in my heart drive. Edmund MacMillen. You beatiful son of a b*tch. You've done it again.
If you buy this game, buy everything. All the dlcs. It's worth it. Trust me. This game cost me so much stress, and so much more happiness and tears of joy. If you want a game that will keep coming up with new challenges, that won't get old, can stay in your library forever and always be there to entertain, you've come to the right place. 11/10"

Repentance delivers a lot in terms of quality of life changes, balancing, and content. It's unfinished in very minor ways that the devs are planning on patching in slowly over time. That being said it's a fantastic game with a metric F*** ton of content and replayability. Seriously if you have any doubt about buying this game the only thing I think you should ask yourself before buying is whether or not you enjoy roguelikes, if you do then it's a must."
19303,yes.
19304,its gud game nyan
19305,"Original, fun, dark story and love the random part of it! Items get better with every version too! Great, challenging game to play every once in a while."
19306,good
19307,its fine
19308,"this game is bound to my nostalgia, having played it like 7 or 8 years ago when a friend of mine downloaded it and copied it onto our school computers when it was wrath of lamb. I love this game because of the characters you can play as, the kinds of unique concepts of endlessly conjoined item combinations and the dungeon crawling that constantly keeps me excited for just how strong I can get. i've had some runs that were a little weak, and runs that were extremely powerful! overall, this game is just pure joy."
19309,play
19310,its epic
19311,its a good game just buy it idiot
19312,An amazing game !! No run is the same !! 100% would recommend !!

19332,this happened to my buddy eric
19333,"I bought this after Repentance came out and honestly I'm having a blast. I started playing after I got the rogue bug from Hades and the balance between skill and luck is very good. All the characters are pretty fun to play and the sheer amount of items and synergies and strategies is staggering. I recommend playing with the mod on the steam workshop that shows you the items description so you can understand what you're picking up and make better choices because some items you definitely don't want (I'm looking at you cursed charge shot). Game knowledge is everything in this game, so if you love looking at wikis and min/maxing you will probably love this game. My achievement addiction will keep me playing for hundreds more hours methinks."

This shit looses its fun when i have to hold R for an hour hoping to get a gold run so I can accomplish new stuff. Making this shit nearly impossible is just terrible. -10 review for a game i used to love"

19350,Good
19351,"this game's definitely worth buying, 100%.. although if you're like me you probably had to put in actual effort to try to get into this game because everybody else likes it.

best case scenario, you have a friend who knows everything and slowly eases you into the game. ""meh"" scenario is if you have a friend who tells you EVERYTHING from the get-go. worst case scenario, you have to go onto the wiki/platnium god to figure out what anything does.

i still sunk an unholy amount of hours into the game and intend to put in even more. get it"
19352,great game

19371,"10/10 would play again, absolute Time-Sinkhole and never regret it <3"
19372,"The Binding of Isaac has a long history of being a great game, deceptively simple, polished and FUN.
Repentance changed all this. The creator of Isaac, Ed, passed the baton to the creator of one of the most popular mods in the community to make Repentance. He certainly had the drive to make more of the game, but that's basically it.
Yes, the game with Repentance has more than doubled its content, but that's basically the only good thing that I can honestly say about this DLC.
The mentality of the new developers is that of hardcore gamers that only have fun when inserting needles under their fingernails and punching rocks. They nerfed or made much harder every way to break the game, and everything that was so good that you would be actually happy to get. Simultaneously, they increased the projectile speed of every single enemy, nerfed stores, made devil deals borderline useless, and replaced fun with frustration.
This gets increasingly and painfully obvious when getting to the ""new content"", which I won't spoil for you if you are the single person on the planet that still doesn't know about this game.

If you're new to The Binding of Isaac and are thinking that it looks fun, I agree with you, and I encourage you to get Rebirth and Afterbirth+. Complete all that, then if you're feeling spicy and it's on sale, get Repentance and hit me up so we gan get angry together."
19373,Yes
19374,"Quality game, Sad time."
19375,fun
19376,<3
19377,Great Dungeon Crawler! Very difficult but fun nonetheless!
19378,"the original isaac was already AMAZING and the binding of isaac rebirth, afterbirth, afterbirth + and repentance take the already working isaac formula and expand it! the only problem i have is with mod support with many repentance changes causing some mods to crash. however it's understandable how the devs would likely wanna change things to maybe be more efficient"
19379,rotta
19380,one of the best game i play
19381,"This is a very hard game but even though I have not beaten it. Yet it is I still one of my favorite Roguelikes out. There are a lot of characters to unlock many more than the game tells you can unlock if you have the DLCs. I highly recommend buying all of the DLCs because each one adds more and more content, store and item. Repentance is the last and final DLC this finished the game story. They are making a board game and that counties the lore.

19410,"This game has changed so much with every DLC release, this game has always been a banger, starting as a flash game and now having its own engine, this game has always been so great except for Afterbirth +, Afterbirth plus scuffed a lot of things and made the game easy but now Repentance has fixed a lot of shit, Repentance gave better multiplayer and added in Antibirth content, the game has made a great comeback with the new DLC"

19425,"honestly i have nearly 1k hrs, know the game like the back of my hand and still, i don't like it. Game is just overly RNG and that is the understatement of the year. You could either have a run with godly items or a run with basic DPS throughout the whole game. Majority of its community is toxic flexing or pushing yourself to the limits, past beyond having fun. Game is unfair and never was meant to be. 2/10"
19426,:)

19453,"Imagine the Bible, but ina video game, but it makes no sense, like the bible."
19454,POG
19455,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visiter,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
""'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            This it is and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you""—here I opened wide the door;—
            Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""—
            Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
            'Tis the wind and nothing more!""

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
            Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
            With such name as ""Nevermore.""

But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered ""Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.""
            Then the bird said ""Nevermore.""

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of 'Never—nevermore'.""

But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""
            Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!""
            Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""
            Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting—
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
            Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            Shall be lifted—nevermore!

—Edgar Allan Poe"
19456,I WILL BECOME BACK MY MONEY
19457,binding
19458,mother
19459,Fun
19460,"look at my playtime
"
19461,Game's a real game
19462,"Fun Rougelike with super cool item synergies and almost infinite replayability
Altho sometimes you can just get fucked by RNG, just makes lucky runs even more fun tho"
19463,"this game is very bad and not good at all, i highly recommend it"
19464,PPoG
19465,"The Binding of Isaac is the ripest Rouge like Game in my opinion.Players will accompany Isaac on a quest to escape his mother, facing off against droves of mysterious creatures, discovering secrets, and fighting fearsome bosses. Along the way, Isaac can find bizarre treasures that change his form and give him super-human abilities. But it won't be easy!
Rebirth is the remake of the original game that sports a game engine that runs at 60 FPS, pixelated style artwork, polished visual effects, and a new soundtrack from Ridiculon. Oh yeah, hundreds of new rooms, synergies, and retuned enhancements by the series creator, Edmund McMillen and developer/publisher company Nicalis, Inc. There are three DLCs available for Rebirth, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth † and The Binding of Isaac: Repentance. Did we mention the poop?
After the DLC Repentance presented, we finally learn about the Ending of this game.And it added more than 100+ items.The balance between the items is near by the equality(Maybe).The new characters added in the game were brought us more delight.(I guess:) The characters of this game all originated from the Bible.And the story of this game is irrelevant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Last but not least,[strike] Fuck [strike]

19469,haha isec go brrrrrrrrr
19470,One of the most addictive games.
19471,its okay
19472,"Тот, кто придумал Порченного Лазаря никогда не запускал эту игру.

UPD: он трогал игру, все нормально. Спасибо за последний патч к Repentance, теперь от игры можно получать еще больше удовольствия.

Хочу отметить, что это, можно сказать, мой первый рогалик. Почти ни в какую другую игру я не наиграл такого количества часов, что положительно говорит о Айзеке. Я категорически советую эту игру всем, кто хочет попробовать мир рогаликов и получить место, в котором можно потерять огромное количество часов, проведя его весело."
19473,good game very fun
19474,true
19475,"I've been playing this game for a long time, first on flash when I was bored at school, then on consoles where I played rebirth and AfterBirth, and now I'm here. I probably haven't played the game as long as some people have but this game is my favorite of all time and will probably always be its one of the best games I've spent money on and I will probably continue to pay it until I die"
19476,"well i mean... by now you should know what this game is about
i really love the additions repentance brought, gave the game a LOT of new content, i'd say it doubled the playable stages, more than doubled the nr of playable isaac variants"
19477,"yeah it's cool
"
19478,this real fun and bloody i like all the BLOOD
19479,fuck this game it's suffering
19480,i hate pills
19481,gud
19482,good
19483,it's fun
19484,good game
19485,great game. lots of content almost endless fun
19486,Grindy game with lots of items and unlocks! Rage inducing levels with endless outcomes!
19487,ooooo mamas. very good sexy game.
19488,"good game
"
19489,one of the best indie-game i ever  played i remember when it was new on new grounds a flash game plataform back in the day.
19490,"I definitely would recommend this game. All of the new rounds you begin is unique and the game never gets repetitive! Every time you unlock a new character, new opportunities arise and your journey becomes more open! Not only that, the symbolism and story within the game can bring you to tears as you slowly begin to realize what has happened to our main character. Thus, I leave a positive review on this masterpiece of a game."
19491,"isaac cry funny game

After multiple hours, I can say indeed that isaac cry funny game lol"
19492,very good game
19493,"Here's the 11th commitment: You shall be a naked boy who give showers to bunch other naked guys with tears and shall loving them with tears until death.(Cryingpoop 5:10) 
"
19494,this game sucks in the best way possible
19495,"it fun
sometimes"
19496,Yes
19497,"Approximately 620 hours played on the Switch version, approximately 520 hours played on PC when I write this review... yeah, I think I'd recommend it.

Edit: If, IF, you can handle crushing defeat after crushing defeat before you hit those sweet, sweet victories. I'm currently sitting at a -100 streak trying to complete a specific challenge, and it's gone as high as -150 or so for an even-harder goal. My highest win streak? Five, maybe six. Heh.

Edit 2: And the pooping and farting. There's this one card* you can play that literally fills the entire room with poop.

* - https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/A_Card_Against_Humanity"
19498,i like when he poops
19499,"it's fucking awesome, I can't stop. I want to sometimes but i can't"
19500,"Honestly, this game is proper LOG. This game and all its DLCs are worth it in my opinion and having them all makes the experience a good one. The mechanics, music, art, items, and many other cool features make this game a good one. The workshop is also a nice place to check out as some of those workshop things can really help and make your experience a good one. 9/10"
19501,"Game funni, cry child kill mommy"

Well Polished, deep, interesting. You can get addicted very quickly, even if you are not a regular roguelike player.

Do a favor to yourself and buy it NOW"
19508,good game is isaac binding of

19510,"good game

19511,"Fantastic Rogue-Like game, so much to do and collect, characters are fun and vary in difficulty (for the most part) and the gross and dark nature of the game gives it a great atmosphere."
19512,....

19514,"This game makes you suffer, but sometimes you get lucky and win."
19515,good much fun

19578,"At the time of this review I am about half way through the games content (DLC included) for the price you pay this is definitely worth your money if you like rogue likes that have bullet hell elements. Also the modding for this game can give you hundreds of hours of extra gameplay for free.

19582,good game and i love the community/mods
19583,"I've never played a game like this before, I love it!"
19584,"Binding of Isaac is just one of those games you probably already own, but if you don't you should just go ahead and buy it immediately with all the expansions.

It's one of if not THE most definitive 2D Roguelike ever made, a game everybody should have in their steam library.

Just pull up your big boy pants and start unlocking everything, you can thank me later after you understand this game will make you into a better gamer and human being."

19590,"Played the demo for the first time on a middle school laptop on some random Flash website (I'm 21 now) and it made me look into the actual game and Instantly i was drawn to the art style, the combat and 100s of items you could get. tboi has been one of those games for years that i know if I just want to hop on and get a quick game or 4 in I could, AND still unlock something I've never seen before or an enemy that I've never seen before and i don't know any other game to this day that has the replay-ability factor that tboi has on me. I have it on every platform because I know that its forever going to be a classic for me. This is my first review for any game and I only review if I thoroughly enjoyed the product. I've made my brother play before and my friends definitely know about the game just cause they used to see me on religiously after school as it was all I was thinking about before getting home. 10/10 game in my book but also I'm not one to look for bugs or issues with games but i do notice when they occur and this game is solid unless you have crazy mods on (mods/workshop makes it 11/10 for me) The base game wont or do a random game breaking bug or glitch. All in all good game and cant wait for anything tboi related in the future."

19640,"This game has got to be one of the best I've ever played. The story is so rich and so deep. The addition of repentance adds to the story and excels it even deeper. I love seeing the theories and the thoughts of others. The gameplay is great, the OST has to be one of the best if not THE best in the indie scene.

My god i fucking love this game. I remember playing the original as a young teenager, it's come so far and is SO worth playing. I could write trillions of walls of text about this game"

19645,Yeah i have about 1000 hours in this offline and on various systems. It's THE roguelike. There's not much else to say.
19646,always different. challenging in a fun way.

19649,"If you don't mind the excruciatingly disgusting blood and gore that comes with this game, then this is a very solid rogue-like. Good story, (although it might be offensive to some people,) good combat, and it's a very fun game with quite a lot of replayability."

19684,Its good
19685,"One of my favorite rougelikes! There are so many unique items and characters that each playthrough feels completely different. There are also over 600 items to unlock by completing various runs, which helps this game have insane replay-ability (if that's a real word). I totally recommend this for anyone looking to really get into a roguelike!!"
19686,i play this game bcz i hate christianity and i love babys .
19687,Very hard. Very fun once you learn how to not die on basment 1. P.S: ragman sux
19688,shooting monsters
19689,"What can be said about this game that hasn't been said already.  It is my favorite game ever (and I have played games since the NES days).  The game I put the most hours in, and beat but continue to play even now.  I love this game so dang much.  I started playing the flash game in 2012 or so, and it was great but had flaws with performance and stuff.  Rebirth and especially Repentance just blew me away.  I hope that Ed and Nicalis continue to either update or come out with a sequel or whatever.  The controls are on point, you can run it on a potato like me.  The replayability is the best.  It never gets old.  

-pros- replay value, awesome synergies, music on flash and repentance (and antibirth) are off the charts
-cons- fix the dang crawl spaces and T. Laz ugh.

19695,this game makes me hate myself 10/10
19696,"I've been playing this game since Wrath of the Lamb and honestly it's so god damn addictive! There's always something new to unlock and new item combos to figure out. In one of my runs yesterday I was shooting bombs out of my eyes at machine gun speed, decimating everything that was unlucky enough to spawn in each level, including myself. This game is so chaotic, I love it to bits!"

19752,"This is literally the most addicting game I have ever played and it is how I spent 90 percent of my time on my laptop. For 15 dollars base game it's pretty good, but you definitely want to shell out the 45 for the ultimate Isaac experience with the DLC. That may seem like a ton but soon you will find you have gotten more than your money's worth. The community is fantastic and there are tons of mods and videos and a subreddit to dedicate even more of your life to while you aren't playing the game. All in all, 10/10, a shit of piece."

After only 235 hours, I have all the items, trinkets, consumables, and their effects memorized. I would absolutely recommend this game for those of you who are fans of roguelike/roguelite games; Isaac was the modern catalyst for the genre."

19773,"I think I can recommend the game as a player who is about to finish 100% his second file
"
19774,"Of the roguelikes I've played, nothing has come close in terms of replayability and content dump alone than this one. While I prefer Gungeon's gameplay more and Bullets Per Minutes aesthetics more, Issac is the best starter roguelike and a pillar of the genre. Worth picking up, and it's usually on sale for dirt cheap

19824,"So, this is an interesting game to review, because it's very easy to recognize that this title is not for everyone, as not only is this game relatively difficult, it also has quite a few bugs and you NEED the DLC for this game (Fullgame+All DLC is only $31). I've been following The Binding of Isaac since I was a kid, and I played the original flash demo on Newgrounds back in the day, so this game holds a very personal place in my heart. Though it is fairly buggy at times, it is in my opinion one of if not the greatest indie game to ever be released, and it defined and has become a gold standard for the rogue-like genre. Ever since it's original release very nearly a decade ago it has been innovating and pumping out so much content that it's insane, and with the latest DLC Repentance, it has only continued surpassing itself. If you're a fan of Roguelikes, and don't mind some challenge, please play this game."
19825,i will not become back my money
19826,"i will become back my money
"
19827,its good
19828,yes
19829,"Highly recommended, this is an awesome game."
19830,"Poop is the best part of this game. If you dig your grimy little hands in it you can find money. It also is the best tasting item in the game. If you lather it around on your body you will blend in with the enemies and fight along side them killing the next victim of The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth. This is all hypothetical of course. Would recommend for the poop aspect of the game. I have only played it with a friend so I don't own the game but it was a perfect experience. Even the main character cries at the sight of poop. I think we can universally agree that it is the only reason people play this game. The thrill of walking into a room and seeing a pile of poop is unimaginable. It is a feeling that can't be recreated in any way. This is why I will be giving this game a 10/10, and I will be buying the full bundle as soon as I have the money. Good day to you all."

It is done quite well and the game never takes itself too seriously. It seems like a good game for both novices and experienced gamers alike, especially with all of the possible synergies and the weird ways items can work together. Im always finding new weird and wacky ways stuff interacts with each other!"

19906,"This game is absolutely amazing, although the video effects may be pixelated, the game itself is well developed  and has some serious lore behind it. its also great for people who want to spend time without doing much, this game is challenging and rewarding once you get through that challenge! I would 100% keep playing this if you are into deep lore and gameplay."

19934,it is good
19935,"They lock a lot of stuff to DLC, even MODDING is locked to Afterbirth+ which I think is kinda weird but I guess it's just a way to make people pay more money. I'd almost say you're better off pirating the game but obviously you shouldn't do that.  DLC are suppost to add small extras to a game. That's not the case for the binding of isaac rebirth. The DLC IS the game. Besides that it could probably be a fun game. It's really difficult to understand what different items do because theres no real description before you pick something up. I get how they might think it adds a learning curve but it just doesn't work with the items they have. For example theres extremely bad items that you will just pick up thinking they will upgrade you but instead it just makes the game a burden to play. Oh, you can get item descriptions, but you guessed it, you need a mod so prepare to whip out another 30 dollars. I like the idea, the art style and the story is unique, but if you buy it understand that the base game lacks A LOT and expect to pay around 50 dollars for the complete experience."
19936,It's alright.

19972,"Yes I have over 500+ hours in this game, I didn't have a single problem with the game. The characters are great, mechanics are great. The only issue I have is I decided to play a run today, and to my surprise all my repentance progress just disappeared. Despite unlocking all tainted variants, despite completing all regular character's post-its. It's gone. Until they get their shit together with the save files deleting themselves I won't be recommending this game."

19974,repentance is ebin
19975,"I played the original Binding of Isaac when I was in highschool and eventually kinda forgot that it existed.. Fast forward to the present and I started stumbling upon NorthernLion's youtube videos again since I was having a nostalgia trip (Shoutout NL dudes been making great content for a long time). 

Decided to scratch the itch and downloaded repentance. Only 22 hours in and it's living up to my fond memories and then some. I can tell theres an infinite amount of content to explore and discover in the game. There's so much soul and passion put into the game and it shows. It's challenging but if you put in the time you can definitely increase your skill and consistently make deep runs even when the RNG isn't on your side.
 
The best aspects of the game are how unique it is (there's seriously no game as weird and hilarious as Isaac) and the infinite amount of item combinations and interactions. On the surface Isaac is simple but it is truly endless in possibilities. Excited to continue grinding out Isaac runs and definitely recommend buying at least base rebirth!"
19976,just play it.
19977,"This is the truest definition of a game that I love to suck at
Edmund pls polish Repentance"
19978,"The binding of isaac is a fantastic game.  It was one of the biggest and most important building blocks for roguelite/like games to start existing in the form they have today. It is so unique, fun and addicting that even 7 years later I still consistently get the itch to play it over and over and over again.

And a big part of that is thanks to the consistent big DLC releases and content patches that have released over the years. Since this review is aimed at the original game il keep it at that. But just know that this series as a whole has gone through so many changes, its whole development and update history is something so interesting I would recommend looking into it just to see how crazy it has been.

Now why is this games development so interesting? Because there are a stupidly high amount of items, so much that you can easily get runs you have never seen before even 160 hours into the game like I have. Some of them interact with each other, some characters have unique features that also interact with all of these items. In the end you get a hot pot of fun, insane and really crazy items and ideas that create for unique and fun experiences.

Rebirth at its base is probably the most straight forward out of all of the binding of isaac experiences. The original binding of isaac has a LOT of bugs and unique quirks that you might not expect, that all has been streamlined a lot more here. But even here there is still a lot of fun and interesting stuff to find and do. The game even has a bunch of challenges which are very interesting in their own right and can be incredibly frustrating but also create for new situations which are incredibly satisfying to finish.

Talking about frustration. This game can be brutal and really hard. Rebirth is probably the easiest it gets and even then the game can really screw you over or you can make some bad mistakes that can completely change the run. Information, experience and skill are key and even when you die you can carry that experience over and do better. At the start of the game it took me ages just to beat the game, but now im able to consistently finish runs. This game isn't all RNG, there is a considerable amount of skill that goes into this.

The last thing I want to talk about is the story and setting. Its full of taboo's and honestly really refreshing to see because of that. The enemy designs are incredibly 'Isaac' and easy to recognize. Same goes for how items and the game itself works, it really has its own style and its charming. However its also incredibly disturbing especially when you start out, I got used to it relatively fast but there are still moments, especially in the DLC, that really make me feel uncomfortable because of the setting. There might be some people who can't handle it and thats ok. Just look up some basic gameplay/bosses/early story to get an idea for what this game is like. I believe a lot of people can get used to it and I really believe this game is worth going through the initial shock phase to see the beauty that lies behind it.

My final verdict goes to pretty much all of the binding of isaac series/dlc. Just buy it. Its a must have for almost anybody, its criminally cheap for the amount of content, and you will have a game you can carry with you for a really long time. Its that good."
19979,preety fun
19980,Yes.
19981,funny game about depression :D
19982,"The Binding of Isaac as a whole is definitely a rewarding game to play, preferably over a long period of time. Pretty much no two runs are the same, and there is a lot of fun to be had.

There remain certain unfair aspects to the game, however. Most of the rooms do not work very well with the new character(s) Jacob and Esau, even ones added in Repentance. This can be very frustrating to complete their post-it note, not to mention the finicky controls. Some of the Repentance floors, particularly the later ones, are difficult to avoid damage in unless the player has a rather high damage/tears loadout. In addition to this, some of the items such as Birthright and Esau Jr. are blatantly unfinished. This extends to the new Tainted characters as well; Tainted Lazarus and Jacob clearly needed more work done on them before their release. The Tainted unlocks being a bunch of trinkets does not help either. Delirium/The Void and Greedier Mode/Ultra Greedier still have necessary reworking to do, something which should have been done a long time ago. Many of the item nerfs added (holy mantle, brimstone, maw of the void, serpent's kiss, etc.) seem ridiculous as many of the new items are even more broken. The balance between Devil and Angel rooms has greatly shifted to the latter in a significantly unbalanced way.

Otherwise, Rebirth is a phenomenal experience that I would recommend for anyone. In addition to my hours on Steam, I have countless of them on PS4, and I fully completed the game in every major iteration it has received, save Repentance (which isn't out yet on the console which is why I started playing PC for the game). It is so easy to lose track of time and sink countless hours into. Yes, there are many moments where I want to smash my computer screen due to the BS this game still has, but I love it either way."
19983,"This game is absolutely huge at this point, so if you're a completionist/perfectionist like me and DON'T have a few months to spend draining your life force into this game, maybe don't buy it. Otherwise, for sure! Runs well on lower end PCs too!"

Eventually you are only half a POS at this game and you actually beat it once. Other games have new game plus but this is on a whole other level. Not only does the game get harder every time you beat it, it changes completely.

I mean it's alright.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On a more serious note, if you are looking for a challenging Roguelike, look no further. The amount of items in this game will have you playing for hours on end trying to unlock it all. The few negative things I would say about this game is that RNG is a bastard, and it can feel pretty repetitive after some time."

20053,i have to many hours on this game
20054,"I haven't actually unlocked a ton of stuff yet (24%), but I cannot recommend this game enough to fans of the roguelike genre. I mainly compare it to Gungeon because its the only other game similar to Isaac that I can think of. I would say this is easier, but more punishing than Gungeon. On one hand, the enemies aren't as tough and at a certain point you can one shot some bosses, but you can screw yourself over if you take the wrong item or make the wrong choice. In Gungeon, the enemies are pretty tough and bosses can take a lot of damage, but pretty much every item and gun are a good choice, so its a lot more forgiving. 

I personally recommend to get the Afterbirth DLC with the main game and then wait to see if you like the game. The Afterbirth+ DLC is good to get if you enjoy it. Definitely wait until you get pretty good at the game before getting Repentance. Overall I think all of the DLC are worth it, you just need to know when to get them. I think if I started with all of the DLC, I wouldn't like it as much as I do."

20085,Base game Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ are great however when time came to buy the newest DLC turns out repentance is completely broken crashing at a 1/15 chance when entering any given room reseting to the beginning of the floor. I love this game to death but nothing excuses a broken DLC

20109,"this game is absolutely astounding. the reason i say this with such little play time is because i originally played afterbirth+ on the switch, and it quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. repentance is even cooler though in my opinion. this game has literally endless possibilities in it. everything you do is based on rng, you never get the same result as last time, which is my favorite part of it all. the soundtrack is insane, the gameplay is smooth and satisfying, and the mechanics are awesome. this game is an instant 10/10 and i very highly recommend you buy it. you wont regret it!"
20110,"This game is amazing, at first I kinda didn’t like the game since there was things you baiscly had to remember about the game but it’s more fun if you remember the items, bosses, enimies, everything, the game looks good aswell, the story aswell is just damn hella good, 11/10 game and uhhh a chocolate cake"
20111,this game has taken away my sanity but is good

Endlessly replayable.  Tons of good mods.  Great style.

Only negative:  Balance issues and some characters are not fun.  Most of the characters are great but there are a couple bad eggs.  

10/10"
20144,Give back me money Edmund for this great game
20145,Great game
20146,"I accidentally put a mod in the game folder from modding of isaac, and even after uninstalling the game, deleting the mod, and verifying the game files multiple times, it doesn't work."
20147,Love this game. Despite other reviews saying that its garbage or trash because of repentence being difficult. They are right in the fact that it can be very difficult. But one of my personal favorite things about this game is seeing yourself progress from barely being able to beat mom all the way to beating delerium and beyond. It truly is an amazing experience that I suggest everyone to try
20148,very gud.

20158,"If you want a game that is going to take up years and years of your life, just for 10% completion, this is the one for you. I honestly believe I will play this game until I die, and i do not think i will ever come close to completing it.

Recently bought the repentance DLC, and man, I gotta say that it made the game a good bit harder. You definitely notice the changes to things like projectile speed, as well as some of the AI being a bit better at anticipating your movements. To put it in perspective, me, who's been playing since the original, died to Pin, on one of my first runs with the new DLC.

If you are already having trouble with the game, you may want to think twice before getting the Repentance DLC."
20159,Fun and Cool.
20160,relatable story
20161,"Almost 300 hours in and I haven't seen anything yet. That's a testiment to how amazeballs this game is. With so much content and mod support. I don't think this game is gonna lose steam (pardon the pun) anytime soon!

Also you cry on your mother, enter her womb, and cry on her heart. Also there's a deal with the devil there somewhere along with memes..."
20162,"Even before modding, this game is seemingly infinitely replayable."
20163,"I first started playing this game because a friend forced me to, but it has steadily become one of the only games I play. It's the only game that I have almost felt addicted to play and fully finish. Normally I played a lot of fps but this game is something else. It causes unfathomable rage and unbelievable happiness at the same time. I would highly suggest this game for any type of gamer!"

"
20209,awesome game
20210,"I've played this game for 100+ hours, everything hurts, i love it.
Ok, to give a more in depth thing, the replayablility of this game is insane, every character you unlock, every ITEM you get, it all helps you to go further down the unlock rabbit hole, with even new bosses, and new areas. The gameplay is also a highlight, easily being a possible gateway into slowly more and more complicated bullet hells, Although, while it may have it's upsides, you CAN have those really bad runs that just have you fail, but overall, the item system means you usually never will have two runs that are the same. Very clever bosses, soundtrack, all unite to make a great game.
And I haven't even touched on all the mods it has too! From visual ones, to changing the overall game mechanics itself, you're almost never going to be disappointed.
A couple more downsides for me, however, would be the fact that the current multiplayer isn't that great, and some of the bosses can be downright UNFAIR, but, the plus is that these can eventually be fixed, either by an update, or by mods.
In conclusion, while it can have some flaws, this is a great rougelike experience that you should try."
20211,its not good. its amazing play it. NOW

20253,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.

20261,"It's alright. Certainly not the best Roguelike, but it can be fun enough"
20262,yes
20263,good game
20264,"A good game that will keep you entertained for a long while! However, for me at least the entertainment of it burned out faster than it does for most similar rogue-like dungeon crawlers like Enter the Gungeon. Perhaps it has to do with the slower nature of this game in comparison to other titles? Even so, still worth the money and a soild experience!"
20265,"Awesome game, doesn't work"
20266,yea its pretty uhhh yea i mean yeah.
20267,"All expansions are well worth it. The excitement of unlocking stuff has continued for 171 hours thus far
"
20268,"A challenging and unforgiving game. Once you learn what most items do (or have a cheat sheet open) it can be a fun game if you're down to test your limits. The amount of times I've rage quit and started the game back up is countless. Aside from the difficulty this game can bear it doesn't seem to get old as it's a well made rougelike therefore almost every run is different. 

If you're into biblical type lore I'd give it a try."
20269,"This is the only game I've ever gotten to 100% completion, and still wanted to play after accomplishing that"
20270,gud gaem
20271,Great game!
20272,"Incredible
"
20273,Great but gave me nightmares
20274,"A game you could quite easily sink hours and hours into. Incredible art style, engaging gameplay and extremely varying gameplay pacing make this game a must have for any steam user. The modding community tops it off by leaving you with loads and loads of extra content, from quality-of-life fixes to complete gameplay overhauls.

One of my favourite games to play local co-op on with some buds, i hugely reccomend <3"

20310,"played a little, its pretty good i guess"
20311,i fucking hate this game. its so awesome.
20312,"Been playing this game for years, always coming back with each new DLC and there is always new content and story to follow. Great fun, really challenging but satisfying when you have that perfect build that gets you to the end. Even with all the time I put into this game, there is still so much to do and so much yet to discover. Starting off you might get a little frustrated dying a lot, but you play on, unlock new items and get better as a lot of items have great synergies together.

The best part is that its a simple little game that you could play in short bursts or long periods. It has also a good game to play after a long day."

20368,Very fun game to just play while watching netflix or youtube.
20369,"One of my personal favorite games in my Steam library, I've finally taken the time to review it after over 500 hours of gameplay.

Positives: Plenty of Characters to choose from, each of them supporting a different starting playstyle. 
Favorite Characters: Isaac, Judas, Tainted Judas, Eve

On most runs, you can expect it to feel different with each random generation of a floor.  Various Enemy types, Items, and Bosses to encounter along the way.

The various gaming references and religious lore are a fun integration too.

Generous amount of unlocks makes sure the gameplay almost never feels stale.

Bullet Hell style gameplay makes sure you're always on your toes and makes for satisfying charges
Negatives: As with most Roguelike/RNG heavy games, bad runs and ruthless enemy generation can screw over your gameplay

Trying to get 100% completion with all of the DLC enabled requires a lot of your time.

Overall: One of the best Roguelike dungeon crawler bullet hell games going, I would happily recommend this as a gift or purchase to anyone interested in Bullet Hells and Roguelikes"
20370,Really fun game nice and to the point and a very fun difficulty curve definitely recommend to anyone interested :0

20381,"So much depth, so much to find, so much to unlock, so much to explore, love the game can be so varied after playing for so long and much to see also. If you remotely like ""rouge likes"" or whatever category it comes under, get this game."
20382,Yes.

good game"
20387,isaac more like iLOVEBALLS
20388,this game is very hard but fun
20389,"This game is great. The Binding Of Isaac is such a insane and hardcore fps/farming sim out there. The game has intense gore and game mechanics from fps games like TF2, BO4, apex legends, and Fortnite. It is also a insane farming sim were you can plant crops and build relationships with people (my favorite is with laz and the keeper). My only issue with the farming part is with how it feels like a slime ranchers rip off at some points. Also I personalty  find it hard to do the platforming in this game it reminds me of super meat boy. The music in this game is unreal. It is so calming and peaceful to listen to (sometimes I use my speakers and leave my P.C running over night just so i can fall asleep to it). I could go one for days talking about this game but i have to say that anyone that sees this post that they should get the game and have fun!
Ps: the NSFW dlcs are 100% worth the money!"
20390,"nice
"
20391,"I loved the original Binding of Isaac game and this new one is that game on steroids. It has way more items, Huge boss rooms, and the enemies are much more difficult giving extra depth and difficulty to the game. All in all I recommend for people who just want to kill some time and collect some achievements."

20403,"Very replayable, and a genuinely great and enjoyable game.
Repentance adds so much more to the table, and refines TBoI, making it imo one of the best video game expansions out there. So repentance is definitely worth the money, alongside the great game TBoI: Rebirth already was.

But sometimes this game makes me wanna become back my money, but hey, great roguelike."
20404,Super replayable. Best value of any game out there.
20405,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

Isaac was simple and they were both Isaac. That was until the Isaac heard a Isaac from Isaac. Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac. I will do my best Isaac in my Isaac, Isaac's Isaac replied. Rushing into Isaac's Isaac removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again Isaac called to Isaac. Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac, he needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac. I will follow your Isaac I have Isaac indeed, Isaac's Isaac replied. As she locked Isaac in his Isaac away from the Isaac of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. You've done as i have asked, but i still question your Isaac to Isaac to prove your Isaac I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac. Yes Isaac, anything, Isaac's Isaac begged. To prove your Isaac then Isaac, I require Isaac your Isaac will be Isaac, go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac. ""Yes Isaac"", she replied. Grabbing Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac watching through a Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around as Isaac to find Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac hidden under his Isaac, without Isaac he flung open Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac and through himself down into the unknown Isaac below."

20413,good
20414,more to the game then you think
20415,hello guys today we are going to be eating our own mother. watch the whole epic gamer montage pro gaming to see the mcdonalds cheeseburger giveaway.
20416,"this game is amazing
"
20417,Endless replayability with a completionist mindset
20418,you little fucker
20419,"This game is fire, Ive been playing since 2017 when it came out on switch and havent stopped since. This game cannot be put down dude."
20420,"The Binding of Isaac is a government experiment devised to send even the most sane man into an asylum. It also manages to drop more hair from your head onto the floor than a barber giving you a bald cut. Now, the Bounding of Issac, much like any other game, is a pleasant experience throughout the first 10 hours, but unlike other games any and all enjoyment comes from the fact, that RNJesus blessed you. Luck is the most important factor and is also the true religious part about this game. If you thought this game's theme was christianity, then you are WRONG. The real theme is how hard The Bouncing of I-Saac can fist your ass. And much like fisting being a tag on some certain websites, The Bonk of Sack got you covered with golden shower, gore, feces and literal BDSM, not only ingame, but also applying CBT to the player at any given moment. 
Now The Bondage of Aa has amazing pixelart visuals and an equally amazing soundtrack and SFXs that include, but are not limited to, multiple children crying, over a dozen sounds for farting and shitting, the sounds the player makes throwing his keyboard across the room and, ofcourse, the dismantling of reality. 
The enemies in The Bababooey of Child Torment are phenominal. For people who have arachnophobia this game gives you a faster cardiac arrest than eating 5 chocolate mountains, and for any other person it gives you arachnophobia for thinking you were save from a spider that sits across the room ..... you weren't. And there are 30 more spider enemies, this was just one. But other than your typical australian huntsman spiders, there are also enemies like maggots, worms, big worms, flies, fat guys, worms that function as artillery, red guys on 2kg adderall, guys on a rope, literal BDSM leathermask guys with whips, worms that disregard the restraining order, a man who explodes when he shits, fetuses, vagina-men, war criminal worms, Satan, D̶̡̻̝͌̐̅͆͠ȅ̴̯͈̽̅̿̏̊ʅ̷̛̱̪͉̟̟̳̈̌̈̇̏͒̚͝ι̷̡͓͕̳͓̟̰̽̃̃̍ɾ̸̥͓̥͚̦̺̓̿̏̈͠ι̶̲̬̻͖̞̖͚̎̆͂͒̑̂͜͝͠υ̸̟̮̰͕͎̰͌͐̃̊̔̕ɱ̶̩̹͎͈͍̰́̊̅̔͝͝  and not to forget the Big Skull Skeleton. And just like the skeleton you got to work out at the library to          truly grasp each and every item and item combination, where 60% are complete trash.
Lastly The Bigotry of Insomnia is a good game as it is, but with the latest DLC Repentance it got better than ever and makes playing the other ones before it irrelevant. And if you have a friend who shares the same one braincell with you, Repentance offers real co-op to rage and suffer together while waiting for purgatory to be over. Also Fuck These Guys."
20421,Is good game but makes me cry sometimes.
20422,"Great, infinitly replayable, has mods, a lot of stuff to be found."

20430,Provides endless hours of replayability entertainment without disappointment.
20431,This game is awesome. The graphics and the way things move are really insane.
20432,Isaac is an excellent game with lots of uncertainty. Ive played for 400 hours while I still interesting in all kinds of different combo in the game.
20433,I have a few hours in this game its not bad
20434,bad isaac game ( joke ) it's actually good

20443,"Hard, Lots of Content, Skill is rewarded!"
20444,the best
20445,"What I like is its massive replayability. All playthroughs are unique. What I hate about it is that the random range of enemies and room setups that can be brutally unfair in relation to the stats you currently hold at the time. YOU WILL DIE!!!! ALOT. LOL. But its fun when you evidently overcome certain boss enemies in the game with outrageous synergies youll find in the game with each character and their respective attributes. Not really for everyone if you are short on patience. All in all, despite its random bullet hell difficulty at times, its still a great game."
20446,"just a solid way to kill time

20447,It's ok

20449,Very fun but 50$? 50$ is too much my girlfriend broke up with me and took my dog and then i ran over 8 kids on 1/14/2017

20454,fub game
20455,buy this game
20456,"The quintessential indie that kick-started the roguelite craze of the last decade, Isaac is definitely worth playing if you haven't already. 

As a side note, try Rebirth vanilla before any of the expansions. The experience is cleaner and teaches you more about the loop of the game and its... inner workings. They work and feel better, more different, more innovative and more challenging the more you've already been into Isaac. But that's just my opinion, feel free to disregard and just buy everything at once. Could work for you.



[spoiler]Better played on a handheld[/spoiler]"
20457,Would Recommend.
20458,"As weird as being a baby and killing monsters by crying on them is, this game is addictive, just don't die death is soul crushing..."

20461,"Probably the best game I've ever played, I've been watching/playing this game for years. Much like good food or a friend whenever I'm sad or loney Isaac is here. This game will provide you with hours, days, months, years of entertainment.

20488,yes
20489,"What's the point of having hundreds of items and rooms if you see the same 5 every single run?
This game was free to begin with, but now it's just a cash grab, which sucks because it's still a ton of fun, but the new content has felt bland, uninspired, and often times not fun at all (The same 2 portal rooms repeated every run, often several times in a single run). The DLC that is being released should be free, especially Afterbirth+. Only buy this game if it's dirt cheap, the creator has been riding off of this game's success for more than a decade, it's time for him to make something that isn't an Isaac cash grab."

20499,"""Against all the evil that hell can conjure, all the wickedness that mankind can produce, we will send unto them only you. Rip and tear, until it is done"" - King Novik

This game is something else. If you like rouge like dungeon crawlers, then pick this up. but be ready, this game doesn't hold its punches. 

But neither will you. turn those basement dwelling demons into red paste. Strike fear into the weak and send those who wouldn't face you running back to hell. Become death, the destroyer of worlds.

20508,"Данную игру нельзя с лету оценить однозначно - плохая, хорошая или даже средняя. Она разная - в одни моменты дико скучная и однообразная, в другие очень атмосферная, захватывающая и динамичная. Будет ли вам интересно проводить за ней время - во многом зависит от того как вы будете играть.
Если решите сразу пробежать сюжет - скорей всего разочаруетесь в том насколько он короткий и предсказуемый, а если сначала решите зачистить всю карту (захватить все базы и лагеря, обшарить все места поживы и т.д.), то рискуете заскучать и уже не останется никаких сил на сюжетку. Лучше все это совмещать и чередовать - подчистили карту, повысили свое влияние, затем прошли парочку сюжетных заданий, снова поизучали игровой мир, далее опять углубились в сюжет. Я делал именно так и игра, не смотря на все свои очевидные недостатки, все-таки доставляла.

Плюсы:
- Атмосфера так и прет, порой возникает желание пешком гулять по пустоши и любоваться ее мрачной красотой.
- По сути сами пустоши не такие уж и пустые, любопытных мест полно и есть чем заняться. Жаль, что это в основном рутина, но об этом позже.
- Оптимизация, при весьма современном грфоне, отличная. Печальный опыт Arkham Knight заставил издателя Warner Bros. вылизать игру до блеска (ну почти).
- Макс суров, загадочен, молчалив, вонюч и бородат. В общем - харизматичен и брутален, не смотря на то, что порой истерит как сучечка.
- Боевая система из Бэтмана и Тени Мордора по-прежнему радует. Максимка после прокачки начинает жестить - ломает шеи, руки и прочие части тела оппонентов, кидает с прогиба, вертит всех на болту, матерится, пьет ягуар и качает игры с торрентов! В общем занимается настоящим беспределом.
- Наконец-то игра в открытом мире, где физика автомобилей сделана почти так же хорошо как в GTA. Машиной удобно и приятно управлять. Ее полезно апгрейдить, она помогает в сложных ситуациях и вообще является чуть ли не главным после Макса персонажем всего сюжета.
- Есть довольно интересные побочные задания.
- Можно пачками жрать собачий корм, сырых крыс, ящериц и глистов, и при этом оставаться здоровым и сильным мужичком, который умеет бить щи похлеще чем Брюс Ли! Я хочу так же.

Минусы:
- Скомканный, скучноватый и непродолжительный сюжет. Хотя хорошо прописанные персонажи, кинематографичные ролики и еще парочка моментов, вытягивают его на уровень ""с пивком потянет, можно пройти"".
- Все, что не касается сюжета и доп. миссий - это нереальная пичаль и однообразие, состоящее из зачистки территорий и захвата лагерей противника. Причем происходит это по одному и тому же сценарию: отбиваемся от множества врагов, попутно уничтожая метки Члема (Члем - это такой очень влиятельный в Пустошах злодей и главный враг Макса), взрывая цистерны с горючим или разрушая нефтяные насосы. Очень редко нужно добраться до главаря базы и надрать ему анус. Кстати, тот факт, что в лагерь можно пробраться через какой-нибудь секретный проход в стене - вообще ничего не меняет!
Сначала, надо признать, это довольно интересно и затягивает, лично меня такие занятия завлекли на 25-30 часов, но другие могут не выдержаить и 5-10.
Из остального - совсем необязательная рутина: убийство снайперов, засевших на вышках (сначала с ними сложно, но после прокачки снайперской винтовки - вообще никаких проблем), перехват конвоя (иногда бывает весело), сбор хабара в определенных точках, указанных на карте (на карте тут вообще указано все что можно и это почти убивает дух исследования мира) и разрушение каких-то монументов, торчящих из земли (они тут называются ""пугалами""). Вроде все. Повторюсь - какое-то время это интересно, но потом приходит понимание, что ты постоянно выполняешь одни и те же действия и мозг вообще отключается. Мотивация у всего этого одна - получить опыт и прокачать Макса и его тачку. Прям какая-то РПГ (да вот только не очень хорошая).
- Металлолом, много металлолома, горы металлолома! овер 10000 тонн епучиго металлолома! 90% времени нужно собирать этот гр♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ металлолом, он снится мне пятые сутки, мне кажется я только о нем и думаю. Я был уверен, что металлолом будет финальным босом. Разрабы, продавайте игру не за деньги, а за металлолом!

Вывод: игра на 50% процентов состоит из гонок, взрывов, мордобоя, металлолома (!!!) и сурового взгляда Ошалевшего Макса, но остальные 50% - это скука. Однако, общее качество исполнения, дизайн игрового мира, стилистика постапокалипсиса и крутой, но неоднозачный главный герой - вытягивают.

9,5 килограмм металлолома из 10."
20509,"Just like classic Isaac but with more tears! YAY! In a good way! Except that Isaac is the sad one. This game is an instant classic, I've burnt up laptops playing this game for so long in a single sitting. Its fun, its got good references, its got support and DLC and Brimstone, the good kind, I think. Ed does a fantastic job with the game and it's awesome to see it last so long and in my opinion this is the STAPLE rogue like game. People always talk about going Ham, this game doesn't do that, it's the food that gets you through any weather, the good times, the bad times, the ups and downs, and just like the potatoes I'm talking about this game has just as much variety. You can fry it, bake, load it, fire it out of a freaking spud gun, have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, you would put Bubba from Forrest Gump TO SHAME with all the things you can do with it and it will still surprise you! Too difficult? Play on the easier mode, too easy? Play on the more difficult mode, play with all the characters, unlock all the things, do better! Do the daily, beat my score, laugh at all the weird poop referernces and bathroom humor. Try to figure out the story, I still don't know it and i've been playing for like 400 hours WEEEEEEE!! if the classic is almost perfect with a 98/100 this game ever so slightly one ups it, 99/100, only cause  I haven't got all the DLC yet to call it 100/100 tell your friends, your mom, your dog, the neighbors tree, that this is THEE rouge-like."

20541,"276 hours and still can't beat the ultrahard challenge - 1/10 for me, 10/10 for game devs."
20542,Have a total of 18d 20h on my old Xbox save. Needless to say this game has some ridiculous replay value well worth buying all DLC twice.
20543,"Just discovered a 2nd floor, hope mom is okay."
20544,game is tight
20545,"So, repentance.. Turned Rebirth from a baby game into a difficult indie masterpiece. The game has way too much content for you to get bored easily, all the achievements and unlocks, secrets, different characters, bosses, mechanisms, unique style, great community etc. Definitely worth the 40 bucks or whatever can't remember at the moment.




Just as a friendly sidenote.. i had all of this until i modded and played with the debug console a bit too much and now my game crashes everytime if i don't watch or skip the cutscene in a very specific way. So yeah, stay away from mass-modding and game crashes with console :)"

20567,yes
20568,"Wow
i vividly remember purchasing this game and i got 100 hours in just two weeks.  Please consider that i very rarely play games and this game began haunting me. 

It is no exaggeration when i say that i quite literally had dreams about playing this game.  Every time i closed my eyes, all i could see was myself  playing this game.  It became an actual issue and it was astounding,  This game is fantastic, addictive and is infinitely replayable.  

I dont often write reviews but god i just had to for this."
20569,I dont have this game so go ahead and buy it
20570,good
20571,It's a good game.
20572,"I have been holding this title for a certain game. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is my favorite game on Steam. This roguelike is very addictive to play. The sheer amount of achievements creates a seemingly Sisyphian task that rewards every milestone you achieve. I spent all summer of 2019 playing this game to get all I can out of it. I decree that before I die I will get a completion on this game no matter what. 

There is only one negative, when you finish this game you will weep because there is nothing else to achieve. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is for those who don't give up. You will die many, many times, but suffering is a part of the game. You will struggle, and you will enjoy struggling."
20573,ehh its ok i guess
20574,I wish I never bought it
20575,"Eh. ""Infinite"" replayability can only bring me back sooo many times..... Yup, still here. 159 Achievements out of 637. Maybe I'll beat the game before my deathbed."
20576,"wicked gameplay, 10/10 would recommend to local dying grandmothers <3"
20577,"In my honest opinion, this is the best indie game. Period.

There would be so much to say about it, I can't even begin to structure my thoughts.

Thank you Edmund ♥"

20591,this game is very nice
20592,"This is such an incredibly in depth game. The synergies in the Repentance update have drastically improved what was already a phenomenal rouge-like! I wouldn't want to share too much information, since there is lots of lore to discover and secrets to unlock, but if you are someone who is interested in a challenging and creative rouge-like, this is the game for you!"
20593,"my son hasnt gotten out of the floorboards for 3 weeks
help"
20594,epic story about child abuse and religious extremism
20595,"It's a roguelike RPG where instead of levelling up you get items, many of which are based off of diseases or christianity. The story is that God told mom to kill you (Isaac (sometimes)) for being a soyboy beta cuck and always bursting into tears over the fact that your life is shit. You go inside the basement and have to fight enemies by crying on them.
You eventually unlock 16 other characters including the lost and go ""holy shit the lost is the most difficult character in the game"" and that's because you haven't found the tainted characters, which are like the regular characters but on crack cocaine, their gameplay changes are a bit more substantial than ""oh I'm Isaac but blue and I have shit"".
Difficulty wise, it's like the game's bending you over a table while blasting your ass, but the bedroom's dynamics are ever changing, and all it takes is a bit of risk management, skill and luck to be the one blasting the game's ass. It's 100% possible to break the game completely, breakfast and even crash it if you've really gone buck wild but in the mean time, you'd better get used to holding the R key.
I rate it two red hearts, a soul heart, a black heart, three keys and a card out of 10. If you're planning on getting completion marks for [spoiler]tainted jacob and tainted lost[/spoiler], I suggest you memorise this."
20596,"its really fun if you like games that you can unlock stuff. And it kinda is a shooter game

20627,"I have never really been interested in roguelites but this game is just something different. I enjoy playing this game a lot because of the huge replay-ability and the style. I played this game a lot when I first bought it and dropped it for a while until Repentance, which sucked me back into the game. The story was also an unexpected enjoyment in this game. However I will say that if you stress over achievements a lot, this is not the game for you as there are SO MANY TO UNLOCK. To wrap it all up, this is a great game and I will continue to play the hell out of it. 10/10 would recommend."

20634,"after replaying, this game is just really boring. could be fun for the first few hours, but there isn't enough variety between runs for the game to be enjoyable for a while. for example, while there are hundreds of items, most of them are virtually the same, being either generic stat-up items or items that have some other mediocre effect on your character. 

the enemies don't help either: most of them are just slightly altered reskins of eachother, and the bosses are mostly uninteresting slogs. most of them are just 2 minutes of dodging easy attacks. 

the first 3 floors are also essentially the same thing.

overall, not an actively terrible game, just extremely mediocre"
20635,"The Binding of Isaac is awesome I wish Christians were real

Alright jokes aside, I can't recommend this game enough! It's AWESOME! Give it a go!"

Would buy twice."
20639,yea

The difficulty really spikes from rebirth to repentance, but ll the achievements, items, challenges, and of course, characters leave you with so much gameplay on your hands you don't know what to do first! I would definitely recommend this game, and will forever go down, in my opinion, as one of the best rogue lites ever made!"

its a game you can play over and over and over and each time will be a unique experience due to the large variety of unlockable content, enemies, bosses, items, player characters...
sad i didnt play this sooner but im glad i played it at all, its fucking awesome"
20654,great game
20655,It's alright I guess
20656,"Probaly the best rouge indie game i have ever played
"
20657,"very well made and simple game, very intense and action based.
"
20658,"The game is pretty hard if you don't know what your doing and or have bad luck, but its fun and a great time killer, also great for achievement hunters as there is a lot to do."
20659,"First of all let me tell you i started seriously playing this game with the Afterbirth+ expansion. I reached platinum god, meaning i completed (nearly) all achievements. Since repentence i started a new save and am now passing the progress i made the first time i played this game.

I gotta say this is one of my favourite games of all time. At first glance it seems like a rogue-like action rpg. But BOS is more than that. It is a very strategic and tactical game that will reward the player for amassing knowledge about its mechanics. Achieving synergy with the various options you come across is very rewarding to say the least. But BOS is still more than that even. This game is evil. It wil fuck you up. You will hate it, learn to control your hate towards it and even learn to appreciate how this game makes you hate it. It's mechanics are designed to mess with you. Not just in a sense of trying to challenge you or make you lose but also in a psychological sense. Patience is key. I am now well on my way to completing all of the characters completion marks and i am most impressed with what Repentence has offered. I would say the experience has gotten that much harder but also more diverse an intriguing (to me atleast).

My only problem would be the somewhat incomplete state of the game right now, with some items being not fully implemented and certain serious bugs preventing immersion, but i figure these will be adressed soon.

9/10 please play this game until you die inside, i promise it will be worth it"
20660,That's me
20661,I have played his game for over 800 hours by now and im in love with it. There are so many different items you can unlock that ultimately can lead to amazing combinations. Even if the game is annoying sometimes you will still have a lot of fun playing it to completion.

I love dungeon crawlers and get into hyper-fixations with other ones, but I always seem to come back to Isaac and have done so for about 6 years now. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of roguelike dungeon crawlers. (I haven't even gotten into the huge modding community and tons of extra content from that as well, but I'm excited to do so once I finish up this save file :) )"
20668,10/10
20669,GOOD GAME
20670,Its pretty good
20671,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

It just crashed for no reason. Do I want to do that entire floor again? Nope. But I have to. This happens more often than it should so I finally decided to write a review. 

Of course though, isaac is a great game. I've been playing it since the original.. But I do feel like it needs some adjustments and bug fixes. Repentence is just a well known oof. But I'm sure it will get a big patch some day."

However I do think with more new levels and new items, this game actually offers more ways for us to play it. This game truly deserves all the good reviews and imo it's one of the most successful rouge-like games in terms of game play and positive game feedback. [strike] PLEASE DON'T NERF AZAZEL [/strike]"

If you manage to maneuver yourself through the place you can make any run into a winning run

The RNG in the game makes every single one of the runs you do a unique experience, non of your runs will be the same or have the same outcome, even if you make a new run through the seed of someone else, your decision making and luck by finding things, can possibly make the end of the run not look anything alike

The Binding of Isaac is endless, and there will be always room for improvement"

20722,"No matter how long you play this game, it will always have something new for you. new items, places, enemies, and that's just the surface level. the game is forgiving and punishing at the same time. difficulty increases at a fair pace and allows you to challenge yourself as it gets more and more difficult. It can get pretty hectic and fast paces once you get deep enough. SOOOO much to do and explore in it's randomly generated levels. I would recommend for anyone needing a game to just waste time on or spend long hours playing. Insanely fun and satisfying"

Very very few games have been able to keep my attention for this many years, and having been here from the Demo on NG, taking turns with my little brother on death on our grandpa's shitty desktop, all the way to now to Now and playing it on my own PC. I can't help but just truly say how many times this game's helped me though stressful times, through anger fueled rants, and through the lowest points of boredom. Thank you Nicalis, Thank you Antibirth Team, And thank you McMillen. You've ruined my life in the most wonderful way you spectacular sonovabitch."

20764,"This is the best game for theme (you kill your inner demons with your friggin' tears!) , control simplicity, and most of all replayability (MANY items and enemies to unlock, and every playthrough is different)."
20765,"This game is really an emotional game for me, It's been there with me for so many years. I had this game on PS4, then bought it on my Switch after I've sold my PS. Then sold my Switch too and few days ago when I saw it on my friend's switch and played for half an hour, I thought why don't I have this on my Steam.

This is the game that made me start loving Roguelike genre. It has a special place in my heart and It still is one of the greatest and the best roguelikes of all time. I always return to it no matter what."

20779,Its a fun and time consuming game.
20780,Amazing game
20781,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.

20807,"I would 100% recommend this if you like games like Rougelikes, the DLC is also a definite grab aswell as it adds so much to the game, but if you are new to games like this I do not recommend getting the ""Repentance"" DLC until you learn the basics of the game first as it makes it alot more difficult and you may struggle.

But overall this game is a must buy!!!"

20840,"I just spent 9 hours attempting my biggest game break yet (things go slower with tainted cain) and in a moment of absentmindedness I held ""r"" instead of ""q"", which reset my run -- no questions asked -- 9 hours of work down the drain. 

This is a good game, but it has many subtle design flaws like the one above (and they are just as abundant in the DLCs). Keep that in mind when you buy."
20841,haha 420 hours

20844,"When i played it first time, It was cool. But as i continued to do it, i think there were few variables and there was no big difference in difficulty. Well I played rebirth only. If you are planning to buy DLC, it doesn't matter."

20846,"i love this game!
I first played it on a ps4 with my brother
This was my first game into rouge likes and bullet hell

20847,"I don't have The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth on my PC, so using remote play i can write a review.
This game is absolutely amazing, Even though it has flaws.
Rebirth is a love letter to the flash isaac fanbase, adding in hundreds of items, bosses, enemies, floors, and more!

I absolutely reccomend this game, and all of it's DLC's.
(Well except Afterbirth+ of course).

EDIT: (IMPORTANT) I now have The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth on steam.
One of my friends have gifted me the game, so please don't go into the comments and start hating because of ""I lied about my skill"", i just didn't have this game before on steam."

20861,"I really fucking hate this game, this has more questionable design choices than Spelunky HD."
20862,"I love this game to bits, but my only problem is the pricing and the OVER abundance of stuff to do, I just get lost on what to do next. Yes it great to have lots to do but too much and I just get lost. I can only play this game for a hour every 2 days or so. So making progress has been tediously slow. But the content and the gameplay is fucking fantastic. Its so fun to get a good run, but getting a bad run isn't challenging its just a bit boring but maybe thats just my shit attention span. Still yet to get tainted characters and yet to even get the lost. So idk"

I thought that it had no point, just a little character running around shooting flies and thats it. man was i wrong ive played this game like non other i love it i hate it. its cool tho/ 9.793/10. it makes me very angry sometimes but i just suck and i boot it up after 5 minutes."
20883,"This is my FAVORITE game of all time. The story is ambiguous, but compelling. The imagery is dark and morbid without being visually unappealing. Super fun game. Almost 2,000 hours deep on the Nintendo Switch version and recently decided to buy it for PC."

I would say this game would be in my top 10."

20929,"I'm taking back what I said. This game was fun before Repentance and Afterbirth+. Before both of those, TBOI actually required you to be good (which I'm not), but now it's almost 100% luck and I hate it. I'm on a like -20 win streak right now because I actually can't get past tainted Lazarus solely because I manage to get one good item and the games like ""Yeah that should be fine."" and gives me nothing but garbage for the rest of the entire run. If you want to play a game that is almost completely RNG based, then get Repentance and Afterbirth+, but if you want to actually have fun then just stick to Rebirth and Afterbirth."
20930,it good
20931,"Isaac is by far away the best roguelike on the market of it's kind. Isaac provides room-to-room combat and 'quick' runs with unique synergies every time and a variety of different characters each changing the way you play the game. Some characters affect gameplay more than others, but Repentence doubled the amount of characters while also providing some of the more unique ways to play Isaac. There are tons of crazy enemies and bosses to master your bullet-hell skills or die agonizing deaths against. This game is fun, bullshit, challenging, satisfying, disgusting, creepy, and addicting. If you somehow haven't heard of Isaac or taken the time to play it you should."
20932,good fucking game loved it since the flash version
20933,It good
20934,Such a nice game
20935,"One of the best (roguelite) games I've ever played, combined with the DLC's there's endless variations on the item combinations, the min-maxing and a surprising amount of mechanics, all combined with a fucked up traumatized baby theme"
20936,off of pc on my xbox account i have over two hundred hours of this game and with the addition of repentance there are pretty much infinite item combos and infinite hours of fun couldn't recommend this game more to someone who is bored and wants a pretty tough game to grind towards completion
20937,funny hahahaha poop with fly is so funny im laughing so hard dude AAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

20946,Best game of all time.. by far the longest lived game in my library
20947,"good stuff
"
20948,I've played BoI for over a decade this game kicks ass. Mods also fix a lot of the annoying stuff (having to look up items)
20949,"GOOD, VERY GOOD"
20950,"i think i have played enough to have a good review. It is a very fun game. There are so many synergies with so many items and so many items to unlock, giving the game lots of replay value. I believe the repentance dlc is probably some of the most fun I've had playing a game. It can be unfair at times (tainted Jacob and Lost) but when you have a good run it is a very enjoyable game. It also has one of my favorite soundtrack out of any game I've played, which is nice as well. All in all, despite how rage inducing it can be at times, it honestly is some of the most fun I've had in years. (Also looking forward to four souls requiem next year)"

20963,"this game has a TON of replay value, I highly, HIGHLY reccomend this game to people who like roguelikes. I also reccomend getting the DLC, It adds so many new characters, and items. If you can't afford the DLC then search up ""Antibirth Download"". It's a mod that adds items/characters to the game. (its free btw)."

How was the fall?
If you wanna look around
Give us a call
We don't see humans often
We're happy you just dropped in
I'll be so popular when I show all the monsters what I just brought in
Hey! Papyrus, mind your manners
Can it, Sans, no time for banter
Excuse my brother, he's a bit eccentric
You're just lazy and apathetic
Call me what you want, I got thick skin
Another bad joke and I'm finished with him
We are monsters, the awfullest kind
To mess with us takes a lot of spine
We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
Humans betrayed us and left us burnin'
One day we'll make our way back to the surface
Through all your travels, your sins will follow
Your consequences aren't easy to swallow
Who's the real monster? Now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone
"
20991,"[h1] Holy, where do I start... [/h1]

[b] Important: This review might contain spoilers and it goes from my experience from the base game Rebirth to the latest DLC which is Repentance [/b]

This game is maybe one of my favorite/most hated games of all time. Have to give it to Edmund, he really made me love and hate every single second I played. In a future I might attempt second and third save file... but not at the moment.

After getting my 100% completion with Dead God I decided to talk about it.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]

[b] The Good [/b]
1. Easy controls and easy to get used to
2. Hundreds of items that change the way you play the game.
3. Every run will always be different.
4. 17 different characters + 17 challenge characters with different play styles.
5. Huge variety of monsters and bosses.
6. Mod supported game.
7. Multiple challenges to overcome.
8. The game grows in difficulty with you.
9. Interesting/Rewarding Mechanics.
10. Multiple environments ( also known as Chapters).
11. Easy to get into.
11. So many unlockables.
12. Multiple endings that change with progression.
13. Completionist addictive candy.
14. Almost all the DLC's are godly
15. You might love Ed.


[b] The Bad (You get used to it, not going to lie) [/b]
1. Insane difficulty spikes which can overwhelm players after unlocking/completing certain objectives at the first hours as well as a huge RNG difficulty factor on late game progression.
2. Punishing\Tiltening Mechanics.
3. Hard to master.
4. Afterbirth + DLC (Just buy the whole bundle to avoid the AB+ GARBAGE experience and play straight into Repentance)
5. You will hate Ed... a lot....

[h1] ART STYLE & MUSIC [/h1]

The pixel art style of BoI is just superb and I really love how it gives everything a sense of uniqueness. It really shows how they cared about making the player feel that they are trapped in a world in which you are alone against the monsters that lay waiting the deeper you go into the basement, some of this being unique to that area.

When you combine it with the music it is just incredible. The two blend with the each other makes it for an immersive experience, specially hyping the boss fights and making you feel the rush to survive with the unsettling atmosphere.

[h1] STORY [/h1]

The story for me was at first open to a lot of interpretations and it made my imagination go wild during Rebirth to Afterbirth DLC period  (tried to recall somewhat my theory at the time, it might be incomplete). 

[spoiler] At the time, I used to think that Isaac was being abused by his mother because something happened in his past. At one point I thought he used to have a sister (Sister Maggy) and at one point she died, causing the fights between the parents.

Isaac felt responsible for the death of his sister and the fights between his parents, causing him to start seeing things everywhere, which got worst when his father decided to leave them. Her mothers mistreatment of him and abuse made him start looking for comfort and the Devil and convinced himself that he was evil incarnate, making a deal with him and selling his soul for some peace.

Things calmed down at one point (like we see in the intro of the game) and her mother starts to lose it harder than ever when she starts hearing ""gods"" voice. At one point the mistreatment got so bad that Isaac decided to take his own life by locking himself in the chest causing him to die and pass away into the afterlife where the devil was waiting for him and took this soul away (Ending 17). [/spoiler] 

The ending even on the time making me think there was going to probably be a sequel in the future... then Afterbirth + summoned Ed into my room, waggled his middle finger on my face, then proceeded to fart on my face and fly away while taking a dump on my head during his ascension into the heavens (most of my worst runs felt like that as well). Ending 20 plus the terrible DLC made me want to just quit the game there and there because [spoiler] it felt like so cheap and was like ""Hey guys!! He just fucking dies and that is all, nothing will come later!!""... [/spoiler] but I just had to finish it and I did the 1001% achievement.

However it came to my attention that the game ""The Legend of Bum-Bo"" goes and completes a part of the story that was incomplete or felt I left in a way it was incomplete at the time (Did not play it but I saw the videos and such, might play it in the future) [spoiler] Isaac has an insane imagination, he created a game in which Bumbo was the protagonist and sometimes his father came into the picture to encourage as well as playing with him.

After a series of events that we see in BoI happen (which was when his mother and father fight got so bad that caused him to leave them)  his mother decided to throw his game away.

After some time passed, Isaac's mother treated him a way that caused him to look for the game she threw away.

This was his escape from the real world to put it in a way and in the note his father left him he stated this... however his mother finds out and has a huge backlash upon Isaac making statements like that he left, that he never cared and that he never loved them and that she and him are the only ones left [/spoiler].

Then Repentance came out and the story connected with everything so well it was just so freaking good again and it caused such an amazing satisfaction that I had to play it and complete it again 100%.

[h1] IN SHORT [/h1]
Binding of Isaac is again, one of my favorite/hated games of all time and it will always have a place on my heart, despite how much I hate Ed for making me feel so many emotions. The game has so many things to see, indulge and experiment, while you go deeper and deeper into the basement and its story. It will grab you and will not let you go unless you let the frustration take over you. 

If you are a completionist, you will not regret it.

20993,"Most of the time you get hurt it's because of something you can't see, like red ""creep"" (something on the floor that damages you) on a red background, or red tears (bullets) on a red background, or black enemies on a black background. Not to mention the ""curse of darkness"" that just makes everything even harder to see for no real reason. Many players turn their gamma up when this happens as a way to counter it.

Enemies can have various affects like exploding into tears on death, but this isn't clearly shown on their in-game models. For example, sometimes a red enemy will explode into tears on death, other times they will drop health. Sometimes an enemy with bloody tears flowing down their face will shoot (a nice indicator), sometimes they won't. There is no real consistence in that regard to show what enemies do what visually.

There's also many items in the game that alter your character, something like 600+, but there's no way to tell what they do without using a mod that adds descriptions, showing that the dev has no interest in making the player's experience any more enjoyable, wasting their time looking things up on the Wiki rather than simply putting it in the game itself.

Overall the game has too many problems and doesn't respect the player enough to be worth recommending."

21062,"This game frustrates me, this game motivates me, this game pains me, and this game grants me hours of entertainment. I've probably felt more love for this game than Minecraft, which is saying something--for me, at least. If I could erase my memory and open this game up for the first time again all those years ago, on my middle school's netbook, I would. I've never felt more dedication to a game before and it tramps all of my previous interests tenfold. It has a special place in my heart.

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys crazy ass shenanigans paired with constant highs and lows. If you're not a big fan of rogue-likes, then I suggest you move along, because The Binding Of Isaac--in my opinion--is the essence of what it's like to play rogue-likes."

21100,"I'll be reviewing the individual game, as well as each DLC here, there will be spoilers since I cant recommend this game if you know nothing.

REBIRTH- I have played this version the least, but I know whats in it, and how you unlock it. For one the game is really fun off the bat, and most of the items have real uses, but heres the cool thing about this, and binding of isaac as a whole, synergies. If you grab one thing and then grab another, theres a chance it will synergize with it, creating something craaaazy. Like a exploding laser of doom. But in this version theres really only synergies with like 15 items. Which I guess makes sense, can you imagine having to code at least 600 synergies that some may never see? This is a pretty tight base game that can stand on its own 2 feet.

AFTERBIRTH- this one I have no emotions on, it barely adds anything and the items it adds are pretty useless. The main thing this one adds is a new area with a new boss fight, as well as a new gamemode, but thats it. 
AFTERBIRTH+- This one is probably closest to being my least favorite, it adds MORE new items that suck, and it adds in a unfun area with reused assets, and a final boss so frustrating and unfun that it honestly makes me sick. ON TOP OF adding ANOTHER new game mode which is just a harder mode of the one we already SAW. It only has mod support going for it.

REPENTANCE- This one brings it up by about 10,000 and adds a lot of new things. New areas that arent lazy and unoriginal? Yep, new bosses that are actually fun and fair (most of the time)? Yep, a FUCKTON new synergies for the new items on top of reworked items that sucked mega dong in the other versions? Yep, game actually being hard? Yep. yep, and yep. It even adds a lot of new characters, but you have to unlock them in a odd way, but its very worth it. While the final boss of afterbirth+ still makes me ask why I have to this every fucking time the new stuff added makes it all so much better. The big thing however are synergies, they have so many more synergies in this game then any other game. If you have 50 bucks to spare, just skip the others and get this one, and if you have been playing afterbirth+ for a while now and are getting sick of it, get this, it makes you feel like you're playing isaac for the first time again since 2011 or 2013 or whenever the hell you started playing."
21101,gang shit
21102,"This game is fun, who is Isaac? And WHY is he Binding? Other than that this game offers all of the best jumpscares for a typical horror game. Reminds me of the first doom game, because there are tears in both."

And dispite all that time I am still playing the game and still having tons of fun! It is gross, and weird, and creative, and just so SO disturbing, and has somehow made me cry. It is one of my favorite rouge likes ive ever played, and absolutely one of my favorite games.
While it 1001% isnt for everyone,  (id reccomend watching someone play it a bit before deciding if you want to buy it, Northernlion is a great youtuber to watch if you wanna check out the game) I absolutely adore the game and if you are a rogue like fan or it seems like your kind of game you owe it to yourself to try it out!"

For me, it never gets boring, each run is different, and you're always fighting new enemies and bosses and learning their attacks. Another plus of the game, is that sometimes items won't tell you what they do, so you'll be left guessing what has changed since you got the item. It has hundreds of hours of content, and if that isn't enough, there's 3 extra DLC for it. Great game, highly recommend. 10/10"

21288,"This is an incredibly good game! I've gotten hundreds of hours in it, and I expect to get hundreds more out of it. The only warning I have to give is that it can be a little overwhelming to start, so I'd recommend having the wiki open when you play, before you've learned all the items. Alternatively download the External Items Description mod, which just tells you what all the items do directly in the UI, which is very helpful for beginners!"
21289,its ok
21290,"The Binding Of Isaac is a good game for some reasons that I will talk about. The first thing to get out of the way, this game is a top-bottom rogue-like game, so if you do not like those genres then I would not recommend this game for you. Anyways let's move on to the actual gameplay. This game features a room based map where randomly generated ""seeds"" will determine your layout. While moving around the map some special rooms will spawn such as shops, item rooms, boss rooms and others depending on your DLC. Opening and going into these rooms will be different. Anyways this isn't a tutorial so this game is good, I recommend it and if you enjoy the game getting the DLC's is recommended!"

21310,"the ultimate rouge-like, there is no other in it's position as the absolute king of this genre"
21311,"Do not buy this game, 75% of it is just holding R trying to get a decent item while the game give you basically useless garbage, and the other 25% is getting railed by the game as it refuses to give you anything that would help in any way, you need damage? have some speed. you need tears up? have some shotspeed. you need health? have red hearts that you literally cant use unless you lose red health and thus lose your devil deal chance. and some of the enemies are just fucking annoying, such as the skeletons in the third to sixth floors that randomly wander and when they see you sit in place and spam projectiles directly at you. 
If you happen to get the one in a million chance of getting a good run, the game is pretty fun, but that'll never happen since the amount bad/useless items majorly outweighs the amount of good/fun items, remove 90% of the items and it would be pretty good
but this game is awful. don't waste your money, don't waste your life, don't buy this game."
21312,"one of the best games i've ever played. highly replayable and tons of mods on the workshop if you ever get bored of the base content. accumulatively across all platforms i've played this on, i have at least 1k hours.

21326,This game's sick
21327,people wont get bored with this game at all
21328,Very addicting! Its an amazing game to play when you're indecisive about what to play lol
21329,"This game has had an enormous impact on my life, and to this day remains a roguelike nearly unmatched in its variety. Every run is a breath of fresh air, and it's easy to play for hours and hours. It's also helped greatly by generally good enemy, room, and mechanical design.

Being as varied as it is means it's not going to be as fair as other roguelikes, but in my experience the trade-off is extremely well worth it. There's also the issue of the mountain of DLC (All of which I would recommend to varying degrees), but as a dedicated fan for many years, I'm just happy to have more of the game to play."

21353,game good
21354,"An amazing game made my amazing developers,
You could almost say with some exceptions that this is the most famous roguelike game that's our there.
Game is very fun, with now multiplayer over remote play included.

The game can be very stressing at times with you dying in some stupid way, but it pays off later when you break the game with like 2 items."
21355,"This game is easily worth your free time, it seems impossible and crazy hard at some points though. Lots of hidden references, insane synergies with items, and a big mixture of good, ok and bad items along with a handful of just overpowered items. 10/10 game"
21356,PEE PEE POO POO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
21357,"I don't even like roguelikes but I like Binding of Isaac. Plus it has a great soundtrack, so even though I suck at it I still have a great time."
21358,Like banging your head on a brick wall but the pure joy of your messed up face going through to the other side is worth it. Probably.
21359,Fun :(
21360,"After playing for just under 400 hours, I'm glad to say that I've cleared Isaac for the third and final time. This series has accompanied me since 2014 and without it, I probably wouldn't be the same person as I am today. While Repentance certainly raises the difficulty of the base game with challenging new floors and characters, given that you put in the effort and time conquering the creatures of below, you will see the fruits of your labor flourish and be left with a satisfaction greater than any other games for a similar price.

Edmund McMillen, thank you for bringing the story of Isaac to a definitive close in Repentance and bestowing the world with what is arguably the most significant rogue-like of all time. It's going to be tough knowing that while I have no further achievements to unlock, I'll face the future with positivity and strength. After all, this game has taught me that regardless of whatever life throws at you, how many means must be conquered to meet the ends, we all just have to stick with what we have and move forward to becoming the greatest versions of ourselves that we can be."
21361,lots of playability
21362,"The Binding of Isaac series is far and away the reason why roguelikes are so popular today, and it continues to be one of the greatest games of all time. Every single run is unique and full of secrets that keep gameplay from becoming stale. With an incredible variety of characters and items, you can easily play the game for hours and not get bored."
21363,"This game is awesome. Intresting reference to bible, and nice but very hard gamplay. As for the music, soundtrack on Cathedral is epic. The graphics captivate with its reference to older and iconic games

21386,"I can't in good faith recommend this game in the state that it's in currently with Repentance, but I just can't bring myself to not recommend it as I dearly love this game. However, Repentance is extremely buggy, extremely unfair and most importantly, it isn't done. It's overly brutal far past the point of fun and has made me a violent, angry person every time I play this game. Every cool new thing added to the game is instantly overshadowed by how bullshit enemies are now. All the cool new bosses? Unpredictable attacks and way too tanky for when you incounter them in the game, you're guaranteed to take damage. Got a really good run in terms of item synergy and damage? I bet you lost that run because the game absolutely fucking refused to give you HP drops of any kind. A run where you're getting really healthy HP drops? Yea I bet you do so little damage that you won't even want to keep playing the run because of just how demoralizing it is. They completely gimped Devil deals so they're 9/10 times useless so you feel obligated to always go for angel rooms, just to constantly lose your angel room chance to bullshit damage that you couldn't have avoided even as a seasoned player. I desperately hope this game is fully completely and turns into the super tight and really addictive rogue like I know it can be, and I'm willing to wait as long as it fucking takes because I know there's only one developer working on Isaac for now. Until then, I just can't recommend this game to anyone. I can't even play it to relax anymore."

You definitely need to play through a few times to get the hang of it, but it's worth it when you complete a run. Especially when you get broken runs with amazing items. Can't recommend this game enough."

21452,"TLDR: Poor, RNG based design that makes the game unenjoyable, and absolutely zero quality of life features, even simple things, and topped of with jank that disturbs the flow of the game. All those things ruin what could be a deep, interesting game with lots of unlocks, and goals to reach for,

Requiring RNG to have a good run is poor design. Some of the game is very interesting, and very well designed, but unfortunately it is just completely unreasonable to play. Barring the good, fun parts of the game behind hundreds of hours of gameplay, RNG, and poor game mechanics is just not enjoyable.

The game is so unintuitive (in a mechanical way) that there is almost no room for improvement for the player to have, other than knowledge, either in actual synergies and the path, or jank.

This game is mechanically barren, and it is unbelievable that it is as popular that it is with such a time sink being required.

Its unfortunate, because behind all the jank, poor design, and reliance on RNG, is an actual deep, interesting game, with cool bosses, decent music and sound design.

The story is only comparable to fanfiction, unfortunately, but it is at least not bad, just not good.

Mind you, this is all considering that i used mods to IMPROVE my experience, and it still is a poor experience. Having items be a complete mystery until you pick them up is bad, and requires either a notepad, or perfect memory without mods.

Maybe im spoiled by roguelikes like Spelunky HD/2, and Slay the Spire, but i feel that this game falls short in the worst way possible; the first, introductory hours."

I have just a few hours in this game, but I love it. I have been playing since right when afterbirth released and I still haven't beaten everything. The level of replayability is ridiculous. I have this game to thank for getting me through a lot of rough patches. Also it was the first game I played on my Nintendo switch! I recommend this to everyone that likes the rng dungeon-crawler rougelike genre, as it is probably my favorite game of all time. Only downside is since its rng you get buttF*cked a lot. It happens. But when you beat that final boss, with the adrenaline of being on half a heart, there's no feeling like it. Get this game. It'll be worth your while."
21471,destroy all that cross your path by crying on them. played this for over 90 hours in the span of 2-3 weeks and i cant say that im disappointed
21472,lots of fun
21473,good
21474,"Just no. It's a good game to a degree but gets stale quick. I want to give this game a good review frankly, but with what happened before and the fact that for a good while, Afterbirth+ was completely broken after Repentance was released, my recommendation is going to stay the same. Maybe on a future date, my opinion will sway but for the time being, only get this game if you're into modding and grindy games, and having your game crash every 2 seconds if you get a god-tier run or mod too heavily."
21475,"I've been playing Binding of Isaac since the release of the original game. It remains one of my favorite games of all time, and i find myself going back to play it time and time again. would recommend this game to anyone with even the most slightly morbid sense of humor. the replay factor on it is near infinite. 666/10"

21479,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

21507,"Ive loved the binding of isaac from the original java running days and i really enjoy playing through this rouge like, and it wasn't until now until i purchased the game on my steam account (technically for the 2nd time) . i do wish i could experience the full game with repentance without having to do the ol' yar har because i use mac OS but afterbirth+ will always have a place in my heart and is the best experience that everyone can have!"
21508,"ye it good

edit: it still good"
21509,"This game will make you scream in excitement when you get a good run and will make you smash your keyboard or controller when you get a bad run. But as you keep doing more runs, the bad runs will become more manageable and you might rage less. I know I won't stop raging though, I hate dying when I have a good run. So piece of advice, don't get hit. EVER."

Mr Fluff really enjoyed this game, you should check it out"
21529,"This game is pretty fun. It's a dungeon crawler rogue-lite that focuses on item collection and synergies between those items. The game map and rooms are similar to the original Zelda but are randomly generated from a pool of pre-made rooms; this means that every run will be different.

Rebirth - This is the first version of the game, very simple, good amount of content. This version of the game took me about 400 hours as a child to complete.

Pros- Easier enemies, Easy marks, the good items are run winners, old secret rooms, devil deal is extremely strong

Cons- Some challenges are harder in this version, bad room layouts, softlocks in some rooms. Familiars suck and there's too many of them.

There are many bad items in this version, but the bosses give so many stat ups that it becomes fair or easy. Devil deals are good in this version, this carries on to afterbirth+. The challenge character is tough but the item pool is small, so you'll probably find the items you need anyway.  This version is good for getting your basic skills down like shooting and dodging.

Afterbirth+ - The big boy of the series. Everything gets way harder in this version. The game gets flooded with tons of items (mostly bad). I didn't finish this version on release because the difficulty spiked, instead I waited a few years until I was older to 100% this version. This version took about 200 hours to complete from a fresh start.

Pros- Cool new items, enemies, and completion marks. There's a new game mode. EVERYTHING BREAKS THE GAME; if you find 1 or 2 items like restock, iv bag, d20, you just win. Restock machines in shops. A really fun bullet hell boss that requires you play the game fast and smart. Lots of new consumable drops that make the game easier; these are locked by the new challenges which can be hard however. The old challenge character gets some love.

Cons- Small boss rooms, bad secret rooms, lots of unfair rooms. The item pool is littered with non-stat and do nothing items; many runs you won't get a damage up. Devil deals rooms on average contain less deals. There's a bullet hell boss that telefrags you. A fustrating challenge character. Some of the hardest challenges in the game. Lots of synergies that gimp your run. Boss armor is slightly annoying. Nerfed red chest and curse room.

This version suffers from too many items that do nothing or have little impact. Optimization is key to this version, most players will die because they don't get any stat ups or lose their devil deal; this can be solved by going infinite. In almost every run by luck or skill, you can find an infinite. No kidding, this is probably the easiest version to cheese if you take the time to go infinite or farm. If you don't like to memorize items or slightly optimize your runs, I would recommend skipping this and going directly to repentance.

Repentance - The reason I decided to 100% afterbirth+. This version changes a lot of mechanics of the game that seem unwarranted to afterbirth+ veterans but are well needed. Many awful items are buffed, and run winning items are toned down. This is definitely the most balanced version of the game even if it can be unfair at points. This version took about 200 hours from 100% in afterbirth+ to complete.

Pros-  New synergies. Not one (IMO) bad item was introduced in this dlc. 19 new characters and new path route. Buffed all familiars and most bad items. Removed small boss rooms. True co-op and awesome challenges. Hp drain items and mechanics now target your red health if possible (afterbirth and rebirth had this but it either lowered your devil deal chance, or didn't work for some items). More stat-up items. Better secrets rooms. You can guarantee angel deals. Buffed curse room layouts. New beggars and machines.

Neutral- The game changed from soul heart oriented, to red heart oriented. Soul hearts are much harder to find compared to afterbirth+ and sometimes are required for devil deals. Red hearts appear more often and hp pickups heal an extra heart. Because red hp is more common and soul hearts are rarer, devil deals become a hard choice and angel deals get an indirect buff. Restock machines don't spawn in hard mode shops (not sure about normal mode), but restock machines were broken anyway.

Cons- Many BS enemies. Game crashing bugs (especially co-op). Some bosses are a bit cheap. The bullet hell bosses have unavoidable multi attacks (developers are working to fix that). Batteries are rarer. You can no longer cheese beggars, devil deals, or blood machines. Most infinites are removed. The devil deal layouts got even worse (Even less deals on average due to more itemless/1 item devil rooms)!

Despite feeling harder, Repentance is a lot more forgiving. There are many red heart drops, tons of stat ups, many opportunities to get items, and lots of new consumables that change the way you play the game. This dlc will feel harder for the veterans who are used to breaking the game with 2 item combos, while feeling easier for those struggling before. This is the best version of the game.

The challenge characters introduced in this dlc are BRUTAL. They are challenging to the point of being unfair at points. If you plan to 100% this game, good luck!"

21538,"This game is so amazing, while is may not be so friendly to newer plahyers once you start playing it and understanding the games it's amazing 10/10"
21539,"There's definitely a bit of a learning curve but once you get past that it's really one of the best games around.

Only complaint is in the current version you are forced to use remote play to play with friends, and remote play is probably one of the most underdeveloped programs steam has. Also it has a delay for inputs which makes it that much worse in this game in particular.

With online multiplayer I would give this game a 10/10 which I'm pretty sure it's in development anyways. Good game."
21540,don't ever play this damn game it sucks so much and you WILL forget about the other games you own
21541,"Great indie rouge-like game, and it even has workshop support. Good game if not a little pricey with DLC, but I'd say its worth it overall."

Life was isaac, and they were both isaac.
That was, until the day Isaac's isaac heard an isaac from above: ""Your isaac has become corrupted by isaac! He needs to be isaac!""

21614,"Well I guess after reaching 1000 hours of playtime it's time to write my review about this game.

WARNING! May contain traces of spoilers!

First of all: I freaking LOVE this game. It is addicting and it doesn't matter if I take breaks from it or other games are more important some times. I am always coming back to this masterpiece. It is hold simple but still makes a lot of fun. The atmosphere in the game is quite fitting for the situation you are in.

Gameplay:
The game is easy to play but hard to master. Also the gameplay is hold pretty simple. W,A,S,D or left stick on your controller to walk and the arrow keys or the right stick or A,B,X,Y buttons to shoot. Also every run is different. Items and enemies in each room are random and so it sometimes happen that you won't see an item a few new runs again. Winning a run is sometimes based yon your rng then :D.

Enemies:
Almost every room is filled with enemies but the enemie patterns are quite easy to learn but it can be hard to fight against different enemies in one room based on their type and numbers. The bosses are quite easy too if you've managed to learn their patterns but the deeper you go in a run the tankier they get. 

Items:
Items are categorized in 4 different types: 
1) Active: These items can be activated to unleash their effect but the activation uses all it's charges which means you have to clear rooms to charge it up again.
2) Passive: These items give your character boosts in stats and passive abilities to your projectiles.
3) Trinkets: Trinkets give you a small extra stat boost or ability when you pick them up but you will loose it again if you discard the trinket.
4) Collectibles: Bombs, keys, coins, pills and tarot cards. Pills have positive or negative effects on your character and tarot cards contain useful side effects. Bombs, keys and coins are explaining by themselve :D

Playthrough:
Like I said before, every run is differrent. Also the way to play it through. There are 7 end bosses to fight against and each one have a different way to be reached. So if you miss a certain key item for one of these bosses you still have the possibility to fight against another one. But if you have already fought against all bosses but one, well, finish the run or restart it :P

I guess that's it. For every fan of rouge like games this is the perfect game to waste hours and hours of your life. It will be worth every penny.

21615,10/10
21616,Very good
21617,Game sucks
21618,game is very fun and cool thank you edmund for making baby plum real :)
21619,this game is super fun. cuz there are like 500 items you can get. + dlc items! and alot of ending (i love multiple endings in games) + its a challenging game. can be boring when you dont get good items so you have to restart the run.
21620,edmund mcmillen beat the shit out of my son and called me a motherfucker
21621,Very fun if you're looking for a challenge. Controls are easy to master and there's a huge variety of items and enemies in the game! Not to mention all the endings and characters you can play as. Definitely recommend!
21622,i will not become back my money
21623,This game tricks you into making you think it's $15 when in reality is $50 and then tricks you AGAIN because you ACTUALLY haven't overpayed because of the amount of content it has to offer. Not only do I highly recommend buying this I also highly recommend cheating through Greedier mode because that's where the fun ends.

Isaac will take your effort and hard work then kick it into the dirt and flush it down the toilet. 
You'll pick it back up and try to do another run, only to be RKO'd back into the toilet then shoved down your throat.
Then finally, it happens. Item after item churns out and makes you better, stronger, harder, FASTER. You'll progress further than you've ever gone...
then get crapped on in the pussy floor.

This is a hard RNG base game with some inapropriate jokes but getting used to the controls are easy. Here is a list of some controls you will need: Q for pills runes or others, space bar for active items that use a charge bar it should appear on the top right of your screen, E for you to place down bombs which can break rocks and if you break rocks with X marks then you can get someone special. and that is all I know to say but if your looking for a fun RNG base game it's here (also there is blood) and uh yeah sometimes you will get overpowered in a run or maybe not but good luck if your trying this game out and everyone stay safe :) bye!!"

21679,"One of the best games I've ever played, and some of the best time for money value. Isaac has become one of my favourite media ""franchises"".

The game has so much content in it for what you pay, and the gameplay is engaging with the interesting and insane combinations and synergies with different items.

Unfortunately the game does not run above 60fps, so if you have a high refresh rate monitor the game will be capped at 60fps. The game does support ultrawide displays though."

But if you don't have a life, this is the game for you :))) You will feel anger, happiness, tiredness, grief, and more because you will love and hate this game simultaneously. Take it from me... I feel dead on the inside playing this for 300 hours. (P.S. Get the DLCs if you can, it adds so much stuff in the game.)

Do I suggest the game? Yes, if you don't have a life.

Fun? Yes. 

Replayability? It's infinite.

Will you have a tendency to want to smash the ever-loving crap out of your pc because you died to a needle? Yes, you very much will. (Although this might be my skill issue)"

21704,"[b][i]A Game With The Worse Traits of Rogue-Like Mechanics. Not Recommended: 6/10[/i][/b]
--------------------
The interest in Rogue-like is that you begin each session from zero every time. Supposedly, this is to simulate a form of realism, where if you die, you die. I can I understand this concept; but I thoroughly disagree with it; why continue to play a game where you don’t have any sort of progress? [b]The Binding of Isaac exhibits the worse of these Rogue-like mechanics[/b] and depending on who you are, you will either really like it or you won’t. 

I don’t. 
--------------------
[b]What Might Be Good[/b]
--------------------
Despite that, there is definitely some things here to appreciate. The main reason why everyone is positive about this game is because it is dirt cheap. Certainly, the [b]value proposition is very very good[/b]. The [b]graphics are cute in a 90s Nickelodeon gross kind of way[/b] (think of colorful snot, poop, vomit etcetera). The [b]music too is reminiscent of 90s Alt-Rock and Grunge[/b]. The [b]theme is deceptively complex but a little too indulgent in the developers own mental disorder[/b] if I’m being honest.  
--------------------
[b]What’s Bad[/b]
--------------------
The [b]controls though is not good. It’s floaty and mushy and thoroughly unsatisfying[/b]. The story is meh. And the [b]“infinte replayability” is deceptive[/b], since the content is basically a 1000 types of power-ups and an impossible dungeon run to defeat impossible bosses.
--------------------
[b]What’s Worse[/b]
--------------------
 [b]The difficulty is entirely dependent on your RNG[/b], which means whether you complete a run is based entirely on luck. 

[b]This is not fun, this is just gambling[/b]. Come to think of it, that is exactly the appeal and my disagreement for this game.[b][i]The Binding of Isaac is the lootbox of game mechanics, and the gamers who play them can only be whales.[/i][/b]
--------------------
[b]Conclusion[/b]
--------------------
I’m not going to judge if you find that you like this game. To each their own. But I don’t like it, and I don’t want to be [i]that whale[/i] that spends too much and make the experience for everyone else worse."

21733,love it
21734,"Stick with the game through the tough early hours and you'll slowly improve, I promise :)"
21735,"Great game, never got bored while playing it. Though its luck based system is annoying. There are really good items and really bad, almost useless items as well. Also some room designs are straight up bullshit and will end your run (There is one room in womb that instantly damages you twice if you enter it from below or above. Instantly killing your lost run). But all in all it's an amazing game to kill time or play while chatting with your friends. 
PS: download 'There are a bit more options at the start!' mod if you keep pressing R in start to find a decent item."
21736,this game is a drug and i love it 10/10 would recommend
21737,"Infinitely replayable AND still fun
"
21738,yes
21739,"Outstanding video game, addicting in the best way. Features unique and grotesque (and sometimes adorable) art, this is truly an indie gem. Not too mention the Repentance DLC really brings the playing experience a huge step forward polishing everything and making this feel like a brand new game. Definitely would recommend."
21740,"eve is my waifu 
"
21741,my tears became lethal after playing for a while
21742,"As a long time player there is a definite difficulty curve noticeable in the Binding of Issac: Repentance DLC. However, I did not personally feel this subtracted from the main game; rather just offering a new difficulty experience and allowing credibility to the ""Hard Mode"" game option. Overall a very fun experience."
21743,Very fun game purchace again... very nice
21744,!!!

Each time you start a new run it feels like you are standing at a huge wall that u are about to fucking destroy by getting brim.

21776,"     Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill.  Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.  
     Life was simple and they were both happy.  That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above, ""Your son has has become corrupted by sin.  He needs to be saved""  ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.
    Again the voice called to her, ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt.  He needs to be cut off from all that is evil from this world and confess his sins.""  ""I will follow your instructions, Lord.  I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room, away from the evils of the world.
    One last time Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her, ""You've done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me.  To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""  ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.  ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice.  Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice.  Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else.""  ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butchers knife from the kitchen.
     Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.  Scrambling his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement hidden under his rug.  Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below..."

21811,"The Binding of Isaac is easily one of my favorite games to date, it’s cute in a creepy way with a wonderful story and is infinitely random with the maps and loot all randomly generated, and If you're an achievement hunter then the 637 achievements should maybe entice you to play."

21818,"its kinda hard but that is good.



10/10"
21819,I died.
21820,"One of my favorite games. I like the depressing style of the game, how the character model changes with picking up certrain items, idk why but the style really gets me. The music, the story, the crying models, the different characters build around different story endings and so on

The game offers a lot of funny easter eggs, and much stuff to unlock. Many different bosses which take some time to understand how to even face them. From time runs to special boss encounter, to picking up certain items, you name it.
Finally beating them always gives you some new unlockables like new stages, shop upgrades, new items, new characters and challenges which are hilarious and make the game feel really rewarding. 300h+/played and still unlockinng new stuff on a dayli base

I love how the game gets harder every time you make some progress. Even some characters like ""The Lost"" which are not that easy to unlock and even harder to play, since you can only take 1 hit the entire run. So you need certain items which help you out.
Been playing here and there over the past view years, enjoying it much more nowadays with the DLCs that came over the past years.

Edit 2: Im going to kill Edmund"
21844,"Original Game? Not bad for flash.
WotL DLC? Nice for a DLC, grew my tolerance to rouge games.
Rebirth? Twice the fun as flash, fun to play, and gave me an open view to more rouge games like it.
Afterbirth? An expansion to an already great game, more ways to play, more ways to die.
Afterbirth +? Should've been part of the first DLC, but I still bought it anyways. Not much to be said.
Repentance? Not only an expansion to the game, but it feels like a whole new one. 
Now, no matter the pain, You'll have a large amount of fun with all these new ways to play.
This isn't to forgive to Edmund for most of the nerfs and decisions made in Repentance. I swear, with every 5 good things I find for this game, there's 1 really bad one that just stabs my soul. Jokes on you, Edmund, my soul is non-refundable.

Also, buy Four Souls, all of it's expansions, and spread more Issac propaganda. Spend. Consume. Greed. Screw you Edmund, thank you for making this game <3."

21894,"I know you know what I'm talking about. You've played a game with gameplay that seemed to be building up towards some grand conclusion, but somehow, some way, you knew all along - from the very beginning - that it was just pretending. That the whole time it was all just an act. You've heard everyone talking about it. This game had twists, man. And you just had to know. But now, halfway through, you're just rolling your eyes.

And then - boom - there it is. Roguelite. The whole thing was a roguelite. Suddenly, out-of-nowhere, roguelite. The twist was roguelite. Of course it was. You didn't think there was a valid twist in there, did you? Nope, it was just as you figured. There was no twist. The entire thing was a farce, masquerading as a clever joke played at your expense. The thing goes out of its way to wink-wink, nudge-nudge you into thinking it wasn't about the content, but the experience. You had fun, didn't you? Maybe you should go tell your friends. It wasn't what you expected, right? It was suddenly a roguelite. C'mon, you at least had fun, right? Seriously, go tell your friends about me.

That's this whole ""game"" in a nutshell. There's no plot. There's no clever twist. Despite what I know you've heard, there's nothing ""meta"" or ""shocking"" about this sad sack train wreck. It's a slightly more developed version of the flash-game quasi dungeon crawlers you used to play on Newgrounds (that's the real horror right there, being forced to remember those dark, dark days).

Much ado is made about this game's ""horror"" aspect. Calling this thing ""psychological horror"" is like favorably comparing a Pinto to a Ferrari. Are you easily impressed by goofy jumpscares that are cheap and ridiculous enough to inspire literal facepalms? If so, then yeah, there's ""horror."" No, I'm not kidding. I'm not being facetious or over-the-top. I mean this game's attempts to surprise or shock me inspired literal, groaning facepalms.

This is a rare example of an ""action""-based ""game"" that fails utterly at gameplay, while being written by someone who - technically speaking - isn't strictly bad at making games. The creator intentionally went out of his way to make extreme parodies of common dungeon crawler game stereotypes, which is all well and good, but they're generally well made. The poems included are, for the most part, actually pretty good material (except for when they're not, which is usually on purpose). So, again, for emphasis: we're talking about someone who is technically competent at game making, who is absolutely terrible at it in practice. It's usually the other way around: people who lack the chops trying their hardest to visualize what's in their head - an otherwise decent game they can't quite fully realize.

So because of this inconvenient truth, listening to the creator use his game as a platform to express his views on games as a form of art, while simultaneously helping to put me off of gaming for good, was a painful - absolutely painful - experience.

I kept hoping halfway through that the ""twist"" was going to be some sort of clever send-up or inversion of staid dungeon crawler tropes. Like the best way the protag could help these enemies out is to not try to at all, and just show up and have fun sharing book studies or something. Instead all I got was a laundry list of ""new"" old tropes (DEPRESSED KID KILLS HIMSELF YEEEEEEEEEEEAH) and limp attempts to shock the reader with oh-so-scary flashing images.

But whatever. I'll just add this big thumbs-down as a shout of defiance against the death of good taste. People like this junk. It makes me imagine a future where all ""interactive"" fiction strives to be Youtuber bait.

God. That's the real horror. The unspeakable, unfathomable abyss I cannot bear to gaze upon."

21908,"for some reason it isnt letting me launch the game, even after i reinstalled it, removed all my mods ect, idk bad gaem dont want me to play it

"
21917,Great gmae
21918,"its a fun game, and you can spend countless hours on it. it probably takes over a day non stop to get every item in the game. overall its a really good game that you can play for a long time"
21919,fun but hard
21920,.
21921,"Just. Do yourself a favour and play the damned game if you've been stalling. If you like roguelikes, this one is amazing. I've been playing the Isaac series since before Rebirth, and there is still new content to unlock. Repentance may not have been the perfect final DLC, but it certainly was an amazing one. 

It has a few problems here and there, but the team have been transparent about it being incomplete, and that they are going to continue updating it for free until it is up to the standard they wanted it to be upon release. Also, don't let people scare you away with the difficulty. The game is hard, yes, but it is very VERY rarely unfair. 

The game also has years worth of mods, most of which are of an extremely high quality. Hell, there were even ""booster pack"" updates to the game that added certain modded items from the community, and the entirety of Repentance was made in collaboration with the mod-devs of the fan-made expansion called ""Antibirth"". Yes, they even have [i] those [/i] mods.

The community is also, extremely welcoming for such a... well, bizarre game. You'd expect it to be all politics and religious opinions considering the game's subject matter, but it isn't, and I really appreciate that. Anyways, like I said, just bite the bullet and grab the DLCs, i've spent way more time playing than I have spent dollars, and all of it has been enjoyable. Especially the way the game handles synergies between most items, there's just so fucking many. Don't get me started on the bosses either, I love them all. [strike] Except you Delirium, you're a bitch ass motherfucker and i'm glad they're planning on fixing you. [/strike]

22081,"Successor to original The Binding of Isaac and the most famous roguelike game of our days (the past decade, at least).

It has so much to offer in terms of variety: characters, items (passive / active / trinkets), enemies and bosses, floor and room layouts etc. Literally anything can happen in the game, sometimes you even become OP and basically unkillable.

[h1]Achievements[/h1][hr]
You'll go nuts if you're eager to get every achievement, so beware. Better take it easy and have fun, drop the game if it stops surprising you and isn't enjoyable enough.

[h1]Downsides[/h1][hr]
1. The major con is the soundtrack by Ridiculon - pure trash, absolute garbage; I literally hate it. Such a pity McMillen and Danny Baranowski (composer of awesome scores to Super Meat Boy and original TBoI) had some quarrel in the past and Danny B didn't write anything for Team Meat and Co since :(

Perfect replacement:

https://mudeth.bandcamp.com/album/antibirth-ost

It's music composed for community expansion [url=https://antibirth.com/]Antibirth[/url] and it's fantastic, highly recommend ♥

2. I liked the look of original flash-y game more, it was cuter.

3. Finally, the last (and final?) DLC to the game Repentance isn't supported on Linux, unlike TBOI: Rebirth and all the previous expansions to it. Sucks :("

It makes me relaxed and get my whole stress off while playing it. It is a quite good game if you have nothing to do or want to get away some stress without even being angry at anyone. And those soundtracks, damn they're so awesome to hear. Definetly worth atleast trying it."
22121,planetarium exists
22122,Too good of a game! i would Definetly Recommend this Game Because It Ain't Like No Other! Best Game Of my LIFEEE! You Should Absolutely Check this Game Out!!
22123,Yes
22124,fuck tainted eden
22125,"El mejor juego del género sin duda, adictivo a morir."
22126,fun
22127,very good! i love the adversary
22128,"Please buy this game, the wacky and silly synergys are endless. Also unlocking all the items is satisfying, so yea"
22129,a loot of poop
22130,my fav game
22131,this game is terrible. Please play it.
22132,"The pixel art is a wonderful touch of this game, compared to Flash, this game looks way better and cleaner. The game mechanics themselves are pretty good, and the game seems to be bug-free besides the items doing some buggy things. Oh and this game does make me upset but hey, when you get a good run, everything gets better. Oh and another note, screw Delirium."
22133,This game is good.
22134,"This game is awesome and randomly with telepills i found a room with a guy saying ""I am ERROR"""
22135,delirium sucks
22136,"I played for 442 hours, and I still find the game enjoyable. Honestly, I am shocked that I only played 442 hours, that's a low number. 10/10"
22137,good game
22138,This is the roguelike that all the others are chasing.
22139,"This game made my cry, (at the enemy)"
22140,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
22141,It's shit ;)
22142,I love the binding of isaac series because of its challenging but fun aspect.
22143,"A very good and an actually challenging game if you get the Repentance DLC
10/10 would recommend"
22144,"this game managed to steal around 300 hours of my life away as of the typing of this message so it must mean its good. Lol.

Jokes aside this is an amazing game. Great graphics, extremely varied gameplay with a ridiculous amount of items,mountiants upon mountains of content to get through, and a ton of characters that are all fun as hell to play (unless you're lazarus). I'm not even a third of the way through completion and I've already played for this long and its only gonna take up more time as life goes on. 9/10"
22145,pls make discount i want buy game pls
22146,\o/
22147,I've been playing this game for years. I love it way too much
22148,Very sad baby causes me major amounts of anger and frustration. Good game.
22149,one of the best games of all time
22150,all the things BloodTrail
22151,"Good game, but I will not recommend it until devs fix the Maraphon achievement, so it won't block other 636 for completion.
It's so annoying because the achievement has been bugged since the Repentance came out.

Upd: Finally"
22152,"Very fun rogue-like, lots of unique items, bosses, and playable characters, and when you get bored there are 3 different dlcs to play as well!"
22153,"I normally don't leave reviews, but I feel like this is one of the times I will.

This game has gotten me through a lot. I've struggled with my own fair share of religious trauma in the past. The narrative of this game hits so close to home, it's sort-of become a small safe haven for me. It's helped me through a lot of my issues, helped me realize I wasn't alone with my problems. Though I'm sure you don't want to hear about that. 

I love the gameplay. It frustrates you sometimes, makes you wanna bang your head against a wall, but you can't resist going for Dead God. It just has a certain pull to it. It's fun singleplayer and multiplayer, and after a while, you find yourself memorizing item names, cards, bosses and the such. I've bought all of the DLC full-price and it was worth it.
The modding scene is genuinely great. I've only come across a few ""bad"" mods. They make the game more silly, some add enemies, new bosses, and hell, Antibirth was such a good mod it made it into official DLC. The community is very nice too, due to some themes in the game it's very rare to find someone hurling slurs, and instead you find a lot of very talented artists, very devout theorists, and people just like me who have sunk in hundreds of hours of game time.

I don't regret buying this a bit. People complain about ""the nerfs"", but there's mods to fix it if it annoys you too much. I've played a lot of rogues and rouge-likes, but I always come back to Isaac. If you're iffy on it, buy Rebirth, see how you like it, then get the DLC."
22154,You play as a jewish boy

22169,"i will become back my money
"
22170,bruh
22171,"Hm I wonder if someone whos played half a thousand hours of a game would give it a thumbs down or a thumbs up. Well the answer is obvious. This game has so many achievements and Im still out here unlocking them and the game has so much hidden strategy that you'll probably need 1000 of hours testing stuff to figure what you want on your build or not and testing synergies or anti synergies. Challenges serve some difficulty especially in repentance, and if you have not much to do and just wanna have some plain ol' fun this game is for you. If you are a rogue like fanatic like me and do NOT own this game, you are crazy"
22172,I guess it's pretty good
22173,"Good, Hard, lots of meaningful unlocks for long term progression that improves/expands gameplay."
22174,"This game takes a while to get used to, but once I did it's one of the best games I've played in years!"

ive heard people call it a lost run after you pick it up
like just dont get close to the enemies 4 head
it won me a run just because of the aoe it made some bosses easy
it was a challenge run too
i couldnt see what health i was on or anything beyond two feet but big boy boom tears go brrrrrrrrrr and delete a room full of enemies 

in conclusion fire mind good

22189,Super fun and has longevity. It can be played over and over and still not feel incredibly repetitive.
22190,i hate this game
22191,"It's a classic roguelike game, if you haven't bought it yet do it right now, it's fun and challenging."
22192,"I love this game so much, it's incredibly fun; I've played this on the WIiU as well a long time ago and love it just as much here."
22193,is good too good it sus
22194,g
22195,FUCKING SHIT GAME!!! still good game though
22196,"SO FUN. Seems simple, but after you realize you will never have the same item combo ever again, the game expands beyond belief."
22197,good game
22198,"It's just great. All runs are pretty much unique. None are the same, millions are items to choose from."
22199,good

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, ♥♥♥♥ it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some ♥♥♥♥♥ who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground ♥♥♥♥ that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the ♥♥♥♥ you did with Rawkus too, that ♥♥♥♥ was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ man, you're like his ♥♥♥♥♥♥' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got ♥♥♥♥ else so that ♥♥♥♥ helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up ♥♥♥♥♥! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh ♥♥♥♥, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this ♥♥♥♥ out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that ♥♥♥♥ intentionally just to diss you
But what's this ♥♥♥♥ you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that ♥♥♥♥ just clownin' dog, come on, how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this ♥♥♥♥ about us meant to be together?
That type of ♥♥♥♥ will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy ♥♥♥♥
I seen this one ♥♥♥♥ on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!"

Absolutely recommend this masterpiece."

22205,"its a very fun and addicting game! At first i had to get used to the difficulty but now after 20 hours of playtime i can say that this game, for that price, is a must buy!"
22206,Yeah it's pretty good. You could probably sink at least a couple hours into this game.
22207,git gud

22210,fun
22211,"I bought the game awhile ago, and then didnt play it for awhile, and just came back to play it, and its gone from my library and I have to buy it again, What the fuck is wrong with you steam?"
22212,"Disturbing, brutal and rage inducing. All the qualities for a good or bad time depending on the type of person you are. One of the OG Roguelike titles on steam that is a must buy for anyone into the genre, the expansions add a lot of variety and content plus the added bonus of an incredible soundtrack"
22213,There is the most content in any game ever
22214,challenge your self in this game

this game has been the only thing on my mind all week"

22243,"I love games with a randomized element in them, it adds to the overall replayability for me. Isaac is no exception to this, and the difficulty curve is fine considering how many hours you have to put into this game to unlock everything. There's so much to do and I absolutely love this game."

22245,gud

22253,"I'm a life long gamer. Played my first game at the age of 1. With that being said, The Binding of Isaac is one of my all time favorite games. No other rogue-like comes even close to how fantastic and replayable Isaac is. If you're new to the game it can be incredibly hard at first and you may feel like you're not progressing after a -50 win streak. Just keep at it, every successful run is rewarding and expands upon what the game offers."
22254,it help me pp juice
22255,"cool cool
"
22256,10/10
22257,This twisted tale is the quint essential rouge-like. Have put more hours into this game than any other by a long shot.
22258,haha you can shoot poop
22259,It can be challenging but I love the randomized aspect of the game. I've been trying to unlock Lillith for ages and it's been a fun challenge with Super Greed as well as in normal runs. The one thing I don't like really is having to unlock some of the Challenges in the challenge menu because I just want to jump right in. Otherwise I have played for hours and have enjoyed every frustrating minute
22260,Cringe

22265,"But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves, and not living in the truth.

But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.

And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven!

Impurity, lust, and evil desires,

Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.

Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming!

No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear!

Fits of rage! selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like! I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God!

But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us all from sin!

For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord!

But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin

If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves, and not living in the truth

But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness

Pride! Greed! Wrath! Envy! Lust! Gluttony, and Sloth!

So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality!

BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT!!

All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away

No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear!

“Vengeance is MINE!! I will repay"", says the Lord

There hath no temptation taken you but as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above all!"
22266,worth
22267,"I'm honestly shocked I never got around to writing a review for this game before, but I think the number of hours I have played of this game speaks for itself. The game genuinely takes hundreds of hours to complete, but even if you are not one to 100% games, each run of this game is unbelievably fun on its own. The amount of variety that the items, floors, enemies, bosses, trinkets, characters and everything else this game provides means I almost always can come back to Isaac without being bored of playing too much of the same thing. There are very few games I can recommend as much as the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and its expansions."
22268,Enjoyable rogue like games with very dark elements to it only criticism I have is the fact that it has way too many dlcs other than that very good game.
22269,Best $40 I've spent in my life
22270,it is very
22271,very fun :)

22281,"If you love rougelikes you'll love isaac, it's the most perfect one, the sheer mount of unlockables gives you countless of hours of playtime. Hell, I've played 31 hours and I still have tons of characters to unlock. the DLC make the game much better, balancing items, adding new stuff, and making it look and feel better."
22282,"fun game. lots of rng so its pure luck which can cause frustration, but overall a good dame."
22283,"great game, good jokes on items, good lore, good replay-ability, fun"
22284,What I like about the game is the replayability and the almost endless amount of synergies that makes every run a different and fun experience. Also I like how there are characters with high and low skill caps so that it's not impossible for beginners but not boring for veterans
22285,"it good
"
22286,cool game
22287,"I hate this game, you should play it

Actually one of the most fun games I've played in a while, it's so easy to get lost in a run, please give it a try"
22288,"great game 20/10
"
22289,It's the same annoying mechanic that made me refund Enter The Gungeon too. It's not fun to be sent back to the very start of the game every time you die. It's just not fun. I don't see how anyone can have fun by having to start all over again after dying once.
22290,we know you're going to buy it :)
22291,"Amazing, 10/10"
22292,I like holding R for extended periods of time because I hate doing anything with my life apparently
22293,yes

22304,"Even after 8 years, this game has an active fanbase and community for a reason. There are limtless possibilities for runs, with lots of achievements and characters to unlock and lots of secrets to discover, The Binding of Issac just keeps giving me hours upon hours of entertainment."
22305,BAD GAME
22306,"The Binding of Issac is what I consider to be the most complex, interesting, replayable and frustrating rouguelike of all time. The game is brutal, especially with all the DLC and gets harder the more you play and progress.
The music is catchy and fun, items and synergys are epic and well thought out (Mostly).

If you are the type of person who enjoys a challenge and wont punch a hole through your screen then I fully endorse this game. Just play it, and if you think it's boring, you have not played enough.
"
22307,do not play if you value your hairline
22308,its a cool game when your bored

"
22326,Where am I
22327,"A game about a crying naked child, that eventuarly crawls into his mother's womb to kill a fetus, Satan, or himself.
Great game for kids."
22328,"Bro, the challenge ""hard mode"" is way to unforgiving in repentance"
22329,"I originally bought this game out of boredom one day on console and the original ad I saw said 500+ hours of playtime and I can definitely confirm it will give you unique content all the way through it, someday I want to play it again but its just one of those games in the past"
22330,"Took a devil deal item while curse of blind was active, it wasn't brimstone.

22334,fun game
22335,"i hate this game, its my favorite game"
22336,gaming
22337,"A really fun game. Has to be in my top 10. I had played this before on my nintendo 3ds, and as I can tell the repetance version improves on mostly everything. It is a kind of game that you can re-play as many times as you want and it mostly never gets boring."
22338,"man, this game is addictive. you will die, over and over again, but you'll have so much fun doing it it wont even matter. superb rogue like, and my favorite one at that.

22343,addicting and fun never gets old
22344,This game is Pog
22345,Pretty Pog
22346,its good
22347,pretty good
22348,"played this game on every platform possible, buy it. Might take a bit to get into but if you get the rhythm you wont regret the purchase"
22349,"This game is a lot of fun, and surprisingly addictive. The items and rooms are random enough to be unpredictable and very improvised, which makes every room a mystery. If you're on just one heart, you could go straight to the boss room and try your luck or try your luck in a room of enemies who may drop another heart

The sprites are well designed and the music is great, the price is great for the sheer amount of content and there's plenty of DLCs to get if you get bored."
22350,Life worsening experience!
22351,Good game.
22352,It's fun as long as you don't try to 100% it
22353,"Graphics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Wonderful 2d graphics, the sprites are colorful and very vivid at times. Everything is in a misleading cartoony style to distract you from the fact that your are regularly fighting half-dead creatures using your own bodily functions.

Controls: ⭐⭐⭐ The controls are fine. The character feels a bit slippery at times. Only being able to fire in 4 directions without the use of items is pretty neat I suppose. Overall, there is nothing amazing here, but it isn't uncomfortable, and it gets the job done.
 
Gameplay: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very fun to play, though a little repetitive at times. Infinite replayability. The game is fairly difficult, on average, while playing on hard mode, I only win once every 5 runs. My longest loosing streak was 13, which takes me to my next point.

RNG: ⭐⭐ Nothing is certain in this game. Some runs are laughably easy, while others feel next to impossible. While skill does play a role, it can only take you so far. For instance, I truly don't think the average person could beat Hush without a very strong run. Not saying it's impossible, but it is certainly unfair at times. I hear the game used to be more balanced, as you would receive a health upgrade almost always in the early floors, but this was since changed to be truly rng.

Overall score: 8/10. The game is not without its flaws. However, if you can look past minor inconveniences and are up for a challenge, this game is amazing."

22371,"One of the best and most addicting games I've ever played, totally worth buying and playing, there's never a boring moment with this masterpiece, and with every playthrough, it just gets better and better!!!"
22372,"Start with the base game and practice. You can buy the remaining DLC in a bundle later on if it's not too difficult for you (DLC adds more wacky fun but also more difficult environments/enemies)

Other Tips:
-DO THE CHALLENGES! You unlock new items and consumables
-Use different characters! Completing objectives with different characters unlocks new content as well
-Don't be afraid of challenge rooms, curse rooms, and devil deals. High Risk = High Reward

I also recommend watching content from Hutts or Sinvicta to help learn the little tricks :D
"
22373,"the peaks of this game make u smile and feel good :]
the lows makes u want to toss ur fcking pc out the window. 

edmund's design philosophy is so bizarre. half of the time he is a genius and makes cool, well designed stuff like tainted keeper, eye of belial, dark arts and the dogma fight, and then the other half he makes unfinished, poorly designed garbage like tainted lazarus who has half items with no benefits, the delirium fight which has been broken since its release years ago, tainted eden who gets their health rerolled for 0 reason + able to get run ending items instantly like 9 lives, and birthright which is not even fully implemented and literally does nothing for half of the characters. at least give a stat up until its implemented jesus. 

also what is with edmunds obsession with adding annoying enemies that do nothing but annoy the player, like flying hosts and brimstone enemies. why.

tis a good game, with an unreal amount of content (more than any other rogue-like IMO) and a whole lotta charm. but it needs quite some fixing and polishing to be anything more than just ""good"", an opinion ive had about the game since the flash days."

By far the BEST part of this game, is the coop. the coop should be  illegal with how fun it is however, you'll need a third party software since it's only local multiplayer. other then that, the dlc is worth it (even if there is now a hole in my wallet.) the price goes from 15$ for the base game, to 50$ with the dlc"

22463,"I have put in over a thousand hours into Binding of Isaac, and up till the latest expansion, Repentance, I have absolutely loved the game. Played in it regularly. I'm not a youtuber, or a twitch streamer, I just play casually. I wish I could say I would recommend this game now, but I just can't. The creator of this game, single or plural, whichever the case may be, has made this game so difficult to play that it's just not fun anymore for me. The casual player. And as I've looked at a few other comments and reviews. No, I have not been playing the new expansion in hard difficulty. I don't claim to be a pro, but I was pretty good at normal mode, and enjoyed playing this game as my hours can show.. But now? I wish I could yank my money back and throw this POS in the trash."
22464,"Easily one of the best games on Steam. With such a wide array of possible builds, the replay value is infinite. It also has a surprisingly deep backstory for a roguelike. 10/10"

22530,"TL;DR: Just buy it.

I've played for much longer than the time written here. This game is one of the most interesting rogue like games that has been put up on steam and in general. There are many things you never get to be introduced to like Jewish Mythology, and then you go on and google it and find some interesting stories, and you dive right into that rabbit hole.

Gameplay wise - There are some bugs, critical I'd say that need an urgent fix, but honestly? You can survive them, and it makes the game much more challenging and rewarding, a great way to get a dose of dopamine in a somewhat healthy way."
22531,dont play this game

22536,its amazing
22537,just a good time to have if your bored and got nothing to do.
22538,"The magnum opus of its creator (Edmund McMillen), Isaac has always been one of the best indie games on the market, and each DLC expansion has only iterated upon and improved the game before it. Even though the full package is 50 dollars now, I highly recommend not only playing Isaac, but waiting until you can purchase the whole hog and install it all at once; many balance patches and mechanical changes are implementing in DLCs, and so by going in with all DLCs frmo the get-go will save you some time re-learning the mechanics, and give you the most streamlined, ""complete"" experience. I'll be continuing this review with the assumption that you *are* purchasing the entire bundle, up to and including Repentance.

As for the game itself, I imagine you already know what you're getting into. Isaac is the granddaddy of the roguelite genre, and one of its most expansive specimens, with over 700 items, 50 bosses, and hundreds of other enemies. There are 4 main ""chapters"" (a bundle of two floors; Basement 1 into Basement 2 into Caves 1 and so on), followed by 2 more 1-floor mini-chapters, leading to a total of 10 floors in the average run. You unlock more floors as you progress, beginning with only the first 3 chapters and unlocking more each time you defeat the ""final"" boss. Over time, you'll unlock more characters, capping at a sizable roster of 17 Isaacs. The differences between characters vary; some are simply Isaac with different stats or a particular starting item, whereas others have fundamentally different mechanics, such as fighting exclusively with familiars, or shooting a short-ranged beam instead of bullet tears. Beating each of the the 14 different ""final"" bosses and in-run challenges as a given character unlocks a new item- so that's over 200 more items that you'll be consistently unlocking with each run- plus an additional set of challenge runs that you'll unlock as you go, and minor achievements here  and there (such as ""Obtain 10 Tears upgrades in one run"", or ""defeat a given boss 5/10 times""). All of this means that you are *constantly* unlocking SOMETHING, be that a new character, new floor, new item, or what have you. It's a constant reward loop, and the incredible amount of variation in each run means that each run is fresh and fun even if you've already gotten all 238 of the ""boss"" unlocks. I would go into detail on how the game keeps itself fresh with all the mechanics and changes in each run, but discovering that stuff for yourself is one of the best parts of Isaac. 
In short, even at 50 dollars, its one of the best money:time investments on Steam. 

Repentance has improved Rebirth from its classic status to a genuine juggernaut of the genre. If you enjoy roguelites, and somehow haven't played Isaac yet, you owe it to yourself to drop 50 bucks on not only one of the deepest and most rewarding roguelites on the market, but one of the deepest and most rewarding GAMES released in recent memory."

22596,amazing game so many hours of gameplay tottally worth the price
22597,Game caused my parents divorce. And Caves II can burn in hell and rot with my -62 win streak.
22598,"Good game. Difficult but rewarding. Would recommend playing blind for a decent amount of time without using any ""cheat sheets"" or mods that explain what each item does so you can feel out the game and not obsess over min-maxing runs."
22599,el
22600,epic
22601,Repentance is pretty hard.
22602,Very amazing game
22603,i really dont know how people can get triple dead god in only 1000 hours
22604,i friggin love this game ive played the entire game on console and its even better on Pc. alittle tricky at first but i recommend trying it gets better the more times you win and the better you learn attack patterns and unlock more characters. its also a fun game to stream and have fun in the long run is the moral of the story - love Germ
22605,"69 haha nice [spoiler] secks number [/spoiler] [spoiler] i love my dad [/spoiler]

22610,it makes me cry when i die
22611,Best rogue lite there is imo
22612,good game
22613,"Even though I have only played about 12 hours as of writing this I just have to leave a review now. 

This game is hard af, yeah but the reward that comes after you beat the bosses feels amazing, like each run you get better and unlock more content (and trust me there is a lot) and from what I have been told the DLCs add way more too so I look forward to when I can buy them as well. Amazing game!"
22614,"i guess its fun
"
22615,One of the most disturbing and frustrating games but still might be my favorite roguelike ever.
22616,fuck
22617,Still addicted
22618,this game sucks you should buy it and spend all your money on it
22619,This happened to my buddy Eric
22620,its much better with the dlc but the base game is good (if you want basic mods get afterbirth)
22621,"yes
"
22622,"Definitely one of my favorite ways to kill time, a game I'll play forever and ever :D"
22623,yes.
22624,Great game
22625,I don't really know what's going on in this game but it's very cool. 8/10
22626,"A naked boy, crying to save the world. Epic."
22627,"IF YOU LOVE KIDS LIKE I DO, THIS GAME IS A SWELL TREAT!"
22628,"Amazing game, great soundtrack, insane build synergies. Hands down one of the best roguelites to exist. There is also an extremely impressive workshop, the mod support for this game is fantastic, adding overhauls, new characters, QoL, and more. Buy the game!"
22629,the 19 dollar fortnite card mod really kicks this title to a 10/10 for me
22630,meat cube good
22631,isaca
22632,child lost in basement
22633,fact: game good
22634,It ruined my life
22635,good
22636,Just buy it
22637,"a very fun rougelike with so many different items, enemies, and bosses.
PROS: a shit ton of gameplay, characters, and broken (amazing) runs.
CONS: very hard gameplay, (although i should prob add that to the pros... and the ultra hard challenge. yes that deserves it's own penalty, fuck you Edmund"
22638,"good
"
22639,Surprisingly addictive
22640,"this game its cocaine, so good the best rough like"
22641,"This game is awful and I love it. Every run is wildly different from the last, unless you die. If you download all the DLC you're a real one and you have full rights to send death threats to my good friend Edmund. Don't play as tainted Jacob."
22642,Isaac
22643,This is a game
22644,"FUN!
"
22645,"This game is really unique because it has so many possible outcomes due to the vast variety of items that either appear in item rooms, devil rooms, angel rooms and so on. The items are shuffled so you never have to worry about getting the same complementary of items so it's a different experience every time. I recommend this to people who are willing to take some time to learn and get good at a game and to a more mature age group."
22646,"I have no idea what I'm doing 95% of the time.

Game's great though."
22647,"fun but requires memorization of the 1,600 page wiki"
22648,ovewosmeawsdas
22649,cry on fetus
22650,its alright
22651,"just doing this for that one Steam badge, because I'm a pillar of the community. This game does slap hard though"
22652,Hit your head against a brick wall enough times and the wall will crumble.
22653,"It's great I'm playing way too much of it. Hundreds of hours played, still so far from any completion."
22654,"One of the best games out there. With all the time I have played this game, I have only really completed 3 characters out of the many more that there are. Many challenges to do as well. Synergies and items have no equal in any other roguelite game out there."
22655,good
22656,its pretty good.
22657,How do I only have half the achievements
22658,"good game. even better with mods. heavily recommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes or wants to get into them, as this game was my gateway to things like nuclear throne and enter the gungeon."
22659,This game provides hours of entertainment through randomly generated levels and easy to understand controls. I would highly recommend downloading mods from the community hub to detail what every item does before you pick it up.
22660,yes
22661,It's ok
22662,poor isaac
22663,Very good game. Especially happy playing tainted keeper and tainted lost.
22664,who said crying doesn't solve your problems
22665,nice
22666,"The best roguelike ever made. The story is so unique and emotional. The gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. The items are so vastly different and powerful that even after hundreds of hours you encounter new things. Theres a great deal of strategy to it where you can affect the rng of the game through planning and game knowledge. A very difficult game that is also quite forgiving.
And when you get good item synergy you can totally break the game. Infinite bombs that heal you, rainbow death lasers that fill the room and spin in weird shapes, its just ridiculous. What a masterpiece"
22667,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
22668,437 hours and not even half the achievements cause I'm terrible
22669,sheeeeeesh

22689,Isaac
22690,fun. some characters need buffs / nerfs imo but is still good
22691,"I hate it, but I've gotten too used to coming back to it."
22692,fun
22693,isaac and his mother
22694,"I think because this game requires a calculator to play and very easy to control, the overrating went up so high. 
I just couldn't see much fun to play, just go and shoot, walk around poo piles. Everything needs a wiki, which is a good but you basically try to figure out what the item does and you see later on that it doesn't do much.
This game couldn't get my interest from the beginning. I had high hopes but 1 hour is way enough. Maybe I'm not into being a roguelike nerd, idk.

Write ???? on top of a collected item so player can be intrigued. Sneaky good idea but I don't buy that."
22695,Edmund Mcmillian You litte Fker You made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s fKing Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker
22696,"its fucking bad this trash game 10/10

22703,Pretty fun though confusing at the start
22704,"Been playing this in my college days, like way longer than what my playtime is saying here in Steam. This is the game (well technically the Flash version Wrath of the Lamb) that got me into the Roguelite genre, and I'm thankful for it. Best genre for me, and great game overall. Would recommend, especially with the mod support."
22705,Best roguelike of all time

nice"
22714,good
22715,"This game is kind of gory and is a little on the eh side when it comes to whether it's appropriate or not, but it's amazingly fun and the amount of unlockables and the endless possibilities makes this game good! 9/10 in the scale of whether you should buy it or not. It's not a 10/10 though because there are some things you should be weary about, so be aware... but those things to be aware of are the point of the game but still, be ready for what to come if you are diving into the game blind..."
22716,"This game honestly used to be my favorite game.  Since the update i hate it.  I've put in all my 700 hours before the update came out and since then, I've maybe put in 10.  They took all the fun out of the game and made it overly difficult.  If you're looking for a better version of this game, go play the flash version.  This updated honestly ruined the game for me and I've uninstalled it for the last time."

22783,Fun Dead Babey game
22784,This game is the best ever!! it has a lot of unique bosses and has give me hours of fun i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and simple game to play!
22785,"I've played Isaac games since the Newgrounds flash version, so there's way too much nostalgia for me to write an unbiased review.

(+): Fun, combo-oriented, bullet-hell-lite.
(+): Huge payoffs for certain builds, (and most of the Repentance changes are sensible adds that improve the game)

(-): Extreme learning curve. Mods practically required for new players to learn combos and to differentiate between some items.
(-): I never really understood the bodily fluids obsession, but it's at least a goofy shtick if it's not a turn-off."
22786,Yes
22787,fun ig
22788,very fun but i hate edmund
22789,"so much shit
"
22790,good game
22791,"Probably the best roguelike on the market.

The game has simple mechanics, yet pushes you with a large difficulty curve. In return, you're strongly incentivized to improve your skills, both mechanics wise and game knowledge wise.

With all DLC, (though I'd try the base game to see if you like it), there is an extreme amount of content to complete. If this is a game you enjoy, you can easily dump loads of hours into it."
22792,it's ok i guess
22793,"Amazing game with tight, fun combat and it being a rouge-like game with over 10 characters it has an amazing amount of replayability"
22794,"BUT IF WE ARE LIVING IN THE LIGHT, AS GOD IS IN THE LIGHT, THEN WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH EACH OTHER, AND THE BLOOD OF JESUS, HIS SON, CLEANSES US FROM ALL SIN. IF WE CLAIM WE HAVE NO SIN, WE ARE ONLY FOOLING OURSELVES, AND NOT LIVING IN THE TRUTH, BUT IF WE CONFESS OUR SINS TO HIM, HE IS FAITHFUL, AND JUST TO FORGIVE FOR US OUR SINS, AND TO CLEANSE US, FROM ALL WICKEDNESS.
Repentance is pretty good."
22795,Goochie game
22796,game makes me feel new emotions
22797,it's ok
22798,Fuck this game
22799,Binding of Isaac + all it's DLC has the most replayability of any game I've played in my entire life. Even with 588 I still don't have all the content unlocked. It's neverending in the best way possible. S++
22800,Nice game
22801,yes.
22802,It do be kinda fun tho

22809,"it's okay, i guess"
22810,"Hard, trolls tf outa you. But very rewarding when it works out. Extremely replayable."
22811,I bought it a few days before the steam summer sale and I've been regretting it ever since.
22812,A masterpiece in the rogue like genre. Nothing much more to say about it. It's amazing.
22813,"This masterpiece is one of the pillars of the roguelike genre.
Inspired by the early Legend of Zelda games but shaped to give you the challenging and endless experience that only roguelikes can provide. 
It has limitless replayability thanks to the huge array of items, unlockables, synergies and fresh gameplay that the randomly generated runs can guarantee.
The creator and devs are constantly working and releasing updates, having released the latest huge DLC just a bunch of months ago. 
After 7 years  from its release it's still the most solid and enjoyable roguelike (if not indie game in general) on the market.
Cannot recommend it more!"
22814,I will not be becoming back my money with this game
22815,"Probably the best rogue-like ever made. Half Zelda, Half Rogue, and very dark humor.  I played it for HUNDREDS of hours on console back in the day.  Just started on pc and it's got me hooked again all ready.  If you're on the fence, just buy it.  It's amazing. Don't even wait for a sale.  It's that good.  I haven't tried the expansions yet, but I fully intend to once I play the main game again for a while"

22825,"I was suggested this game by a friend and I've already beaten the second ""mother"" experience after 12 hours. I know that it's got a deep lore so I'll keep playing. I think I've already found my favorite character, so I'll stick with that. I can guarantee that if you like arcade (pac-man with guns) games, then you'll like this game."
22826,[pog]
22827,Nice
22828,the best game ever.
22829,"Insane replay value, especially if you want ALL the achievements."
22830,"Immense replayability. I've had the game for several years, enjoy playing regularly, and still haven't come close to unlocking everything - and I actually enjoy seeing what new stuff is unlocked as I try to go through and play different ways. Great way to kill some time and have fun while you do it."
22831,"Edmund McMillen...

22834,"It's currently the Fourth of July at the time of writing this review. Ths Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is 33% off, with the summer sale and all.

What reason do you have not to buy it.

I only have about 23.5 hours in this game but I think it's very worth your time, so much more time if you get all the DLC.

Sadly, I did not become back my money. :("

Since I bought the game it was and is very fun and intriguing, I really like the newest DLC, it buffed and nerfed some items, even though I feel sorta bummed out by the nerfs, i still respect the change of items, it made the game less of a hold-the-R-button-to-get-a-good-item-and-win. Although the game does have some flaws I still really adore the game."

22889,"[h1]My Favorite Rogue-Lite Game[/h1]
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is my favorite rogue-lite game of all time.

Check my Steam profile. No other single-player game has kept my attention for so long. I wish other developers and rogue-lite games could achieve this sort of standard.

The game is fun to play, and there is so much to do and learn about the game.

The game can quite hard. But for me, that is what makes it so much fun to play.

Every time you beat the game, you unlock something new.

[list]
[*]Harder final bosses
[*]Harder characters to play
[*]Fun and interesting challenges to complete
[*]New Items
[/list]

This game will hold your attention for a very long time if you like it.

The music is also amazing! I love the music Ridiculon has made for the game. I own the soundtrack on Bandcamp.

My only complaint is the art style of the game is a bit odd and off-putting sometimes. 

But it is something I just have grown to live with as I enjoy playing the game so much.

[b]LInux Support[/b]
The game had great Linux support up to the final update. Repentance.

But for some reason, the developers decided to not release that final update with Linux support. I am slightly disappointed by this.

Thankfully the game and all updates work well with Proton. So I now play the game with Proton.

I had no issues getting my controller to work with the game and no tinkering was needed.

I played the game with Ubuntu Mate 20.04."

22908,"Coming from the PS4 version of the game where I have over 1k hours of gameplay, this is by far one of the best ways to spend an hour and get absolutely no-where, it's purely addictive once you get the hang of the difficulty, and a great game to hot-seat with your friends to see how far you can get in each randomly generated level, or if you're really up for a challenge, playing one of the built in seeds to push your skills to the limits can be very rewarding. If difficult games are your thing, you'll absolutely love this!"

22917,"So many issues are brought with the increased speed of enemy bullets and movement. No consideration has been given to how the game should be rebalanced with these changes in mind. Standard 1.00 player speed is now too slow in comparison, meaning successful runs are often dependant on increased movement speed buffs. Which you might think are quite common but with so many items now added to the game, it's just bloated and unbalanced.

There is so much unfair damage now that 80% of runs are simply not enjoyable. They're a chore. This wasn't the case with previous expansions. With unavoidable damage being much worse in this expansion, I can't recommend this game anymore. The Devs have shown no interest in adjusting the gameplay any further and are seemingly ignorant to the issues now in place.

Over 700 hours and previously 100% before you ask."

22966,"roguelike peak, this is the type of game youd play for 600 hours and still find new items and shit to do, the amount of content that is in this game is absolutely insane, from items, characters and bosses, TBOI always has someting new for you to discover

the synergies in this game are amazing, and my favorite part of the game, it makes every run special, its extremely fun seeing yourself turn into a demi-god because you picked up a mushroom, and really helps the replayability of this game

the characters and bosses are awesome, unlocking a new character is so rewarding even if the character isnt the best, and the bosses are so fun, and tougher ones are such a rush

some of the bosses arent the best designed, and some of the items are actually dogshit, but this game is absolutely worth it, buy it, its awesome"

It's really annoying that Edmund created literally all of the dlcs for mac, and the second he made repentance (which, I may add, is the one that adds the most stuff to the game), he was just like ""lol no."" The worst part is that I was really hoping to play co-op with my friend, who is on a windows computer. Please, Edmund, your game is awesome, and if you could make repentance for mac, that would make the game so much better.

Its iconic, whats not to love. a game that keeps you on your toes and now with repentance adds a new layer of difficulty the game was really missing. frustrating, sometimes in the good way, sometimes in the bad way, either way a win still feels good as hell and grinding the game is really fun.

23066,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: ""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!""

""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again, the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""

""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.

One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""

""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.

""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!""

""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

23075,"I'm pretty confident saying it's the best roguelike out there. Runs vary from frustrating to absurd in the best possible way. There are so many items that most people will be unlocking them for years, and many unlocks change future runs in significant ways. The art style and character/enemy design are gross and excellent.

Repentance fixed a lot of itemisation problems, and it feels like a balanced and fun game. It could use a bit of love post-release (Birthright half-works, tainted Lazarus is just bad), but I think it is coming."

23093,"Since BoI is a roguelike, it's obviously not for everyone. But if you happened to be a fan of the genre, it's definitely a must have.
 
Pros: 
-Creative and various in every way. Plenty of items, enemies, room types, bosses and secrets. And with all the current DLCs ~700 achievements. 
-Great artistic aspects, nice pixel arts, and music
-Really few game mechanical problems or bugs
-Takes a lot of time to max out

Cons:
-Takes way too much time to max out. 
-After a while it gets DLC dependent, since most of the bugs and mechanical problems are fixed by DLCs. But they are very good so whatever
-Really vague control over your runs. Sometimes you are a demigod one-hitting every enemy, and sometimes you are so shit you spend half of your life againts one boss

Overall the cons aren't that bad, you can notice these after 250-300 hours, but by that time it really doesn't matter, because you get better at the game, and start enjoying it maybe even more, because it constantly gives you new content by achievements."

23151,"This game is amazing, you should buy it if you can.
Its a small game (Around 500 mb)
The story is amazing and will give you many hours of gameplay."

23153,good
23154,"this is a game with many flaws.

i have a bunch of issues with this game but even though it is flawed
its fun as hell and i all reccomend yall to play it"
23155,I hate this game
23156,"Binding of Isaac is a game that allows you to become the most deformed monstrosity you could ever hope to be, and somehow you're desensitized to it because it is filtered through the scope of a child battling his inner and exterior demons in a never ending labyrinth of increasingly unsettling foes. This game will take more of your time than you wish to admit. I wish I couldn't see my time played."
23157,buy it
23158,Awesome game for many hours

23160,"haha, isaac mother beat him me laugh!"
23161,"My doctor told me to stop playing this game at risk of raising my blood pressure to critical levels. 
10/10 health hazard"
23162,"Amazing rogue-like game, would highly recommend to anyone. Great for any type of gamer, whether you are a one or done kind of player or a 100% completionest kind of player, this game is for you."
23163,not homo
23164,s'good
23165,Turns out I hadn't even beat Mother 10 hours in.
23166,The fact that your main weapon is literally your tears should tell you everything you need to know about it.
23167,good
23168,good game mald
23169,part of me hated the game because of its lore/story
23170,"its okay, not a lot of replayablity to be honest.  At most you could play this game for 10 hours then uninstall it."
23171,Best game ever
23172,Yes
23173,fun game with endless replayability
23174,"farts, blood, and tears"
23175,best game of my life
23176,"really really good game, honestly. it's just a shame that the dlc costs so much. i only have Afterbirth but it's still a blast and i don't mind my game being outdated"
23177,why that mf eye sac always crying
23178,solid game with seemingly endless hours of play i just got this game on my computer after playing rebirth and I absolutely love these games
23179,it good
23180,hard as fuck but rewarding 10/10
23181,"Very long lasting, I recommend easily. DLC is worth it if you like the base game and wish it was to be expanded on, especially up to Repentance that has Tainted Characters. WARNING: WORKSHOP USUALLY ONLY WORKS FOR AFTERBIRTH+ AND BEYOND TO MY KNOWLEDGE. Game is not for the faint of heart however, and is not something easily picked up. Knowing items is one half, the other is PURE RNG. If you find yourself liking the game, its ability to be replayed over and over again is immense."
23182,"A lot of game to learn, a lot of fun to be had."
23183,"Its like anal without the lube, or the consent."
23184,vary much good

23189,"Thee best rogue-like game I have ever played. Every run is vastly different and there is always something new to try for.
"
23190,"If somehow you're unaware, The Binding of Isaac is a procgen twin-stick shooter that uses tears as a weapon. great game definitely pick it up"
23191,"The OG, and still the best, roguelike."
23192,i mean i've played this game for 437 hours at time of this writing...i play it kinda raw...i dont look up what things do like my pals do...i always forget what things do.....it either works out or i die like a lil diaper baby....i play it once or twice a day and it sometimes makes me feel like a farkin boss
23193,"I think the number of hours I've sunk into this game says everything, no? 

The variety of enemies, the number of items, and the potential synergies between said items are just staggering, and I can't imagine what it must be like for a newcomer at this point to be faced with all the information that they have to learn.. I started with the original game, and even then, there was a bit of a learning curve before things finally clicked. With this updated vision + numerous DLCs, I'd recommend watching some LPs by bisnap to get a feel for the game as you're learning it.

An absolute value in terms of dollar to hours of enjoyment here."
23194,
23195,good game
23196,"I like this game, I don't think anything is too unbalanced and if you're decently lucky you can get some pretty good builds. It also has mod compatibility allowing for tons of other experiences and changes which helps add some replay value (even though it has tons of replay value as it is.)"

23213,"This game is insanely good, everything is so detailed and amazing. 100/10"
23214,"It's horrifyingly messed up but really entertaining and fun. I'd suggest playing it for yourself! Be careful though, I'd suggest not watching a single thing on youtube, It's better playing eithout spoilers."
23215,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Good gaem."
23237,"Lives up to the name, a little repetitive but still a great game 10/10 masterpiece in my book"
23238,What appears to be a really simple roguelike ends up being one of those games that you'll spend hours on the wiki for
23239,
23240,just nice :D
23241,"Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. ""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved."" ""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."" ""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."" ""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else."" ""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below."

23304,"This game is just amazing.
It has tremendous replay value. It is a little graphic at times, and the game is a little gross, but besides that it is great. It is a dungeon crawler with RNG rooms."
23305,its ok
23306,"dude my first 15 hours came from playing this on multiplayer with someone on their account, its a damn good game, get it if you love jesus"
23307,"I love this game, its never the same twice and for me it never gets old. Unfortunately it wont open anymore and crashes every time I try to boot it up. (I have afterbirth+, not repentance) I talked to a couple people I know about it and they looked through some things and decided it wasn't an issue with my computer, but rather the game. I uninstalled the game and all of the mods for it and still no luck. I also tried running it as admin and through GEforce. Any other game works very well with my computer, but for some reason Binding Of Isaac won't anymore. Its a shame considering this is currently my favorite game. If anyone has any tips, that would be awesome.

Bought Repentance and now it doesn't happen anymore, so that's cool."

23329,my god this game is so fun but so tedious its like you want to take a break but its to fun and im only on rebirth not  after birth or repentance

23345,great game to squirm to
23346,"One of the best indie games I own. The diverse selection of characters and challenges to choose from makes it hard to get bored. There's so many items that you can collect in this game. You can collect items as you go to make you stronger and stronger. You get to choose what major bosses you want to fight near endgame (later on in the game). This game may be cheap, but the gameplay and story sure aren't. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is wanting to get into indie games. Easy to play once you get the hang of it, fun to mix and match different items to see whats the best combo for you in your battles."

23362,I've been playing isaac since rebirth and the repentance dlc is very different from ab+. I like most changes. The devs definitely cracked down on breaks. I dont like that demon beggars and donation machines can't be double hit anymore. The synergies have been improved significantly which is paramount to a game like isaac so i am very excited to continue playing repentance to discover the new content as well as the new synergies.
23363,"[b] A complex, grinding, and adventurous journey in an arcade game that just leads deeper into the basement. [/b]

This game is great to play in one's free-time, and here is my synopsis of why:

[u] Pros: [/u]
 + Has a neat perspective in arcade gaming, in which many mathematical equations are used to determine speed, damage, size, and etc.. What makes this different-- is how these equations factor into larger known parts of gameplay, such as momentum in movement of objects/the player and overall survivability.
 + The game literally has infinite replayability: it's an indie arcade game with thousands of different variables which can lead to billions of possible combinations for each playthrough.
 + There is a storyline... eureka! Uniquely, this game utilizes a background storyline which eventually meets its end in The Binding of Isaac: Repentance... I won't spoil anything.
 + Great audio and soundtrack-- although I feel like the music can be redundant at times, there's always the satisfaction of entering the Cathedral stage, fighting certain bosses, and more.
 + RNG, RNG, RNG. This game is absolutely packed with RNG-based gameplay. This makes every run a unique one.
 + Soo many achievements... it truly is unbearable. I don't have to explain this.
 + Great artwork and visuals. This game is full of unique textures and art, literally there is nothing more satisfying and equally terrifying than meeting a boss for the first time or other enemies.
 + There are tons of mods that allow for the game experience to be expanded.

[u] Cons: [/u]
 - The game is RNG-based. Although this acts as a pro as well, the issue with RNG is that it is immensely possible to receive many unfortunately difficult or unfair combinations of items. Expect to play sets of levels over and over again with tough luck. 
 - There are rare visual glitches. Not sure if it's just me, but randomly throughout a set of levels, creep (trails of fluids) and pebbles will lose their textures (becoming replaced with no texture markings).
 - The game is redundant in many aspects. In a normal game, finding treasure, fighting enemies, and etc. tends to be the same after you've already found out what to do. 
 - You need to buy the dlcs, in order to get the full storyline and aspects of the game.

This is my take on an awesome game to play. I may have missed some aspects, so sorry if I have. I recommend this game, so that you enjoy a journey of violent satisfaction if you choose to purchase this game."

23386,"The original Binding of Isaac is probably almost singlehandedly responsible for the explosion of roguelike games in the 2010s, and for good reason. Rebirth is an improvement over the original in every regard. It's easy to get sucked in, exploring the hundreds of unique item synergies in the game and trying to reach every ending as every character. And despite the perhaps immature gross-out humor and sacrilegious imagery, the game has some pretty interesting themes, dealing with trauma, family, sin, and shame in a surprisingly sensitive manner. One of my all-time favorites."
23387,i hate this game!!! it is fun
23388,"This is one of my favorite roguelikes of all time.

Every run feels unique for a long time, mostly because you'll keep unlocking new items, rooms, events, and playable characters throughout your gameplay. Once that starts to get a little stale, you can visit the workshop and start installing mods. Sadly, most of the mods require one or more DLCs to function, but at least all the major mods are of great quality."
23389,250 hours and only 50% of achievements. Still the gold standard of roguelikes
23390,dont abuse children or they will kill you
23391,pretty good
23392,.
23393,"Buy the game or I wont will kill your family

My last review got banned...."
23394,"Easily the best roguelike on the market, it has such a high skill ceiling but simple mechanics, making it fun for hours, and it has the most content out of any other game like it. So many items, so many possibilities, so many characters, so many runs.  There is never a dull moment and the game is always surprising and astronomically different every playthrough. It's the perfect game for somebody who is a fan of the genre, and someone is drained out by other roguelikes becoming repetitive."
23395,it really makes you FEEL like you want to become back your money.
23396,Good game would recommend

23405,"When I think about the phrase ""endlessly replayable"", this game certainly comes to mind. The Binding of Isaac spins you a new adventure with every new run, and it provides hundreds upon hundreds of achievements to pursue. Only the strongest and most dedicated players will ever be able to 100% this game, while at the same time, you can experience the entire story and unlock all the endings with a much more modest investment of a dozen hours or so. For the best experience, one must certainly also get the DLC; Repentance's balance and new content should be the new standard for DLC, improving on what was already the greatest roguelite of all time."

23495,"good game, very good game"
23496,This game will MESS. YOU. UP. This ain't your mother's videogame. This game is only for hardcore manly men who can swallow glass and kick your ass. You'd have a better chance at breaking a window with a pillowcase than beating a single run without any damage. Good luck soldier and make sure to keep your brimstone close at all times.
23497,"Its meh
"
23498,Great game. Even better with the improved local co-op.
23499,"Idk... kinda fun from time to time, but I'll never be a serious player. Seems like the kind of game that some people would love beyond all reason, but most people would ""meh"" at. Yeah, it's kinda fun and pretty morbid, and yeah, there are tons of little upgrades you can get... and yes, it's fairly hilarious. You'll definitely get a few really good giggles out of this. But... I don't know. I kinda get tired of feeling like I've got no room to move around, being swarmed by enemies, and dying over and over.

Like, again, it's NOT a BAD game, and it IS fun to play from time to time. The fact that your weapon is your tears, that there's poop literally everywhere, that you're essentially out on a quest to kill your mom, and so on.. the morbidity, the violence, the insanity... yes, again, it is NOT A BAD GAME. (That's why I gave it a recommend) I just... can't feel like it's something I look back and think, ""My life is so much better for having purchased this.""

So yeah IDK. This might be your cup of tea. I've seen YouTube videos of people loving the crap out of this game. You might sink endless hours into playing this. But me? After the initial ""woot woot"" of getting a new game wore off, and after I had exhausted my fascination with the morbid and humorous elements of the game... I will quietly uninstall this, and maybe re-install down the road to re-visit it.

Wait until it's on sale.. that's my advice. (Or watch some YouTube videos to see if this game is your kind of thing. And if the atmosphere of the game - the morbid humor, violence, etc - is what attracts you, maybe remember that gameplay also plays a critical element in enjoying a game. Be ready to die over and over.)"

In 2014 I pre-ordered Rebirth and was waiting for release in the middle of the night. I beat it and again got all the achievements. I was not able to play it for years, but recently got back to it and now discovering all the new stuff that last three DLCs brought in. It will take some time, but I know I will beat it again. For almost ten years it's been my favorite game and it will stay way that for years!"

23562,"It's boring and the fighting style is edgy. I'm confused on why this game is highly rated. If you're looking for good roguelike gameplay there's better choices out there, especially in 2021 where the genre has popped off. The story is niche as it's a crazed christian mother (relateable by as an extreme). The combat is what really bored me. It's a 4 directional system where you shoot a teardrop projectile every second or so. Where upgrading it will make it more powerful. It's a barebones system, where there's better games out there for a more appealing combat.

I realize the game is older and probably didn't age well, but if you're reading this nowadays. There's just better games out there go play Hades, Noita, Enter the Gungeon, Into the Breach, Monster Train, or SNKRX. Other games just feel like they put more effort into creating an interesting world and combat systems than this game."

So when we get out of the monsters it is very fun but the monsters are struggling on. So when The Binding Of Isaac came out I proceeded to not play it nor purchase it because it was not with the monster sections ):< I believe this game could be great as long as it had the game. 10/10

Game's story revolves around an abused child running from his mother, and the game contains 16 endings (without any DLC)

Would recommend if you also enjoy ripping your hair out in large bunches or constantly feeling as though you're ""this"" close to winning only to have it ripped away from you faster than my dad with a line of coke. 100/10.

10/10 game.
By far the best.

P.S. Buy the DLC it is literaly 1000000% worth it."
23643,very good
23644,"Very fun, deeply flawed. Frustrating, cryptic, poorly explained... You literally need mods or a wiki to understand certain things in the game. Cause they make no sense. 

It's good for many people, but god this final DLC was not complete. Needs work.

23679,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and all of it's DLC are all most definitely worth the money and I would 100% recommend the game for anyone who even slightly enjoys the rougelike genre or if you just really like games that feature a naked baby running around in a basement as the protagonist.

23699,one of the best games ever made. highly recommended!
23700,yes I suggest this game it's cool
23701,"This game is pure gold, there are so few games as good as this, so much to do, or not do, or do with cheats, just anything. Edmund, I don't know how you did it, but you did it well, that's for sure."
23702,"Ooh, this game. This game makes me rage, scream and feel sorry for the main character, all at the same time.

This game is a fun rogue-like game, but if you look deeper.. you find a dark and depressive story. 
I won't spoil ANY of it for you, but it gives a creepy tone to it's plot.

If you enjoy rogue-likes like these, GIVE IT A TRY! It's ever so fun and feels amazing when you complete that one part you put all your energy into. 

Not only is it mindless fun, but there is a character for everyone! With the addition of the Repentance DLC, it adds a variant of every character, being named ""Tainted"" characters.

Enemies and Bosses are so unique. Giant spiders, devils and angels, the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, the 7 deadly sins, or even fight YOURSELF!


Please give it a try if you're interested. It's so goddamn fun and I'm just trying to convince you now. Give it a go if you want to."

I recommend you to wait for a steam sale, because for the full experience you need to play repentance, the last dlc, and for that you need the previous two and the base game as well.
This game is a 9/10 just because of repentance, the game has its bugs and some characters still need to be fixed, but its still really fun, challenging, and the PERFECT roguelike, and as soon as they patch and rework Tainted Lazarus and tweak some technical stuff, this will be a solid 10/10. Also, please add a TRUE co-op that's not played via Steam remote play together, it's laggy and really unstable, takes the fun away."

23744,"Very fun when the RNG allows for it. You might get nearly 100 bad runs before you get a good one, but when everything lines up just so, demolishing boss after boss feels amazing. That sense of breaking through and destroying everything certainly makes up for the much more frequent frustrating runs that end in failure. The item combinations are a lot of fun to try out. Even if you know a lot about the game before you buy it, the experiences you get each run are much different than just watching someone else play.

23782,BEEEEST game ever
23783,"The Binding of Isaac is a fun arcade rogue-like that relies heavily on resource management, fine-tuned reflexes, and an encyclopedic knowledge of its various intricacies and item synergies. If you lack the third pillar, visiting the wiki at https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/ helps.

Edmund McMillen has shaven weeks off of my life and replaced them with poop jokes."
23784,"Ever since Binding of Isaac was released in the Flash version, I've been an avid player. Depending on my mood, and especially after new DLCs, this culminates in months-long sessions, during which I hardly touch any other game. This is also the case with the current DLC ""Repentance"".

I spent three months unlocking the newly added characters and items. Repentance is extremely satisfying, so I've made better progress than ever before. Today I beat the Ultra Greedier fight with Tainted Samson. I closed the game afterwards, shut down the PC, restarted a couple of hours later - all unlocks in the savegame are gone, even though the achievements are still in Steam.

The ability to earn unlocks is the driving force for me to play this game. Now I'm faced with the choice of unlocking everything via cheat (self-deception) or resigning myself to the fact that the work of three months was just flushed down the toilet. That such bugs still exist in the game, but no system is put in place to help players restore the precautionary backup, is an absolute slap in the face for every non-tech person, who does enjoy to earn their treats.

You can sync back your Steam achievements to your savegame by going to the stats screen (ingame) and pressing Alt-F2. This is not common knowlege, you have to know what you are looking for in order to dig it up. All completion marks (these are needed for certain unlocks), that you unlocked will still be gone!


Update: Here is how you can restore your unlocks and completion marks from the day BEFORE your savegame got corrupted:

1. Go to C:\Users\[YOURUSERNAME]\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance
2. There should be files named in the following format: 

YYYYMMDD.rep_persistentgamedata1.dat

e.g.

20210623.rep_persistentgamedata1.dat
20210622.rep_persistentgamedata1.dat

and so on.

3. Locate the file from the day BEFORE your savegame got corrupted. In my case it was ""20210622.rep_persistentgamedata1.dat"". Copy it.

4. Since this folder is only used for backups, you need to copy the uncorrupted file to the folder where the game actually loads its saves from. Unless you did a custom install for Steam it is located here: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\[STEAMID]\250900\remote

5. There should be a file name rep_persistentgamedata1.dat. Replace it with your uncorrupted savegame.

6. Done. You now have all your unlocks and completion marks, except those you earned on the day your save got corrupted.



You can't expect a non tech person to figure this out, so this review stays until we get an easy way to restore a backup."

23855,"Now I have played all the DLC and had some time to play the new DLC I have made my mind up and I have to say its such a great game now and feels like the game is just Perfect!

Its true for sure the new repentance DLC has made the game harder for sure and some of the Enemies are real dicks however it makes the game more fun and does add that extra challenge which does makes the game more fun.

I understand some people will not like the DLC but if you like Isaac and its challenge nature then you will love the full game with all the DLC/"

23864,"This game will make you rage, cry and despair... yet for some reason I can't stop playing it ever since the original game. Repentance brought back that memory of pain and suffering, yet at the same time gave a breath of fresh air after breaking the game so many times in AB+ that I felt bored of it. Yes the new content made everything harder in general, but would it really be TBoI without the challenges, surprises and hardships that make frequent players go back into the game?"

23919,"Have you ever felt like punishing yourself for being good at a game? That's how Isaac: Rebirth does it to keep it fun. ""Oh, you just finished a run of the game? Well, here's a new boss you will absolutely hate."" Now take a look at how many achievements there are :)

There is a lot to do, it's all (mostly fun) and the game is unapologetic when it comes to interactions, the fun begins when you bend those interactions to your will"
23920,"This game is honestly great, The mechanics are good and simple to use, all the enemies and bosses have super creative designs and quirks, all of the items are great and fun to use, and not to mention all the different types of synergies you can get from combining items together, which is really where this game shines.
All of the music in this game is so good, I also really love the sound design of this video game, it really fits the whole mood of the game as a whole.
The Binding of Isaac is honestly one of my favorite games of all time, there is just so many things that you can do in the game and I can never get bored of it, this game gets an 10/10 from me."

'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac', she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below."" - God"

24019,MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME! love the new items in the dlc as well. makes it feel refreshing
24020,I played Rebirth back when it launched when I was a freshmen in college and came back to it after Repentance as it was the final DLC. There has been a huge effort to 'fix' a lot of the balancing issues from Afterbirth and + and this is the best expansion of the game. BOI is an incredibly fun and addictive game thats become one of my most played games of all time. I've really enjoyed returning to it and exploring all the new content. Bravo to Edmund and the Nicalis team!
24021,you have uno dipshit it came free on your fuckeng xbox
24022,gud game
24023,Buy this game.

24026,"Incredibly fun, only starts to get boring after ~6 hours straight of playing. If you're a completionist like I am, you can get hundreds of hours out of them game; and even if you aren't I'm sure you could get at least 150 hours out of the game. Overall 10/10 one of my favorites."
24027,the video game equal to cutting yourself.
24028,i became back my money
24029,Best god damn game on the steam store.
24030,"fucking
 play it"
24031,"Banging game, so much replayability. Makes you go from feeling like a fly on the wall to a demigod. Suprisingly enjoyable to kill the same shit 100 different times 100 different ways. So many different cool endings, bosses and secret unlockable items. The story of the game is sick as well, convoluded as hell and very intricate but still adds cool reasoning for why you're a naked kid shooting tear bullets from your eyes. 100% recommend if you like getting demolished by a spider and then coming back with a big ass rainbow lazerbeam and a million fly friends for revenge."

Granted, I left my computer on a couple nights by accident, but that's still a lot of time on one game in less than a month. The only reason I even feel the need to post a review for it is that people who easily get addicted to games should take some caution before buying this one. For those people, you'll be sinking a LOT of time into this, so be prepared."

24144,"I would recommend to steer clear as a casual gamer

Its tongue in cheek troll-like sense of humour wears thin sometime around your 300th loss and the random chance mechanic is similar to gambling, with the desire to chase the odd win punctuated by 50 time-wasting losses.

It has an arduous progression punctuated by constant trial and error and a difficulty curve so brutally (and at times unfairly) punishing that it starts to eat into the fun that video games should instil.

Recent updates have added even more difficult content requiring a perfect symphony of good fortune, and extreme mechanical knowledge to allow your run to become so hopelessly overpowered to even allow you a tiny chance at taking on the final bosses (and extremely rare occurrence) coupled with runs taking even longer than they used to, thus wasting even more of the gamer's time before finally landing its death blow and forcing the gamer to start all over again. 

What reward does a victory land you? Nothing more than the reward of doing it all again, this time with characters even more teeth-grindingly balanced towards frustrating handicaps making it all even more difficult the next time.

For those who have mastered this game by putting in the thousands of hours one asks ... is it really worth it?

I have uninstalled this time-waster and would recommend the casual gamers who still play games for fun seek their enjoyment elsewhere... for little remains here anymore.

The only feeling I was left with after my 377.6 hours of this game up until this review was: 'It was not worth it, I could have spent my time elsewhere doing something more constructive'. My recommendation is that people study for their jobs and seek skills that will better their lives, doing those unenjoyable tasks are about as much fun as The Binding Of Isaac, and will serve you far more long term benefits.

In short: Don't waste your money and more importantly, your time."
24145,"Binding of issac repentance is probably one of the best DLCs i've played in a while and is well worth the money, repentance adds loads of new content including new items, synergies bosses and even new floors, gameplay feels more fun and balanced compared to afterbirth and overall is just satisfying to play, my only gripe with the game now is the existance of delirum, but perhaps I just have a skill issue.
this game is great please buy it"
24146,"Honestly the greatest game ever created, that is regarding replayability. If you just wanna melt down and sink some hours into a great game, this is the one. I love you Edmund."

I completed everything in game,

The challenging
The boring
The Fair
The Unfair
and THE UNFAIR 

Unless you are clinically insane and have an urge to complete EVERYTHING... this game is 100% pure, refined fun and I would recommend it. Just dash into the game no matter if you are a casual or an epic gamer with no life.. There so much to do and so many mods to install if you want them."

24188,"Do I even need to say anything about this game?

Do I really? Fine, Fine, I guess i'll write a review. (im starting a new thing now where I actually care about writing a good review :O)

Many people know what this game is. Baby Cry and he cry at enemies!!! Oh my god!!!
But this game is so much more than that just simple concept. Edumund and his team, ESPECIALLY with the most recent expansion, Repentance, have really squeezed everything they can out of this, and who knows? Theres much more people can do with how moddable the game is.

What amazes me more however is how such a simple concept for a rougelike can have such a interesting Lore around it. Issac is a kid whos identity-conflicted, is abused, and dosent know whether he is a demon meant to be punished or, himself. I wont give away alot, as you will want to actually play the game to actually learn the lore, and im not about to spoil this 50$ game for you.

I say 50$ beacuse at this point, who is gonna play this without Repetance?

Speaking of which, the game play from previous versions has been improved greatly with Repentance. Many items are balanced out so they arent total doodoo poopoo or make you a living god among men who smiteth whomst've cometh in thine path. The new items as well are just so much fun to discover and play with, as well as the 2 new characters (Execpt Jacob and Esau fuck Jacob and Esau).

Event better, there are even MORE than just 2 new characters that I cant get into here, as again, spoiler territory. But everything thats been jammed and improved into this game, the new floors, rooms, enemies, bosses, and music is just the best ive seen out of a rougelike in awhile.

Would I say its the very very best? No. Sometimes you die unfairly, and every death is met with a note that tells you how you died and really hammers it in. Some enemies are just plain annoying to deal with early game if your going to be speedy, as they run away from you in a fashion just to erratic to understand.

And I get it, this game is MEANT to be hard, but some of these things just feel hard to.. well, be hard. Hard is meant to be challenging, not Hard. (yes I know what I said)

The only thing I feel upset about is the lack of easter eggs that arent in the form of items or secret rooms, such as I am Error rooms. Theres no big easter egg mystery that keeps the community looking around for clues, theres no super duper rare room with a unique enemy in it that gives you anything cool. But then again, thats not always a nessecary thing.

Overall, The Binding of Issac gets...

8/10 Gameplay
9/10 Music
3/10 Secrets/Easter Eggs
10/10 Lack of Bugs/Glitches
10/10 Addictive"
24189,"I have over 2k hours over 3 consoles and two PCs playing this goddamn game and I'm still not even close to unlocking everything.

24201,"It's a golden standard for roguelikes for a reason. 
The difficulty is brutal but fair, good item combinations make you feel like a god, progression is satisfying as hell. The 30 hours I have on it so far is literally nothing, I barely scratched the surface of the content it has - and that's just the base game without the 3 DLCs. 
Presentation wise, the usage of heavy-handed themes in this game is pretty much legendary by this point. It looks and sounds both gorgeous and unsettling, and I love it for that.
A game well made. Go play it."
24202,I like to cry.
24203,"This game is very fun, although it can get repetitive and pretty frustrating once you've reached a certain point. Luckily, that point is far from when you first play the game. 10/10 would recommend."
24204,"The best roguelike of all time, and one of the best games of all time.
Extremely accessible, with a very high skill ceiling, with genuinely tens of thousands of hours of content.
Repentance, the final DLC, has completely tied the experience together into an ultimate masterpiece. 

I suggest either getting the base game, or all DLC's, as Afterbirth on it's own is not worth it."

You might get frustrated with the game, but you'll never, ever get bored."

24242,amazingness in a single purchase
24243,idk
24244,"an awesome game, would recommend to everyone"
24245,"I have a love hate relationship with this game. It has a great story, great replay value, and most importantly amazing gameplay. The game is quite challenging, to the point where i have taken month long breaks over deaths like being telefragged by the boss ""Delirium"" or losing an hour long run to a black spider on a room with a completely black floor. But despite all of this I always comeback to play some more. The game has around 36 characters (if you count the seceret ""Tainted"" variations) all of these characters have a post it note beside them on the character selection screen that shows your completion marks on that character. The main goal of the game (in my opinion) is to fill out every post it note on every character which obviously can take a huge amount of time. The game has plenty of achievements you can hunt for alongside trying to fill out the completion marks. This game will leave you extremely frustrated when you lose a good run and will make you feel cool as hell when you get an amazing run and steamroll everything in your path.

24324,"I've been into The Binding of Isaac series since around 2013 or so. With about 500 hours between the original flash version and the PC version of Rebirth+DLC (plus probably over 500 hours on console), I absolutely recommend it. Rebirth will leave you feeling satisfied and each DLC will make you even more satisfied with quality of life changes and lots of new content. If you are weary about getting everything at once, I recommend holding out. In my opinion, the DLC is meant to be enjoyed one at a time. If you're new to Isaac, I wouldn't dive headfirst into Repentance. The most I would say to go with is just Afterbirth. This game will leave you with memories of great items and combos. The amount of excitement I get when I see ""that"" item that just helps me out a lot on my run is such a good feeling. 10/10"

I instantly fell in love with it, and I remember even playing the demo for hours just to try and beat Mom within the demo's time limit. 

Fast forward to now, and it became this huge, roguelike that I still play and love. This game has been through so much, and it feels nice to see its transformation from that small demo to what it is now. There's even much more content to explore again because of the new DLC. Binding of Isaac is pretty much the game that got me into indie games, and I'm so happy to see it become a masterpiece. 1000000/10"

Between the music, the sheer variety of runs, the story that it tells, or just simply how addicting it is to watch my little boy Isaac goon around in the basement for hours on end. Highly recommended. So much time spent already, and I'm nowhere near done with the game. Insane replayability, insane value. 

Honestly ruined roguelite's for me. I've played nearly every major one there is, and Isaac still comes out on top.

24403,i love the challenge and all the different items you can get and different builds u get with the items and its been my favorite game since the start of middle school and still is my favorite even now
24404,"good

24405,"Excellent game, has a lot of bad items and weird design decisions which make some runs feel like a waste of time. But the thought and care put into this game is immense, Edmund and crew really put the time and effort to make this and it shows.
However, really questionable for precious item gets are just like niche stuff like kamikaze and evil charm or like or in general run ruiners like glass shards and Isaac's heart.  But god runs feel SO good, sacred heart and psy fly, if you know what you're doing, will usually hard carry you. You always feel invincible but the game will kick you in the balls if you're not careful and respect the mechanics.

It also takes a lot of knowledge, experience, patience to deal with bullshit runs/rooms but after 39 failed runs, that one successful run feels AMAZING. Some characters I hate but playing them makes you grow a little. Jacob and Esau suck but at least you're rewarded with good items for getting there with them. My final challenge will most likely be tainted Lost, haven't beaten anything yet with them...
After beating Mom the first time, the item description mod is your best friend.

Would recommend, but only if you like hardcore rogue, as of writing this, this is of one the greatest ""rogue likes"" you could buy especially since the game+dlc are cheap base price. I would say it sets the bar for the genre and other games should look to this for inspiration. 

Worth it full price, even better on sale.

24455,"I reset my two save files to give the game more hours after Repentance dropped because goddamnit is the game that good. Classic must-play for people who like action roguelikes, or challenging roguelikes, or action games in general. It's easy to lose hours to this game with all the content that unlocks throughout the game; you constantly want to try new things and play new characters and it doesn't even matter you die half the time, you're having fun learning about all of it, all the poop to cry on and all the awesome combos and just everything. Expect to play literally hundreds of hours of this game and some bouts of intense sweating to get all items and achievements. Just buy it if you want to play it, even if you don't buy the DLC right away. Also the OST is good; the basement theme gets stuck in my head sometimes and not in the annoying way."
24456,I chewed my steak too fast 
24457,"This game has an excellent gameplay, the dungeons are pretty similar to TLOZ a link to the past.

The game is hard but very entertaining and a shit ton of items, this game has a lot of replay value, so you wont get bored of this until you reach 4000+ has, this game reminds me when i played the first zelda game inside smash bros brawl, it was very fun and after that i emulated 
A link to the past.

No run will ever be the same as the last with the map always changing between each run and with tons of playable characters to play you'll always have something to do.

-Do you like difficult and challenging games?

If you answered yes to all (or at least most) of these, then The Binding of Isaac is the game for you"

24491,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on an Isaac. Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That was, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac. 'Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac.' 'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac. Go into his Isaac, and end his Isaac, as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac', she replied, grabbing an Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac, watching through an Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around his Isaac to find an Isaac, he noticed an Isaac to the Isaac, hidden under his Isaac. Without Isaac, he flung open the Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac, and threw himself down into the unknown Isaacs below."

24496,Decent
24497,jogo bão
24498,A fun combination of cute and spooky. It also bashes organized religion.
24499,"The Binding of Isaac is an challenging top down twinstick roguelite. Each run you select from a pool of unlocked characters, during which you will face down a ramdomized series of rooms each filled with enemies, or treasure and tools to make you more powerful. At the end of each of these floors is a boss you will need to defeat to continue to the next floor. Doing so will grant you another treasure, and if you did well enough on the floor you might get the chance to make a deal..
All of this culminates in a battle against your own mother for your survival. As you manage to beat each run with different characters the game will grow more challenging but you will also gain more powerful items in return, and new characters too. 
The game features a heavy focus on challenge, interesting items combining to become more powerful, a broad selection of enemies, branching paths to different endings, multiple difficulties and game modes and a diverse pool of characters to play as each with different playstyles. 

Soundtrack is incredibly well done by Ridiculon handling the music. I highly recommend using a good pair of headphones for this game if you have them, the tracks for this game are top notch.

TLDR. 10/10 If you like roguelikes/lites buy this game it's a standout of the genre. I've played over two hundred hours at the time of this review and barely scratched the surface."

24521,dis game is so adictin i luv  it
24522,A great game that you can play when you have small time windows.
24523,It's almost criminally under-priced for how much content you get.
24524,"In my opinion one of the very best games out there. Through the release of massive expansions since its release, the game has managed to stay both entertaining and challenging. Since the release of Repentance I've had a surge of enthusiasm to play the game again, and I love all the weird and funny stuff I am discovering on almost every run."
24525,"Great game, ridiculous pricing.
I thought about getting the 'full version' after repentance essentially being an upgraded 'Antibirth', but I guess I won't be getting it, since I'm not willing to pay 33,50 euro for a game I already own, and would only give me access to
Afterbirth: Probably a decent expansion pass.
Afterbirth+: A large selection of mods, but poor content aside from it.
Repentance: The thing I want, but in the end is just Antibirth but slightly improved.

24534,yes
24535,"This is one of the best games i've played. There's so much to do and there's limitless ways to play. Its a very simple game thats one gigabyte, and you can add as much as you want with mods. You can have custom seeds where you can play for the fun of it. Normal, for basic BOI. Hard for a harder experience. And greed where its basically a boss and enemy rush. Im pretty new to the community and i've just got into this game. Playing with your friends and messing with them is very fun. Its one of the best purchases i've ever made. 10/10"
24536,Insane good game. The best part is that you can play this game over and over and over and get unique runs every single time. 600+ Achievements and I haven't even gotten half with my playtime.

24589,"I recommend the game, but not because its particularly good, but it is a challenge. Expect to learn a LOT of items and constantly play with 6 tabs of wiki pages open and search for items to find out what they do. The game itself tells you shit and there are sooo many bad items in this game that can fuck up your run and it is straight annoying. The RNG is insane, nothing like Hades, were you get upgrades most of the time and can choose your playstyle. Here you need to adapt constantly and there are (at least for me) straight runs that are unwinnable. So don´t expect a fun game, but try it if you want a challenge and get mad."

24731,"This game was one of the most fun rollercoasters I've been on from start to finish. The mix of luck and skill creates a really engaging and solid experience. The majority of boss fights and enemies feel fair to fight with all characters. Although sometimes the chaoticness of the game can result in imbalanced runs, such as lagging the game with items like Trisagion + Pop, only getting HP Ups, or reducing your movement speed to 0.2 which can cause unavoidable damage from fast moving/shooting enemies. Despite this, there is an insane amount of fun item synergies such as Rocket in a Jar + Dr. Fetus, C Section + Spirit Sword or Ludovico Technique + Brimstone, I would highly recommend experiencing these synergies yourself. 

Additionally, there are many min-maxing strategies you could use to improve your odds of a winning run such as playing donation machines or sacrifice rooms. All characters since the latest patches are actually fun to play now with characters such as Lazarus, ???, T. Jacob and T. Laz getting much needed reworks in order to make playing them not feel like a slog. The artwork and music is excellent and the modding community made many high quality graphics, quality of life changes, and unique custom content such as items and characters. 

Been playing this game for a few years and recently got dead god at the time of this review, it was worth all the hours it took and the game was definitely worth its price. If you want a randomized, chaotic yet fun game, I would definitely recommend picking up Isaac with all the DLC. However the game is a bit expensive so if you don't want to buy this roguelike for full price, wait for a sale, it usually goes on one every now and then."
24732,biblically accurate 10/10 cant wait for the rapture

24739,Give henry what he deserves he shouldve been the replacement for dogma. That being said I don't own the dlcs on pc or a full hour on pc but on my xbox i have afterbirth with afterbirth + and too many hours. I suggest you get this game with at least afterbirth and afterbirth + because it is truly a great experience and a joy ride. 10/10 also give Henry his true ability's back you know he is god incarnate and too powerful for isaac to handle. Or just make a familiar of him that is just a montezumas revenge blast but without the corn.
24740,Very awesome and fun :)
24741,game sucks dont play it
24742,"Now I have a lot to say about this game but I won't say it all here. This game is super unfair while also being super fun, Overall I think it's a great game."

24744,the rarest enemy in the game is a poop named henry.
24745,i installed the crewmate plum mod and now the voices won't stop
24746,this game sucks
24747,"This game may be hard to understand, and with the large amount of Items, it can be very confusing. After you play for a while and look up the wiki, you begin to get a feel for the game. I would heavily suggest getting the DLCs with the game, because it will enhance the experience you get while playing the game. Also make sure to watch a few beginner guides."
24748,i real;lty  liek thebinding of isaac repetnmnave because of the alot of tuiems and very ahrd abosses but also tainrted jacobn >:(((((((((((((
24749,"Alright, I take my negative review back.

Turns out that if you beat mom's heart legitimately with any character once, you can use whatever mods you want and still get achivements and unlocks.

Thus, the fun becomes limited only by it being Issac, and by whatever the modders have uploaded."
24750," still the best rouguelike i've played

repentance made this even better"
24751,Look at the amount of hours I have played and believe me when I say that this game is addicting. Truly one of the greatest rogue-like video games ever made.

24758,Great game must getter!
24759,"this game has pretty much endless amount of fun, and its not as hard as its prequel making it a great entry for anyone looking to get into rouge likes, though there are alot of trigger warnings like gore, self harm, religious fanaticism BUT if you can get past those you have an amazing game with a very sad story about a broken family and what a kid sees!"
24760,"iv'e played this game around when afterbirth came out like a few minutes but when repentance came out i played so much of this game. i love the randomness and sillynes of the items. to describe it in short i will say this: 
1. get a shit item
2. proced to reset the game for 100 times
3. get an op item and die to the dross boss
4. restart
5. play as azazel
6. profit :)"

24777,"The new enemies, floor layouts, and pathing obstacles have made it incredibly difficult to unlock the d6 for Isaac to start with now. I've spent over 200 of my last attempts trying and I've only made it to Isaac a few times. ??? should start with the soul heart creator. Some of the new boss fights include a bit of bullet spamming and lack of area to move around in due to hazards like fire, holes in the ground, narrow hallways, and toxic poop. Achieving 100% was difficult before, now it includes winning the national lottery odds."
24778,hi
24779,fuck yeah
24780,"Polished enough to be called a sequels worth of improvement upon the original, Rebirth is a remake of Binding of Isaac in a shiny new engine. It runs smoothly at 60 FPS, there are loads of quality of life improvements, new content(especially with the DLC) and design elements like new enemies, room modifiers, soundtrack, graphics and so on. It really is a brand new Isaac with all the numerous pros and a few heavy cons straight from the original. 

BoI is about a naked crying boy who shoots tears at body horror cartoons in dungeons of poop. I won't lie, the release of the original BoI turned me off of it for about two weeks before I tried it. It's a great game and also a pretty disgusting one at a glance. Isaac lives alone with his mother on a hill, she goes insane, he dives into the cellar to escape her and it gets metaphysical from there. Despite the initial juvenile experience the storytelling is pretty well done and there's a good deal of comedy to lighten things up. It's a light twin-stick shooter rogue-like with dungeon crawling heavily inspired by the original Legend of Zelda. Enemies are all vicious little monsters constantly rushing and shooting at you and greater challenges graduate to bullet hells. Resource and risk management is crucial and the big allure of the game is the hundreds of power-ups that modify things. Combined with the randomized dungeon layout and the dozens of bosses and enemies makes every run feel new, especially as you unlock items and things change. Experimentation is key and usually a joy. Many Isaac players remember fondly those ascendant runs where all the right power ups appeared and they gleefully obliterated their foes with moisturized laser streams.

If you enjoyed the original BoI or are wondering how to start then Rebirth is a fine product. I played OG BoI to near completion(rounding out Satan clears before Cathedral was added and doing a few of those) and replaying Rebirth is enjoyable. It's a very refined and improved more-of-the-same. My only gripes are longstanding ones from the original game: some of the RNG is particularly spiteful and petty, bad runs will bore you to tears(but not extra damaging ones, hence the problem), there is obtuse design at times and some design elements are so terrible the game would benefit from direct removal. There's also a few new Rebirth specific fumbles, some of the new enemies adding tedium instead of variety(Walking Hosts should be quietly deleted with a touch of private shame) or some of the new design elements not working well, such as enemies that can attack or aggressively teleport at the player from off screen in large rooms. A sight/proximity based radius would help a lot here; if I can see the enemy and he can see me, he can use his offensive leap and I can react to it.

I'd say roughly there are about four types of BoI runs. Regular runs where you take what you can get and your skill determines how far you're going. Outstanding runs where a nice wombo combo or several beneficial gains in a row place you far ahead of the power curve and you can comfortably win, only your own hubris or carelessness posing a threat. Then there are the bad runs. The boring ones. Trying to clear rooms in the second half of the game with a low damage stat. Your power-ups don't have synergy and weren't very good to begin with. You can do it. To the game's credit there is virtually nothing you can't defeat without playing better. The real problem is the last type of run, a cursed type. A ruined run. There are several items in the game that are so awkward to use or genuinely overloaded with balancing flaws that picking them up will doom you. This can happen at any point of the run, particularly well into it. Since the game leans heavily on ""do it again you idiot"" to teach there's not a reliable way to tell without memorizing these items after picking them up. Better item descriptions or item name visibility would go a long way here, perhaps a way to discard the last power-up received(this was added for trinkets!) Or just tossing things like Cursed Eye out of the game and into patch documentation. Or the dumpster, either way.

There's just a certain level of frustration that is native to the experience. You'd expect as much from anything that would call itself rogue-like but here it often happens blindly. Now in several well made games the lows help to define the experience so that the highs feel all the better. BoI does that well at times. It's just a shame how many times BoI will slam you straight into the lowest lows for want of a tooltip or daring to experiment, going against the best nature of the game. With that said I stress that Binding of Isaac is a great game, don't get me wrong. It's worth full price. It encourages dozens of replays and comfortably does so. Just be aware that sometimes the poop covered dungeon will stink."

Memorize enemy patterns, learn what items do (Also have the wiki up on a second screen).  This game is amazing and sincerely a masterpiece.  I'll be honest, I'm writing this as I am starting to get better and pick up my first big wins.  I'm invested, I'm hooked, and this game is sincerely a 10/10.

24809,"I've been playing the Binding of Isaac from day one. It's been hard, and challenging, and as every expansion came out it kept getting harder. Repentance gets dropped, I buy it. Haven't played in a few years so I expect to suck. What I didn't expect was that I didn't unlock a lot of achievements I know I got, and had the items to prove it. I tried to fix my save file to proc them.

Smash cut to 30 minutes later where the game REVERTED ALL MY DATA TO A CLOUD FILE OLD AS FUCK.

I said fuck it. Start from scratch. MAKE THE GAME ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. 

I've been running failed run after failed run to complete a blank save file in a purely rage induced stubborn plan to 100% the game ONCE AND FOR ALL.

I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE ISAAC. EVEN IF MEANS KILLING YOU AND YOUR BRETHREN A MILLION TIMES OVER JUST TO HAVE SOME ONLINE CRED."

24813,"One of the best roguelikes of the past decade. Even though your build will be pretty garbage in most runs forcing you to fight the uphill battle a lot of the time, the moment to moment mechanical depth is still pretty good, allowing for some ""on the edge of your seat"" gameplay. The guy who directs this game also has a very strange fixation on poop and worms for some reason.

24823,"The Binding of Issac will live no doubt as one of the best rouge likes to be made in recent memory. From the charming pixel art style, with a simple yet addictive game play loop, and a story with many complex themes of child abuse and religion, Binding of Issac is a fantastic experience overall. All of these also get expanded upon in all three great DLCs to the game, adding many new features and characters to mess around with. Ed Mcmillen has truly created the definition of a classic Indie game. I whole heartily would recommend this game, unless you have a life, because as seen by my hours, it sure likes to take that away."

24850,"After playing hundreds of hours on Xbox, Switch, and now PC I can say that your money goes the longest way with The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. It is one of the most replayable games you could own. Every run holds new challenges and solutions to them. As you play you unlock more items, more floors, more bosses, and more enemies which drives you even deeper into its depths. I've seen around that there are about 1k hours worth of content in the base game and each DLC adds 500 more each.

You will be given a lot of choices in your runs, every one will butterfly effect on for the entire playthrough. every bomb you trade, heart you lose, and item you choose to take will determine the future of it. As you learn how to play you will start to realize half the fun is planning ahead like 5d chess, dancing around the prospect of one item over another, finding out what items combine to give you what little edge you need for the next boss, gambling life, bombs, and money for the chance to get that ONE thing you need. Its a new puzzle every time, and it only gets better. 

The newest DLC, repentance, has taken this game to a whole new level. If you have previously played this game or own it on another console I HIGHLY recommend you pick up this version for the DLC (if not for the mods that also span thousands of hours). Repentance is basically the next Isaac game released in this one. it reworks the entire game from the ground up."

Verdict, Isaac was worth the money more then my 3080, a gem of a game."

24879,i like it and it is good to play with friends
24880,This is by far one of my favorite games of all time. It combines great elements of a rogue-lite with a challenging bullet hell full of many retro-video game and crazy bible references. I have played since the original game was released and have been more than satisfied with each expansion to pass. This final expansion has been legendary thus far and I'm just scratching the surface. If you haven't played Isaac I would recommend you do yourself a favor and buy this game.

The game is replayable, unique, difficult, and many objectives to strive for. I definitely won't say I'm a hardcore member of the fandom (as I can't play more than a couple runs in a row) but I've enjoyed this game for nearly 7 years now. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

24901,This is the best rouge game and the best DLC by far. They added so much new things and made the game more challenging like it was many years ago.
24902,just got 2 of my friends to want the game so its an amazing game go buy it for yourself.

24907,this game is awesome
24908,"Well, I impulse bought this game because several of my favorite streamers play it.  As a newcomer to the roguelike genre, I got my ass handed to me several times in my 6hrs and I expect it'll stay like that for a long time.  I like that there are a LOT of unlockables and that'll keep me hooked for a while.

I cannot stress enough that this game is hard but well worth the cost because highly replayable."

24916,"Ah yes, a child trying to escape from his mother and her obsession with god's divinity. When I played it for the first time, which was the original flash game, I was impressed with the amount of possibilities and it started my addiction to rogue-like games. After playing Rebirth for a couple of hours, I waited for Repentance and the wait  has paid off. Repentance isn't just an expensive DLC, containing the most favourite community mod but it is also a fascinating and new experience of more possibilities and even more item combinations. The sheer amount of input in the ""DLC"" shows that the developers didn't just copy and paste Antibirth but added far more complexity in their game what Antibirth didn't have and the difficulty happens to have increased five times, which can be good or bad. One thing TBoI hasn't changed is how frustrating this damn game can be..."

24921,"Ever since I first picked up The Binding of Isaac back when it was a flash game, I struggled with it. Couldn't even beat the first of the bigger bosses in the game, let alone complete a run. 
Granted, I was hella young, but there are kids everywhere able to outshine plenty of adult players as far as I know. 

These days, I feel like I'm doing decently, and this game really keeps me on my toes with its gameplay. Each run can start out pretty slow, but with decent RNG and in-game know-how you can get strong pretty quickly. 

It's a must-buy for sure! Don't even hesitate! Do the thing!"

24966,"The game is simply amazing. While the design of characters and bosses may seem childish at first, the game is actually no stranger to adult themes. I am not going to spoil it, but each ending can invoke quite the emotional response in the audience. They can personally empathize with Isaac, being raised in a heavy religious household, being trapped by the chains that is his religion, his mother. The symbolism in this game is exquisite and the gameplay is unique but creative at the same time, giving older players nostalgia to games such as Legend of Zelda. Overall, a great game and definitely recommended."
24967,I will become back my money
24968,"There was once an isaac, small and sad child cry too many... Dad leave and mother insaneo mode. grab and take and unlock many idem to play game more, make isaac stronger than mother.

25028,yes.
25029,"I don't think this expansion should get as much praise as it does. Most of the new content was from a mod, so they couldn't be bothered to create original content. They made the game harder, but they did it in a lazy way (does every single enemy need to have so much life that you have to be in the same room for 2 minutes?). Most of the new characters are pretty cool, but for some of them the mechanics are so annoying as to not be fun. 

That being said, ultimately, I don't have as much fun with Isaac as I used to. I used to look forward to unlocking achievements, but with this one, it seems more like masochism. I'm a casual player, I'm sure there are hardcore fanboys that love it, but for me, this is not a good expansion."

This game is the sole reason that I didn't say goodbye to this world, because it is the only source of happiness and fulfilment in my sad and lonely life. I have severe social anxiety (which comes from being a level 2 on the spectrum), by talking to other players in the chat i have relieved a lot of my social anxiety (even though I do still get shivers when talking to people in game chat, especially other boys)."

25063,"SPOILERS - WARNING 

Hey look a review about a great game. I wanna go over my pros and cons about this game. First off, I love the fact that this game has a huge amount of content added into this new DLC. The tainted characters are great and i have no problem with them other than a few hard challenges and a few other tainted characters. 
The biggest con of this game is the balancing. I liked having powerful runs because getting those were annoying. The only thing that really makes the game great about balancing is helping you learn patterns in boss fights. Unless if you want to talk about the fact that delirium exists and we have to deal with the idea of a boss without a pattern. And yes i know he will be getting a rework but I don't like how we're getting items balanced. We never needed item balance unless if it was absolute. Nerfing brimstone was just annoying. Any god tier items like jera and blank card are just nerfed to the floor. Holy mantle was nerfed, daddy long legs, any of your loved items were just nerfed."
25064,Ok so in the game theres this one female boss thats kinda hot they sing n shit
25065,"Although many games have in ways surpassed this in the Roguelite genre, this game remains the unquestioned peak of synergy-based gameplay. The best way to have fun in this game is to leverage whatever resources you can to make a broken combination of items, and though some combinations can make the rest of the run a complete cakewalk, most of the time getting those combinations requires a lot of resourcefulness and intuition."
25066,
25067,"Probably the game with the most replayability of all time. The amount of things to collect, unlock, fight, play with, synergize, discover and more is simply astronomical. One game you might become a literal Bomberman and start slinging bombs at people. The next you might be a flying spirit shooting soy milk at monsters. If you enjoy rogue like games or just want to try something new, this is definitely it. It's extraordinarily difficult, but unlike other games, you never feel cheated... most of the time, (looking at you, every Lost run I've done, or every Delirium fight.) 10/10 would suffer repeatedly again, and again, and again."

Sorry for my bad english. Also I’m typing on mobile, if im make any spelling mistakes im sorry.

So i was browsing reddit. i did my daily deed by creating my 420th account to downvote EA’s comment about microtransactions (EPIC). and then i saw a hilarious meme about dying in a car crash on r/dankmemes. i decided to try it out. So me, being the typical redditor decided to take my wife and children with me (SPOILER, THIS WAS A MISTAKE). Not with standing, we were in the car and saw a big truck. Now i’m a fan of big trucks, let me tell you, but the driver was clearly an insta normie. We crashed into the truck going 250 mph. My wife was vaporised immediately. The car flipped 69 times (nice). Cum, everywhere. My cock and balls, tortured. My reddit gold, gone. r/wooosh.  now you might have noticed the truck driver has uploaded this accident on r/watchpeopledie after committing 4 counts of vehicular manslaughter. This guy is a repeat offender when it comes to reposting. I could name several instances in which he reposted in r/blursedimages and r/aww. Typically he reigns in 20% karma gains as compared to the original posts. This is outrageous. But what is more outrageous is this man, this normie decides to repost on to instagram! Unforgivable! Onto his instagram account, i have noticed several posts causing me to believe he is a boomer! Not just this, but a simp! He supports the orange man and kills children! To relieve my stress after this scarring incident, I decided to donate my life savings to pokemane. Now this bitch, didn't even say my name! I cant believe this! And then, to top it all off, after uploading my cat to r/chonkers HE DIES! It was right after his 12th meal of the day, so at least he died happily. Could it be the cat food? Has anyone else experienced this? After my cat dying i asked my crush out and she said no! My wifes boyfriend called me a cuck and insulted my neckbeard. I was sad. I covered my tears with my fedora. “M’lady”, i whispered, “please forgive me, i have failed you”. After this i went onto r/pewdiepiesubmissions to defend a woman being bullied by evil men. They called me a simp, but i knew that i was actually a protector of the female gender from the patriarchy!

25117,"Bom pra caramba, vale a pena comprar todas as DLCs"
25118,"I think its an icon for Roguelike games and the game is so basic yet so fun and challenging to play, I played this game before it was ""rebirth"" and my brother has that game on steam so now I still can play it on his PC and I enjoy the game very much, so far we haven't unlocked much but I wouldn't recommend it to people who hate losing progress or rage on unlucky ""runs""."
25119,Don't play this game unless you want to become addicted.
25120,"At first release wasn't really interested, got the game on sale and now love it. The game grows the longer you play it."

25131,fetus cries and mom dies. good.
25132,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a fantastic game that offers not only hundreds of hours of game play but also never ending fun. The game also takes a amazing approach at lore where it doesn't force it upon the player but leaves it in spaces for them to find. BoIR can also be played in so many different ways, this lets the player find out what they like best so they can have the most fun possible. I recommend this game 10/10."

It takes a while to fully get into/understand fully the game's brilliant mechanics, but once you can, an entire new experience emerges from the heavens to lift you and soar you into the universe.

25155,"fucking hate this game, still my favourite tho."
25156,"While this is one of my favourite games of all time and with the addition of Repentance the game is nearly perfect. However there is a major issue with the controller support. the controller will disconnect from the game anywhere from 2 seconds - 3 minutes. Once it has connected however the game will claim it recognises the controller yet you'll either have no movement with either the controller or keyboard which forces you to hard close the game, or it will spawn the second player/co-op baby and lock your keyboard from movement. If this issue was non existent or fixed then the complete package of all three DLCs would make for the perfect game."

25171,"This game is great, but charging people $35 in DLC just to get a proper Co-op mode (that should have been in base game already and if not as a free update) that doesn't even work is absolute garbage."
25172,"just follow me at twitch.tv/buttersquanch 

steam reviews are the best to network"
25173,The game is good yet very grindy. I would recomend getting dlc like afterbirth and afterbitrh plus.

25177,"my mom beats me


and my dad left me

game is relatable"
25178,Funny game yes
25179,"good

play"
25180," Having never played Isaac before, a wiki should be open at all times to learn about items and what they do, yet it isn't much of a problem. Some items can be pretty bad compared to others, though I have learned that this is balanced out the more DLCs you go, especially in Repentance (ex. holy water's buff). However, TBoI just keeps on expanding in content and doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. The way the game has you repeat the mom's heart fight lots of times to make sure you're good enough for It Lives!, the way that I could defeat Satan with only endings 1 and 2 done, the way that you can complete 5 requirements at once after breaking a single rock... It's almost beautiful! 9.8/10"
25181,many poo for many moons oh ya plus you get a cat named guppy  its a win win in my book

25190,"Been playing the game off and on for 10 years, and it is still going strong. Amazing!"
25191,SUPER FUN!!!
25192,I don't know how they managed to merge a cool edgy setting and poop-funny cartoon babis but they did it!
25193,This game makes me very angry and no I will not stop playing it
25194,"Great content-for-price ratio. You can easily spend hundreds maybe thousands of hours on this game. It's addicting, it's challenging, it's replay value is infinite. So much to unlock, from new characters to areas to items that you can combine and experiment with. Just when you think it's over, you realize it's only just begun

Great game, very fun, will last you a LONG while"
25195,I have no bitches but a lot of achievements so yeah...
25196,this game is very good i like to play the good games so this one is one of the ones i would play you should also play this game becuase it is a very good game and what makes it even better the POOP AND FARTING IS THE BIG FUNNY  it just makes the game 100 times better thank you edman keep the updates up and i like your game so i will keep playing the game that you very much love and kisses
25197,good
25198,very fun love the bosses
25199,"The best Isaac has been! The new items, characters, and mechanics are fantastic"
25200,"This game has great replay-ability value. If you like roguelikes, you're probably already familiar with this game and if you're new to the genera I couldn't recommend a better starting title. The game has a great difficulty scale as you progress through completion. One thing I really enjoy about the newest DLC, Repentance, is that the developing team made use of assets that were less used. The re-implication of the Mom's heart fight in the Repentance path was one place I saw reintroduction of a mechanic that is lost in progression. I also like that The Lost character was introduced as a regular mechanic instead of a very well hidden secret. By playing as The Lost I feel that curiosity around the character may drive players to learn more about them, whereas previously this character was really only available to players that engage in online Isaac communities."
25201,One word- Phenomenal
25202,nice

25212,It's amazing! The endings the story the items all so darn great!
25213,"Isaac and his Isaac lived alone in a small Isaac on a Isaac. Isaac kept to himself drawing Isaac and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was simple and they were both Isaac. That was until the Isaac heard a Isaac from Isaac. Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac. I will do my best Isaac in my Isaac, Isaac's Isaac replied. Rushing into Isaac's Isaac removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again Isaac called to Isaac. Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac, he needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in this Isaac and confess his Isaac. I will follow your Isaac I have Isaac indeed, Isaac's Isaac replied. As she locked Isaac in his Isaac away from the Isaac of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. You've done as i have asked, but i still question your Isaac to Isaac to prove your Isaac I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac. Yes Isaac, anything, Isaac's Isaac begged. To prove your Isaac then Isaac, I require Isaac your Isaac will be Isaac, go into his Isaac and end his Isaac as an Isaac to Isaac to prove you Isaac me above all Isaac. ""Yes Isaac"", she replied. Grabbing Isaac from the Isaac. Isaac watching through a Isaac in his Isaac, trembled in Isaac. Scrambling around as Isaac to find Isaac, he noticed Isaac to the Isaac hidden under his Isaac, without Isaac he flung open Isaac, just as Isaac burst through his Isaac and through himself down into the unknown Isaac below..."

Not to mention many of the new updates are taken from player-made mods that the developer is now charging money for. The creator used to make funny and unique games but it seems like now he's more interested in wringing every cent possible from this successful franchise. If you still really want to play Binding of Isaac, I recommend playing the original version. It's a more complete version and the music is better."

There's too much RNG that controls whether you get to progress or not (and I don't mean the good kind, like for items), I mean the kind which decides whether or not you're allowed to even try for new unlocks. There's absolutely no explanation for things in-game which means you need the wiki to play it, tabbing in and out gets annoying quickly. There are also too many encounters in the game that tests your luck rather than skill, and can kill your run without you having a say in it."

So much variety and replay value on top of all the DLC that exists which expands the base Rebirth game by almost 4x. The simple fact that collecting the same items with a few differences across 2 separate runs can have such a large impact on the synergies and the final outcome of your damage makes this my favourite rogue-like to exist."
25309,yes

25318,WHY IS REPENTENCE 20 FUCKING DOLLARS!? (edit: it droped down and im happy.
25319,Although Afterbirth+ turned me away from the game Repentance fixes a lot of the issues I had with that expansion and makes for an extremely content rich experience that you can sink hundreds of hours into with 34 playable characters and hundreds of unlocks the base game with the DLCs is well worth the money.

25328,"Pretty fun game to pick up for brief period at a time or to focus heavily and grind for months. If you're fond of standard roguelike mechanics and have a tolerance of gross imagery then be sure to give it a try.
Just avoid the new DLC until you're very comfortable with the game as it is - Repentance is designed to bring challenge back to experienced players and could make the game unenjoyably frustrating if you're trying to learn while playing through it."

If you have watched content on Issac before it may seem like a lot but you naturally unlock stuff as you progress through the game. With 'Repentance' the amount of unlocks goes up as long as new enemies and adds even more hours to a game that has a ton of replay-ability.

Therefore I highly suggest you buy this game whether now or later when it's on sale. It's great.

I don't suggest that you should buy this game if you don't like any form of religion in gaming since a lot of the items and pick-ups are based around topics from religion and so if that grinds your gears, don't buy the game because you'll end up hating a portion of the game."

25414,"Very diverse and challenging gameplay, can be difficult and frustrating but it's done in a perfect way that rewards the player for success. Tons of things to unlock as well which gives it hours upon hours of potential gameplay."
25415,What if you were a baby fighting monsters in your basement? This game answers that.
25416,"I don't normally play Roguelikes. I simply think they're just sorta there, so when I played the original BoI, I have to admit, there was some fun to be had. That was on my dad's account. When I found out there was a remake coming out, I was sorta looking forward to it, yet at the same time, I was worried as it was a remake and the charm may have been lost or altered.

How wrong I was. The game by itself without any of the DLC is still pretty charming, ditching the flash look for a more retro style that added more charm if anything. Add on the three DLCs and access to various mods on the workshop, including the huge mods that were so big they got added to the game OFFICIALLY, and you have a team that genuinely cares about not only the game, but the universe. Now we have a card game, a spinoff and even merchandise.

This game was Friday Night Funkin before Friday Night Funkin even existed. It's the one game I find myself coming back to again and again just to get one item unlocked. And I'm just a casual gamer, so it's even more shocking for me. The community is keeping this game alive and, judging by the amount of mods, it'll be kept alive for a while.

As for the game itself without any mods, it's still such good fun, but there's one caveat and I hate to say this but...

[u] It is the Dark Souls of Roguelikes and YOU WILL DIE MANY TIMES. [/u]

But that's the aspect of Isaac. You have to find the best combo in order to survive, you gotta survive. You are a naked child crawling into the depths of the earth to hide from your mom. And that brings me onto the story.

GOOD GOD THE STORY. It's woven brilliantly and is expanded upon with the DLCs, but it's not expressly told to you like a story narrated by Samuel Jackson or Morgan Freeman. You get the start of the story and the end narrated and that's it. You're left to string it together.

Altogether, it's honestly the best game I've played on my PC purely because of replayability alone. I look forward to more Bindings."

25418,really fun and addicting shmup-esque roguelike that puts your skills to the test. It's like this game never runs out of insane power-ups. Just beat the game officially on a very lucky run where I was super OP and I still wanna keep playing. Highly recommended

25428,"A lot of balancing made with previous items that were once useless are much better here. Originally 15 characters to a new 34 unique characters total. Being able to start a run weak, then ending up potentially overpowered with millions of combinations/synergies to choose from is satisfying, along with the true final ending. Co-op is made well and the new soundtrack kills it. I have logged in over 1,600+ hours between the Steam and Switch version, and I don't regret it. This made me interested with the Roguelike genre and the franchise as a whole. After completing 637 achievements on Steam, I think it's safe to say that I would consider this game to be my favorite game of all time, that's not gonna change anytime soon."

25481,"Best Rouge-like on the market....BUT....

Having to look up a wiki for items and a newly added character is too much to overlook. I understand the devs want people to gradually find things but 700+ items and a bunch of other stuff it way to much to just say ""remember this item does +.3 damage in this room but with this character it does +1.0 on Tuesdays"".

YOU NEED the external item description mod! So you dont keep on pausing the game ever 45 seconds to wiki something. 
Also some enemies stop the flow. Even if you have an overpowered run going some enemies stay hidden, and you just have to sit there with your finger up your butt.

I have 200 hrs on Steam
700 on Xbox
20 on Switch
so I REALLY dig this game, it can be hard but the world and gameplay is so much fun!

25499,"BEFORE THE SIMPS FOR THIS GAME GET MAD, THIS REVIEW IS BECAUSE THIS GAME IS 15$ ON TOP OF PAID DLC. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF IT WAS FREE AND THE DLC WAS FREE.

I played it by using steams friend play thing. Boring af and not my cup of tea. This is a mobile 2D pixel game that would be something you play on your phone in a restaurant. I can not believe people actually simp for this. Fuck devs who put games on PC and console that should be mobile games. There is no need for mobile games on a PC other than money. And dont try saying that the ""mobile game aesthetic"" on PC is not real, it is very real. The gameplay of this game is so boring and arcade like that it is basically just galaga but with ""new"" stuff. Same gameplay loop over and over, just everytime its a new boss with more pixels and more HP. Just because I played 0.1 hours (5 min) means nothing. I have watched hours of people streaming this game and walkthroughs to go indepth why devs need to stop making mobile games but on PC. This genre of mobile pc games is terrible and needs to stop. The same way EA needs to stop putting the same game out over and over every year. But EA dont stop because they know their simps are there to leech off of. The mobile PC game genre is the same way where devs will keep putting out sh1tty gameplay games and no one has enough self respect or balls to call it out. I mean why do you think Genshin, WOW, WOT, Magic the gathering, Magic legends, DOTA 2, etc. are so popular. They are basically mobile games on PC. I know what you think ""well this game is from 2011, cut it some slack"", no. Skyrim is from 2011, look how that game is (with no mods). Amazing, fun, and holds up great. This? This is (like I said before) something I would pull out on my phone to play in a restaurant or at a boring family gathering. Not saying the game doesnt have passion or any sort of effort, just the gameplay is boring, repeated, done better in other games, and goes along with the problem of mobile PC games. I give ISAAC a 4/10. Under average game because I have seen the same gameplay done better elsewhere."

25508,"Steam recommended I give this a review as my 500th hour passed, so here we are.

Pros:
•Replayable. Core gameplay loop has the structural integrity of a neutron star. Much variety from item synergies and different paths are fun to unlock and rewarding the navigate.
•Enough difficulty to make no run a cake walk, feels good and only adds to 
the above point. 
•Literally hundreds of things to unlock. 1001% after the first DLC, I now have about 300 things to unlock coming back after the *free* boosters and new DLC was released. 
•Roguelike. Lite? Light?
•Scratches the ""dungeon-crawl"" itch with an Abrahamic twist.
•Style, especially with the recent DLC and ESPECIALLY compared to the original Newgrounds flash game.

Cons
-Remote-play system for online is actually ass, unfortunately. It doesn't matter if the mechanics for co-op got a rework with repentance if the system for multiplayer is a twitch stream, delay and all. Shoutout to couch co-op, it leaves the current online in the gutter.
-Pretty sharp learning curve. Secret rooms, planetariums, unlocking the lost, enemies patterns, items, synergies, dog-tier items. All things you either learn from platinumgod or the hard way. Such is the life of a game born in the age of wikis.
-Gore. Not a problem for me, but sensitive stomachs may find this game unappealing. All within it's rights and style, obviously, but worth pointing out.
-Minor, but new DLC has some fights that are designed like they belong in a game that has a dodge-roll. Looking at you, Bumbino. 


Good game, just a really good one. 
Full price with DLC is well worth it's weight, but goes on sale pretty often, so it's perfect for your wishlist. 
Bought this game seven years ago and gotten both free content and DLC releases.
Never heard a toxic peep from the community. I'm sure they're there though.


Worth the money, 9/10."

25520,"This game is really cool and pog :) The random element and the need to start over after death can be infuriating at first, but it quickly becomes the games strength. Runs can be busted and take 20 minutes or feel like a true challenge taking the better part of an hour. New items are also funneled into the game at an addictive rate through achievements certain conditions. Overall great game."

25553,"Great game, super difficult with all the DLC, and recomended to get all the DLC, days of play time, even allowed to get mods to improve or change the game (Aslong as you have the dlc that is) 100% reccomend the game, best if you have all the DLC"
25554,"I really really like it, but I really really hate it"
25555,FUCK THIS GAME
25556,"After you fail in this game for many torturous hours, you'll somehow get infatuated with it. Highly recommended for players that love dungeon type games!"
25557,Repentance is the best thing to have happened to this game. But it was already a great game prior.
25558,Very fun! Addictive. The amount of time you can play this game is nearly endless.
25559,"I have waited to write a review until finally achieving all of the achievements in this game. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is overall an amazing game. Players will likely struggle and become frustrated with many runs and challenges as they play, but the satisfaction of every win overpowers all the frustration. With over 600 secrets (achievements) and endless synergies (item combinations), the game is able to be replayed endlessly. It is nearly impossible to have two identical runs. It has DLC with extra content that make the bounds of exploration in the game expansive. It has a great soundtrack, different difficulties for the player, and a good story if you pay attention to the cut-scenes. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging game that feels rewarding, and I hope to see more Isaac in the future, whether it be in a new game or in more expansions."
25560,Juegaso.
25561,what?
25562,"This game has been the king of rogue-lites for years, and still reigns supreme. Highly recommended!"

25567,honistly this game is good! it can be hard so if you like hard games you will like that game!
25568,Who thought adding those little spiders would make the game more entertaining
25569,"Buggy on Macbook Pro M1. 10 minutes into playing this game there's this ear piercing static sound that plagues certain rooms and once get to the next stage, it disappears momentarily before coming back. Tried deleting, reinstalling, updating steam but no cigar. Plays fine on my PC but not playable from my experience on my M1."
25570,A fun game with a lot to discover.
25571,"I don't remember there being this much poop in the original bible story, but it's a bold adaptation nonetheless"
25572,I have this game on every platform and all I got to say is... amazing!
25573,"its a very fun game.
It is a difficult game but it is very satisfiying when you kill a hard boss (like hush)"
25574,"I've only been playing for a bit, but I've seen a crazy amount of videos on Isaac. There's so much stuff in the game to unlock and so many challenges to play, it's pretty swag

good ass music
lots of characters
lots of synergies
10/10 game"
25586,"its a good game dont get me wrong the game is good but moments in the game where there are hits you can see coming due to
   A. enemies blocking other so you cant accordingly
   B. you tears go so insane you cant see enemies even
   some characters that dont get anything from some times that still appear in there runs one character was really bad with this ""The Lost"" is not able to use any health up items of any kinda but they still appear in his runs and only recently with the new dlc did they fix it kinda not really 
   this game is part skill based part stat based beating the game is doable even when you arent to good at the game just need some really good items but if your stats are too low 
   1. shot speed = good luck trying to hit anything
   2. Damage = your runs will take forever
   3. running speed = good luck dodging 
theres more but if you can look pas all that its a great game its just when it goes bad its awful"

good game"
25623,"Rebirth is a spectacular game, and each DLC adds a ton of content. No two runs will ever be the same, and that alone is worthy of your time compared to similar games in the genre. 

Newest DLC needs some more balance work and contains a lot of fun-ruining enemies and mechanics, but that's the kind of criticism that dates a review once it's fixed up. Hell, it's happened before when the previous DLC first released. Could always just revert to not having that DLC, however, and as far as the rest of the content goes, I loved it enough to 100% the achievements, then continue playing up to a total of 600 hours without burning out. So, huge recommend. Has a fun community, too."

25636,If you had to buy one single game to play a whole year is this. i'ts affordable and still every time you play it it's something new and don't need internet to play it.

The new Repentance DLC adds so much more content to a game that already had hundreds of hours of content to begin with.  The items and synergies you can create are so fun and rewarding and each time you play the game, you pretty much unlock a new thing.  This makes the gameplay rewarding as you feel like you are slowly accomplishing more and more.  10/10 This is the best rouge-like out there."

25722,"The binding of Isaac is a game that took a while to get into, like many I watched a few hours of it on youtube and made a purchase. Nothing clicked.
Here's how i got it to ""click"":
 - Unlock Samson (or any character you like on the wiki)
 - Play that character, get unlocks 
 - once you start unlocking, you begin to feel an actual purpose to playing the game. This is because the more unlocks you have the more variety the game has. 
 For the love of god do not play Isaac (character) unless you have a world's worth of patience or have the D6 unlocked.
All in all TBOI is a good game that you can sink hundreds of hours into, and even then it keeps changing."

overall 9/10 wish my mom would hurry and get that 1up already"
25773,BIG yes.
25774,I dont understand the appeal of this game. It doesn't play exceptionally well and being in poop hell isn't exactly original nor fun.
25775,A tier above heroin. would recommend to my meemaw
25776,it gud game
25777,"It's just a really good game man. You do a lot of things that you really wouldn't ever expect to do up in here. It's literally never the same run ever. It's also highly infuriating. If I were to suggest a game for the most casul of casual players, this'd probably be the one. In the most loving and sympathetic way possible of course. It's silly, and disgusting, and there really isn't a moment where you realize that everything that's happening is actually really horrible in real life concept terms. At least that's how it was for me right up until I started writing this for basically no one to read. Play it if you haven't, it's totally worth your time. Hence why I've spent so much of mine hanging around inside of the world."

25787,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

25824,"If you like rogue like dungeon crawlers and bullet hells, this is the game for you. There is so much stuff to unlock and find. I used to play the wii u version and memorized everything. However, once I got this version, I had to learn about more than double what I used to know. Be warned, this game is very difficult. (Escpecially a certain character on Rebirth. Also I heard repentence is hard.) So just be wary it might be too difficult. I recommend getting Rebirth as well as Afterbirth and Afterbirth plus. When you complete those, you can get Repentence."
25825,fkng awesome
25826,you like rouge likes you like this game
25827,"very epic game, absolutely would recommend. im just saving so i can buy afterbirth+, then repentance."

25829,"The best rogue-like out there. It's as if Stephen King designed a video game; dark, crazy and fun. There are hundreds if not thousands of hours of game play here now with all the DLC's, and it is well worth the money. Even when losing it's important to remember you are still working towards unlocks, or at the very least learning for your next run."

25836,Its a great game! SO much reputability with many save files you can play lots and lots of character with unique ability's to complete. So many challenges to complete many secrets to find so many rooms and floors so much final bosses to kill and lots of items to collect and unlock i 100% recommend
25837,This happened to my second cousin Ricky once
25838,yes
25839,game good
25840," The Binding of Isaac is essentially 𝘵𝘩𝘦 roguelike, or roguelite, depending on how you define ""roguelike"". There are 700 unique items, and almost every item has a unique interaction with another. Around 200 unique enemy types, and over 80 unique bosses, not counting final bosses.
Most impressively, though, is the large amount of characters you can play as, featuring 17 characters [spoiler] and 17 more alternate versions of these characters [/spoiler] to unlock and play as, all with unique and interesting playstyles.
This game is hard. Sometimes to the point of frustration. Some bosses have armor that scales with your damage stat, others can transform into different bosses, some spawn other bosses, and some just have a large amount of health. In this game, anything from the smallest spider to a Beast of biblical proportion can kill your run.
This game has strong religious influences. It channels both the positive and negative aspects of Christianity, and implements them into the items, enemies, bosses, and even player characters of the game. The plot that drives the game's story is reminiscent of the story of The Binding of Isaac, this game's namesake.
I recommend this game. It is fun, challenging, and provides a good balance of difficulty and achievement."

25899,"It's ok, I guess..."
25900,"This game is fucking good (This review is definitely biased)

Story:
There is """"little to no story"""", but to not spoil everything
""you are Isaac, a child who escaped into the basement after his mother tried to kill him, but as Isaac goes deeper underground, he realises that monsters are real & has to fight them, using his own tears and the items he finds along the way""

Graphics:
The pixel art is very pleasant, except in some minor items, most of them from afterbirth.
Repentance added some new art which looks really good.

PlayTime:
Depends on how much you like the concept & gameplay, since the game doesn't get really good until you start unlocking items, from looking at friends playing the game, I'd say the place where most quit is when you have to beat mom's heart 11 times (which even I consider tedious) specially considering the amount of items you have at the start.

Music: The music used to be better in the original flash isaac.
tho, Repentance has added some new tracks which are great while playing.

Offensive?:
...
Don't take it too seriously, I even learned some weird shit about the bible.
I didn't know who tf Lazarus was before playing this game.

Price: I think that after all the content that has been added, the game still getting things fixed & all the amazing runs I had... I'd say its 1 of those steam games that pays its own price.

After 300+ hours into the game, all I can say is, give it a try
its hard at the start but u get used to it, recently I finished The Lost's completition marks... that was just painful, but also a lot of fun. 
Even if you only buy Rebirth or even if you pirate it becuz you don't have money, please give it a try.

Cause this game, is fucking good."

25937,"This game has a lot to do in it, and it's one of those games that once you start, you're hooked. It's pretty good for wasting time, and in a fun way. Although some rooms are very over the top sometimes. One room you get 2 spiders, the next you get 4 hosts and 20 leeches covering the entire ground. Sometimes you just kinda die and you can't do anything about it. This is probably due to the repentance update though. When that isn't happening, it's a very fun game"

unfair but fun"
25973,"Very good game. i dont understand why people complain about the difficulty. certain things are pretty rough, but it just takes practice. tons and tons of content is in this game. most AAA games today are $60 for half a product, this game is $50 (all DLC included) for the gift that keeps on giving."
25974,Very jazzy
25975,"Alright, I've waited years to do this, and finally it's time to put forth a review here.

For context, Isaac was one of the two games (the other being Spelunky) that got me to dump AAA games and switch to almost exclusively playing indies (AAA games getting progressively more slimy and worthless also helped though).  That was the ORIGINAL Isaac, and it was seriously just THAT DARNED GOOD.  And then Rebirth came out and upgraded EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, this is by far one of my favorite games of all time.  Top 3, I'd say.  Considering I've been gaming since the days of the 2600... that's extremely high praise.

So yeah.  I like it.  But I'm going to do this review a bit different.  Instead of talking about what the game is like and all of that like I usually do, let's just go over some good/bad points, and maybe a bit about the expansions.

First, the good.  Well, there is a LOT of good here.  The design of basically everything is outright masterful, and there is an absolutely stupid amount of content here.  An absolutely astonishing number of items, enemies, bosses, areas, and so on.  Getting 1000+ hours out of this game isnt exactly unheard of, and it's very easy to see why.

What's more, despite the roguelike nature of it, Isaac is a skill-based game.  RNG cant kill you... unless you let it.  Skill, knowledge, and making good decisions... like any good roguelike, that's what wins runs for you here.  This is a game that gets it RIGHT.  ...Mostly.  With 20 bazillionty enemies/bosses/rooms you do get a dud here and there, occaisional things that rather need an overhaul as they can produce unavoidable attacks.  Fortunately, this is quite rare (and expansions make it more rare).  But still, it DOES happen every now and then.  

Also, the items you find are often just lots of fun to use.  So many creative concepts here.  And the concept of wild synergies just adds to the fun, and makes it so that runs can be so wildly different from one another that even 800+ hours in (I have the game on other platforms) I *still* am surprised by it at times.

Character variety also goes a long way here... there's a darned wide cast of dudes to pick from, and drastically moreso if you buy the expansions.  

The controls are superb, though one small issue is that Isaac's hitbox is... strange.  Even to this day I sometimes find myself not *quite* sure just where it is, particularly as his sprite evolves and warps as you get items.  That's a pretty minor issue though.

And the game can be so darned exciting... when it's being challenging.

One major issue that I've always had with Isaac is that, by default, it is simply far, far too easy.  If you're used to other roguelikes, this one in its base state will be child's play to you.  It has ""balance issues"", and that's putting it VERY mildly.  The game is FAR too easy, allowing the player to become an overpowered disaster almost every run once you know how (and it sure aint hard to figure out how).  While some players like that, I've always found it fantastically boring... I'm sorry, but ""enter room and push win button"" over and over again in 70% of runs isnt very interesting and I find that my interest fades very fast... up until recently, while I love the game, I didnt PLAY it all that often due to the fact that the absolute lack of challenge would cause me to lose interest fast.

Fortunately, that changed with Repentance.  That DLC performs an absolute overhaul of the game's balance, and turns it into more of a PROPER roguelike... darned difficult, and drastically less common that you will get overpowered.  It becomes more in line with other games in this genre, and to me that is a very good thing.  Not to mention that DLC also just adds tons of amazing content.  So, if you want any actual challenge... make sure to pick that up, otherwise you really wont find much of any.  The game is seriously mindless without it.

But, even with that, there are still other issues.  Two particular things stand out to me:  The absolutely atrocious unlock system, and the fact that the game NEVER EXPLAINS ANYTHING.  Wanna know what that item there does?  Well TOO BAD because it will not tell you.  Better learn by trial and error and then MEMORIZE the many 100s of items in here.  Or, better yet, get Afterbirth+ (which adds mod support) and just get the item description mod.  Without that... hoboy, better get used to alt-tabbing.

But then there's the unlock system... I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  Look, I grew up in the days of really primitive games... the 2600 and NES for instance.  I do not, and never will, understand modern gaming's obsession with achievements and unlocks.  But honestly, even for those who DO understand, this is likely to still be a massive source of frustration.  SO MANY FREAKING THINGS are locked behind arbitrary and often irritating nonsense, some of which genuinely does require that the RNG be very kind to you.  Other things are just stupidly annoying, like trying to beat X final boss with The Lost (a challenge character who dies if you look at him too hard).  Or doing ANYTHING with Jacob and Esau (from Repentance) who are fun enough, but who DO NOT work well with unlocks, as the game is not formatted for their bizarre dual hitbox.  An absolutely astonishing amount of things require that you unlock them before using them, and that is... irritating.  It is by far my biggest complaint with the game.

Also, there are expansions!  Great stuff really.  Afterbirth is pretty basic... it is MOAR STUFF, lots of fun things.  Afterbirth+ also adds MOAR STUFF, but is truly about modding the game.  You can customize your experience and play it how YOU want to!  People have come up with some incredibly creative and fun things.  One thing to note: you MUST have Afterbirth+ to use Repentance.

And Repentance itself is, to me, the best of all.  It is Antibirth integrated officially into the game, with way more added on top.  And like I said, it rebalances EVERYTHING.  OP broken things are nerfed, but even moreso, about a bazillion items got buffed.  The game is far harder, and there are alternate levels, even more endings, and ALL of the content is just SO FREAKING GOOD.

One thing I do want to mention though:  particularly with Repentance, this game is at its best when you DONT just stick to ""the meta"" (which is frankly something I say about all roguelikes).  EXPERIMENT with the different items.  Despite what some players may say, I genuinely think there are very, very few ACTUALLY bad items in the game.  Like, less than 10.  There are certainly some situational items out there (and deciding when to take something and when NOT to is a big part of the game!) but that sure doesnt make them bad... learn when they work well, and when they dont.  USE EVERYTHING... even if you've used it before and it seemed bad.  Again, this is seriously advice for the entire genre.  But this DLC *really* ups the need to approach it this way, if you want the best experience and the most fun.

And dont be afraid of losing.  Dont let it bother you when it happens.  Again, good advice for the entire genre, not just this.

There is honestly sooo much more I could say about this game, and almost all of it is positive.  But you know, Steam character limit.

One way or another... it is fantastic.  One of the best.  And the DLC just makes it way better.  It does have a couple of odd issues, sure, but those can be fixed in many cases (with the DLCs) and for those that cant be fixed, well... the rest is just so darned good that those problems get a pass.

Just amazing.  Congratulations to Edmund and his team for creating something so incredible.  And then improving on it even further.

...Seriously get the DLCs though. They are great."

25987,"An absolutely amazing game, unlocking items can be a chore though. Afterbirth is really good as well and you should get it too. Afterbirth+ is eh but you should get it anyway because repentance is the best DLC out of the three. Repentance adds an amazing new final ending as well a bunch of new items, three new floors and three alternatives to those floors, and 19 new characters (including tainted ones). You should really buy this game."

26073,"Cry baby game, its epic"
26074,"I've now beaten the game through Mother's Heart, unlocked a few extra characters, and faced Ultra Greed. The entire game seems like a massive trolling of the player. I can say I grinned and beared it when I sat through the discordant music, the squelching/squishing sound effects, and the disgusting, rotten, pee-pee poo-poo body horror bosses. What I got at the end was a series of nonsensical ending animations that continued with the unsatisfying, troll nature of the entire experience.

Every playthrough of Isaac feels like actual repentance for my gaming sins. The controls for each character feel like Super Mario ice levels, and the shots are frustratingly angled when you move. Enemies in Greed mode spawn right on top of you at random. Apparently this version cranked up several levels of BS to make completion even harder. Let me tell you, bullet-sponge bosses, split-second dodging and invisible enemies don't make for fun challenges. Looking up item effects on a fan site just to figure out what the hell my strategy is doesn't feel fun. After hearing what's required for a 100% completion, I'm stopping right here. There's so many fun rogue-likes out there, and I know Isaac was one of the OGs, but it definitely ran its course years ago. 

All I can say is if you're a hardcore fan of this series, and you play it for 100+ hours, I can only deduct that there's something seriously psychologically wrong with you, in a distinctly masochistic way. Please seek actual help. This game is like the gaming equivalent of self-harm or something."

Every power-up and every boss are breath-taking. The game itself offers hundreds of hours worth of entertainment and its high difficulty will keep you on your toes. As you play the game you unlock new items, new bosses, new challenges and even whole new levels unlike anything I've ever seen in a game.

26119,"I love this game. I genuinely do.
I have put hours into trying to finish this game and I usually never have that kind of determination for anything. It's weird. When I first got this game, I couldn't get past the first floor, just like many others and I thought that I would never get anywhere in this game. Well, look at me now. 200 hours in, coming on 250, pretty much finished every character. 

A lot of people don't like this game because of it's difficulty, and that's fair enough as this game requires hours of learning mechanics to master. But what I'm trying to say is that if you devote enough time into this game you will turn your 15 dollars into 10 times its worth. There are so many characters to play from, endings, challenges, secrets, achievements, even more if you include all the DLCs. 

Now, let's talk about gameplay. This game has a very simple premise, to clear enemies in rooms, some rooms harder than the other. I know this sounds very simple and bland but trust me, I wouldn't still be playing this game if it was boring. As you progress through the floors it gets more and more challenging and fun to play through and is really a great experience. When it comes to bossfights, you have to learn their attack pattern to successfully finish the room without being hit, and this learning process can be really fun! Most of the bosses in this game are really fun to go against and provide a neat challenge. The main bosses like Isaac, Satan, etc. are really challenging and give you a chance to show your skill. Once you get used to them it will of course get easier but still incredibly fun to play through. To actually have a good chance to progress, you need to get items. There are a range of items each floor that can range from run-ruining to run-winning. The way of obtaining these items are through devil deals, treasure rooms, angel rooms, libraries... the list goes on. There are also 20-35 challenges between all DLC's and so much more. This game provides for many opportunities and every run is very fun to play through. Well, most runs, anyway.

Now, for the music. In this game, the music is INCREDIBLE. It is immersive, catchy and really fits the atmosphere of the floors. When you're in the caves, the music is more echoey and you can hear the dripping and flowing of water in the background. It really makes you feel like you're in a cave and that's the magic of it. The music is amazing and always sets the mood extremely well.

Is there anything bad with this game?
...
Well, yes. Not every game is perfect. This game can be pretty glitchy at times and sometimes these glitches can break your run to the point where it's unplayable or maybe in a good way. There are many glitches that you can use to your advantage and that kinda ruins the fun or IS the fun depending on who you are.

What is my overall opinion on this game? 
Amazing. This is the best 20 dollars I've ever spent and that isn't a joke. This game has brought me so much entertainment that I literally cannot fathom. When I'm bored I would just play this game. Genuinely fucking amazing. If you have the money and you are considering it, just buy it.

You won't be disappointed."

Comments-
I've played hundreds of hours of this before getting it on Steam, and it is THE game that has 100% replay value for me. Rogue-lite which gets more fun the more times you finish it, as you tend to unlock more items, playable characters (each with their own perks) and challenges. The later DLCs add some play modes and items (which are awesome), but the base game is also perfect as it is. 

Gameplay-
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Nothing special

Difficult-

☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master

☐ A bit grindy sometimes
☐ Average grind level

☐ Insanity
*It's win or die, nothing to grind

Game Time-

Price
☑ Just buy it
☐ Worth the price
☐ Wait for sale
☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
*With how much time it will keep you occupied, it is well worth the price and more

26168,"i have to say, this is a DAMN good game. this was the first game that got me into roguelike games and it did an amazing job at introducing me to the genre. the story of the game is that there is a boy named Isaac who lives with his mother alone, one day however, god tells Isaac's mother to kill him as a way to prove her devotion to him. if you couldn't already tell, this game has a big take on religion. I won't go too in depth with the story or anything but what is a simple story turns into something way more sinister as you keep playing. the game has multiple endings which each tell a part of the story and let me tell you, there are a lot of endings, you get a new one each time you complete a run however later on you will need to do more than just finish a run to achieve the last few endings, some endings will require you to get certain items but you won't need to worry about that until much later on.

just like other roguelike games, when you die, you lose everything and have to restart from the beginning however there are items that can be obtained which allow you to die more than once but I've only ever got those on rare occasions. you may not like it at first because of the whole 1 life thing but just keep playing and you'll get better, that's how i went about playing this anyway and it's one of my favourite games of all time now"

A lot of characters, you can choose the one that suits you the most, or take turns playing each of them.

26278,"I overall enjoy the gameplay. I love how many bosses there are in the game and all the items included. The game is randomized which really spices up the experience because no one ever really  knows if they're going to absolutely crash the game with one op item they get or maybe if they die only on caves. The part I don't really enjoy is that there's a trully small difference between normal and hard . In conclusion the game is really diverse as well as hard and I, personally, rate it 8,5/10 (concidering the fact I'm playing vanilla) and would definetely reccomend."

Forget your old broken builds.  The meta has changed. 
The amount of stuff to do in this game is wonderful.  I'm extremely happy with the gameplay loop.

26321,"I loved this game. I played it for years and it was my way of winding down or playing something when nothing else felt right. Not I am throwing it in the trash. I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone after the DLC. This is now a huge load of... garbage. The designer may say he re-balanced it to make it more of a challenge. Well, I'd say he made it so much of a pain in the butt that it has moved into the not fun and it only stresses me out. I do not fell great after struggling to beat a chosen end boss like I used too.I used to be able to beat the game on hard 1/3 of the time. Now I can spend days loosing over and over on normal mode with out a win in sight. Yah I he has some new and old characters that I can win back to back even on hard but that is because the are balanced to be strong right out of the gate. Meanwhile you have clunky garbage characters that make the game harder than if you played the lost with not holy mantle. The I frames have been lowered from 3 seconds to .5 seconds which leads to double and triple taps that will kill you with mobs that charge you in a swarm that are faster than you can move. The short of it is Ed screwed his game up for all the mid range players of the game and I would get my money back if I could."

26332,Great game to pass time and addictive! So much in the game to keep you engaged and learning something every run!
26333,"Nerfs and no damage galore: the game. ""a shop where you are supposed to use your hard earned pennies that already has a chance to spawn an enemy instead of items? lets nerf it. An item that you unlock for getting all hard mode marks as one of the hardest characters? yeah lets nerf that too."" But hey they buffed holy water and added even more overpowered angel room items so everything is alright. Right now as im seeing things all the good items in almost every item pool are hidden deep under a massive amount of mediocre items and the neverending range up or shot speed up items

Then when it comes to actual flat damage you never actually find any flat dmg up items except sacred heart once in a while and from there if you actually find more damage boosting items you just snowball into an all powerful killing machine. The other option is that you run 3.50 damage all the way into endgame bosses and pepper them 5 minutes straight until your health or patience runs out. If that isnt enough you have these new bosses without health bars so you cant even see how far in the fight you are and god forbid if you actually have damage then they just superarmor half of your damage away because no fun allowed.

Last but not least all the runs im playing are the same where I get the same mediocre items or a few familiars for a bit of extra damage and yet I end up on my end boss of choice with max of 6 damage. Then you have these same alt floors with the same curses such as gehenna/mausoleum with darkness or dross/downpour with any curse ever. 

If you arent already insane before this game then you will certainly become over time when playing this"

At about fourteen hours into the game, i realised that the fun in the binding of Isaac comes from getting absolutely broken item synergies, and shredding through every single enemy that dares to cross your path. I didn't see why everyone made such a big deal about this game until my discovery, and once i did, i was immediately hooked."

     Binding of Issac is a weird game. What else would you call a game where you can pick up divorce papers to get a tears up.  I have 64 hours in this game 24 in the last 2 weeks. Needless to say, I hyper-fixated on this game for a bit. For the first 24 hours of this game, I would pick it up after seeing a YouTuber play it, and then I would go play it get frustrated, and stop playing. This needless to say left a bad taste in my mouth for the game. It was around a few months ago I began watching daily videos from a YouTuber Sinvicta playing it and from this I learned the deeper mechanics of the game.
     A week or so after repentance came out I said fuck it and bought afterbirth plus and repentance. I got a mod that let me see item and consumables descriptions. Thus began my Issac hyper fixation. Now at the end of it, I can write a review of the game that can help you decide if you want it. 
      This game is beyond cryptic to call it cryptic is an understatement this game doesn't explain anything ever. Going into this game blind would be a mistake because you will get no explanation for anything in this game. The most words you ever read in this game is a brief and sometimes completely useless item description. Reading the wiki on this game is a must due to the nature of it. Let's say you want to do something simple like unlocked ""The lost"" to do that you need to die in a sacrifice room while holding a missing poster to do that you need to kill the lamb as Issac to do that you need to beat satan 6 times on separate runs to get the negative beat the game again kill satan with the negative and go to the dark room well how do you fight satan to do that you need to get a devil deal after killing moms heart to kill moms heart you need to beat the game once already and how do you get devil deals well you need to beat the entire floor without taking red heart damage you get what I'm saying here this game isn't just cryptic its downright a puzzle that you need to devour the entire game's wiki to solve and the game itself will never explain any of this to you. I have no problem playing like this I enjoy it but I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and if it isn't yours then this game is not for you.
     Let's talk about the game once you understand it. The game itself is mainly about gambling to raise your odds of getting that one special item that lets you win. This game is a jammed pack of decisions that will let you gamble for a better position than the one you are currently in. The problem with this is that sometimes you roll big and sometimes you roll nothing. The skill itself is useful but it isn't required to win Issac wisdom of how the game works is what's useful and of course lady luck herself. You start a run and hope you get a good start so you can go to floor two with a soul heart and you hope you get a good layout so you can hopefully get a good item and a good shop that lets you beat the boss and you hope you get a good devil deal or you can stick it out for an angel deal on the next floor. you see my point here the game involves a lot of rngs more so than a typical roguelike the game is built in such a way where what leads to a winning run is being able to understand all the negative outcomes and the positive outcomes and taking measures to overcome them but this is hard due to the nature of the game as a puzzle This game has hundreds of items and you constantly unlocking more and more as you play if I wasn't using a mod and the wiki it would have taken me hundreds of hours to play at the level I can play at right now. The game is full of items that let you change your luck you can use the d6 to re-roll any item pedestal you can use tarot cards to get buffs in the boss room you can use the demon beggers and extra hp to try to get a good devil deal item. The game gives you hundreds of options to try, win, and fail.
     Finally, let's talk about items since it's roguelike it's packed full of them. The binding of Issac has the best items in any roguelike iv ever seen. The items in Issac are unique and they all tie together so well and end up creating magic. You can get the famous brimstone which turns your attack into a blood vomit laser destroying everything in its path, You can get Ludovico technique which turns your attack into a single slow-moving ball of death that you control, and you get both of them to turn your attack into a controllable ring of red laser death destroying everything it touches. This game's items work together so well that while playing you end up going what is this going to do when you see something that changes your attack so fundamentally, The game is amazing in this regard and it makes the suffering almost worth it.
     Binding of Issac is a really weird game. The type of weird that contains items that comes from the dead body of the main character's dead cat and if you get three of them you turn into that dead cat and will spawn flies when you attack. The game isn't something I can't say I recommend due to how special it is. It's truly unique and that uniqueness leads to a lot of positives and negatives. it's not bad, it's not good, it's Issac"

26462,"Quite honestly the defining rogue-like of the current video game scene. This game offers countless synergies between its Literal Hundreds of Items, dozens upon dozens of bosses, different routes, playable characters, and more. The DLC to this game is incredibly worth it, and you'll find countless hours of entertainment playing it."
26463,Good game kill bad guy :) 10/10
26464,"You little F**cker
You made a gold of piece with your treasure Issac its f**King Great this treasure game you will become my money i hope you will in your next time a king on a treasure empire you bugger

(There's been so much constant support for this game, official and unofficial, its basically defined the Roguelite genre, I can't recommend this game more for anyone who has even a passing interest in Roguelites and Roguelikes.)"
26465,"GOOD
"
26466,its a good game but it will not let me play the game anymore
26467,"This game is amazing, I'm only 10 hours in but this game is so gigantic that I have the feeling I haven't even touched the surface of all the things it can give. This is one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a videogame.
Do yourself a favor and buy it.
"
26468,"game, good."
26469,This game is just one big joke about poop.
26470,"I sadly can not bring myself to give this a positive review, things like taking a route that should lead one place but takes you to another, like taking the Sheol hole, but going to the cathedral. Things that lack explanation that really should be explained, things that can be run ending, and some combos that just hurt or kill runs. These are the reasons i can't recommend this game, it can be fun, but this starts to get frustrating, this mixed along with some runs being almost dead before they have begun leads me to be unable to leave a positive review."
26471,Favorite game of all time. Best rouge-like out there.
26472,yes
26473,Game(DLC) of the year!
26474,it good
26475,Curse of the Tower is a good item. Don't @ me.

26484,"repentance was a good DLC, though I think there are so many items (and way too many bad items) that I honestly think there is too much content. it would take you hundreds of hours to unlock everything from a fresh save."
26485,good game. disturbing story. perfect.

26507,it's fine
26508,@edmundmcmillen
26509,"One of the best rogulikes and a really replayable game. The amount of potential unlocks and different builds is really something. That, along with 2 different game mods and plethora of characters allows you to enjoy the game for a long time. If you really like the game, I advise you to buy DLCs since they add like 70% of the content. What is good though, that this game awards skill and knowledge, since even bad runs can be turned around if you really know game's mechanics and some ways to ""break"" the game. Strongly recommend if you don't mind themes and artstyle of the game."
26510,yeah
26511,reeee
26512,Many hours on playstation as well. Will continue to come back!

solid gameplay with so much variety its unbelievable and it just keeps pulling you back for more."

The game of my dreams."
26520,epic
26521, y
26522,Addictive.
26523,"This game is a masterpiece of its genre, and only got better with the addition of Repentance. I had always watched gameplay of Isaac for the longest time but never had the option to play it, and i can say the actual playing experience is 10x better than the watching experience. Its like this game is just neverending in terms of content.
one of the best roguelites ive ever played
11/10"

26525,"Weird game, interesting design choices, can be frustrating if you don't like something grab a mod and change it cause balance has many forms and fun is important."

26540,"easily the best roguelite, my personal favorite dungeon crawler, and one of the best twin stick shooters/bullet hell games. insanely high amount of content and replay value (even without the dlcs). HIGHLY reccomend, one of my fav games ever."
26541,haha baby go poop and cry somehow the best game I've ever played
26542,"the game is hard but really really fun, if you want to play with me im smokymike30 make sure to friend me
"
26543,"This game is simply amazing. I've played the first Isaac for a massive amount and loved it. Sure certain updates were kinda unfair at first, sure certain bosses are hella hard... AND sure the game is very vulgar. But all of those things is what makes it what it is : an indie game. Now that I've completed the final ending and spent 345 hours, I can finally put one of my favourite games of all time to rest. I highly recommend it to people that love roguelike and poop jokes. 10/10"
26544,Very challenging and fun :)
26545,"What an amazing game ! There's so much things to do, this game is very long but it's so much fun !"
26546,Haha poopoo funny :)
26547,"Watched Hutts play, seemed fun. in reality hard af, would play again"
26548,Fun game
26549,After the Repentance the game got harder but way better at the same time. I'm loving it.
26550,"I hate my Life since Repentance, but it's great."
26551,game good
26552,"very cool
"
26553,"Much like Isaac, I am constantly crying while playing this game."
26554,OG of twinstick shooters with hundreds of hours of gameplay to explore.
26555,"Okay that's cool but It's pretty draining. On my days off I find myself not even doing much. Like legit the other day 90% of it was on my laptop on my couch watching YouTube videos because I didn't want to do anything else, even easy stuff like come here or work on some small personal projects.

My manager used to be the nice middle ground but she's been out for the past month so the assistant manager took over and thats when things started declining rapidly. I tried calling the hr line and was told I'd get a call back but nothing.

Some days it really is too much. On my days off I rarely do too much because I just don't feel like it because of everything I've had to deal with the past few days (one time it was 7 days with none off).

The changes they made tonight basically sealed my fate, unless something changes. It's no longer the question of how I'll get out but rather when I'll be forced out and have to very quickly figure out a plan. The only possible saving grace would be the pending stimulus but I really can't count on that bc of politics."
26556,"I fucking love it, it addicting, I like that moms heart was buffed!"
26557,"I hate this game, don't play it while you still can."
26558,Good game
26559,"The new enemies is even more trash than what thay previously made... it's like they learned nothing

EDIT 1: This game is more about RNG than actual skill, makes it way too boring having to die in a good run because you get telefragged as the lost."
26560,"Bought this game a few years ago didnt think much of it, felt kinda meh.
Then Repentance came out and I decided to try it out.
It's fuccing amazing, so if you're buying this I wold definetly recommend Repentance DLC for some neat balance changes."
26561,"Remove hosts. Remove Lumps. Remove Mobile Hosts. Remove Floating Hosts. Remove Leaper. Remove Fred. Remove Parabites. Remove Ulcer. Remove Round Worm. Remove Night crawler. Remove all the ghosts. PLEASE PLEASE REMOVE NEEDLE! AND THE OTHER ONES THAT LOOK LIKE NEEDLE! I play bethany i lose every single wisp every single time it jumps at me! Why does Hanger have so much healtth? Remove Remove anti D6 flies at the first floor! ! ! !  JHUST REMOVE ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT CAN PULL A ""Hey you currently cant hit me"" card PLZ!

SAME for spiked rocks amazing kinda crazy you cna fly over rocks but not spiked kinda wacky! Anyways this game ):< Ima still play it becuas4e i think its still a fun game unlocking shit and using them is satisfying! Now I have more to say Why make tainted lost so aids and RNG to play???????? and no better items. Samson made me stop playing for a while becuase hes so zzz to play. Remove the room with the 3 vacumms with the spikes in womb/utero because that was a bs way to lose a run like acutally how was i suppose to know that. Im mad i dont like this game but im goign to keep playing it . Oh yeah cursed of the blind? Why does that have way more probability than literally any other curse jsut give me darkness for every curse please man"
26562,"before playing this game please keep in mind this quote, from a man who has played everyday for the last 4 years, ""[b] This game hates you [/b], this game will do everything in its power to stop you from playing.""
[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/sinvicta316] - Sinvicta [/url]
with that being said, the binding of isaac is amazing. it rewards smart plays, and punishes everything else. the progression is slow, but it get your heart racing when you know your so close to victory."
26563,ive put hundreds of hours on xbox and now that ive gotten a pc its ten times better the new update makes the game much harder but also more rewarding. i started on rebirth and jumped to repentance so personally i have much more content to play with. highly recommend and i know ill put many more hours in.
26564,it hurt my feelings.
26565,"I have hundreds of hours racked up over multiple platforms and this game is still fresh. It is absolutely filled with bullshit (thank you Edmund,) but it's also filled with some of the most enjoyable runs on any roguelike I have ever played. The story is genuinely terrifying and well thought out considering how little you're given directly, you kinda need to go off of items and bosses, aside from all the endings. Great game, great community, and a dev that absolutely hates your guts (all kidding aside, Edmund is a really cool dude.)"
26566,"I was never into Rogue Like games, but i watched Northernlion play this, decided why not. Couldn't even beat the first room but i enjoyed it. Kept playing, now over 250 hours and still loving it. G/F is playing now too and she likes it also. Highly recommended"
26567,"lol funny number time
good game very good i think yes"
26568,good game 9/10
26569,Yes.
26570,it good
26571,"takes a fair while to open up (have to win 11 runs to go beyond chapter 4 consistently, and beat both versions of chapter 5 5 times to unlock chapter 6) but it's definitely worth getting a bundle with all the dlc on sale

extremely difficult, having to avoid damage for entire floors to get a chance at powerful items, and balance resources to get normal ones and make your way through the rooms

17 ([spoiler]x2[/spoiler]) characters with gimmicks ranging from the mundane (more starting health but less damage) to the busted (short range high damage laser beam and flight) to the absurd ([spoiler]moving with a spirit, and attacking with a stationary pile of bones, which the spirit can pick up and chuck across the room[/spoiler]) to the asinine ([spoiler]no strictly defensive items or extra lives can spawn and any damage will instantly kill you.[/spoiler])

absolutely ludicrous amount of unlocks and attention to detail, coupled with wonderful pixelart and music

unless you head empty your way through without getting any of the story or the allusions from certain items, the game needs a content warning for just about everything

8.5/10 adding a point when [spoiler]the void[/spoiler] gets reworked and the missing items are implemented (birthright, c section, bag, etc)"
26572,Its just fucking amazing.

26581,"A completely immersive rouge-like experience with hundreds of hours of content awaiting in the depths. Issac does a beautiful job of opening up the world up to the player with every single run, tons and tons of unique items with interesting synergy.  completion-ists will be frothing at the mouth and the mini-maxers will be taken to heaven. Not for the light of heart. Highly recommend checking out some content before hand, Issac isn't afraid to throw you in the deep end. (Or use a descriptive Items/etc Mod)

But i cannot summarise the amount of praise i have for this freaky religious drug trip.   Check it out!!"

26665,"Really fun, casual or focused...
Diverse Updates and unique characters. The repentance update balanced a lot of items to be less overpowered/ underpowered. 
All of the new ""tainted"" characters are really fun except for two or three whose only purpose is to add an extra challenge to a run, although some of them are more frustrating in the end.

26684,"There's a lot of replay value with this game. It's gruesome, its dark, its tragic... but a challenging game that has a lot going on in it. I can't get enough of this game. Highly recommend."

26697,"Fantastic roguelite, every run brings new thrills and play styles. The variety of items really means that unless you use the same seed no run will be quite the same."

26728,"After 87 hours, I have barely scratched the surface of this game. It's an overall fun title that is great to pick up and play. The variety of items and synergies in this game keep me wanting more. A bit difficult at times, but that's what keeps the game interesting. I would recommend this overall!"
26729,steamhappy
26730,Best game of 2021 :D
26731,Lots of poop. I like poop. You can even see inside your Mother's Uterus!
26732,"as a fetus, you piss and shit everywhere. 10/10"

It's worth your time."
26758,magic mushroom
26759,"Great game to just chill, while your watching and listening to other stuff, super fun.
"
26760,"Very nice game, love the quality even though it was made in 2014."
26761,"help its been 3 weeks i havnt seen my family
"
26762,"a fun rouge like dungeon game
somewhat difficult and there are too many items"
26763,SO FUN BUY NOW
26764,Literally my favorite game of all time
26765,"An incredible amount of content and replayability, there is so much to this game! The most fun I have is unlocking a new character or overpowered item late into the game. The forgotten are such a challenge to obtain for example but they're so much fun!"
26766,Fun.
26767, MMMM GOOD GAME
26768,"it's so good and challenging and addictive and pretty, even better with the dlcs (maybe without the lazy butt ab+.... but repentance is wonderful, adds a second life to a game that was still alive and kicking!!).
even though i lost all hope that i'll ever complete it hundred percent i'm still pretty sure i can play it whenever forever. essential install."
26769,"This game wild, I can already tell I'm gonna spend a lot of hours in this game."
26770,top-tier game
26771,crazy good game.
26772,there  are poop fighting you 10/10

"
26778,I WILL BECOME BACK OF MY MONEY
26779,very nice 👍
26780,very fun and banging with osts
26781,"Even though repentance made a lot of things a lot more unfair (when there was a lot of scuffed buggy unfairness to begin with), it just overloads the game with more options and more ways to synergize and potentially save or throw a run in the most fun ways. 

The graphical updates were also much needed, i always thought some things seemed pretty bland, some things still feel like they need a change but all the Q.O.L stuff they added is quite serviceable."
26782,"when i started playing: hehe funi poop game
now: BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOOOOOOOOLY SPIRIT"
26783,"Quite simple and easy to get into, but yet still very diverse and with a ton of stuff to explore. 

So much fun and very addictive – a lot of value for the buck."
26784,"Took about 175 hours for me to learn that holding R resets your run right away. That's how much fun Isaac is. Go ahead and get all the DLC now, unless you're some crazy tryhard that wants to stick to the meta, having the absolute insane amount of content all the DLC provides is worth it. Whenever you've got a free 20-30 minutes you can start up a run, and either get your little baby head kicked in right away or you become as strong as a god and nab yourself another completion mark.

Unless you hate rouge-likes (In which case, why are you here?), play Isaac."
26785,Its a joy playing isaac
26786,"carry on my wayward son
there be peace when you are done
lay your weary feet to rest
dont you cry no more
 to isaac with love"
26787,It's pretty great I've been playing since Afterbirth and I've been enjoying Repeantance I really love this game just please buy it :)
26788,fuck jacob and esau

26790,I don't own this game
26791,cool game
26792,still not done
26793,"love every moment of the challenge.
"
26794,I think the game is good but this guy called Ragman is holding me back from saying its great
26795,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I WANT THE DLC
26796,I've watched and played more hours of this game than I have spent loving my children.
26797,c*m item
26798,"It's pretty cool
"
26799,"Been playing BOI since the orginal game, probably logged more hours on this game than any other"
26800,"Absolutely frustrating, and terrific.  I cannot express the feeling of reward when you hit a good lick and get a powerful character.  Also, the dedication to this game from the developer is incredible, I've paid immensely more for much less quality and variance of play.  This game is worth three times what it costs.  Its grotesque, its beautiful, it's everything that has ever kept you up at night as a child.  Please, check this game out."
26801,one of my favorite games of all time

26804,it cool

26806,It may be a hard game at first but after many failed attempts the game is still difficult but more fun after each new run.
26807,Great game to burn time and have fun. Don't even have half the achievements unlocked yet but I have 100 hours.
26808,Nice
26809,Good game good.
26810,love it
26811,"I hate this game, would recommend"
26812,It cost me a little more than one US penny for every hour I've enjoyed this game. Well worth it indeed.
26813,i mean its kinda ok
26814,Big good
26815,Guud gaem
26816,It sucks getting the lost but most of the pain is worth it.
26817,tboi:r is an expertly-designed roguelike that will go down in history as a timeless classic
26818,I can't stop
26819,"love this game ""mix item turn to guppy"""
26820,v
26821,EU NÃO AGUENTO MAIS FAZER ACHIEVEMENTS
26822,Depends on RNGesus if you survive the first round or beat the game.
26823,"love the game but FUCK JACOB & ESAU
THEY ARE THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE"
26824,This is a game EVERYONE needs to try out it may have died for me a while ago but i still reccemend it. If you like games where you go through levels constantly until your basically a god then this game is for you. If you have the last DLC you can play multiplayer join up with your friends and beat the boss! So do i reccemend this game? Yes 100% should you try it? Yes you should because i easily got addictid so you should try it too!
26825,Isaac
26826,One of the best games i've ever played. A must have for anyone that likes Rouge-Likes
26827,"Don't do Christianity, kids"
26828,"Honestly, this is just me. But I personally find the game very boring. I hear it gets super good, but if you can't keep someone invested until then, what's the point?"
26829,This game is absolutely addicting especially with the release of repentance
26830,"Best Roguelike out there.
So unique and almost infinitely replayable."
26831,"Good game, Shame mods are locked behind paywalls, still the price is way worth the sheer amount of content"
26832,swag baby
26833,Best game ever
26834,"We've got you surrounded! Buy our DLC!

I HATE AFTERBITH+ I HATE ANITBIRTH I HATE REPENTANCE"
26835,i dont even have the game why can i write a review for it lol (also no i have never owned the game before.)
26836,I miss my dad and so does Issac
26837,This game got serious big dick energy
26838,this game is good
26839,good
26840,"Ахуенная игра, 20 пидарасов-эдмундов и из 10"
26841,pretty good and addicting game can get pretty hard tho
26842,"I DO NOT have an addiction
maybe"
26843,"Brings me back to my happier childhood memories, though even setting nostalgia aside, the Repentance update has elevated Isaac from ""best roguelike""to ""genre defining."""
26844,"Theres no reason to have so much RNG with so much drawback. It's not creative, its just an arcade game without the ability to put up a score."
26845,Seks🤭
26846,its good
26847,it is a great rogue like game every run is diffrent and the best part the farther you get the easier it becomes because enemies dont scale
26848,"An absolute banger of a roguelike. If I was better at it, my hours would be atleast doubled"
26849,is good
26850,"One of the best rougelike game out there. Big learning curve with the items but once you searched platinum god a million times, shit will be ingrained in your head."
26851,bro i cant stop playing since repentance dropped help
26852,"I hate small, red spiders."
26853,very fun!
26854,i shoot poop with tears 10/10 would recommend
26855,"éteignez l'ordinateur

26861,its good
26862,"I've only played for 32 hours on PC. I have it on Switch and Xbox too. This game is amazing. It looks like a simple top down thumb stick shooter, and it kind of is but it has a huge depth which you get to learn. Recommend for anyone who enjoys the Rogue-lite genre."
26863,is a fun game
26864,Iz a good game
26865,I get hit a lot but its usually my fault. if you make it past the first floor the game is fun
26866,a good bullet hell that is so wacky it works
26867,me likey very much
26868,<3
26869,This game truly makes you feel like an abused 5 year old.
26870,"My favorite roguelike, and the one that got me into steam games. Huge part of my childhood"
26871,Isaac was simple. and they were both Isaac.
26872,its good
26873,Was really happy to see repentance being added as an official mod to this game and I'm really happy to be able to support its creators. 10/10 would eat random pills I find again.
26874,t'sa gud game
26875,funny scream
26876,A really good Rougelike
26877,"You litte F**ker
You made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker"
26878,I like to cry on turds.
26879,Gay baby jail: the video game
26880,"When you think of the greatest indie games of all time you think of FTL, Spelunky, and The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth. Now that repentance is finally out, it's time to return to the basement once more to find out all of its secrets.

I got real platinum god, then they added more content.
I got 1001%, then they added more content.
I got 1000000%, then they added more content.
I'm well on my way to getting really real (for real this time) platinum god (or something idk) so i hope they don't add more content.

Truly one of the best games of all time, highly recommended."
26881,brilliant game first had it on xbox then bought it here and I don't mind restarting. this game will give hundreds of hours of content and is in my personal the best roguelike to ever be made. I already loved the game with just AB+ but now with repentance this game has just so much stuff to do. final note and the only negative comment I will leave here. FUCK JACOB AND ESAU.
26882,":3
"
26883,"if you have a life then dont play this game, i can already feel an addiction coming"
26884,yep yep yep
26885,114 mom kills. Over 600 deaths. Yeah it's pretty fun.
26886,"This game is a certified banger, as are all its DLCs. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth takes everything I love about the rogue-like genre and combines it with a darkly comedic, obscene, blasphemous story and art-style that I cannot get enough of.
If you're a fan of the genre you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game and that's pretty much all I have to say."
26887,"This game is worth every penny, just buy it and enjoy the journey"
26888,"This game is fantastic, I love it. Buy now. Stop asking yourself what you are doing with your life. Immerse yourself in the lifestyle. Binding of Isaac is all of us."
26889,Poop!
26890,great game especially with repentance just coming out.
26891,It's a good rouge-like. Very hard but very good. Imagine dead cells but different.
26892,The Binding of Isaac game series is one of my all time favorites. It has the perfect amount of satire and sass along with awesome characters and game mechanics. I can proudly say I have wasted 2000 hours of my life playing this game.
26893,"I hate this game, it drives me to despair, everytime i play it i want to break my controller.

10/10 would recommend"
26894,When is the mod that adds Lady Dimitrescu mommy milkies and dump truck ass?
26895,i like it
26896,"Pros:
-Great gameplay
-Lots of fun interactions and hidden secrets
Cons:
-You better enjoy reading through the wiki cuz that's the only way to know what the items do"
26897,"This is one of the best roguelikes to have been made. There's a huge collection of characters, TONS of potential items that mutate your skills, and the combinations of items you collect can work together to create drastically bizarre and ridiculous skillsets that will either have you raging or jeering at everything. Almost 200 hours on record, and will likely be playing this for the rest of my life!"
26898,Amazing...
26899,is good
26900,It pretty good
26901,Near Perfection
26902,yes
26903,Why is Rebirth harder than Repentance?
26904,"Played this game since the Flash version.
Best game."
26905,yee
26906,I suck at this game but it is amazing
26907,Fun game. Lots of levels
26908,yes
26909,"Honestly, I find myself coming back to this game from time to time and never getting bored."
26910,"so bad, big poopy stinky bad gams"
26911,"Every game you load in to will be different from the last. Ten years of solid updates after the base game, and The Binding of Isaac is better than ever."
26912,Amazing.
26913,All my homies hate bloat
26914,Iv'e played around 2 hours and from what iv'e seen its a decent game

in 34 hours i haven't even completed 25% of the game."
26947,Really good game 11/10
26948,"ENDLESS fun.  This game is very simple to play yet the RNG dungeon layout, power ups, items, bosses, will always keep the game very intresting and exciting and fun. The more you play, the more you unlock.  See how strong you can become with the power ups!"

26963,"By far one of the best games ever made!
Don't judge it by it's look or it's graphics!
There is so much to do and to discover.
It has mod support for even more fun!

Don't ask! Just buy and enjoy.
DLC's recommended!"
26964,just perfect
26965,I have played this way more than recorded here because I have bought this game on multiple platforms. It's amazing and there's so much to unlock AND the newest DLC really did change the game entirely. Entertainingly frustrating at worst immense and ever changing at its best. I love this game
26966,"awesome game, played it first on the nintendo 3ds and now i am here. planning to buy all the dlcs as well"
26967,Yes.
26968,"Best game i've played on steam, play this game if you are looking for a game that is seemingly endless and you want challenges because this game brings a lot of those. The only downside is that sometimes some characters are needed to unlock items such as the lost and he is really hard to play but if you're good then you should be fine."
26969,good game
26970,I've defeated randomness. 17/05/21

26974,gud gaem
26975,"Absolutely addicting roguelite which gives you heaps of new content the more you play, and really rewards getting good at the game."
26976,"Rebirth is one of my absolute favorite games. 1300+ hours and I enjoyed the majority of it. Now that Repentance is out, Isaac has been completely ruined. I've deleted the game and will only ever play it again with Repentance uninstalled. What a shame. Ed ruined a great game and doesn't want to admit that his DLC isn't all sunshine and roses. He's lost any good will I had towards his games."
26977,If you like dungeon crawlers you'll love Isaac. It's very dark and disturbing but perfect in my opinion.
26978,the game is very fun but very challenging for nooby players but would recommend you try it 10/10
26979,I won't stop until I've found all the possible synergies of collectibles
26980,A must have in your collection. One of the best Rogue-Lite out there!
26981,Please help everything is exploding for no reason because I picked up something called ipecac please help
26982,"There is so much in this game, it's very hard to get bored. I love how much thought has been put into the synergies. Repentance was an amazing end to this game"
26983,"Never played it, but it looks fun"
26984,horrible
26985,isaac
26986,just yes
26987,the binding of isaac is one of the video games

27006,Very cool gameplay!
27007,"""I've played a fair amount of video games (in my time, he almost added). 

Some brilliant triple-A, big studio releases and some quirky Indie gems that seem to run on wild ideas and improbable coding alone. Never before, however, have I played a game that hates its player as much as The Binding Of Isaac does. The first time you beat the game you just unlock an epilogue that makes the first six chapters look like cake (and they aren't). Then there are ten different endings for each time you can manage to get through the 'final boss'.

Just got through my sixth playthrough. Played the epilogue flawlessly, without taking any damage. And the game rewarded me by officially announcing that it was done horsing around, and then thrusting me into a new bossfight that kicked me in the nuts and then just kept on kicking. The visuals are all out of some twisted suburban nightmare, and like all the best roguelikes, you're thrust helpless and unequipped into each new game (literally as a naked infant, in this case).

So, um. Give it a go if you haven't already.""

I wrote this out to my Facebook friends in '13, after playing the original Flash version. I have since spent even longer with Rebirth (the hours on this Steam account are just the tip of the iceberg).  The game is even more vast now ([i]vast-er[/i] ?), runs smoothly (apart from the occasional crash(es) just before a major update comes out - could that be a feature?) and has a bunch of deft visual touches that go beyond a cutesy child's eye view of Monstro City.

I never got to try Antibirth (although Forgotten Lullaby is tied for my favorite Isaac track alongside the opening themes and Sacrificial - check out db and Ridiculon and Mudeth before you get this!) even though it had the best trailer of all time. 

However, every bit of content that trickled into the actual game was proof of many hours spent pondering the mechanics and lore and artstyle, and now Repentance has turned an already diverse game into a macrocosm of all the insanity that can fit within a troubled child's imagination.

It is by no means a happy game. In fact it is as sobering as the myth from which it draws its premise - but just like that myth, it lends a semblance of cohesion to the stark existential horror of a self-aware consciousness knotted tight into its fixed endpoints.

[spoiler] Also there is an item called The Poop that lets you generate poops that provide temporary cover from monsters that look just like you but for the leering grins and bloody tears replacing your sorrow [/spoiler]

The reason I am writing this review (instead of pestering my friends to play the online co-op, which lets us double-team the descent into madness as long as I have a controller and some bandwidth) is because Repentance added actual, physical violin-stings-as-you-fall-off-your-chair body horror back to the game, and it did so by subverting my familiarity with the enemies and mechanics. 

Exposed brains now slide out of invulnerable skeletons and chase you instead of acting as weak points, and flooded levels often have something waiting underfoot for you to kill the last enemy and let your fingers drift smugly from the keyboard...

The achievements and hours here are retreads of things I have already done on my friends' battered laptops and janky P2P builds. 

I am saving the new levels and mechanics and endgame(s) for when my old crowd tires of slaying dragons and shooting demons in the face and doing other things that fall under the broad purview of [i] not [/i] playing Isaac. 

I am saving them so we can let a five-year-old's innermost apocalypse scare us and humble us before reminding us that helplessness is a temporary state, prevailing over our horrors by taking the shape of their nightmares, and taking us to the one place where cancer beats a mystery present wrapped up nice and tight.

[spoiler] Mainly because the damned giftbox almost always yields The Poop [/spoiler]

The unknown depths await."

27030,Once you get past the disturbed and ugly content you're rewarded with one of the most addicting games ever made. Just utterly fantastic with each good run bringing something interesting to the table. This and Slay The Spire are the hallmarks of the roguelite genre.

I'm a privileged white man!
There's lots of things about oppression I don't understand

I think that everyone
Is born the same!
But somehow inside of my tiny white brain
I have a idea that I'm better!
So that's why I'm the privileged male oppressor

Yeas I have been privileged
Since day one!
Raised in a household where my mum
Fed me lots of food and gave me lots of love!
Because I'm a privileged white male!

I'm so privileged! I'm privileged! I'm privileged as fuck!
I'm privileged! I'm privileged! I'm racist! I'm scum!

27046,"Learned about this game from a Youtuber I enjoy, bought it after watching him play a couple games and have not been disappointed yet. The main part i enjoy about this game is that you can almost never have the same experience in game, and there are HUNDREDS of unique items with more being added very frequently. If you're debating purchasing this game, i'd recommend watching a video or two and see if it strikes your fancy."

27061,"this game is great, i love it, but god can Rotgut PLEASE get fixed?
the way they are right now, several types of runs can just get softlocked on their third phase.
it's absolutely a pain, and i lost a perfectly fine Dr. Fetus run to it. not ok that the third phase can just invalidate your entire run because you picked up Spirit Sword or Dr. Fetus randomly on like Downpour 2. bad boss design.

EDIT: Can we NOT have the f*cking alt path doors be locked behind rng bullsh*t? I would really appreciate it if I didn't have to restart a great-looking run because ""teehee u don't have key :)))"". That's just bad f*cking design."

"
27120,"Used to be a great game before Repentance, but the latest expansion just filled it with rage-fuel. Nearly all the good items were nerfed, all the mechanics were shuffled around and changed seemingly for no reason other than because some Youtubers were able to consistently have game-breaking runs."

27142,this game is the fucking worst i love it
27143,It's really cool
27144,"A very fun, and addicting but challenging game! It has unforgiving moments and bad items, but mostly it's all the time very rewarding to play! You always get more to do. And even when you 100% the entire game and get all of the achievements, there is still replayability! Endless amounts of seeds, so many cool synergies between varying items, 34 or so characters, secrets and MUCH MORE! This game is GREAT for the cost of it, seriously, some games cost $60 and you'll have ONE playthrough, before getting bored and regretting your choice, but this full game (with the DLC's) costs only $51 and you will NEVER get bored of it! There's even mods that the community makes, and you can make some too, so even MORE replayability. Probably the best game I've ever played, so it gets the PERFECT 10/10 from me."
27145,"very fun, i'm shit though"
27146,"""I feel like I should make a negative review for this game because it's too hard, despite the fact that it's already achieved it's main goal, which was being a bullet hell shooter in the first place.""

Even that is not guaranteed, the normal mode is like Hard on the last mode.  I suggest keeping the old version, this one is very needlessly punishing."

27258,"“Instruction in world history in the so-called high schools is even today in a very sorry condition. Few teachers understand that the study of history can never be to learn historical dates and events by heart and recite them by rote; that what matters is not whether the child knows exactly when this battle or that was fought, when a general was born, or even when a monarch (usually a very insignificant one) came into the crown of his forefathers. No, by the living God, this is very unimportant. To 'learn' history means to seek and find the forces which are the causes leading to those effects which we subsequently perceive as historical events.”

27320,"Isaac has been in my life for as long as I have had Steam. 
Through highs and lows, I can always count on Isaac to both humble me and remind me of the unpredictability of life.

If you've followed the rougelike genre for any length of time, you've likely heard about the Binding of Isaac, so I'll keep this brief.
If you're new here, may I direct you to Northernlion's YouTube page for further study.
The game is utterly laden with synergies, legitimate challenges to test your mettle, literally hundreds of items and enemies, dozens of endings...the list can go on to speak to the game's depth.

Even after thousands of hours put into the game, there's always new mixtures of items to explore and test. 
For the replay-ability alone, I can STRONGLY recommend the game at it's standard $15 price point. 

If you happen to get bored of the standard game, you can always look to the DLC content to add dozens of new items, enemies, challenges, and endings to keep you satisfied in the long term. 

The learning curve to the game is relatively simple and the gameplay loop is apparent from the start, The average run can take you anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour depending on how min-max-ish you want to play.

Even at 166 hours played at the time of this review, I haven't seen anything close to the full spectrum of the game.
(P.S. The wiki is VERY helpful to give you an idea of what items in the game do, as well as give helpful tips to better your play style.)"

27335,"i love this game so much. after stumbling upon the flash demo randomly i was instantly addicted. 3 years ago now i got rebirth for the ds and i do not regret it. and upon recently getting vanilla isaac, i saw how much nicalis and his team improved the game over the span of 5 years. And so far repentance has not disappointed me. This is a great game for people who have time on their hands and want to spend it having fun. There are MANY playable characters, bosses, items, and different floors. The rush you get in the heat of the moment is insane, and its SUPER rewarding when you finally beat that one boss and get a really good item, or when you get an insane, game winning combo. theres no limit to fun with this game and i highly recommend putting your time and money into this game"

I played BOI 1 and sunk 50 hours but it never kept me playing but BOI 2 plus all DLCs is absolutely massive. There's an untold amount of combinations you can have and in my 26 hours I've had some ridiculous amalgamations.

Best roguelike bar none.
"
27356,"Great game. I can see myself playing it for many hundreds hours to come. All DLCs 100% recommended, I can't live without them anymore. Repentance solidified this game as one of the greatest roguelikes of all time.

27377,"This game feels like it was started (at least conceptually) by a sixteen-year-old edgelord, and then was lovingly built upon until it became the perfect game. I have racked up the hours in this game quickly. There are so many combinations of items and different synergies, that every round feels new and fresh. 

Easily one of the best roguelikes of all time."
27378,"This game is awful, frustrating, I hate it, and half of the things that go wrong are either yourself being bad, or just bad luck. The DLC for this game, all of it, just adds more suffering - now with different flavours! I hate this game as much as I hate myself. And I wouldn't really want it any other way. TL:DR - Game is pog, worth every penny tbh. Very fun, semi-enjoyable pain.

P.S - Lumps can suck a fat one, and so can Bloat. Fat pr*ck."
27379,Gud Game has some bosses here and there.
27380,"makes no sense, is still best game ever"
27381,Great game poggers
27382,"This game will give you hours and hours of fun.  The floors are unique, the enemies and bosses bring a nice challenge, and the transitions between each floor give the humor to lighten up the dark atmosphere of the game. The items range from fun to insane. There is literal ipecac as an item that turns your projectiles into bombs! I give the game an 8/10. There can be aspects of the game that are annoying depending on the enemy/floor, or rng."
27383,"fun and well rounded rogue-like. give it a try if you haven't.
"
27384,"This game is a masterpiece. Not only is it trying something new, but it gives me nostalgia to other games from my childhood. This game is a work of art, making a seemingly cute game gruesome. I have played this game for 130 hours and can't put it down. This is rouge like done right."
27385,"It's a really good roguelike, I've played it for 400+ hrs on multiple platforms. The cartoon-y look of it hides a pretty messed up lore if you piece all the cutscenes together; hell, if you're not sure the setting/story is for you, watch the pre-title screen cutscene first, it gives a taste of the tone for the rest of the story content. All the DLC is worth it, in my opinion. At time of review, the newest DLC, Repentance, does not include mod support and is rough around the edges, but the devs have said that they're working on patching in mod support and have ironed out a lot of the bugs in the current updates.

edit: 7/3/2022
My feelings remain the same, and it's had mod support for a while now."

27393,My third time purchasing this game.
27394,"I adore this game! if you like rougelike dungeon crawlers, you'll love this game. It's got graphics that are both cute and creepy at the same time, and the style is timeless. Just be ready to die a lot!"
27395,Yeah this game is fun
27396,yes
27397,"I've been watching this game on youtube since 2013 and i really liked the concept, i even learned a lot about item synergies long before playing it for the first time and once i started playing it i realized how difficult it is to play it and stopped playing it in less than a week. After a year or two I picked it up on switch to give it another chance and the same thing happened, it is super hard and devastating at the beginning, but if you push yourself you start get comfortable with the controls and start finishing floors. The third time I gave it a chance is when i finally got hooked and now I'm writing this review.

You constantly feel the progression and i really love that. It took me 17 hours to beat mom's foot for the first time, and it felt amazing, almost as good as how you feel when you rank up in cs. The great thing about this game is how deep it is, once you beat mom's foot then you have the next objective, mom's heart, and then you have satan, isaac and many more, you unlock them progressively so you always have something new to go for. This goes for more than 400 hours or at least that what I've been told, and there is no other offline game that gives you this experience as far as I know.

The only problem I've found about this game is how hard it is to start, even knowing how great the game is, it took me more than 5 years to start playing it myself instead of watching others play. This may differ from other people but if you get easily frustrated like me it is hard to keep going.

I would say this is one of my top 5 favourite games of all time, and i bought it less than 2 months ago.

27506,Best Rougelike
27507,"First of all let me say I really like this Game.
But with the most recent DLC they managed to fuck everything up and suck the last bit of Joy out of the Game. Every item that once was good was nerfed, while garbage Items havent received any notable buffs.
Yes there are still tons of fun Combos but with the vast amout of Items in the Game it is impossible to count on that alone.
On top of that there are several items, that just instantly end your run. And i even get that. Bad Items make good ones actually look good and you dont feel like everything is an indistinquishable mess.
This was one of the points i fell in love with Isaac before. Every run is different and interesting because of that. But between the nerfs and the buffs to/ introduction of new enemies and items you can very well need a Minute or even more in a single Room on Floor 1. And most of the time its not getting better past that.
For me the game isnt about skill any more. ist just a constant Annoyance filled with artificial Difficulty, not actually well designed Enemies and Items. 
The new Charactes and new Chapter add a lot of replayablity but the Characters are badly balanced as well. Some are incredibly fun to play with, because of different mechanics or their ability to deal with bad RNG. Some are just plain Garbage and not even worth mentioning.
In Conclusion: Isaac was a great Game, and i really would like to recommend it, but unless you are into self-flaggelation i simply cant do it (any more)."
27508,Yes.
27509,ahah crying kid goes brrrrrr
27510,"One of the best rogue-likes/rogue-lites out there. Beat it on xbox with just rebirth, but the DLC is definitely worth buying it on PC. Repentance and afterbirth/afterbirth+ are awesome."
27511,Extremely underwhelming DLC
27512,It's a very fun game. I dont know what else to say. I only have the afterbirth dlc as i didnt have enough money for afterbirth+ or repentance but. Its still very fun even though i dont have as much content as everyone else

27522,"This is the one roguelike game you will get addicted to. If roguelike games threw you off in the past,this is the one you will enjoy trust me. Oh and yes there is so much to do and so little time lol."
27523,baby cry lol
27524,"Sometimes this game makes me want to maul a child, sometimes it makes me want to do a lil happy dance"
27525,"  This game is fantastic, you begin your first run as the weak little Isaac, shooting tiny tears at a slow rate which don't do much damage, but by the end, you shoot giant lasers which kill the hardest bosses with ease. 
 Now, the sweet, sweet progression, you complete challenges and progress through the game, unlocking multiple new items, bosses, floors, characters and enemies, the number of things you can unlock is out right insane.
 And lastly, the lore, now obviously, there will be spoilers ahead.
 The story starts out with Isaac and his mother, when Isaac's mother suddenly tries to kill him, so Isaac, trying to escape, runs down to the basement, and keeps going lower to escape her, but later it is found out, that none of this is true, and he has been suffocating in his toy chest, so Isaac, is dead.
 Great game, buy it now.
"
27526,"Overall: Repentance fixed almost ALL of the issues of the game being to easy, and in itself it's a blast to come back to every once in a while"
27527,Isaac is a crybaby. 10/10
27528,very luck based for playing but other than that great game!
27529,"I'm 130 hours in and have only unlocked 40% of the achievements (dlcs included). The replayability is insane and I still encounter items I've never seen before (and I'm not talking newly unlocked items). I really like this game, especially getting those runs with wacky item combos that just obliterate whole rooms."
27530,BAD GAME. it made me happy
27531,This game gives me pain and joy but i still love it
27532,"Very much an excellent game, never in my life would i think a game about a crying child that has to run from his mother and the fuck shit she's going through would be consistently fun and entertaining. 12/10 wouldn't buy it again."
27533,Hours upon hours of game play that changes each time you start a new run.
27534,Cry baby
27535,HELP I CANT STOP PLAYING

27543,The Repentance changes are absolutely for the better.
27544,"amazing lol
"
27545,Replayable
27546,It's Isaac. Lots of variance in runs. The only thing I don't like about this game is Niantic.
27547,Game where you play as a crying child and avoid glowing balls and beams.
27548,"Played it once or twice, it's pretty ok."
27549,This game can improve your anxiety.
27550,"Everything is pretty cake in the new expansion except... 

Still waiting for mod support in Repentance
Spiked rocks hit box is TOO big
Delirium can sometimes bug out and create two copies of itself at a time

Regardless of these small inconveniences, its a GREAT game and well worth the purchase"
27551,cool
27552,this is such a good game strongly sagest buying
27553,yea man this games good
27554,"good game, much to do"
27555,"i was playing the lost and i had PSY FLY AND BRIMSTONE and then i went to fight the boss and INSTANTLY DIED because two blue gurdy jrs charged me the instant i walked into the room. I HAD NO TIME TO REACT AND LOST A GOOD FUCKING RUN

I HATE THIS GAME"
27556,It's good.
27557,"One of the top favorite games. I've been playing it for years and each DLC gives me more motivation to play and unlock more items. The replayability is insane and it doesn't feel tedious at all. It's the right amount of challenging. Even though I've been playing for years, I still have trouble with some runs and I like that. I LOVE the art style. People think I'm crazy because I think this game is so cute. I love it. Combines my love for gore and cuteness. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
27558,"Holding R key for 15 minutes sometimes, but when things finally fall into place, it can get pretty great pretty quick"
27559,worth ngl
27560,I'm gonna one trick azazel
27561,This game is as good as it is fucked up.
27562,It's okay
27563,"fun
"
27564,"Repentance just bloats the crap items and makes a really fun run almost impossible.  Did a little test today and told myself I'd reset if I didn't have either a damage or tears up by the end of floor 2.  I reset 37 times.  Holy shit the base game is good and every expansion up until this one, but Repentance just fucks with your time and doesn't want you to have fun...ever.  Everything was nerfed.  I decided to try and unlock b-side blue baby.   Four runs later, I still hadn't seen a spirit heart...maybe one tinted rock in four runs...and never broke 5.0 damage all the way to Mom and beyond.

Maybe I have the worst possible luck in human history, but it just seems like a boring slog now.  I recommend everything up until this last disaster, now it's just agony."
27565,Very fun game
27566,Good Game will play again

27573,"A fun dungeon crawler with a ton of fun synergies. There is an amazing amount of content, and the difficulty curve is beautiful. I own 4 or 5 copies of this game because it's that good."
27574,"You may never finish this game. You may never even get close. But that slow climb to the top, the items you unlock bit by bit, the completion marks slowly acquired, that journey is worth every penny, every hour spent."

27591,good game excellent pacing and fun difficulty if you are religous and can handle a few pokes go for it if not then i suggest avoid it they use varius allegories for the game so if you can handle a few pokes play it it is a god game!
27592,"Fav game 
changed my mind on it being luck based, you can control it pretty well I just kept playing issac and not had fun, now I play eve and it has made all the difference"
27593,"Great game and easy to recommend. It is a very easy to pick up and play game

9/10"
27594,The game is pretty fun
27595,"I'm in love with this game. However, I also hate it with every fiber of my being. Repentance started off great, adding new items and floors. But it fell off real quick when every good item and synergy got nerfed. Some items that were super good are now straight dog water. And don't get me started with the multiplayer. Its not real multiplayer, its remote play. Its so laggy that its not even worth using. So my final verdict with this game is that if you really want it, get afterbirth not repentance."

27627,its cool ig idk havent gotten too far into it
27628,This is a positive review.
27629,awesome game
27630,Yes.
27631,"During it's original flash release, to Wrath of the Lamb, and then Rebirth and Afterbirth, I used to love this game. I put several hundred hours over both games, getting 100% completion. Afterbirth+ murdered my interest in the game. Whereas before I'd be hyped to see all the new content, I instead saw a poorly made mess, which only really served a good purpose of allowing mod support. After that, I thought I'd be done with The Binding of Isaac. That I'd played it too much, and simply burnt out forever.

Repentance changed that very quickly.

I went into Repentance with a pessimistic mindset. I thought ""I haven't really played recently, I didn't like the last expansion. I'll give it a try but I probably won't play as much as I used to.""

That was roughly 300 hours in gameplay ago.

Repentance is an absolutely incredible expansion to the game, adding - as advertised - many hundreds of hours of possible gameplay. The change in difficulty to Hard actually challenges even veteran players, and actually is what it says - hard. The overwhelming amount of new synergies and buffs makes even some stale, oft looked past items suddenly very powerful (looking at you, soy milk). With that, though, certain ""won run"" items were nerfed, particularly the fan-favourite brimstone receiving the equivalent of a 30% damage nerf. Though understandable, it is still sad to see.

While I fully recommend the game (if you have the free time for it), I won't say it is without it's problems. Repentance did not release fully finished, and as such certain features remain unpolished. Even moreso, the final final area of the game is still a mess, and though we are promised a rework, it has been like that since its addition in Afterbirth+. There are also several characters that can be classified as ""challenge characters"", however some of these feel like they're less of a challenge of winning, and more of a challenge of finding how to have fun with them.

Looking past that though, the game is incredibly packed with content, and with the constant unlocks you get, each run feels more interesting than the last. If you want one of the best roguelike experiences on Steam, you're looking in the right place."
27632,Fantastic game <3
27633,edfkmnsdljfnjlkfe
27634,"I have this on my laptop and console, with roughly eighty hours between the two, and each run has been totally different. I’ve been surrounded by floating minions firing spiders, flies and blood in all directions. And on another one I was spewing rainbow coloured blood vomit that bounced off the walls. Very original and highly addictive. Whenever I have half hour to kill I stick Isaac on, if only to see the monstrosity he’ll become. And repentance has made a good thing great. It’s added even more to a game already bursting with content. Can’t recommend it enough."
27635,"bad
edit: I am on my 3rd save I cannot stop playing help"
27636,"Set in the imagination of a child of trauma and religion, Isaac is a golden pillar of modern Rogue-likes, packed with secrets, powerful combos and unfair, alt-f4 inducing enemy spawns. Although it can feel like a bit of a slow grind to start, and with some later unlocks requiring luck more than skill, Isaac still presents the player with many interesting decisions which let you wager your skills against the games systems.
The latest DLC doubles down on this, increasing risk and reward, as well as adding tons of synergies and interactions between items.

Good:
Hours of gameplay and lore content for a reasonable price.
Great potential for screen filling God runs.
Diverse characters with different play styles.
Many secrets and strategies make for lots of room to git gud.

Meh:
Many enemies fit a archetype too well; there are countless of monsters which mostly just run at you, and many more who are just a variation of a shooting turret.
Once you get a God run and unleash hell upon the world, a regular run is a lot less rewarding to grind through.

Bad:
Restarting the game to get a good start is tedious.
With so many items being locked behind achievements, it can feel unrewarding to unlock something near the end of your Isaac experience, to then only get to try it once or twice."
27637,thumbs up
27638,good
27639,since when
27640,"Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an immensely entertaining game where each game feels fresh and new no matter how long I play it. And now, with the new Repentance DLC, there's re-vamped multiplayer, added items and bosses, as well as new characters to play. The games difficulty can seem daunting initially, but it scales up nicely and is very easy to learn as you go. My only gripe is the lack of a comprehensive in-game encyclopedia to help decipher what each object does (there's some fantastic wiki articles out there as well as mods--once support is added again). Finding new synergies between items and building overpowered runs is always a great time. I'd recommend this game to anyone that wants something you can pick up and play or for people who love collecting a vast amount of virtual trinkets."

My favorite boss is dingle and my favorite trinket is the Petrified poop. My favorite challenge is challenge number 2. I love the poop in this game so so so so so much oh my god"
27713,"I'm still nowhere near completing this game, but I'll give my current thoughts on this game without the DLC. First of all, this game will kick your ass. It's hard. Second of all, this is the first roguelike I've ever played, and I've loved every second of it. There are so many things to unlock, and most item effects combine. The game has been amazing for me so far, even if you don't like roguelikes, give this a shot. You won't regret it.

100 hours, £30 and 1 edit later, I can safely say that this is one of the best games I have ever played not only this year, but ever. It's addictive. It's fun. You will not regret it."
27714,"This is by far one of my most favorite games I've ever played. There are so many items/trinkets in this game, and there are synergies for EVERYTHING.

27722,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

27740,"This is probably the only game I really play on any console really. I'm totally down for other games but this one, for some reason I can't get tired of. If you have Nintendo switch, buy a copy of the game on their platform... or a really badass laptop, super useful for long trips, solo."
27741,I started loving my life again after getting into Isaac again after years. I think Edmund has found cure for depression
27742,"I will say that this is, in my opinion, the best roguelike game ever created. I wasn't sure until Repentance came out, because it has a few flaws such as repetitive sequences of the same enemies and room layouts. Of course that is completely up to luck, but if it happens noticeably often, I think it's fair to call it a flaw.

With the additions of Repentance, this is by far the deepest, most impressive and plain fun game of its kind. Tons of items that are hard-coded to combine beautifully as one might imagine, or in even more creative ways. Huge enemy and boss variety. Lots of characters each with their own optimal playstyles, which is even more pronounced with the new ""tainted"" versions. I have many more hours on this game than is written on this account, and I can guarantee that anyone with an open mind and willingness to be challenged by the learning curve, will love it.

If anyone's interested in the story, there are tons of endings that happen after certain events such as boss kills that each signify a part (or a version) of the bigger picture, but I am not myself sure how they all fit together into a coherent story. It's full of biblical references and analogies that one could ponder for hours and make theories. The final ending of repentance brings a more specific and tangible end to the story but I still believe there's room for interpretation."
27743,"i like this game 

fun"
27744,Very spoopers 9/10 a little too hard but thats the point so
27745,"Difficult to learn, difficult to master. With Repentance this game has incredible depth and polish, the base game seems very small looking back but it's still plenty for a new Isaac player to enjoy."
27746,Nice gameplay and replayability.
27747,"What do I have to say it's isaac, buy it if you haven't"
27748,good gameplay and story
27749,good game
27750,epic game my dudes
27751,this game is something that brought rougelikes to the mainstream media it is probably one of the greatest games ive ever bought its fun from your first run figuring out how to play to buying the dlcs and downloading mods just to get that sweet fix of more binding of isaac yes this game will turn you into a crack addict of rouge likes
27752,"great game, shitload of content, somewhat frustrating but overall fun to play again and again"
27753,"This game is fun, don't play it if you have a life or anything. Also screw spider AI, like damn wtf"
27754,S tier
27755,fun
27756,sheeesh its bussinnnnnn
27757,"well first of all i like isaac and my frineds naem is isaac and he laighs when i polay this game haha. it is a very fun game and has alot and i mean A LOT of items, etc. lots of reasons to replay the game because you wont ever play the same thing twice. i knowits not multiplayer but like i said its like im am playing with my frined isaac cause thats his name haha. wish i could buy it twice!"
27758,"Long story short: this game is great.
Okay, let me explain.
 I love this game. It frustrates and makes me experience true and unbridled gamer rage sometimes, but it's great. It's so satisfying unlocking different items, characters, areas, and endings. The thing that is frustrating me the most right now, however, is the unlocking. Some of it is way too convoluted, even for a guy like me, who loves unlocking things. I've unlocked most characters, but the ones I have remaining feel like such a chore to unlock. Like, you have to unlock an area, then beat a boss as a specific character, and then die in a room with an item you unlock from beating said boss, I KNOW that the character is a challenge character and it's supposed to be like that, but still. Some of the balancing feels off (specifically in Repentance, though). I'm complaining too much. Another thing that I adore is how great it feels when you just get the PERFECT synergy! It feels great mowing down bosses and clearing rooms in two seconds. I'm an Azazel main by the way, if it wasn't clear from how much I complained. 

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
9/10 because I like the lore, the characters, the items, and the variety."

27830,"Only going off afterbirth since i don't have Afterbirth + and Repentance, Real broke hours rn, the game has alot to do and develops the more you play due to unlocks by playing characters and completing challenges ,the combination of items results in silly builds which add to its replay value ,the story is good and quite dark which stands out from the somewhat childlike imagery that can appear in the game , but underlines more dark themes which i find well implemented. without the DLCS of afterbirth + and repentance you quickly get use to the enemies which is both good and bad as you can better fight them but can get tiresome however the game play loop is still great and is one of the if not the best rougelikes on the market which i think anyone new to the genre will enjoy"

27864,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

27905,"The Repentance DLC gave this game the last vestige of replayability I didn't realize it was lacking. This is an incredible roguelike with highly tuned and carefully balanced encounter design, item design, boss design, etc, etc. The game's DNA defines a lot of what we see in modern roguelites.

27941,Outstanding! Endlessly replayable. I would recommend Isaac to everyone!
27942,"I had a good time with this one. Issac is pretty hard to beat your first time through like any rouge-like, you'll have to come back and triumph over the odds against you with increased skill and a little bit of luck. However, I think that successful runs usually boil down to what items you get in what order. Sure, there's tons of combinations of items available to the player, but some are definitely more overpowered than others. Some runs you'll get a crusted cum sock and others you'll get a glock that can one hit every boss in the game. In that regard I do believe that the game leans heavily on luck rather than skill. but there is most definitely a skill ceiling present. You have to be able to actually PLAY the game rather than hope that items and power-ups carry you through it. I find it fun to start from nothing and claw my way to being op as fuck. It's rewarding sense of progression is definitely real, I just don't think that casual game reviewers that give up after twenty minutes will be able to play it. Essentially, just like other games, you have to play to get better. Other than that, Issac's unique art-style and soundtrack really bolster the vibe present. I don't think I could recommend this to just anyone, but if you like a challenge and the rouge-like genre I would probably put you on to this."
27943,"Since its release in 2014 iv played Isaac across four accounts on three different platforms. I've purchased rebirth and its DLCs 3 times now, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Iv put almost 500 hours in, plan to double that, and not only are there still things to do, there are still things i'm learning. Not an easy game to get into by any means though. It will require a LOT of time, patience, and above all else trial and error before you even have a decent understanding of the game (although modding the game can help ease this process), but once you do it will be very rewarding. This game also benefits tremendously from each of its DLCs. Everyone basically multiplies the amount of content by x1.5. Each one adding hundreds of new items, trinkets, enemies, bosses, secrets, challenges, endings, etc... Even the art and music which I almost never acknowledge in gaming is absolutely perfect in this game. I'm usually a harsh critic but honestly I can't think of anything bad to say about this game other than the fact that its pretty unforgiving to new players, buy it.    10/10

TLDR: This game is a must have, mileage will vary depending on the amount of time you're able to invest though."
27944,After watching my brother play for a while and making it look easy I thought ill give it a crack... OH MY DAYS!!! I got handed my arse over and over put it down and walked away. Came back to it with the new update and while still hard as balls I made progress and it managed to get me hooked again. Ill be putting in many more hours for sure.
27945,best game played it since 2000 something love the rebirth
27946,"Binding of Isaac Rebirth is an roguelike game where you shoot your tears on sh*ts, worms, your mother and demons. The game may look simple and cute but the deeper you get, the harder it gets. The game also features biblical contents like heaven and hell, the 7 deadly sins, SATAN, and dealing with the devil. 

Despite its cute and simple looks the game has many mature or horrid references. The story of the game is also pretty sad and dark but I will not discuss it because TRY IT YOURSELF. Anyways  The game has many stages and the more you play the more items,bosses and areas you unlock. Also there are total of 11 characters in base game and 34 with all DLCs, with some having different playstyles. 

Items, The items in this game is not always beneficial, some having mostly negative effects and some having Good ones. The game will make you learn about which item to get and not to get. The items also has synergies specially in repentance DLC where they fix most awkward item interactions. 

This game is great and has a tons of replayability and almost each run is unique. Even the base game will take you about 200+ hours to complete all marks and challenges. Thats why I suggest buying the base game first, It's pretty cheap and if you like it, buy all the DLCs, It makes the game more difficult and adds tons of content into it. 

anyways its 9/10 for me. FUCK bobs brain, FUCK the Wiz, FUCK my reflections, FUCK THE BLOAT, FUCK DELIRIUM, FUCK GURDLINGS AND TURDLINGS GOD I HATE THIS GAME."
27947,;-;
27948,Remove every spider in this game pls.
27949,"one of my favourite games ever, ive completed most of the switch version but i am only buying this for the early DLC :D"
27950,"I totally want to give this game a thumbs down, but I know that others will enjoy it. Here's why I want to give it a thumbs down:


Isaac is becomes a chore to play after a long time because in terms of getting achievements and ""progressing"" (I say that in quotations marks because at the point where I am, I'm not really progressing at all) the game is like hitting a big wooden log with a mallet to destroy it. You'll see why. This is coming from a guy with 91% achievement completion at 387 at the time of writing this.


At first, when you install the game you get achievements, breaking the log, like crazy. This keeps for a while, but around 35% game completion, your log breaking progress has slowed down greatly. Not because of your hammer, but the log it's self. The wood becomes more and more compact as you hit it again and again. 
Getting achievements becomes harder, because runs become more demanding, not only in terms of skill , but demanding in terms of luck and time. 


The game requires you to reset your run about 30 times before getting a good item to start, which is luck based and takes a long time. The bosses get harder, and the characters get worse. So when you start getting to the [spoiler]tainted characters[/spoiler], the log is practically stone. 


Around 55%, you'll have most of the marks for the normal characters, forcing you to do everything on hard mode for them just to get one achievement and unlock one useless thing that you can't even use. And the [spoiler]tainted characters are a pain in the ass to use, except for a few which are good but still very annoying to play as. These characters are clones of the basic characters, and are on a separate page on the character select screen. The tainted characters have similar looks and mechanics to their original character but have an added mechanic and a down side. This sounds fun, right? Meh. The upside/the new mechanic is much smaller than the down side and they become a challenge to play.[/spoiler]


[spoiler]Most of them don't change enough of the character to even call it a new character, yet they are still hard to play as. There are even some tainted characters that make the game nearly impossible at times, like a character than has a grand total of 0 health and cannot take any hits for the entirety of the run, or another that has a phantom chasing you and if it touches you. You get kicked out of your body and only your spirit is left behind, from this point you can't take any hits until the next floor where you regain your body. But the phantom still chases you.[/spoiler]


Binding of Isaac is a fantastic game, and I think you should play it, but just not for too long. I'm a big steam achievement guy, so I like to do everything possible inside a game. Dying in the game is extremely punishing at times. You could have all the best items in a game in an hour long run, then lose it to one bad item and a random explosion. This game becomes incredibly frustrating when trying to do certain tasks, especially on hard mode (which is required for completion). You can play with a friend to get an advantage and get marks faster, but after doing that for a while, I feel weak from doing this. But this game has so many little random tasks inside of it. It's just gets exhausting after a while...

P.S. I may of may not have a mental disorder, so this may create bias."

27953,"One of the best rogue-likes out there, and one of the pioneers of the modern indie rogue-like genre. I've sunk countless hours into it, more than just seen here on Steam, both in this and the original flash version. I recommended it, and all the DLCs."
27954,Why live life when you can play Isaac over and over and over again?
27955,Best expansion
27956,"The game is great, but I can't get my save file in afterbirth+ into repentance. Instead it is using my save from rebirth which is like 10 hours in. I don't want to have to play 150 hours just to get back to where I was originally and I hope the developers find some way to make it possible to transfer my save data from afterbirth+.  I would still recommend the game though, I'm just pretty frustrated by this issue."
27957,This game is super fun for anyone who needs a game with tons of content! this game has hundreds of items and even when I lose I don't get mad. I just feel so happy playing this game! I have so much fun no matter what happens I recommend this game to anyone who needs a game to play for a LONG TIME
27958,it's good I think
27959,i think it's alright
27960,is gud
27961,"Endless hours of gameplay, so many things to play with, so many unlockable items and so many characters, and even if you finish all challenges and all unlockable milestones you can have so many different gameplays with your favorite character."
27962,"One of the best games PERIOD.

Buy this game!"
27963,worst game ever
27964,"It's a fun game, lil bit harder harder with the last expansion. But a great game overall."
27965,"I have played isaac for years and in four diferent platforms so i love it, i am also loving repentance now however i am not a fan of some of the nerfs like tech X which i know is more dynamic with more synergies but still i wish it wasnt nerfed, I however am 100% NOT ok with the changes to the stores, why are their level random now? what was the point in leveling them up before if now were going to get anything, hopefully this is something that is patched un the near future (PLEASE let it be patched!!!!!!)"
27966,This game is great even when its harder to all the piss babies in chat get good and learn to play the game :)
27967,funny number
27968,I've played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox but I couldn't wait for the new dlc and I'm definitely pleased with the decision.
27969,"Definitivamente é um dos melhores jogos rogue like que eu já joguei (se não o melhor), o jogo tem inúmeras sinergias entre os itens, que tornam as runs bem interessantes como também possuí muitos desafios que tornam [b]o jogo em si[/b] muito interessante. O melhor de tudo é que o jogo é basicamente infinito, basta você querer jogar que sempre vão ter experiências novas, acho que a única coisa que eu considero ruim no jogo é que você precisa das DLCs pra alguns itens serem bons, já que eles buffam itens entre as DLCs, porém apesar de isso ser chato, não torna o jogo ruim, porque as DLCs adicionam muitas coisas legais e definitivamente não são usadas apenas pra consertar itens ruins. Se fosse possível dar uma nota, eu daria 4.9/5.0 por conta da necessidade das DLCs e por eles terem dito que a última DLC lançada seria o último update do jogo."

27972,"Hi, someone tell me what to do when Isaac does not turn on? This happened after I turned on the accidentally removed mod and since then I have a problem in turning the game on. Please let someone help me, I really like this game, and i don't want to factory reset my computer"

27997,"I have been playing this game for almost a decade now and it just never gets old. 200 hours in and I still haven't even gotten half of the unlocks / achievments - it sounds like that would make this a grind, and while it might be in someway, it never feels like one and is always a pleasure to play. The music is bangin' but I use this as my podcast and chill game and it never fails! 10/10, one of the GOATs for sure."
27998,I think this is a great game. It is fun unlocking new items and finding secrets. I have not played for long and I already love it!
27999,Game sad.
28000,"This game is so god damn addicting! Its always fun to just play it for a few hours, its also really rewarding to beat a boss! All the items are really creative and fun to use improving the game play and how you play."
28001,"You'll boot the game up and start a run. You'll die. You'll try again. You'll die again. You'll do this a few more times, wondering what people see in this trash game. Then you'll have an amazing run and completely obliterate all enemies and challenges. Best game ever. You start a new run. It's terrible, you die. Worst game ever, why does anyone play this? Then you'll have another god run. 

The cycle continues."

28008,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about The Binding of Isaac? It's a super fun game that's constantly changing, full of fun unlockables and a compelling story about a very broken little kid. Despite the difficulty I've found myself starting the game again over and over because not only do I wanna get better and get all the unlockables and see all the bosses, I want to give Isaac a happy ending. This game will always keep you coming back, and even once you've absolutely completed it, there's mods to give you even more to do! More than worth the money!"

28026,"If I remember correctly, reviews show your time played...just look at mine. Issac isn't just a game, it's a lifestyle. 

There's a reason why Isaac is the progenitor of the ""rogue-lite/like"" genre, at this point, the humble flash game has boiled down the mechanics that make you keep coming back for one more run. 

Let's be honest though, I think everyone in the universe has this game in some form already, so you're probably just bored and are trolling the reviews section for anything new. To be honest, I get it, I did the same thing several times :-)."

28031,"The binding of Isaac is one of the best rogue-like out there, if not the best. It offers a excellent quality for its low price, so on that I recommend start playing with the 3 dlc (afterbirth, afterbirth +, and repentance). Afterbirth and repentance are by far bigger that afterbirth +, because they offers tons of new characters and fun items to discover while playing.

It feels so good when you start playing without knowing what does every item, so you just start picking everyone and hope that it works good together, usually ending up in a really fun run, even thought at first, it is really easy to die within the first floors, and don't worry it is part of the fun. Intrinsically, The binding of Isaac, is a hard game, which increments it replayability, and it is such a good feeling when you play a OP run, where you just beat one of the final bosses in such a fast way. (It is even possible to kill the harder boss of the game, without touching the keyboard or the controller, you could go to eat something or to the bathroom, and when you come back, it will be dead)"

28034,"Still don't know how Mathias Theorem Patrick came to the conclusion that Isaac is in fact, dead.

28035,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth 

Review time let's go

I like this game. A lot. Despite my playtime. I can honestly say that I've been interested in the game all back when there was no afterbirth, afterbirth+, or repentance. Back before antibirth was even a thing, i believe. Yep. Back during original Rebirth times.

So what do I have to say for this game? It. Is. Fantastic. The artstyle, is super easy to get used to (at least for me). The game is easy to learn, yet hard to fully master. Even today, despite me having defeated ALL of the big DLC and non-DLC bosses, despite visiting pretty much every floor, despite me playing as nearly all (since Repentance: nearly all non-tainted) characters. There is still. A shitload of things to do. So you're almost never left with no purpose, and when you are, it's gonna give such.. a grand accomplishment feeling, from what I heard. 

Enough of me saying how GOOD it is. Let's talk about what's actually in the game. 

THE CONTROLS (default) are: 

ARROW KEYS - aiming and shooting || IN MENUS, use them to navigate through the menu
WSAD - movement
E- bombs
SPACE - usage of 'SPACEBAR/ACTIVE' item.
Ctrl: switch between card/pill/spacebar item || OR IF HELD drop all trinkets, cards, and pills
ESC - Pause menu
Q - Use Pill/card/whatever is in that bottom slot.


You play as one of the small kids from the 'Who Am I' screen. There's a lot to unlock and some are really easy to unlock like Azazel or Lazarus. Some are tougher, and some are straight up an in-game secret so you wont even see them on the menu. They all have something special to them. Yes, you can make certain  characters like Eve, Maggie, Isaac, start with more stuff than they normally do, by achieving certain things in the game. 

There's diffrent room types in the game. Normal, boss, treasure, secret, curse, shop and angel/devil rooms. 

Normal rooms - the room fodder of the game. You spend most of the time traversing and fighting in them. 

Boss rooms - they yield an item after you killed the mentioned boss. The trapdoor to go to the next floor (which gets unlocked after room is cleared) is there. So to go to the next floor, most of the time you're gonna need to defeat the current floor's boss.
 
Treasure - It's where your power growth for your character usually comes from, by giving you pretty much free items up until a certain floor. After said floor is cleared and you go to the next, in most scenarios, you wont have them there. 

Secret rooms - You don't usually see them on your map. To get to them, you need to bomb the part of the wall, where you believe the entrance to one is.  To localize/ get to them without the need of special items, you need decent game knowledge. Regular secret rooms are surrounded by 2/3 other rooms. Top secret rooms branch off from only ONE room, and are NOT surrounded by any other room. They're also either close to the boss room, or at the ends of the map. They may contain anything from pedestal items, to gold/gray chests to regular consumables. 

Curse rooms - To get into those, you need to usually hurt yourself. If you have no soul hearts, the damage to your red health from the curse room door will NOT ruin your angel/devil chance. They can contain.. nothing, or red chests,or soul/black hearts. Said red chests, can contain items, or enemies, friendly allies,or even straight up teleport you to the devil/angel room on the current floor, soulhearts, or pills.

Shops - They always require a key to get into. You'll probably pick up coins throughout the game. Coins are mostly used in shops, to buy things like items, health, consumables or cards/pills. There's also a donation machine usually in the shops. Donate when you can to unlock better shops, certain items, etc. As well as to save up for when you need to take the money out of the donation machine. 

Angel/Devil rooms - You better prepare for these ones, because after you kill the boss , and they spawn, if you walk out of that boss room, the room might just.. flat out disappear. So go in there as soon as you can. Anyway. They usually are also a great source of power. Devil rooms is where you trade red health for  (usually) offense items, and Angel rooms give you typically more defensive items, for free, but these rooms are rarer. 

There's so much more about this game, but this review can hold only so many words. So.. with this information, go buy, play, and learn on your own."

28047,.
28048,This game is HUGE
28049,"[b] Small Preface [/b] --  Basically I have played The Binding of Isaac since the release of the original on Steam. (I'd have to really go and check my steam achievements to see when I got my first achievement for The Binding of Isaac, but I know it's been for quite a bit. The first one obviously led me to buy this one, and I enjoyed it enough to where I was curious about this one. [b][i] Also I'm doing this review at 4:17AM, weee. [/i][/b]

✅ [b] Wonderful Reboot [/b] - Basically [i] The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth [/i] is a reboot of the original game, but there are plenty of reasons why this one is just wonderful. There is something about the updated art style that seems so much better for me. It's not that I didn't like the previous art style, but this art style seems so much more preferred for me. It's pixelated-ish, and it just seems more visually appealing. In addition to this, though, there's tons of DLC which adds so much more extra content, obviously. I haven't even finished the game one time through with any character, and I've spent 33 hours on it. I know this seems a little daunting or frustrating, but it's a great roguelike. The original was great, and this one has tons of extra padding to make it interesting. I haven't bought repentance or afterbirth, but I'm sure they are fantastic. 

✅ [b] Ease of picking it up [/b] - This can be a talking point for me. If you don't have a lot of time to play games, this can be a good game as well. Basically if you're doing a run and you're doing particularly well, you wont lose your run, and you can pick it up later! You also don't have to have a huge time investment in order to play it. For me this can be something that's great about a game.

✅ [b] Fun randomization [/b] - Alright, so, as far as the randomization aspect of this game is concerned, I could go into the fact that each of the rooms is randomized, the floors are randomized with different curses -- basically modifiers that change the layout of the floor, or certain effects on each floor. I'd also have to look further into this, but basically they're modifiers for each floor. --, the power-ups you get in the form of pickups are random on each floor, which can result in a really amazing run, or a really bad run. Also you may lack keys where and when you need them, or you may have an overabundance of them where you don't. It all seems to provide for a great experience. And the thing about roguelikes is the addition of depth to the game with pickups, and TBOI:R does a wonderful job of this. The enemies, too, are fantastic. I can imagine that it only gets better whenever you get into the DLC! 

❌ [b] Difficulty of trying to understand unlocks [/b] - So I know this is more of a maybe I need to ""get good"" complaint than anything. I think the only reason I'm here to gripe about this particular thing is because in a more recent roguelike I've played -- Risk of Rain 2 -- I didn't have the trouble of trying to figure out unlocks. I've checked the stats menu and it [i] does [/i] have cute little pictures of what is unlocked, but it doesn't have any indication of [i] how [/i] to unlock.

❌ [b] Potential higher bar, steeper curve for newer players [/b] So I've played The Binding of Isaac for a few years, and while it's not particularly difficult, I could see why maybe jumping into this as a first roguelike would be offputting potentially. Again, I know I'm comparing this to Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2, and maybe there's a bit of a ""get gud"" factor here, but it does have maybe a bit of a steeper curve of understanding for people. It's one of these games that I might have to research a little further to understand things. And to be frank, I'm not the best at the Binding of Isaac. I'm much better at ROR1 and ROR2, and so many other roguelikes. But there's not really a sense of gratification in me or accomplishment when I may perish in TBOI. It's just like, ""welp, time to do something else."" I think this is compounded, too, by not understanding easily what the unlocks are like. It would be easier if something was patched in to explain unlocks, and perhaps adding another difficulty that was easier than normal? But that's my two cents. 

Overall despite my couple of gripes I have for the game, I would recommend The Binding of Isaac as a roguelike game. :) It's a lot of fun and the art style is great."
28050,"The last DLC is worth it, sinking hourly game play because it's that good. More fresh content and modding with the new DLC will make the game even better."

28074,"Main advice on this game, sacrifice some hearts to the devil, and make sure you go through all rooms to get power ups. Really loved how the updates on this game really improved the gameplay of the levels, bosses, and the 7Deadly Sins. I remember first owning this around 2014 on my old acc. I wasnt too sure of this gamen whether it would match my taste in genres. Overall, the dlcs improved the experience. I hope to see more dlcs/updates in the future."

It has so many features and unlockables that every run feels so unique.

Isaac is a game with extraordinary depth. It's got a complex meta and tons of achievements. I've played for hundreds of hours and still have stuff left to unlock. The difficulty curve is very steep, but that's part of the charm. This is THE roguelite. If you like the genre and haven't played Isaac, what are you waiting for?"

28128,"The Binding of Isaac Rebirth remains my favourite roguelike to date. It has a vast amount of items and synergies, and also has dozens of different enemies and bosses. The DLCs also add to the game tremendously and add new characters, items and bosses. All in all, I highly recommend The Binding of Isaac Rebirth if you enjoy roguelike games."

28137,"Great game. Very easy to learn very fun.
"
28138,ive yet to keep a save file for more than 1 run but its very fun
28139,"I've put hundreds of hours into this game and I still have a long ways to go to complete it. This game is a marathon, and if you are into that kind of thing welcome. The Binding of Isaac is very unforgiving. It was already kind of challenging when it is Afterbirth+, but Repentance has stepped up the challenge to a ridiculous degree. There are times where the came feels unfair and impossible. I've hit that wall many times while playing this. When everything clicks into place though the game is magical. That moment where you finally know enough about the items and how to use them that you can legitimately break the game using the built in rules. That's a thing of beauty. Sure that's usually only one run out of every 100 when you're starting, but you can eventually get to the point where you're doing it on a regular basis.

Personally I find this game to be the most fun when I just use whatever I find. I take all the pills. I use all the trash items. I go down all the difficult routes. Do I lose a lot? Sure I do. I win a lot too though. There's a lot of risk reward with taking all the trash stuff. When it doesn't work it quickly ruins a run. When it does work though. That moment you suddenly have quad shot dunce lazers that are secretly exploding hungry tears and you have a stupid amount of health because you figured out which pill is the health up. That's what the game is all about.

This game isn't for everyone. There is A LOT of frustration involved in playing it. It's most for people that like the feeling of overcoming a challenge you've been stuck on for days. For those people that love figuring out how to break games. If you put the time into The Binding of Isaac it can get pretty rewarding."

28142,"In my top 3 favourite games of all time, so much content, and with workshop, maybe even infinite, it recreates the old game so well and smooths out all the edges and it makes it so much more enjoyable, 10/10"
28143,why didnt i played this erlier
28144,funky fresh and fun
28145,"Easy to learn, difficult to master, lots to discover. Perfect."
28146,Este juego es increíble.
28147,I suck. This is funny. I played this when i was 6 :D
28148,"The Lost. Worst thing to complete. One Hit from everything and your run is pretty much gone. In a game with random shot from some enemies. Many items are just useless, HP Ups, Item where you have to take damage to work. The unlocking method too is just dumb. Good luck finding it on your own, I know it should had been an easter egg to the community. At least he gets better with the Holy Mantle in Afterbirth, still doesn't justify how bad is it to play him in Rebirth.

Beside being useless for the Lost some are just horrible in every case, I don't need to have every item to be op but at least a similar power level, Brother Bobby, a familiar which shoots a base damage Isaac tear from a random room after the boss and you have to use your 1 red heart container or 3 soul hearts if you don't have any. Many items have the need to be in a synegy to work, Virus, Midas Touch, take damage to what kill the enemy? Bomb items too, if you don't have a good amount of them or infinite why use them against enemies, I prefer to use them to get items, secret rooms.

Some Challenges aren't a ""Challenge"" (Computer Savvy, Darkness Falls), starting with good items and without item rooms doesn't strike like a challenge to me. Even High Brow doesn't seem that hard
Then there are sometimes where it just ridiculous in terms of difficulty. (Suicide King, Cat Got Your Tongue). Suicide King the fact you shoot while moving the shot curves or is faster, for me is bad design, plus the tear height from Ipecac it makes it worst to understand where it gonna land or in enemies.
Cat Got Your Tongue you only have the Guppy's Hair Ball to do damage. Which works really badly, I guess you can learn to attack in the best ways, but you could easily change the game around with Brimstone for example for Suicide King, Good familiars, like Little Brimstone for Cat Got Your Tongue. They aren't really unique as other in the DLC but at least they aren't as bad as some from the DLCs too...

Last thing is the nerf/buff and synergy in items, they nerf and buff them in the various DLC for example, 20/20 in Repentance it has been nerfed, never before, same for other bad items in Repentance they have been buffed but never in other versions of the game, which make no sense, or quality of life things, a little icon under the map for the curses, the extra hud for Afterbirth+, Dice Rooms without the drawings for the effects...

Beside that I still can't recommend Rebirth like that. If it weren't for the Lost maybe it could had been saved from the negative review, ""getting better at it"" is useless doing a run hitless isn't fun. I only won a run because of extra lives, it is a great game where you can spend hours with fun combos, less then DLCs because some can't without them, I feel runs go only 2 ways, Really bad or Really good.

28149,pretty good
28150,it very gud
28151,"i want to preface this by saying that i am a huge fan of rougelikes and i played this game back in 2018 with afterbirth+ (i pirated it) so i might be a LITTLE biased

this game is genuinely a masterpiece of design and story
any negative review on this game is either based  on the fact that they didnt like a change in an update or one of about 10 negatives of this game.

isaac has an INSANE amount of replay value across all  of the 34 characters and the incredible amount of challenges, with an awesome gameplay loop and fun upgrades as well as a very meaningful commentary on religion 

there is ALMOST NO REASON NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME"
28152,repentance got me hooked please send help
28153,IS NICE
28154,Very easy game. Already finished it. All the runs are winnable.
28155,Really fun way to grind out a game where a baby cries on poop and kills its mom.
28156,"Just buy it...
You'll never get pissed of this game, you always comeback :D"
28157,isaac
28158,I hate this game
28159,A really fun and well made game!

28161,"[b]A Critical Review from my Personal Experience[/b]
This review is on the following DLCs
 · Rebirth
 · Afterbirth
 · Afterbirth+ [i](i know it's not a DLC)[/i]
 · Repentance

[b]Forewarning[/b]

This review is my [i]personal experience[/i], an inherently subjective analysis. With that out of the way, enjoy.

[b]The Start of my Journey[/b]

My first time playing the game was at my cousin's place. Back in 2016, I didn't have a computer. Whenever I'd go to his house, he'd let me play stuff like Portal 2 and Minecraft. One day he showed me ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"". The game was fascinating to me. ""Dungeon rush"" style games were a new experience for me. ""The Binding of Isaac"" was the first rouge-like [i]or[/i] dungeon rush style game that I'd ever seen at the time. I then started looking at the game online. Naturally, YouTubers like Hutts and Sinvicta popped up. I found their commentary bewitching even though my tiny monkey-brain of a 10-year-old didn't understand what they were saying. The ""risk and reward"" style of the game heavily appealed to me. I loved how the items synergised together. Then on my 14th birthday, my parents bought me a Dell Inspiron computer on which I would buy the base game, ""Rebirth"", and the ""Afterbirth"" DLCs.

[b]The Curse of Completionism[/b]

Following this, I recommended the game to my brother. He played the game a lot. Currently, my brother has around 160 hours in it. I played the game repeatedly until monotony started to sink in. One quote that resonated heavily with me is one ""UberDanger"" states in his review. [quote=UberDanger]""The Binding of Isaac was incredible for me before I played it so much that it became a completion grind. But this game corrupted me. Playing it was no longer about having fun and chilling out. Now it was just a repetitive monotonous crusade to discover how stubborn I am.""

[url=https://youtu.be/_Hd5IyiEjQo?t=876] [i]The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ review[/i][/url]
[/quote]

[b]My Thoughts on this Mentality[/b]

I think I partly relate to this experience. Admittedly, I had not played the game to the extent and with the same ""completionist mindset"" as UberDanger. As a result of this, through no fault of his own, he stopped enjoying the game. I watched this review a few hundred hours into the game. Luckily, I hadn't become corrupted by the grind to completion just yet. Looking back, this convinced me to stop hating the game and playing it; instead, enjoying the game as it is. In the beginning, Isaac was relaxing. I had a great time playing the game. I would laugh at the crazy synergies I would get, play the game with a controller with my friends, and have fun. I believe that games should be fun. They shouldn't cause the mental exertion that players have experienced because of a switched mentality.

[b]The Deceit of Offered Replayability[/b]

With all this said, I think that players discovered a [i]'content limit'[/i] in Isaac. The idea that ""This game has infinite replayability"" is a sad mistake. You see, the Isaac Repentance DLC changed the game. In ""Afterbirth"", once you've played the game enough, it becomes the same song. The game was stale, and long-time veterans with hundreds of hours were quitting the game. Players such as ""VinneySuperG123"" legitimately stopped playing the game. But then ""Repentance"" was released. And, to quote Vinney, Repentance ""Breathed new life"" into the game. I'll get into that later in the review.

[b]It's not everyone's cup of tea[/b]

I don't mean to repeat the same things as other people here. Not in the least. However, when I say that the game can be [b]brutal[/b] for new players, I am not exaggerating. The game is friendly [i]to an extent[/i] to new players, but picking up the game is quite the task if you don't understand how it works. Buying the base game would be nice for a new player. With this said: unless you are really into roguelikes and this style, I recommend buying only that. However, as with most games, if you enjoy the base game, I recommend purchasing the rest of the DLCs. But let me forewarn you: don't waste your money and jump into the deep end because I cannot stress this enough: [b]The Binding of Isaac is not everyone's cup of tea[/b].

[b]The Slog of Afterbirth+[/b]

The theme of ""Afterbirth"" was consistent with Wrath of the Lamb. Its graphics were more engaging with a clear improvement from ""Wrath of the Lamb"". Again, incredible game, brand new features, bosses and the lot, new floors, and the community was thrilled. Somewhere along the line, I don't know if it was the money, the community wanting more DLC's or what, but afterbirth+ felt like a personal attack on the community. I don't mean to shit on the game at all, but when I say that afterbirth+ was just about adding [strike]bad[/strike] [b]terribleitems [/b]. It was as if this was their board meeting six months ago:
[quote]
☑ ""Rebirth""
           ☑ Make a game that compliments wrath of the lamb in a roguelike the world has never seen before
☑ ""Afterbirth""
           ☑ Try and make rebirth [b]even better[/b] by putting a decent amount of effort into the game to create something worth buying
☑ ""Afterbirth+""
           ☑ Because we're pissed for some reason and want money, we'll add lazy items, do jack shit and then CHARGE A FULL 20$ FOR IT.
           ☑ Pack it with bugs because we don't care about the community
           ☑ Make the community a modding section ensuring we don't have to do any work, and [i]maybe[/i]  [b]JUST MAYBE[/b] if we like a mod enough, we'll steal their code and then release as some patch that we'll probably sell as a whole 'nother DLC (foreshadowing) here.
[/quote]

[b]Edmund's Announcement[/b]

Regardless, the community didn't exactly take it too well. In August the following year, when they finally (as a combination of personal messages on Twitter from the community and the 'mixed to mostly negative' steam reviews') realised that the team did a bit of an oopsie, they released ""Repentance"".

[b] The Release of Repentance[/b]

The team [/b] hired the antibirth devs[/b] and worked together to create the ultimate DLC: [b] REPENTANCE[/b]. The theme was still edgy, the music [b]slapped[/b] harder than (insert overused joke), and the game was just reunited with its long-lost brothers ""Rebirth"" and ""Afterbirth"". But the release of ""Repentance"" made the game [b] worth buying again[/b]. It might be the only reason I'm playing this game and writing this review.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

If you can tolerate heavy themes, don't mind dying a few times to explore the treasure hidden under the difficulty, and find an interest in roguelikes, then I strongly recommend this game. On the tier of ""the greatest games of all time"" [i](subjectively)[/i], this one is up the top. Far surpassing games like ""Devil May Cry 5"", ""Terraria"", and similar games like ""Enter the Gungeon"". ""The Binding of Isaac"" is something else. The game's core is grounded in a unique and personal experience. I'm sure many people can empathise with some of the heavy themes in this game. This 'personal touch' is why it hits at a deeper level. A song won't hit as hard if it's not from the heart. A game is no different. My honest rating would be 11/10. Simple as that. Incredible game."
28162,kegue
28163,"Fun if you have the patience to go through the first floors.
If not, have fun restarting several attempts in a row till you get a cool first item room.

Joking aside, The Binding of Isaac has to be one of the most complex games out there:
-A LOT bosses, each with their own unique ideas and several pixel animated frames
-HUNDREDS of items, almost all of them  have synergy with each other.
-Unique characters, each with their own ""tainted"" sides with unique ways of playing them!
-a SHIT ton of pixel art that not a lot of people appreciate, so APPRECIATE IT. LOOK AT IT, LOOK AT IT, LOOK AT IT!
-ANNOYING as FUCK foes to fight (Have fun)
-SEVERAL endings which need to be beaten as EVERY character for more fun unlocks (And broken ones.)


If you are bored or have a lot of free time, this lad will be in contact with you.



They had us in the first half not gonna lie."
28164,"This game turns you into a masochist, it'll kick you in the balls and you'll be coming back for more."
28165, AMAZING
28166,"Write a review for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
28167,"my experience so far went from "" holy fuck this game is fun "" to "" why the fuck do i die right when mom fucking dies kill me """
28168,G
28169,
28170,"This is a tricky one to discuss. My recommendation comes with the biggest caveats possible. This is not for the faint of heart, be it on a gameplay basis or a content basis. It's a supremely messed up game, and it gets hard, so hard it actually has a death streak counter. It's also completely procedurally generated, so if you're not a fan of that then you should definitely give this a miss.

But, if you enjoy your games on the messed up side, look forward to a challenge (and not like what Dark Souls claims to be a challenge and just turns out to be cheap tricks to make you hate life, but an ACTUAL challenge), like the idea of a sort of mash-up of play-styles of games like the original Zelda, side-scrolling beat-em-ups, looter-shooters, and probably a few other classic Nintendo titles, and look forward to games with rocking OSTs, then Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is for you

Note: for those unaware, Rebirth is an overhaul of the original which was coded in flash and ultimately due to how big it got with all the updates ultimately became almost unplayable."
28171,Great game!
28172,"good game, play game"
28173,good
28174,worth every cent

edit: 604 hours of repentance later they no longer make me feel anything anymore"
28177,Gross!
28178,fun and actually difficult with repentance
28179,"This game is obviously not made for kids, but it is a genuinely great time for those who like top-down zelda games, as well as rouge-likes similiar to Spelunky 2."
28180,this is like my home life
28181,: )
28182,this game is for people like me who dont want to use there brains

28188,gud
28189,good
28190,This is one of my all time favorite rogue likes i would highly recommend it i have about 500 hours logged and both the game twice on pc and switch!

28204,"Unlimited replayability, fun combonations of items, a great challenge, amazing lore, new multiplayer. EASY 10/10"
28205,"Well worth buying. Hundreds of hours of content, get the DLC too."
28206,Lots of interesting synergies and fun with co-op

28208,"Edmund McMillen, you little fucker.
You made a shit of piece with your trash Isaac. It’s fucking bad, this trash game. I will become back my money. I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker."
28209,"I love isaac, such good game. Would play it again/"
28210,"good game, makes you angry"
28211,I hope baby plum experiences the worst death imaginable. Good game though.
28212,"I have enjoyed this game since the release of afterbirth on multiple platforms. Switch, PS4, and Steam. With the recent release and balance changes that came from Repentance I can easily say my outlook on this game.

First some Pros:
Almost every run early on you unlock some sort of item you experience fairly quickly. Leaving you wondering what other items there are
The synergy updates in Repentance are amazing and I love experiencing them
The challenge is fun, and you can always turn hardmode off if you want an easier experience
Greed Mode is a fantastic alternative if you get one too many deaths in the base game
Certain challenges are fun 
Many bosses are fun challenges that are interesting to learn about.
AMAZING SOUNDTRACK AND STORY

Cons:
The game can be too challenging at times, such as a certain bossfight thats random and hard to perfect
Certain challenges seem almost impossible and you need good luck to win
Some characters seem to be worthless or not fun compared to others. Excluding the challenge characters such as Keeper and Lost
Some secrets seem too hard to get on your own unless you try everything with everything else, which can take ages if you dont get the right seed

All in all there are upsides and downsides. No game is perfect but I would say that TBoI: Repentance is a good one with faults that are meant to challenge you or prevent you from completing the game in one sitting."
28213,very fking addictive
28214,"Played a lot on Xbox, moved over to PC for repentance, great game would recommend."
28215,isex
28216,Really fun game for kids
28217,i aM ADDICTED AND THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE: pretty good tho
28218,soy good man
28219,a good rogue-like game. it has some broken builds which makes the game all the better
28220,fun
28221,ciiiiiiiiiii
28222,good
28223,"Considering it is a remake for original flash based The Binding Of Isaac it is fine. It contains all of original items and enemies, but also adds a ton of new stuff. 3 DLCs more than double the items in the game and you have over 20+ new bosses! I would say if you want to play I would highly suggest getting all DLCs all at once. Just because the DLCs are a bit pricey to my taste I will rate it 9/10"
28224,"For the $14.99 price tag , this game is absolutely amazing and worth playing. But I highly recommend buying all the DLC's just because of the amount of new items , challenges, characters , bosses and enemies that you will be able to unlock. There are over 700 Items , there are so many synergies that just work so well.
Pros:
Highly Addictive 
So much to do and learn
Dark Humour 
Mod Support
YOU CAN LITERALLY HAVE A POO ARMY
Cons:
It is challenging (until you get a broken build)
That's It

28254,"This game will take away your precious time, but not in a bad way. Tons and tons of different combinations with lots of different characters makes you want to play it again and again. Some runs are more frustating than the others, but that's what makes this game fun.
Although the base game is already jam-packed full of content and replayability, the DLCs brings so much more to the game, I highly recommend you to buy the DLCs.

Solid 9/10"
28255,"One of the best, longest lasting and easy to come back to rogue-likes. If you get into this game, it will suck many hours of your life away. I only have 300 hours on here, but at least 1000 on Playstation as well. I need help, serious serious help."

28267,it good
28268,is fun
28269,I think it's good
28270,Hi 👋
28271,It's pretty alright. RNG can be awful but it's fun finding every way to crash the game.
28272,Good
28273,"Do I recommend this game? is that even a question for this one. A RESOUNDING YES TO ANYONE, even if you don't like rougelikes. This game is super fun. There are tons of enemies to fight, tons of fun bosses, tons of fun item combos, lots of good and fun mods, satisfying achievements and unlockables, 1,000+ hours of replayability easily. OVERALL A GREAT GAME.
The only cons is that:
-there is a lot of RNG, but if you are skilled enough, most poor item runs can be challenging and doable
-some enemies and bosses are UNFAIR and very stupid to dodge, I'm looking at you early game haunt, or bloat.
-every run takes about upwards of 20-30 minutes, and if you die later in the run, before finishing, it can be pretty demoralizing.
BUT THE PROS HEAVILY OUTWEIGH THE CONS
ALSO THERE IS NOW REAL CO OP WITH DA HOMIES SO VERY WORTH.
(Finally, get all the dlc or no dlc)
(Afterbirth and AB + are ok and a huge diffuculty spike without repetance, so I recommend base game or all 3)
Either way the 50 dollars for all dlc and game is very worth
Oh yea did I forget to mention, there is like 30+ different playable characters with all like 9 run completion achievements each, so if you wanna 100 percent the game, it will take awhile, but VERY WORTH

TL:DR GAME IS VERY GOOD, BUY FULL GAME (ALL 3 DLC) AND YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY. (or just buy base game, all dlc or nothing)"
28274,"I clearly love this game. It will always be my favorite rogue lite. The sheer amount of items and the way they synergize with each other, I will always recommend this game. The story is a bit much, and it is rather gross and messed up at times. But honestly that's what makes boi special. Easy to pick up and play 100 runs, hard to master."
28275,I've played this game probably since 2016 and always comeback to play it even for a run two every month. I have to say playing repentance and completing the home ending reminds me why this game holds such a dear place in my heart and why i came back again and again and bought the DLC. This game is a true labor of labor that the creators wanted to share with the world and it truly a masterpiece and timeless classic.

28286,Very fun and lots of content.
28287,Got hit in the head with a metal bar and started crying harder. Sold my soul to Stan and started vomiting a laser of blood. Found pieced of my dead cats corpse and started mass producing flies. Rerolled my entire build into short range nails that exploded periodically. Died to a worm that was the same colour as the floor. 15/10 would reroll all my items and lose again.
28288,amazing game easy to get sucked into for hours
28289,Very addicting
28290,"starting fresh makes some unlocks incredibly hard to get now, which does make completionists struggle for their 100% alot (and also unlocking some very good items). gameplay is one of the best rogue likes out there, with some neat lore hidden everywhere, making for some fun theorycrafting if you are into that.
the roguelike loop is one of the best, since there's so much to discover and pretty much every achievement is worth it."

28306,"It's a bullet hell. It also rewards not getting hit. It's also infuriating to get hit. Tons of items, with tons of synergies that you can either look up or just learn by trying out. Multiple characters, dlcs add even more, with multiple final bosses. Don't give up early and understand that every room requires your attention. If you have come to this game after watching a streamer/youtuber, understand that most of them have quite a bit of time in this game. They may make it look easy and it can be far from it."
28307,fun and cool
28308,"played on and off for years, would do it all over again"
28309,"Um ótimo jogo para pessoas que tem paciência em morrer múltiplas vezes e ter que recomeçar tudo de novo. Basicamente a história é bem normal: Você é uma criança(Isaac), e sua mãe é uma maluca religiosa que acha que Deus pediu que ela matasse seu filho. Então, fugindo dela, você se esconde no porão de sua casa, que na verdade é um labirinto cheio de monstros que querem te matar. Conforme avança mais no jogo, você encontra itens que te ajudam, salas especiais como o shop(que mesmo não tendo ninguém lá, você tem que pagar pelo item, e ainda é caro) ou a sala satânica(que só te fo**), etc. Em todo final do level sempre tem um boss que ranca quase toda sua vida e torna impossivel prosseguir. Enfim, o jogo tem vários personagens com habilidades diferentes, que facilitam
um pouco sua vida; e também tem vários finais diferentes para se desbloquear (varia de acordo com o destino da rota). Mesmo assim, é um jogo muito divertido e viciante então é melhor ficar longe (aviso de amigo que quer cuidar da sua sanidade) :)"
28310,is good
28311,"Endless hours of content, creative items and item interactions, challenging while also allowing for game-breaking item synergies. Only downside is you have to grind a lot in order to experience the full game, however the base game offers plenty to explore while you progress."

28326,Big fan of the game but repentance takes that fun away get after both plus
28327,What can I say? This game is just a masterpiece since it was released. You can spend hundreds of hours into this game without being bored of it. Trust me when I say the DLCs are the main part of this game. They make the game complete c:

28340,"I love this game. This game has so much content that i could probably play one run every day for the rest of my life and die before unlocking everything. Repentance added so much more content than anyone was expecting,  essentially doubling the roster of characters with their tainted versions. I have nothing but praise for Edmund and his game. If you are on the fence about buying this game, buy it! My one warning is completionists might just waste the rest of their life on this game."
28341,Too addicting
28342,10\10 would recommend not to sound cheesy but these things always do. really though the brand new update added double the characters and a bunch of new items to unlock whether you are playing for the first time or coming back its a great game that will eat a lot of your time. also have the game for switch and now have to re get all my unlocks. i have it on iphone too
28343,Iconic game.
28344,"Repentance is out, game is finally good"
28345,It's ok.
28346,just a fun game that you can get really good at or have a good challenge to kill time
28347,very good game. it is very fun to play when you are bored and yo have a lot to explore.
28348,"I've only recently started getting into rogue-lites and i must say, this game is such a blast, i'm having so much fun with it, worth every single $, the replay value is huge too, every single rrun will be different, and the challenge log is such a great addiction that will for sure keep me hooked for hundreds of hours!"
28349,Probably the best rogue like of our generation

28363,"The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a top-down perspective RPG following a young boy named Isaac, who escapes down to the basement to avoid his murderous mother.

The gameplay itself is fantastic, although it should be noted that it is recommended to be played with a gamepad/controller, as it makes controlling Isaac so much easier.

Each floor (3 on your first run, 4 after you beat your first run, 6 after beating a certain boss a certain amount of times, 8 after that, and an additional 6 floors with the three DLCs.) has their own unique themeing towards them as well as enemies that provide challenge or disgust. 

Items are a key part of the gameplay. Picking one up will cause Isaac to undergo a visual change, as well as giving him different effects depending on the item. This game encourages experimentation and exploration, as there are secret rooms to find, reroll rooms and even vaults for more resources.

The bosses are well designed and animated, giving each one a personality as well as their own unique strategy to fighting them. Beware though, as the endgame bosses tend to be very challenging!

Each of the game's three DLCs provide new content that hold new interactions, bosses, floors and items that shake things up, for better or worse, including the recently released Repentance DLC, which, in my opinion, is the best one."
28364,Pretty fun!
28365,The game was amazing i would definitely recommend it!
28366,Fuck this game
28367,"Awesome game! Very challenging at first almost seeming impossible, but as you get used to the game mechanics and discover the secrets it becomes doable. Highly recommend"
28368,bloat is adorable.
28369,shit monster
28370,"it's a game i come back to time and time again regardless of how many breaks i take from it. when i don't feel like playing, i'm often watching streams of others playing. i've worn two controllers out so far just from playing  and i've just gotten a new one so i've been able to pick it up again with the release of repentance. and speaking of repentance... if you haven't got it yet, get it. i've never enjoyed isaac more than i have since getting that. it's the same game but it feels new again.

10/10 would projectile cry blood all over mom's foot again"
28371,Isaac is a staple game of mine and the Repentance update has added a bunch of extra content. Is good.
28372,this game's relatable

28374,Crying kills made up monsters = big win
28375,"yes good but movement is weird

28376,"Didn't think i'd enjoy this game as much as i do. There's so much content and progression that i'm yet to even know about and there's always helpful wikis at your disposal if you need help or information. Skill ceiling is always growing, the game gets harder as you get achievements and item combos are extremely fun to play around with."

28503,The recent update kinda made this game not fun. Too many unnecessary changes which may have balanced the game but removed a lot of the charm. The addition of new content is good but the item pool still feels horrible. NEVER WILL I PICK UP BOBS BRAIN IN THE FRIST ROOM AND NOT RESET!
28504,"I really, really, really like this game. The art style is horrifying in a cute way, the underlying story is interesting and based off of Edmund's actual life, and the way you progress and unlock new items is difficult and satisfying. There are tons of items to find and they can all combine together to make some incredibly fun and ridiculous overpowered synergies. The synergies were kind of ""nerfed"" in the repentance DLC, which focuses more on the difficulty of the game, which I am totally fine with, although a lot of people seem to be against. The gameplay is fun, although it can be frustrating at times, with some rooms having spiders right next to the doors which leaves it up to RNG to decide if you will take damage that room or not, because it is impossible to escape a situation like that unless the spiders get away from you. This is not one of those games I will sink 100 hours into in a week, but it is a game I can never put down for ever. You know how some people say things like ""one day you will place your final block in minecraft and not even realize it""? Well, that is not true at all for this game, you will never stop playing this game, because no matter how long you stop playing for, you will eventually pick it back up, the small download size, how fast it is for you to get into a game, how short each run is (about 30 minutes to an hour max, maybe an hour and 30 depending on how good you are at the game, and how far you are) ensure this to be true. The game feels incredibly satisfying to progress through, your first mom kill will feel like an incredible achievement, but soon killing mom will feel like a trivial task. You will move on to harder ""final"" bosses, until you finally beat the big one, and eventually get platinum god, and it will feel incredibly satisfying. Each DLC adds an entire new game's worth of content, and they are all worth it. I would recommend buying all of them at once for the best experience. Play this game."
28505,very fun game

28508,8 hours short of 500.......probably the best game ever...I think

28510,Really difficult at times but very addicting.
28511,Always a fun game to kill and hour or 6
28512,Yes.
28513,fun game with a lot of replay value and content both base game and DLCs
28514,One of my all time favorite games. Keeps me coming back. :D
28515,"very fun
"
28516,"Have been playing this game far longer then the 50 hours logged here so far. I have this game on multiple platforms and have been playing for years. If you love gruuling pain with unforgiving enemies in a funky and creepy world to explore this is for you.

The games hard, the DLC's make it wildly more difficult and exciting to play. I highly recommend this Gem to anyone who likes challenging rougelike experiences."
28517,"So nice I bought it twice, I mean, 3 times now."
28518,I played for .3 hours using remote play I didn't do shit. 10/10.

28521,fun love the Synergies in it
28522,i love it
28523,Very good. Very fun rougelike.
28524,Awesome game! played from rebirth through all the DLC the replay ability on this game is amazing. The loses are rough but make sthe wins so much sweeter

Overall i give this game a 2/10, since i just found out that there are naked characters in this (fuckin sucks i know)"
28532,"I feel like I have invested my entire life into this game yet I look at literally anyone else's playtime and feel like I haven't even started- almost 100 hours in I haven't even unlocked all the main bosses. The amount of game in this game is NUTS. 

Should be in every library and worth every penny, easy recommend"

28549,funny baby go wahh
28550,"I have mixed feelings about a lot of aspects of this game but overall I do think it's good. The game itself is fun, and feels good to play. Seeing item interactions happen is always a treat and there's an absolute ton of them to find. As for the bad, enemies can leave behind a trail of hostile damaging or debuffing ""creep"" and sometimes, if not often, you can end up with things like red creep on red floor, not to mention when most things bleed red anyway it oft can blend together. Some of the game's attempts to be funny are painfully dated and, for lack of a better word, cringy as well. Overall good game though."

28556,My favorite game!
28557,Yes
28558,"Awful game literally the worst thing I have ever played, every mechanic is poorly thought out and not fun. 10/10"
28559,"a bit hard
"
28560,"Really good game that's really challenging. If you really enjoy Roguelike Indie games, then The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is for you. The base game already contains a good amount of content, but if you purchase the DLC, you'll get plenty of more content and you'll dedicate hundreds of hours to find every single detail. There are so many achievements to unlock and so much characters. One of my favorite aspects of the game are the crazy powerups and upgrades you can achieve throughout the game. I'd personally rate this game an 8/10.


Edit: Played the game much more after buying the DLC, instantly a 10/10, Repentance is so good!"

28565,yes
28566,"I've owned Isaac for just over a week now and I've been playing it a LOT. The amount of times you can replay it without getting bored is honestly quite shocking. I recommend it if you need a game to pass the time and enjoy rogue likes. I have no dlc yet, but so far it provides a fair challenge at times while not being angering."
28567,"es un juegazo con buenas mecanicas, sinergias y buen lore. pero si tenes vida social no vas a tener tiempo para jugarlo"
28568,"Just about the only game I play these days on my $3,000 gaming rig. It is a bit embarrassing, but I know TBOI will give a consistently fun and challenging experience. Plus the runs are all under an hour, so it is really grab and go."
28569,ok
28570,In this game you play as one of many biblical characters and fight off your childhood trauma's inflicted upon you by your christian mother.

28572,"Super fun, provides fair challenge without being obnoxiously hard.
More difficult challenges are optional so it's fit for casual players as well as hardcore gamers.

28581,Its fun
28582,oooo you wanna Isaac so bad oooooo
28583,"Really enjoy this game though repentance has dimmed that down quite a bit. Before repentance Isaac was pretty tame and you could get a run going as long as you got a few certain items that helped make a bad run into a good run. This has been changed with Repentance. What Repentance has brought is honestly divisive leaning on bad in my option. 

The faster bullets on hard mode and the bullet hell nature of the new bosses makes every run more of a chore than fun. While I felt afterbirth+ had some flaws, big revisions that Repentance made to items (and nothing to really fill the void that those changes left) makes the game legitimately frustrating at times. Where previously I'd die in a run and immediately fire up another one. 

Now I feel like exiting the game all together and playing something else until I cool down from what I felt was an unfair situation. So I guess in the end do I recommend you pick up Binding of Isaac Reibirth? Yes, obviously. Do I recommend afterbirth and afterbirth+? Yes, because while these expansions brought flaws they were overshadowed by the positives. Repentance though? If you're a big fan of isaac, want to keep up with the latest changes, and are fine with the changes then I'd pick it up. Otherwise I'd wait until Edmund patches it to where is not so glitchy and a bit less of a bush of thorns to go through."

28589,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a never-ending nightmare that you won't want to awaken from.

This game, over time, has been my most replayed single-player game since The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind. The replay value is baked into step 1 of the design process. The difficulty curve starts gentle and ramps up as you complete it more, though it's never easy. This game combines everything best about masocore dungeon crawling, bullet hell, and slot machines.

Though this is technically the 2nd Isaac game, it serves as a re-imagining of what the first could have been without the limitations of being a Flash game, and dials many of the tried-and-true concepts, tested in the original, up to 11. This game easily achieves the same type of legendary status, in my heart, as Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction. You will learn to love the grind.

Isaac is often imitated, never emulated -- you will find, if you consult the timeline, that The Binding of Isaac is responsible for the explosion of Rogue-likes and Rogue-lites available in today's market, but few of those that came after Isaac would hit the same formula with such precision as to become downright life-consuming, and only titles such as Hades rise to the same levels of artistic inspiration and gameplay excellence.

11/10, Edmond McMillen is an artist of Kojima-esque vision, and his team clearly loved what they were making."
28590,THE best rogue-like out there. Although it is very old it is still high up there. I am hoping to age this well myself... 13 out of 8.37 possible points
28591,"yes
"
28592,the binding of Something else
28593,"Synergies are endless, runs are always interesting and fun, definitely recommend buying the dlc as well as they add soooo much new content."
28594,"I started playing this game back in my junior year of High school (class of 2016) and I haven't put it down since. Theres a huge chunk of my playtime missing from a period where i didn't have internet and the computer didn't make it, but 400 hours is definitely still a testament (haha pun) to how great of a game this is. This is going to be a long one. Buckle up.

If you want a game with story, there is a little story in the game but not much. But if you're like me the you prefer gameplay to come first, on that note TBOI is mostly focused on the gameplay more than it is on creating a narrative. Though that said it is possible to speculate on what Isaac's life has been like based on the kinds of items that are in the game. I mean the item ""Mom's Coin Purse"" spawns pills, so make of that what you will. What story that is there outside of item speculation comes in the form of different endings you get when you complete a run, based on how many times you've cleared runs and what bosses you defeat.

Moving onto what I love best about the game, the items. This is the core mechanic of Isaac and each floor (minus some of the later floors) there will be a treasure room, a shop, and a boss room. Each of these gives the player an opportunity to pick up new items that will give you new abilities, change how certain game elements effect you, or give you stat upgrades. And there are A LOT of items. If you're new to this type of game, don't worry because over the course of your playtime you'll start to learn what items you like and which ones you hate. Once you get your footing on the gameplay you can start to learn which items you want to pick up or not. Many of the items interact with other ones in unique ways that can either really suck or be insanely over powered. The depth of the items and their mechanics is insane to say the least.

Definitely my favorite game of all time. I don't think I've found any other roguelike game that rivals it in the replay ability department. You don't even need the expansions, they're definitely great, but the base game is already jam packed with content to keep you satisfied. If you want a game with in depth mechanics, stylish pixel graphics, subtle humor, and hours upon hours of addicting gameplay. Purchase this game.

TL;DR: I've been playing this game for about 7 years. Light on Story, Heavy on Gameplay. Favorite game of all time. Very addicting.

Hope this helps!"

3. Isaac occasionally cries enough to kill Satan and God and descend into insanity

28610,"I watched Northernlion play this for YEARS, without ever touching the game personally. I bought it recently and literally cannot stop playing. I'm someone who is extremely picky with my game choices because a lot of what's out now just doesn't hold my attention. I am OBSESSED with this game at the moment and find it difficult to put down haha. I love the feeling of getting cool items and synergies. Losing feels just as fun as winning, the experience is always so exciting.  I would recommend this to everyone!"
28611,gotta say that's is harder than Afterbirth+ and there were some arguable changes to items but with time a lot of things have been balanced and with the amount of cheer quantity of content that has been added with the new Repentance update i think it well worth the price and time.

28615,"I've played this game long enough to say that it's definitely a good time, so instead of more praise, here are some good things to know for beginners:

1) If you die the first several runs, that's okay. This is a game where you're progressing towards cool new things, even when you don't complete a run.

2) The wiki is a great tool, though it can be overwhelming if you're not careful. There's a lot of stuff in this game.

3) Donate to the shop. It's an investment that pays off slowly, so you might as well start now."

"
28639,"This is an incredible experience, from start to finish. First off, this game (depending on how you play it and what DLC) is tough as nails, so be ready to get your ass kicked several thousand times.
This is one of those rougelikes that NEVER gets stale, no matter how many hundreds of hours you pour into it. Item combinations, characters, the sheer amount of things to do, challenges, daily runs, etc. will never allow you to get bored. In my experience of playing a LOT of rougelikes, this one is one of the only ones that never feels samey or repetitive even across hundreds of runs.
Now, as for the visuals and aesthetics, this is an intensely graphic game, so a few nightmares are guaranteed to pop up, but you can still build up a tolerance fairly easily. Incredibly reccomendable. The only warning is that because of the amount of content and complicated mechanics that the game throws at you, it is really advisable to have the wiki at hand and focus on one expansion at the time."

28664,"When I was a kid I used to love anime, but grew up in an era where it wasn't ""cool"" to like it. Only the ""weird"" kids liked shows like that. That didn't stop me from living a double life. I would dedicate hours and hours towards consuming anime media, all the while never telling my friends about it for fear of being ostracized.

Now in 2021, anime is cool and I never thought I'd have any comparable skeletons in my hobby closet.

The game combines run breaking item synergies with heart crushing bad luck into a miss mash of great fun and soul destroying loss, to the point where even when you get good items, you're still just as afraid of basic enemies as you were before.

All in all its a fantastic game and one that has really brought out the completionist in me, as I am still, years on, determined to get each and every completion mark"

The latest Repentance DLC genuinely elevates Binding of Isaac Rebirth up to ""one of the best games of all time"" status, let alone the absolute gold standard in its genre. Even with 125 hours I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. There are players out there with play times well into the thousands of hours who still find themselves challenged and delighted by what Isaac has to offer. I highly recommend giving it a try."
28682,Great game over all. The game has stunning game play and recemended for player who want a chalenge
28683,"Much like the original Binding of Isaac, Rebirth is a fun game, The game's harder difficulties are actually challenging. There's a wide variety of playable characters that you can unlock and play. Bosses are super fun to fight. For a very cartoony looking game, the animation is super detailed and spares no expense when it comes to gore. Blood, guts, poop, it's got all of that and more. I definitely recommend this game."
28684,eh good but if you dont have repentance its kinda meh
28685,this game is so easy to get into and i love it so much and i feel before you buys you should definently look into it on youtube!

28692,Yes.
28693,Randomization built on top of a solid structure and seemingly unlimited unlockable items/characters/etc. gives The Binding of Isaac incredible replayability. It's difficult enough to challenge experience gamers while being the kind of game the a dedicated person of any experience level can enjoy and make progress. Add in an interesting (if depressing) story and this game - in all it's flavors - has been a staple of mine for years.

28749,"Small boy, in a basement using his tears as ammunition against the monsters of this world in an attempt to escape the inevitable truth of hid damnation? Yeah, seems like a normal Friday night. Great game, good soundtrack, (mostly) fair and balanced except for when it just gets thrown out the window (thanks to your choices) and...yeah, overall: gud gaem, worth buy (especially with all the dlc, but don't do anything in repentance until you feel complete in afterbirth+)"
28750,Great game!
28751,A very fun top down bullet hell dungeon crawler.
28752,"In short, Issac is the only rogue-like were my default response to dying is being relieved that the run is over and I don't have to play anymore. 

In more depth, Don't buy this game unless you already played it and you are buying for yourself. If you want to understand what's going on, you'll have to play with the wiki open and that's instant do not recommend to other people criteria. Now Issac is and will always be my favorite game to watch other people play, but I don't like playing it. The problems are a bunch of small things continuously stacked on top of each other. From the hit boxes being above the ground to the frustrating inertia, I found it nearly impossible to hit anything unless I'm standing still. You'll also come across items that just don't work together or just straight up have no upside. See my comment of needing to have a wiki open."
28753,"The genre-defining roguelite of the 2010s. Massive replayability, with loads of unlocks and interesting synergies to explore. Bought it both on Switch and PC. Worth every penny, even at full price."
28754,"If you like roguelikes and dungeon crawlers, buy it.

28755,10/10 best time waste
28756,"fun game to waste time
"
28757,"I havent event scratched the surface of the game and i still dont know what anything does. Having said that. I have just spent 5 hours trying not to take any damage on the first 2 floor to unlock a character and as frustrating as that was, I always kept saying ""one more try"".  

I am hooked."
28758,"Rebirth: was a good start for the game.

Afterbirth: was a great expansion to the game nice balancing of old and new.

Afterbirth+: it was okey

Repentence: I absolutley LOVED this expansion, it is the best expirence of the game, the only down side i can say about it is that the prior DLCs are required to play it."

28785,"I've played this game for years now and boy is it fun. The lore is good, its challenging, and there is so much content that it takes at least a year of playing everyday to 100% this game. But you also have to be good. If the fact that the game is hard scares you away, just go to the Wiki and look around there. See how the game works and yo will be playing for hours. And as a bonus you can get into the lore of the game, but the great thing is you don't have to. But it will help you understand what is going on, and explain some of the items in the game. Overall this is the worth the price, every penny, but this game is not for everyone. So you should watch some Youtube videos on the game, and see if its your thing."

The game is now at a point where it's so large and dynamic it genuinely feels like a new game every run even still hundreds of hours and ten years later. The themes and humor just send it over the top, easy 10/10"

The game does many things right, Such as the music, theme, replayability, variety, item combinations, characters, difficulty... Listing all of these makes it seem amazing, and it definetly is; However being constantly assaulted by parts of the game that have absolutely NOT stood the test of time make it very hard to enjoy.
Also the way the tears move while you're also moving is just incredibly uniquely annoying.

6/10, Play it if you can look past/enjoy the glaring flaws. or find a dlc/mod that does."

But still, now that thanks to a friend I bought it, I feel really happy about helping Edmund and Nicalis make more games, for real, when repentance came out I just felt so glad, I didn't even get to play all the content that it adds but still I'm already having a lot of fun discovering and unlocking new content. When I play the game, every part of the gameplay is just so good, the graphics are really smooth to see and I feel comfortable, even on long runs. If I could buy the game again, I'd buy it one hundred times. Thanks for making TBOI Edmund :)"

28876,"This is a desert island kind of game. With over 1000+ hours between consoles I can easily say it's one of the best I've ever played. Endlessly replayble, only for real. There is so much to collect, see, and do that I reckon I'll play until I'm dead."
28877,"I've been playing Isaac on and off for about 6 years, and it used to be one of my all time favorite roguelites/twin-stick games. It absolutely revolutionized the roguelite genre, and while it was pretty difficult, it was still incredibly satisfying and endlessly replayable. The insane number of items and synergies to discover made it feel like an unlimited amount of content. It's a classic.

While a lot of that is still true, the Repentance DLC has entirely destroyed everything that once made the game fun to me. It is now almost completely unplayable if you are a casual gamer or someone who isn't a hardcore Isaac player already. If you are a casual or average gamer who is interested in getting into the game, I can't recommend it in the slightest. Unless you're some sort of prodigy gamer, your experience will most likely be one of pure unrewarding frustration.

As before, there are two difficulty levels in the game: normal, and hard. Prior to Repentance, normal difficulty was easy-ish and fun for casual players, and hard difficulty offered a decent challenge for people who are more serious about the game. In the Repentance DLC, normal difficulty feels leagues more difficult than hard difficulty was prior to Repentance, and hard difficulty is beyond absurd. Some of the new enemies are insanely difficult, and the normal enemies have been made much harder as well. Many previously useful items have been nerfed, making them unhelpful at best. The only way I've been able to win a run is by getting insanely lucky and finding mainly top-tier items, or getting an overpowered synergy that decimates every enemy in the game. And even on the extremely low chance of that happening, it doesn't feel rewarding because I didn't earn that win--the game gave it to me.

It honestly feels like they just got rid of any easy/normal difficulty level, and now the only options are ""insanely hard"" and ""impossible."" Maybe that's an exaggeration, but the game at least should have an OPTION for an easier, less aggravating experience for casual/new players. There would be literally NOTHING bad about having a lower difficulty. The hardcore players would still be able to have a good challenge, and newer or more casual players would be able to enjoy the game and/or ease into the higher difficulties. And yet, for some reason, the developer and most of the hardcore Isaac players are adamantly against that concept.

I admit that I am not very good at the game, but I also don't have the time or desire to play it for hours every day, frustratingly trying to perfect my skills just so that I can enjoy the game in the first place. Many people in the Isaac community have the attitude of ""if you're not good enough to at the game, then it's not for you."" I disagree. The game is right down my alley, and I've clearly loved every minute of playing it up until now. Why is it suddenly MY fault for not being able to enjoy the game, when the skill requirement to get into it at all is a mile higher than any casual/average player could ever be expected to have? I'm fine with there being an OPTION for an extremely high difficulty, but if it's a requirement then the game is only catering toward the <10% of the community that is able to fill that requirement. Also this isn't like Dark Souls, or any other game that is KNOWN for being difficult and is primarily marketed toward hardcore gamers. The Binding of Isaac used to have an easy (or normal) difficulty option before, and the developer practically removed it in Repentance, basically giving a big fat middle finger to any of the less ""gud"" gamers who previously enjoyed the game and were excited for Repentance.

And please don't be pretentious and talk down to the ""mediocre"" players who just want to be able to enjoy the game in the first place. The only reason the ""pro"" Isaac players aren't upset about the DLC is because they aren't affected and are still able to enjoy it. I guarantee you, if any of them were less serious and more casual about playing Isaac, they would also be unhappy. Just because you've spent 1,000+ hours perfecting your skills and are still able to enjoy the game doesn't discount the fact that a massive chunk of players aren't. And that's not mentioning all the new players who will buy the game just to give up after a day or two.

 I don't know why so many gamers today have become so elitist and have such an overwhelming need to feel ""superior"" to other gamers, but it's a childish mindset that is helpful to no one. If an average or casual gamer plays your game and quits because it's WAY too hard for them, wouldn't that make you want to change something, or add an easier difficulty option for them?

I guess that's the end of my rant. The sad part is that there are parts of this DLC that I really do love, but the unnecessarily high skill requirement makes it impossible for me to enjoy any of it.



In short: Binding of Isaac good, Repentance DLC too hard for lots of people, please make option for easier difficulty level."

May indie game industry prevail."
28884,"

28885,Incredible. The ur-roguelike and the Repentance DLC makes it better than it's ever been.
28886,This game is a fun 2D shooter.
28887,child suffocates in a basement
28888,"This game has been good since before the original release on Flash, but Repentance makes the game the most complete and best version that it has ever been and probably will be (supposedly this is the last update to the game, but then again, they said that for the last two or three updates, so who knows).

If you like the rogue-like/lite genre and want to play one of the longest lasting games that is long lasting for a reason, I highly recommend that you pick up The Binding of Isaac along with the appropriate expansions to reach Repentance.

One of the best of all time."
28889,"I'm a looong time player and I've been playing Repentance non-stop since it came out. I hate to say it, but I just don't have fun playing Isaac anymore. I've beaten the new bosses with multiple characters, but all my runs feel the same, I pretty much see the same mediocre items every run and it just feels like a grind now. I think this is my queue to move on."

28931,"The game itself is cool, but  i have to say that even if the game has so much to do in it, these days it will be hard to complete for people who are just starting. But if you are a knucklehead and you want to go for this adventure, then go for it."
28932,A masterpiece
28933,"I discovered The Binding of Isaac by watching my brother play. At first it didn't seem like a big deal, but I started playing and changed my mind completely. Now I think it's a very very good game, with great characters, my favorites are Azazel, Lilith, The Forgotten and Bethany. I also have to highlight the large number of items that there are and the good and no so good combinations that can be created depending on which ones you put together.

When starting the game it can be complicated, but dedicating time and a lot of patience you'll end up enjoying it a lot. Personally, I recommend starting with Rebirth and then moving on to the rest.

That said, I encourage you to play The Binding Of Isaac and have a great time."
28934,"fuck the spider movement.

"
28940,yes
28941,"this is a shit game

Update after an additional 230 hours:
game is still shit pls fix i cant fucking play this shitty ass game anymore."
28942,"The more I play this game, the less fun I have, the more I wonder why I continue to play it. Yeah, no more of that. There are so SO many useless/garbage/useless garbage items clogging up the item pool at this point that you can never tell if the run you're going to have will be a painful slog that you'd rather restart on, or if it'll be a run where you get one of the three items in the game that basically wins the game. I don't want just the overpowered win button items, but I don't want all the useless ""toot on getting hit"" items that needed to have been removed since the original flash version nearly a decade ago. Surely there has to be a middle ground where the common items are either fun or good, and the extremely good items can be appropriately rare finds. As it is, all you can do is hold down R until you find an item that doesn't suck the life out of your body with how hard it blows. Maybe add a selling mechanic so you can dump crap items for pennies, maybe bet your crap items on a chance to get something you'd actually want to have, maybe have more than five item pools so finding a treasure room doesn't feel like playing Russian Roulette with a pistol. This latest expansion tried its damndest to rebuild and polish up the rickety bridge Nicalis has built out of Isaac, yet the most it does is add more things to the already bloated-like-a-pufferfish item pool. We already have like 30 unlock items for each character, and now you have to get 30 more for the same characters but worse/objectively better. It just feels braindead. A run can go just fine until it stops going fine and you can't really tell what exactly went wrong on your end."
28943,"This game is one of the best I have ever played, every time I get on my computer I play it, even if it isn't my goal or what I want to play when I start my computer. Get it now, this is not a request, this is a threat."
28944,"The quintessential Roguelite. 
Endlessly replayable and perfect for if you have any interest at all. This review is after the release of Repentance, and if you are a fan of difficult but incredibly satisfying gameplay with just a sprinkle of bull**** thrown in, you've got yourself an incredible game. 
Cannot recommend enough!"
28945,Good
28946,"It feels like a lot of mistakes have been made in Repentance. A lot of ""don't fix what's not broken"". And the attempt of balancing the game was greatly misled. The game previously had an issue with some items being instant wins, and some were instant losses. Now less items are instant win, more items are instant lose, while the real problem of no items being in between, instead vast majority of them being filler/useless, has not been addressed.

Addition since steam nagged me to write this:
Slapping unbreakable turrets in the middle of as many rooms as possible is not level design."
28947,"For me personally, it is stressing and exhausting and sometimes I ducking hate it, but man 10/10 would do it again.

28960,very pog
28961,"It's the classic indie rogue like.
It has a lot of content, secrets and a very interesting theme.
It's not perfect, obviously, it can become a bit repetitive at times. The maps are very simplistic. It's too dependent on luck, having some items that can break or make your game. The hitboxes are weird, since enemies' are around their shadow but yours is in around your head so at times is confusing. The gameplay is a bit rustic when compared to something like Enter the Gungeon and many of the bosses/enemies are slight variations of each other. Also, the tiny spiders are bullshit."
28962,"Super fun and time consuming, and I love how it's such a simple game that runs on low resources. Great for individuals who are completionists"

My gait was so fucking strange, both animated and rigid at the same time, kind of like a Will McKenZie walk. Fucking hell, at this point I have basically embraced the Aspergers. I cannot stand being around other people, I feel so suffocated, I just want to be alone, yet loneliness is a pain in itself.

You have realised, or if not, need to realise that aspergers will lead you to a life of loneliness, that is the truth. You have to be very picky with girls (as if that is a challenge) and find one that is similar to you, easier said than done, I know. Even for Autists who actually make it and get married, the divorce rate is 80%.

I am just embracing loneliness. It is the best thing for me."

29063,cool game
29064,I miss my dad :(
29065,its a good game forever
29066,"I only found this game recently when someone was streaming it with the new dlc/update. It's a bit frustrating at times since it's heavy rng but also kind of addicting. New items and characters unlock as you progress. I think some things would be better explained in game somewhere in a menu. I had to google search a lot like, why a mom kill on a seed didn't count, to find out you need 10 mom kills to unlock other endings, how tokens for eden works, even hat keys drop an item or restart. I understand the mystery of what item drops do is part of the game, though most search them as well, but some better info on the game mechanics would help.

One thing I dislike is the voice acting is turned off if you turn off the music. These two things should not have been linked. I wind up missing story if I have the music off. Story mostly happens at the end but I keep forgetting to turn it back on.

Other than that it's an enjoyable rouge like dungeon crawler with the possibility to get some really wild and op runs, along with the crummy ones, because of the rng."
29067,the best of the best

29069,one of the best rogue-likes ever
29070,Fun and Challenging. Would buy again.
29071,"I have about 300+ hours spanned over all of Isaac, flash and Rebirth. This game has truly made a statement in the indie roguelike genre and rightfully so, it's a pretty good dame, fun, challenging and even wonky at times. Highly recommended if you like roguelikes with a pretty smooth but technical difficulty scale."

29087,good game
29088,Need I say anything this game is the kind of game you remember before you close your eyes or take your final breath. The small moments that could have changed the entire outcome of your run will haunt you or bring you joy. Take a extra second before you do something on this game. I am speaking from the experiences I have had.

29092,"Being that this game is a randomly generated dungeon crawler with an insane number of items, most playthroughs are still fun. Discovering odd items and item synergies make each run unique.

This game is absolutely fantastic. Depending on the way you play video games, it can be simple or complex, frustrating or calming, or maybe even competitive or casual. TBOI series is absolutely fascinating the way you get dragged in and attached to the characters and the story even though you never really hear them say much of anything. The replay-ability is also one addictive aspect of this game. The sheer amount of items, consumables, and synergies allows you to have wildly different runs that can end up as a struggle or a cake walk.

29143,"A great game with a truly massive amount of content, especially with the all the DLCs. It's always unforgiving, but with the right knowledge, you can turn even the worst luck into a great run. Most of the time.

Being the granddaddy of the modern Roguelike means that it doesn't really pull any punches, and lacks a lot of the quality of life features later games in the genre picked up, like granular difficulty. Actually, the game gets permanently harder as you progress, as you unlock harder alternate floors and bosses that can ruin your day, and the only way to go back is with a new save file. You have to get good or go home, and the only time it ever lets up is at the very end; when you've unlocked almost everything, you have a LOT of really good items you can find. But until then, you're fighting to unlock those items against harder and harder enemies, stages, and bosses. Don't buy this game expecting an easy time, especially with the new DLC, Repentance, which nerfed a lot of the best items (though it buffed some weaker ones, putting an emphasis on synergy instead of finding a single good item that practically gives you a win). It's a fun time, but even the normal mode can be a nightmare, especially when you don't know what you're doing.

But seriously, I can't think of any other roguelike with as much run variety as Isaac. I love Enter the Gungeon to bits, but no matter what you find, the game is almost always about shooting guns. Hades is nearly a perfect videogame, and what all roguelikes should aspire to be like, but when you get down to it, every run is a series of attacking, dodging, and casting, with little deviation. With Isaac, I had one run where a lot of my damage came from telefragging enemies using a floating doll. The run after I was using a blood laser to take out far enemies and a blood shotgun blast to take out near ones. The one after that, I was using my disembodied head to block shots while purposefully taking damage to increase my attack power. Just a few runs before that, I had a rainbow laser of death that fired alongside my normal attacks. The variety you can find in Isaac is simply unparalleled, and you never know what you're going to find on a given run. It makes for an endlessly replayable game.

TLDR: I recommend it! Get it with the DLC, and have a blast with possibly the most influential Roguelike ever, in the best state it's ever been. Don't cry when it hands you your ass on a platter, though."

29190,"I am a BIG fan of both Binding of Isaac games. This one more so because it takes the best of what the games consists of and multiplies it by 10 times! More items, more enemies, more levels. All that I could ask for in a superb and affordable package.  

Plus, I am hugely into learning about the bible lore and how everything ties into it. Neat to learn while gaming!"

The more runs you do, the better you get
Different items open up a variety of strategies that you can use to overcome the obstacles
The game adapts it's difficulty to your skill

Heck, Repentance is literally bigger than Rebirth itself and even doubled the number of playable characters, For those also not wanting to wait for the Repentance DLC to hit consoles and thinking about jumping ship from the console version to the PC version, there are ways to ""sync"" your console progress over to PC if you know what I mean. Definitely worth buying again if you're not a poor little third worlder."

29224,"Game's super good and I highly recommend it. Very fun, very difficult, very rewarding, basically endless replayability. There's some squicky stuff in it, but if anyone is reading this comment and wants to know if a specific thing that would make them feel extra bad is in there, feel free to message me to ask about it. : >"
29225,this is one of the best games I have every played
29226,"Endless fun and exploration as you try to achieve all of the various goals for each character.  There are 637 achievements and the gameplay doesn't get stale with procedural leveling and RNG.  

A great dungeon explorer/NetHack style game!"

29228,yes

29230,one of my favorite games ever created a true masterpiece
29231,eye sack
29232,I played the original I think back in 2013. Nearly completed it and bought Rebirth. Rebirth still had everything I loved. A lot of fun items and synergy between them that made this game great. It's like classic bomberman met zelda in some ways and yet very much it's own unique game. I bought Rebirth and it's DLCs on PS4 as well and got a bit attached but have to say PC is best for TBOI. I find it's a game I'll always come back and play between other games and play every now and then.
29233,"Very nice game. Lots of items, characters, enemies... A game that made my childhood way better"
29234,It's lit
29235,become back my money you f*ker this trash t*****ted l***arus is f****cking garbage

29241,it good
29242,"TBOI es un juego histórico, desde sus orígenes Flash en Newgrounds hasta el gran remake que es Rebirth, con cientos de Items y combinaciones, diferentes niveles y muchos jefes finales que derrotar con un gran set de personajes, vas a tardar mucho en aburrirte de este juego considerando que cada partida que inicies va a ser diferente.
Con respecto a los DLC, Afterbirth fué una bienvenida adición mientras que Afterbirth+ fué, dicho de la mejor manera, decepcionante; pero Repentance transforma todo a un juego completamente diferente y, en mi opinión, mucho mejor que el juego Base por lo que recomiendo mucho tener todos los DLC para obtener la experiencia completa. Eso sí, si quieres puedes conseguirlos de forma gradual, completar todo en el juego base, luego todo en Afterbirth, luego todo en Afterbirth+ y finalmente meterte en la gran aventura que es Repentance

Mil horas dedicadas a este juego y todavía faltas muchas más, muy recomendado."
29243,Amazing RPG game.
29244,Nice
29245,"Challenging and fun , nearly endless amount of combinations to keep content fresh and runs interesting. 

Rewards practiced play styles and offers something fun and quick which you can pick up at any time and resume or play for hours. recreational or goal based with steams achievements the game is fun for single player and for side by side runs with friends to compare and challenge each-other as well as having in game co op. works on my garbage laptop, so would recommend for players with low end pc constraints or laptops like mine, offers an immense amount of replay-ability for veterans and novices alike."
29246,Easy to pick up Hard to master 17 characters to play plus their alt versions tons of item combinations/synergies

29251,"The game is fun for most part, but its supposed to be game hard game but not RNG simulator, some features are bugged, some rooms are impossible to not get hit. I know people say get gud but its impossible in some parts its not Dark Souls where you can learn everything and finish it with no hit, not here you either get stomped or Youre blessed with good RNG and break the game(lol what a diversity). Im having like 200h in this game but not on steam. If Youre masochist that game is for You enjoy :D"
29252,This game will teach you to love rogue likes if you don't already
29253,addicting
29254,"god, the item bloat is so bad. you need to have been playing since launch to have an idea of whether or not the item you're about to pick up is worth the risk, or if it's about to brick your whole run.

mods are a must if you're new, I highly recommend the one that gives you complete item descriptions. 

fun game to chill in discord with pals to have them help point smaller things out to you, though, it is satisfying to see a weird item combo come together"
29255,yes
29256,"After the most recent update and the addition of a fully fledged co-op, TBOI is at it's most vast and expansive and I highly reccommend you get the full package. It's well worth the price and time."

That's a good thing, there is always a new item (although I have the DLCs). Highly suggest the game if you're aren't a sensitive religious person, because this game may offended you a tad, but I get a solid good laugh every so often.

Oh, don't take the game too serious. You will get your guts splattered across the floor a few times and might get mad if you care. I've only gotten maybe 4 wins and I'm missing about 2 or 3 characters and I'm still learning to play. You'll get OP items sooner or later.

29428,It's an addiction. Save yourself! Run!
29429,iits amazing
29430,"Very yuck to look at, definetly not for the faint of heart. Though I think 150+ hours speaks for itself when I'm dropping a thumbs up eh?"
29431,Best roguelike ever with an insane difficulty (especially in the first hours) but after that is very rewarding
29432,pain
29433,racism
29434,"10/10 would brimstone again
"
29435,"It's just more Isaac.  I had my doubts after all the buffs and nerfs, but it is still amazing.  The new tainted characters add a lot of depth to the gameplay and are just greatadditions."
29436,mmm
29437,fun to try different combinations of items
29438,It´s addictive...

29442,Pretty cool
29443,It's okay!
29444,"what can i say more, it's isaac, the best game to lose yourself in the madness of enemies, items and characters"
29445,G_G
29446,"so this game let me tell you about this game

so much to do so much to unlock if this was a phone game it would cost you 10grand to get this much content if you like:
bullet hells
progression
fun upgrades 
fun bosses 
hard games
a lot and its a lot of content
easy controls

just dont think twice buy it hell buy it for a friend buy it three extra times for yourself its just worth the money."
29447,this game made me lose my mind
29448,hash
29449,"This is the game that I always come back to. I cannot stress how enjoyable this game is. The items that you unlock as you delve further down the levels, the interesting and unique bosses you come across, and the gameplay loop are a wonderful combination that will always make you want to have one more run."
29450,It's fun
29451,"""OH GOD THIS IS HARD""

                          -Someone bad at games"
29452,The Mona Lisa of Rouge Lites
29453,"One of the best rogue-likes out there.  Once you get past the atmosphere and story, the game is fantastic.  The atmosphere is not for everyone, and the story can be depressing.  Worth it especially if on sale."
29454,nice
29455,ehh its alright
29456,"This game is easily my most played game of the last decade. It is punishingly difficult, but is equally as rewarding. If you are  fan of games that actually challenge you, then I cannot recommend this game enough. If you want something to hold your hand and treat you like a lady, go somewhere else."
29457,fun
29458,My sister likes this game and so I :D
29459,the game was and is alot more fun when you dont get the same 25 items 50 runs in a row.  after this new DLC the game is pretty shit. does not matter the run challenge mod or whatever you put in you will see the same items for hours and days on end. exteamly frustrating that RNG is not a thing in the game anymore
29460,Best rogue lite. Still discovering new things. 58% of achievements after 500h+ playing...
29461,Good game
29462,So addictive. 1 run turns into 20
29463,good game
29464,an amazing game. tough yet rewarding.
29465,Bindle of Isnacc is a very good game and here is why
29466,Good
29467,Fuck The Lost and fuck this game
29468,Isaac and his mother lived on a small house on a hill...
29469,yes
29470,"this game is very fun, with infinite replayability, if you are going to get the binding of isaac, i HIGHLY suggest you get all the dlc with it, it triples the content. this game is so goofy and playful and somehow dark and miserable all at the same time. the game is a 10/10 from me."
29471,"I absolutely love this game. I got all the achievements for up to afterbirth+ and was really happy. Then repentance came out and I checked to see that there were 200+ added. However, I haven't bought repentance yet and it really sucks that steam doesn't recognize it as a ""perfect"" game for me because I don't have the achievements from a dlc I haven't bought yet."
29472,This game is honestly pure gold.
29473,Pog as game tbh
29474,Very cool
29475,good
29476,great replay value
29477,I love this game very much
29478,Actually Is a really good game i recommend it a lot 10/10
29479,"It is fun, also a good teacher on how to accept failure and not rage afterwards. It is also a good trainer for the skill of being able to track multiple objects at once. So I'd highly recommend it."
29480,"""c A r E e R   s U i C i D e""
-egg"
29481,alright
29482,"This game is a classic for a reason. However, my main gripe is that there is not a very large line between getting lucky and skill. That defines every rougelite and about 25% of games so it's more of a nitpick."
29483,"It's hard to get used to, but it gets very addicting"
29484,this might be the best game
29485,this game is pure crack
29486,yes
29487,yummy in my tummy
29488,Cool game
29489,"This is a fun game, there is alot to it"

29495,yeeeaaaaay cancer
29496,"Sometimes you win a run, sometimes the game decides that you need to suffer."
29497,"very good, yes yes, must buy"
29498,still fun after 8 years
29499,"If you want to get all the achievements for this game in a sane manner buy the Afterbirth+ bundle get everything and then get Repentance otherwise you will find this game as nothing but pain to beat with Repentance on a fresh save, trust me I spent about 400 hours beating Rebirth, Afterbirth and Afterbirth+. even I feel pain playing repentance let alone someone new to the game"
29500,fun game
29501,Pog
29502,i guess its okay
29503,good
29504,This is beautiful game I think everyone should play at least once. The story line is thrilling and brilliantly written.
29505,Very gud
29506,My favorite game in whole roguelike history
29507,"you solve your problems by crying, what else do you need to know?"
29508,80 hours in and still haven't unlocked anything? Must be Issac 10/10
29509,lol fun rouge like that HATES the player
29510,very good
29511,Perfect.

29518,"one of the best games i've ever played in my life, 600 hours on ps4, only 214 so far on pc and hundreds more to come easily."

29524,YES
29525,it's ok I guesss :/
29526,You had me at jumping poo monsters!
29527,"Probably played this for over 1000 hours on PS4 and this game is super fun. One of the best Rogue-likes ever with countless synergies and endless fun. You're always unlocking new items that enhance the gameplay tenfold. In conclusion, completely epic."
29528,One of the greatest roguelikes I ever played
29529,"The story is great, unlike any game I've seen. Wish there were more narrations"
29530,would be better if it looked like the original
29531,edmundo pederasta
29532,it fun
29533,"This game has so much content and replay-ability it really is an all-around good game to pick up and sink 7 hours a night into. It's addictive and challenging, and if you get bored you can pick up the DLC and get even more content."
29534,glorp... slpolpl. :)
29535,"Amazing Rogue-Like with TONS of content, I've played for 800+ hours and there's still new things that I'm unlocking, definitely worth the amount of gameplay you get for the price! 10/10"
29536,pain
29537,
29538,pain
29539,this thang go brazy
29540,"Best game of all time in replayability, difficulty, and progression in my opinion. A timeless classic!"
29541,good game just stick with it and it gets better over time
29542,It's alright
29543,"Masterpiece, story and gameplay."
29544,"This game is fucking great I probably don't have to tell you this but for love of all that is holy stay the fuck away if you are a completionist because this game is also evil, you will go bald playing this game i promise


10/10 would fight delirium again"

Azazel= 100% win rate"
29546,gooda game
29547,"I mean its obviously phenomenal. The most replayability of any game in my library. keeps you on your toes, constantly throws new shit at you. Teaches you how the game works effortlessly. Straight. Hot. Fire."
29548,good good
29549,pew
29550,not a game for people who get frustrated easily
29551,goated
29552,h
29553,"I have played over 650 hours on this game. It never gets old.  Amazing replay, always randomized."
29554,boring
29555,Its a video game.
29556,"This game is both fun to play and watch others play. It is quite hard, but I never feel like I want to quit, and seeing steady progress in my own skill through the many hours of play keeps me coming back to it. So many things to unlock and explore from run to run. Death is only a means to learn something you didn't know before, so you don't die the same way the next run, and the next, and the next"
29557,Great game that has an extreme amount of content
29558,yo mom
29559,painfully great...
29560,"Contains most of the body fluids, just wish it had all of them. Pretty good."
29561,"Its gud. 
Get the DLCs for the whole story :)"
29562,Classic roguelike at its finest.
29563,I like it
29564,Good rogue-like.
29565,"I personally didn't love it, It wasn't that fun"
29566,"I am really enjoying the new DLC. The new characters are all unique, and the gameplay is fun. I like many of the new items and features added, and the changes really revitalized my interest in the game."
29567,GAME GOOD
29568,It has worm physics.
29569,This game is really good
29570,"This game is great for casual play, and a challenge for completionists!"
29571,"this damn game never gets repetitive, every single run is different and the game will find a way to screw you over in every single one of them

10/10 got addicted on ps4 and i'm addicted again on pc I haven't seen my wife in months

edit: still not tired, just finished every normal character mark"
29572,veri nice

29579,"good

29580,"didn't think i'd be into it, but it's funny and gross and grim. I guess it's pretty fun also."

29583,A good time spender. i mean with alot of characters and endings its like a new game ever play through
29584,"Look... I have 800 hrs in the game. It's good, okay?"
29585,"This game is so freaking awesome, best rogue like for me"

29592,endless gameplay bros
29593,"Oh it's an amazing game, 31 hours in first two weeks. I fell in love with it instantly. I recommend it to people that like rogue style games, a lot of fun with a lot of combinations."
29594,GOOD GAME
29595,yes
29596,I love the ever changing levels. I never get the same power up combinations and that always presents a fun new challenge. I have fun playing for a while to wind down after a long day.
29597,noice
29598,"wasted 700 hours of my life, because of this game i neither have friends nor a GIRLFRIEND!
i got addicted really bad, failed school and now i am HOMELESS, BROKE and also really ugly for no reason what. so. ever.

29599,nice
29600,Good game
29601,"Great game, I always find myself returning to this gem. Huge deal of replayability and depth of story for those seeking hard enough to find it.

Edit 11/26/21: After the release of Repentance and several hundred more hours, I can confirm this game is still legendary and a must-play for anyone into rogue-lites."
29602,Solid quality rouge like with A LOT of depth for replayability
29603,"if you are a masochist, this will be up your alley"
29604,"ez game
"
29605,yes!
29606,good
29607,"At first, I did not know if I would enjoy this game and now after several hours of play time, I wonder why I ever thought that.  This is out of my comfort zone when it comes to gaming in both play style and challenge.  However, the developers did an amazing job in making the game difficult but extremely rewarding.  I have completed several runs, but I am likely to continue playing this game for hours more.  Solid game choice!"
29608,old but amazing game
29609,Great amounts of fun
29610,pasha3
29611,"The best Rouge-Like game there is, no debate."
29612,pew pew im sad
29613,I know I have hardly any playtime on steam but I got this game for free originally on my PS4 a while back and have dumped countless hours into this game. Best roguelike I have ever played.
29614,I love this game but i'm also absolutely garbage at it. 9/10
29615,"its too addictive if you like rougelikes
"
29616,Isaac's back baby! Best game ever made gets a new DLC!
29617,Amazing game! 10000% worth playing!

29626,pretty cool game love newgrands
29627,"If I'm not going to recommend a game after 700 hours...

It's great."
29628,yea
29629,"Fun game, had to port my save over and had some troubles but  nice"
29630,"Easily one of my favorite games. Each play through is different, increasingly difficult, but so amazingly fun. The whole game is one of a kind, and I own it on several systems. Do yourself a favor and look into this game for your collection."
29631,i dont think a game has ever made me as angry as this game does but i cant stop
29632,"Baby cries.
TV is best boss.

29635,i have a recurring fear of aliens walking in while i'm in the bath good game 10/10
29636,Cry more baby
29637,FUN GAME
29638,"waaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaa
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
29639,"There are spoilers below:

I've been playing Isaac since the release of the original game, and whereas some of the updates only seemed to make it worse by filling the item pool with useless items, Repentance has rebalanced many of those previously useless items, and it feels like there are very few hopeless runs. Alongside this broad, amazing rebalancing, it added an INSANE amount of content. Just as I was starting to think I was wrapping things up, I noticed that I still had like... 300 achievements to go, and thought that was weird, since I had already beaten Delirium, Mega Satan, etc. with almost every character... Then I learned about SPOILER [spoiler]Home[/spoiler] and the bosses that were added there.

Well, I buckled up and got to work clearing out those completion marks, SPOILER [spoiler]AND THEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE FREAKING TAINTED CHARACTERS[/spoiler]!!

Jesus Nicalis, will you ever actually let me finish Isaac??"
29640,good stuff
29641,isaac
29642,"Item balance is broken. You either press ""R"" or painfully play"
29643,Another killer game in the series!
29644,its isaac what more must i say. lol
29645,E
29646,finally my dreams of smacking around unborn children has been realized!
29647,Probably the most known and most liked rogue-like game of all time and that is all you need to know. Also the newest Repentance DLC is just so freaking good that it just feels like playing whole new game.
29648,naked baby
29649,"Good
"
29650,"good game, played a little"
29651,"Pretty epic game.Bit weird tho like the fuck does his mum keep in her basement - Glad i don't live there- 

Still fun to play 10/10"
29652,Really entertaining game with tons of content
29653,"beending of isook be liek

PEW  PEW
zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap
OH GOD IM DYING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
blorsh"
29654,"good game to pass an hour or two.
pointless as life itself: start, fail, repeat;  i really like it 10/10"
29655,"The fact that I didn't play this years ago, is maybe my biggest regret in life..."
29656,"cry
"
29657,DABABY?!?!?
29658,Good game
29659,"absolutely fucking AWFUL game design. 95% of this entire stupid fucking addictive game is complete ass and is making me lose my fucking mind. sometimes you think 'hey maybe i'll get lucky this time' and that's all the game is it's complete fucking luck. sometimes you get good items but then the boss great gideon appears and you just LOSE because there's NOTHING YOU CAN FUCKING DO. difficulty in games is not 'if you're losing, that means it's hard and you're BAD!!!' it's making a boss have tough but fair patterns you can't just spam a billion enemies at the player and force them into one tiny corner and expect them to be able to dodge everything that's fucking bullshit. it's not even only bad room design, bad combat entirely, but also just bad mechanics in general. the more you play the game, the more you see how FUCKING ASS it is. i hate this game from the very bottom of my heart and i can't wait for the heat death of the universe so this stupid ass game is removed from existance with not a single trace of evidence it ever existed remaining. FUCK. YOU.

for your sake, don't buy this game. it's addictive, but it's a complete donkey shit game."
29660,"Edmund I love you! Awesome roguelike twin stick shooter bullethell game, simply upgraded from the OG. The artsyle is good and the story is... interesting. Its messed up but I like it. Don't let your kids play this but if you like roguelikes you will like this game and its endless progression, its price makes it an easy buy."
29661,"Every run is pure pain, 11/10"
29662,Great game. Can be super frustrating but I keep coming back for more.
29663,a real pog game
29664,"I've spent close to 600 hours playing this game and there is a reason for it: this game is amazing.  The sheer amount of randomness with each run allows this game to be played over and over.  It is challenging but once you get familiar with the items, characters, and mechanics it gets a lot more manageable. I recommend that people install the external information mod before playing, it's extremely helpful knowing what item does what. I'm confident to say that the Binding of Isaac is easily in my top 10 favorite video games of all time!"
29665,"Por favor, jueguen esto."
29666,"Incredibly replayable Zelda-I-style roguelike. Completionism in this game is not hollow or easy -- it has the rare trait of maintaining (and often increasing) difficulty, even as your unlocks progress. Great bang for your buck, if it's the type of gameplay you can enjoyl"
29667,some heat
29668,"There is many things to unlock and many secrets including bosses, secret characters, and secret ways."
29669,i will  become back my money
29670,"I have this game on all my systems (PS, Switch, PC) and I can never get enough. Infinite replay value but always a challenge. Great game."
29671,is good
29672,i mean i'm not the guy that played the most of this game but god damn it's good. Last expension is kinda hard do if you are up for it. good luck with that i'm not even sure if i'm close to finish it 100% but one day i will.
29673,oifcgyt68tyigh
29674,yiss
29675,Christian educational game. Makes me want to die.
29676,good
29677,"Really incredible gameplay! Even in later progress and higher levels, runs are still interesting and I can still push my speedrun times faster and faster... would recommend with all I can!"
29678,very addicting
29679,"Hands Down My favourite Rogue like, some of the bosses hurt like a bus and its hard as heck at times but its well worth it. 10/10 would buy again"
29680,"Some would say Aight, i would be one of those people"
29681,fast paced and quite addictive. Easy to play for 10 minutes or 4 hours. Every run is unique so one game never feels the same
29682,Fun and challenging
29683,amazing game very addictive
29684,i love this game
29685,é os gurizes
29686,"Its got cool themes, serviceable mechanics, and an absurd amount of items and item synergies. With the DLC, one of the most dense games to exist. It's just too good."
29687,fire
29688,hmm
29689,I mean this game is hella satanic and everything but you can kill your mom so that makes the hole experience worth it 10/10 imp
29690,This is one of the best games I have ever played. I played early versions when I was younger and enjoyed it so much now I get to play it in its final version. Amazing.
29691,"very cool
"
29692,Played just a little bit. It's alright I guess...
29693,"yep
"
29694,very very good. one of my fav rouge like type games
29695,"It's challenging at first, but the game really grows on you."
29696,Great game. buy it.
29697,good
29698,very gooooooooooood gam
29699,"Everything and Nothing, but mostly crying
"
29700,"You can't spell ""fart"" without ""art""."
29701,gave me anger issues
29702,Just buy it you dumb dumb
29703,"I have played this game for more than 500 hours and I feel I still have at least 500 more to play before I run out of content. If that's not an endorsement, you tell me what is."
29704,"Great game im thinking of me when im playing 
"
29705,10/10 name another game in which you can cry on your own fetus while impersonating biblical figures.
29706,"So much fun and infinite replayability, fun game to pop into for a short time or to just binge for hours. My most played game on steam."
29707,Very intense!
29708,nice
29709,"IM SUCKED INTO IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"
29710,"Edmund McMillen, You litte F**ker You made a shit of piece with your trash Issac it’s f**King Bad this trash game I will become back my money I hope you will in your next time a cow on a trash farm you sucker"
29711,Repentance is basically what Afterbirth was to the original game.  There's *so much* content that I think edmund honestly undersold the size of it.
29712,Doesn't work for mac laptops.
29713,"Exibit is a bot, so the game is great!"
29714,A purchase worth your money.
29715,you die a lot
29716,Fun lots to do and infinite replayability. The only flaw is that you have to unlock everything and almost all updates come in dlc
29717,"best rogue like ever, developers use this game for references.
"
29718,"Died a billion times, don't play if you wanna chill. GG tho."
29719,it good
29720,ISAAC WILL BE THE SACRIFICE
29721,If you are wondering whether or not repentance makes this game worth picking up again. It does! It adds a lot of content in a lot of different ways. Perfect for completionists.
29722,"you can put a couple hours into it, yeah"
29723,Repentance DLL fixed everything that needed to be fixed
29724,Really good waiting for mods to be compatible again.
29725,best offline game in the world
29726,"Gameplay is fun, the mods are great

The performance is fine but could be way better"
29727,It's Binding of Isaac. Why don't you own this yet?
29728,Good game would buy again.
29729,i may need more time. but i think the game has potential :D
29730,"Good game.
But also frustrating, does not give enough information by itself, open the wiki (platinumgod.co.uk) before even starting this game or you will suffer more then needed. (You will still suffer much. ;( )"
29731,Good game
29732,"fuck bloat, all my homies hate bloat"
29733,play it cucks
29734,good challengeing game
29735,repentance fries your memory
29736,Blue Face Baby
29737,repetence is the best expansion ever!

oh look tech x time to forget about everything that has gone wrong for like, twelve minutes."
29741,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the best roguelites ever made. This game offers infinite replayability, fun, and insane item synergies. With Repentance being the final DLC/Update for the game, there is never a better time to start playing. There are hours and hours of content for you to experience. Soon the modding community will make even more content for us to try out. After 10 years of this franchise, I am still playing and I don't plan to stop anytime soon."
29742,"This is the biggest roguelike game out there. It has everything you need: lots of different items and enormous amount of synergies between them, unique bosses and enemies that will challenge you during your runs, lots of unlockables and characters with their own mechanics. This is the best roguelike experience you'll ever get"
29743,"Every 5-10 runs I do I get frustrated and ragequit the game. It's been going on like this for years, help"
29744,"The Binding of Isaac truly offers an almost endless onslaught of content to enjoy, with secrets and challenges fun to find and overcome. At least, all the way up to Afterbirth Plus, it's a worthwhile purchase! I haven't personally gotten the new DLC, Repentance, but after playing Afterbirth Plus, I'm 100% assured to get it."

29770,"PRE-REPENTANCE (Base game up to Afterbirth +) is an absolutely great game. I love it. So much. I don't have much to say. Buy it. But don't buy repentance, please (see below)

EDIT: most of the review below is for Repentance. See above for pre-repentance review.

I love Isaac. I loved Rebirth, Afterbirth, AB+. But Repetence I don't like.
The game was very fun, maybe a ""little"" broken from time to time but that was part of the experience. In the end you're the one who tries to break the game.
But they nerfed every single thing to oblivion. And now the game has become so hard that even as an experienced player I can only get about one in 10 runs with a win.
Some new rooms are absolutely horrible and undodgable, same for some enemies.
The game is so hard indeed that not one have I had a run capable of going into the new levels which are way, way too hard.
The shops in hard mode are horrible, no items, no reroll box. Essentially, every single strategic thing was removed from the game and it was turned into a 100% bullet hell game.

I'm about 15 hours into Repentence btw. Some of the new items are cool. But the fact that they completely reset the meta for something very meh, it's terrible.
Looking forward to getting mods to un-nerf the game. Until then I would not recommend repentence. Would definitely recommend the base game without that DLC; heck even buy Afterbirth and AB+ as they are good. But fuck Repentence."

29777,The game is great even if it's hard

29781,"repentance takes away most of the enjoyable mechanics from previous items (often by adding rng to items that were originally consistent) and adds annoying enemies (some track your movement more aggressively than before, others take so long to show up that it interrupts the flow of game play) and annoying rooms (many of which are just enemy spam with no thought to how you could survive) and says this is the ""definitive"" edition. what little enjoyment you may have been able to eke out before (afterbirth+ was another disappointment) gets disrupted by the bizarre decisions the dev chose to make. if you want to play, wait until the modding community is able to do what the dev could not - make it fun."
29782,">:-(

I'll change this review when they'll fix ""the marathon"" achievement not unlocking after doing what needed"
29783,YAYE
29784,good game
29785,sawg game
29786,it's fine ig
29787,too many items:P
29788,"Ive bought this game for every system that i could, ive dumped over 1k hrs into it easily on PS4, so im excited to have new content and to finally be able to play on the PC. Def recommend using a controller."
29789,yes
29790,"[h1] Simple and elegant, with enormous replayability [/h1]

Bought the game a few weeks ago and thought about leaving a review only once I beat the game - I am now at 100 hours played and still feel like I am nowhere near finishing it (both story- and 100%-wise). The replayability on this is insane, I haven't had a single run that felt the same - layouts, bosses, rooms, enemies and most importantly items change every run drastically. I also do not feel that it is necessarily as hard as some feedback suggests; even on hard mode there will be games that you absolutely steamroll.

One issue I have is that the number of items can also feel quite overwhelming, as there are many items which are obviously useless or nearly a copy of another item.

I would welcome any sort of internal item database (e.g. like the Encyclopedia mod) to limit the reliance on the external databases (i.e. platinumgod), as I still go there at least once per run since I often obtain items I have never seen before. At the same time, I guess that alt-tabbing and navigating in any sort of ingame database wouldn't differ much in terms of how much time it saves, so it's not that big of a deal but having only played this on controller and sometimes on TV, far from the keyboad, that might actually help."
29791,Fun

29793,"Just great.
It feels like everything has already been said about this game... after all it's been out for so long...
But i just wanted to add my little comment,
