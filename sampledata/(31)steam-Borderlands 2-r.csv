0,Great Story. I would not recommend OP levels if you want a balanced game.
1,Its a very amazing game i would recommend it but i dont recommend for new players i would suggest be familiar with rpg's and shooting also starting from the first game t understand the story
2,"If you REALLY wanted to be a perfect completion player, Borderlands in general doesn't really stop giving you new guns and there is SIGNIFICANT replay value with this game.  You can do challenges for yourself and with others, both friends and random folks you otherwise wouldn't meet.  The story is also pretty solid in my opinion and some of the quests are just plain funny.  4.9/5 stars for me."

31,Stalin recomends
32,"Borderlands 2 is probably the best shooter-looter of it's time, and in 2022 remains a top candidate for that title. Aside from the endless stream of loot (so good), the writing is another big part of the success of the game. Check your maturity at the door and enjoy the toilet humour and sexual innuendo."
33,Gearbox is never going to top this game and they are aware of that considering they needlessly update this game to advertise the newest borderlands game to you. because of that I'd recommend you look into hex editing your game to get rid of the stupid banner ads
34,a great game
35,good soup
36,Guns go brrr
37,"I would not play this game if someone had a gun to my head, my dogs, my nans or even steve backshall. It's a fucking joke. There is more pleasure to be had squeezing my testicles to a pulp. Exposing by bellend to the demon core experiment would at least be interesting."
38,iss a good rpg
39,It's a very fun game. Also it has up to 4 player's can be in one game
40,this game is not that good
41,"A masterpiece, of both comedy and game design."
42,its good
43,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

49,"The game now constantly nagging you about New Tales from the Borderlands.
It's not even out yet and everybody and their cat knows it is going to tank."
50,"good game, hours of content"
51,"One of the best games of all time.  Unfortunately, completely RIDICULOUS lack of local multiplayer ONLY on this platform is making me not want to buy any more games from this publisher.  Seems you can't even LAN the game without purchasing 2 licenses.  Absolutely terrible."

67,Best game in the series
68,"Have been playing this game on and off ever since it came out back in 2012, of course that was on the Xbox 360 but still. This game is alright solo, but where it really shines is co-op. Even with just one friend you'll have fun, but with three friends you'll have blast. The story is quite good and compelling, and the side quests and gun play are still rock solid to this day."
69,A shine new MEAT Bicycle!!!
70,"Fast game play, ALL characters are powerful, very fun FPS - 10/10 Dialogue, extremely funny"
71,gaming
72,Swell item to just own in your Steam library.
73,"It's 2022, this is still one of my favorite games of all time. The universe, the characters, the gameplay, the comedy, all of it is executed perfectly in one sarcastic, gore-filled, looter shooter adventure that stands the test of time. I'd recommend this to anyone with a hankering for cartoonish first-person over-the-top cartoon-styled action, BL2 is an awesome game!"
74,good game
75,borderlands? more like borderline personality disorder

92,Moxxi my beloved.
93,No
94,"Borderlands 2 is one of the few examples of a sequel that is better in almost every way than its predecessor. This game captures the series' signature humour and setting the best, and, though the gameplay can feel a bit clunky at times, it's still great fun. You get four heroes to choose from, plus two more DLC heroes, and the DLC content is pretty cheap nowadays. I've had many hundreds of hours of fun on console, plus the 60-some-odd here, so I definitely recommend. Also, the game's way more fun with friends--preferably 4."

105,One of my all-time favorite games by far. The only one I am willing to go through the beginning multiple times so I can show my friends. The world and characters are so zany and fantastic that I keep coming back. Dameon Clark really sold the villain of this game and I am in love with the character because of it!

141,"what a fantastic game. i'd gotten borderlands 1 around the time it came out, and because i was a stubborn child, i dismissed 2 when i first played it bc it felt different and wasnt the borderlands i knew and loved.

i think it was a friend of mine who convinced me to play it around 2015-2016 and i was hooked. it really did improve upon a LOT, and although to some degree i prefer certain aspects of BL1 more, BL2 is like the definitive borderlands experience that anyone looking to get into looter shooters or the series should start with. (i havent played BL3, but this is coming from my experience with 1, 2 and TPS.)

it really feels like a game that a casual gamer could pick up and have tons of fun with in normal vault hunter mode and maybe even true (the 1st and 2nd playthroughs), and seasoned gamers who enjoy putting hundreds of hours into games have all kinds of stuff to grind and challenges to face in UVHM and the subsequent OP levels, raid bosses and all that.

it's a one of a kind game in both genre and style, and although it isnt perfect (im one of those nerds who insists theres no such thing), it's damn well close."
142,Another fun adventure on Pandora. I loved the first borderlands and this one is a blast as well.
143,"My childhood game, love it <3"
144,frequent boring cutscenes which can not be skipped and random network error completely ruined the game. Absolutely not recommended.
145,the cocaine of fps games
146,It's ok
147,I don't like this game because I hate the Looter Shooter and RPG mechanics and the enemies are too bullet spongy but the writing for the game is good so there is some fun to be had.
148,gg
149,"he satisfaction once you kill jack is amazing, has very cool bosses and actually requires skill. 10/10"
150,"Seriously? 2K games added a POS launcher, and ads TO A PAID GAME, AND a newly required 3rd party account, to several of its games on Steam, including this one?

171,GREAT
172,"Dumb, violent, gory fun designed to appease that 13 year old buried in your brain."
173,yes
174,/
175,"You don't realise how bad the writing and humour was in BL3 until you go back and play this one. Absolute comedy gold and the voice acting for Handsome Jack is just ridiculously good. 

I got the GOTY version recently as I never played as the Mechromancer or Psycho character on the Xbox 360. Chose the Mechromancer and kinda regret it as the Robot you summon is just way overpowered and slaughters everything before you can get close, even at level 20 where I'm at now. Annoyingly this has included a character I needed to keep alive which failed the mission so had to restart that one. The perks themselves are pretty standard stuff like health and shield regen, elemental damage and chance increase etc so shame they aren't that interesting especially for a DLC character. Will have a crack at the Psycho character down the line though as the core game is just good old shooty banging fun that never get old, even after so many years."
176,Just plain good fun crazy characters
177,Favorite game.
178,best story game
179,its alright
180,SUPER fun. The battles get a bit difficult but playing with a mate it is the funnest thing ever.
181,"I'm still suprised, that even after all these years, this game somehow still holds up. If you're an mmo rpg fan and want something offline, this is it."
182,I have about a second entire life just on this game with the amount of time ive wasted between platforms  I could have gone and got a degree and made a better borderlands 3
183,still holds up well solid game
184,"I've played this game on a PS Vita before, so I was excited to see it on steam with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Unfortunately, my laptop just wasn't compatible. The game crashed after playing it for maybe 30 minutes. I tried to make it work by troubleshooting but the game didn't fit the screen (I think this might have contributed to the problem) and every time the game crashed it blocked me from being able to close it by freezing the screen. After restarting my laptop twice just to be able to close the game, I decided to give up and uninstall the game and then get a refund. It's a great game, story-rich, and probably the best out of the entire series. The action and missions are great, especially because you can play it over again which increases the difficulty. It's a game that'll need a bit of skill to win, but still super fun, just sad I couldn't play it on here."
185,its fine but kinda of hard
186,fun lol
187,...
188,It fun.
189,"Borderlands 2 is an excellent game with a lot to do. Some of the missions do get repetitive, but otherwise, it is fun!"

214,grape 10/10
215,ive played this game on xbox for 400 hours i highly recomend any borderlands
216,Even on sale for 90% off this game doesnt feel worth it.  The amount of time you spend back tracking lets you realize that most of the areas and level design is basically just made by someone copy pasting the exact same assets and enemies over and over again in a more or less straight line. Even the guns dont feel that unique but you sure get a lot of them that are completly and utterly useless.
217,AWW WHATS IN THE BOX!?!?!?!??!?!

234,Brings back nostalgia and one of the best borderland games.
235,"Great gameplay, funny as hell."
236,"This is a great game, with many glitches that actually help with stylizing your builds. The gun play is amazing, there is a gun for every play-style (Including Melee) which is just par for the course. Wait, I just realized who I am reviewing this to. You only read the big words.

BUY THE GAME FOR THE LOVE OF THE ERIDIANS"

242,"Game is great. Been playing for years

Me and my friend started a co-op game and got to Moxxi's and immediately gave her all our money and then stopped playing for a few days overall

Great game, and great physics on more than just Moxxi"

Still a little shocking how pathetically sloppy Gearbox was with these,  but I struggled with this downvote because when it runs well, it's pretty fun.  But ultimately I feel like if a company is going to charge full price and then reach back into your pockets as many times as they possibly can no matter how pathetic and sad it gets, their product should at least perform it's most basic core function reliably.

277,AMAZING
278,yes
279,"Would change this to ""Maybe"" as a recommendation if possible. Fan of both genres it's mixing, just not the pacing and overall game play the underlying game engine offers.  Gunplay and movement are too slow and clunky.  The content and world don't quite make up enough for that like Half Life and Half-Life 2 did during it's campaigns."

287,"It's kind of like if you took the first Borderlands...
And made a sequel."
288,"Im sure it would be a fun game if I could get past the very start. Ive played tons of other shooter games and had no problems, including borderlands 3, but for some reason he takes about 3 damage from a sniper rifle shot, only becomes vulnerable right as Im bleeding out, has infinite minions, and keeps you lit on fire indefinitely so you cant regen shields, so I cant progress at all."

290,"The best 27,7 hours of my life"
291,"It's worth taking into consideration that a few years have passed since I played through Borderlands 2. Although, the game's apparent success and popularity since my time with it leads  me to believe the core experience remains wild,, somewhat novel for a FPS, and entertaining/endearing enough to persuade myself, and many others, to purchase and experience the various Borderlands entries that followed as it grew into the popular series it is today."
292,The best game ever made by far for me 100% recommend
293,borderlands 2 is a modern classic looter shooter really nothing more to be said. played the fuck out of this game on xbox 360 when i was younger
294,This is one of the best games I ever played. The story is amazing and the DLCs too. Hopefully the Borderlands franchise never dies.

324,"While i like this game, there is a growing number of atrocities commited against short people. As a short person myself i find this to be extremely distressing. seeing midgets strapped to shields and used as canon fodder has been unnerving, i now sleep every night hoping a giant man doesn't strap me to his shield and use me to block shotgun blasts from marauding vault hunters."

If your going for achievements and didnt buy the fight for sanctuary DLC or didnt get it during its very limited free tim. you will have to cough up an extra $15 because the achievements where added in years after the game came out."

382,"A looter shooter unchallenged by any even in its own series. Borderlands 2 is a phenomenal looter shooter with an unmistakable art style, vast array of cool weapons, huge variance in builds and skills, as well as an excellent villain to root against. The dialog ranges from hilarious to awfully cringy due to its comedy based in 2012 internet culture, and the story can be painfully undercut by poor in game character movements and bad timing (for some reason this is the case with all Borderlands games).
The main draw of the game is the looting and shooting. And woo boy, there is a metric butt ton. It is easy to stack thousands of hours in this game and not get bored due to its excellent character variety, build variety, and weapon variety, but for me, I found my comfortable limit around 300. Not necessary with friends, but it's even better.
There's mods and community fixes to the game that change the game and allow for new experiences; they're definitely worth trying out.

Buy the GOTY edition on a fat sale, and have a blast with or without your buddies."
383,The game is easy to run and all of the DLC is worth it. Play it because I said so.
384,Handsome Jack
385,honestly this is the single best game ive ever played
386,Great game!
387,almost 200 hours no pearlescent halfway through uvhm but havent had a single point of boredom also my game glitched and made me skip from after the preservation to the end of the game for my normal playthrough so that was pog
388,ALL TIME FAVE GAME
389,for an old game this is quality. love it so much definitely recommended
390,Borderlands series is the peak of FPS looter shooter genre. Boom Boom
391,Been playing Borderlands since it came out love the game.
392,"I am a 43 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Borderlands and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, looked at the menu, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
393,"I really like borderlands I have multiple characters on other consoles and stuff like that, and at least probably over 600 hours in this game.  This is a top 10 game for ,me all time only because i like it so much."

429,"hundreds of hours spent playing this on Xbox. Countless Playthroughs that never got old to me it felt new almost every time due to each character having different builds and mechanics, different guns specialized for different characters. I just built my first PC and this game was so good i had to buy it again and much to my surprise its even better.  there are so many subtle yet huge details that console does not get the pleasure of seeing. i am only one person but i recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.  Tis top notch 5/5"

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
It's crazy it took me this long to review one of my favorite games of all time but here it is, Borderlands 2, a first-person looter shooter with incredible humor, an amazing villain, and overall just a truly fun game. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Handsome Jack.
+The atmosphere.
+The guns.

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-A lot of weak and pointless DLC's.
-Plenty of cringe moments. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is a direct sequel to the events of the first game, and oh boy, what a story. Do you even remember the villain of the first game? I doubt anyone does or cares. Borderlands 2 comes in full force with much better writing than before and gives us probably one of the best villains out there in gaming. 

You're placed in the shoes of the new Vault Hunters seeking rich and fame as always when it all goes foobar, and Handsome Jack blows up your train leaving you to die in the cold. You get rescued by the most charming, lovable, and strong character of all time, Claptrap. Things get complicated as you progress, as its always the case, you meet some very familiar faces along the way that now has much more depth to their character and some new and hilarious ones such as Torque(hillarious DLC btw) and Tiny Tina(highly recommended playing her DLC).

The humor is back, and you'll be laughing your ass off most of the time, assuming you have a sense of humor or at least a very open-minded sense of humor. Not all the jokes land, of course, there are a ton of cringe moments, but it's part of the game's charm. I'd pick this kind of cringe over what we got in Borderlands 3 any f'ing day. But the story isn't just humor, it has some serious stuff, some dark stuff, and so on, and as I mentioned before, Handsome Jack carries the whole thing on his shoulders. I never thought I'd get to see a villain as great as the Joker, but Jack does come close.

The main story won't blow your mind, but the characters and the random things happening to you or around you are well worth seeing.

Story rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If you played the first game then you know what to expect; if you haven't, the gist is that it's a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on looting tons of unique and sometimes funny weapons. You get to play as six characters if you have the DLCs, each with its own unique skill tree. You shoot stuff, you pick stuff, you level up stuff, that's the whole shebang. 

The weapons are the main aspect here, and they are incredibly fun to use, most of the time anyway. I've heard and had a lot of debate with different people over time in regards to Borderlands 1 weapons vs Borderlands 2 weapons on how they handle and shoot. To me, the clear winner will always be Borderlands 2 just because it's far more diverse but, yes, I do also tend to agree that some of the Borderlands 1 weapons felt more like real weapons, but they were so rare that I remember hating them all.

Borderlands 2 has some really creative weapons, ones that even talk or are cursed, and I loved them all, but I wish they had a way of letting us upgrade their levels. What I mean by that is, the game is VERY easy, at least on your first playthrough, and there is no way to increase difficulty. Instead, it uses, just like the rest of the games in the franchises, a new game+ mechanic where if you want to make the game harder you have to finish it and replay it with the same character repeatedly. It's an artificial and stupid(IMO) way to make players stick with your game more. I prefer to play the hardest from the get-go, and be done with it. Here I'm not only forced to play the main game several times, but I can't even pick a new class/hero. Luckily you can find some saves online for the True Vault Hunter modes and go from there. 

That being said, even though your first playthrough might be easy, it's still a very fun game, a game I never once felt bored or annoyed, and shooting, killing enemies/cool bosses, looting, and whatever else was overall satisfying. 

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
You can't have good humor without good voice acting, and yep, Borderlands 2 has some very talented voice actors, especially Handsome Jack. I never thought hearing a guy eating pretzels would make me laugh, but here we are. Naturally, everyone else also does a good job, even if some of the cast can be quite cringe at times. 

As for the music, well it's done by Jesper Kyd. If that name does not ring a bell, you should be ashamed of yourself. The man has an incredible talent and you can tell once you hear some of the music, especially the combat songs in the game. As for everything else sound-related, from atmospheric ones to how the guns sound, it's all perfect. 

Audio rating: 9/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Remember Nvidia PhysX? It was a very demanding feature and probably still is, and most of the time it was never really utilized properly, but Borderlands 2 makes use of it in an incredible way. I highly recommend you experience it for yourselves but suffice to say, every weapon you shoot with leaves behind or on impact tons of particle effects that never get old to look at. 

The game is also quite a looker, and has aged very nicely, one of the better Unreal Engine 3 games. The atmosphere is very diverse, very detailed, and you'll travel to a lot of cool places, especially in the DLC levels. Level design is a bit simple, open-ended maps with no particular depth, but they're still better than most stuff we get these days. 

As for bugs and performance, well, it's not perfect, and it wasn't when it launched either. Even on Today's hardware, I had issues with frame drops, constant crashes, and other coop issues. They're not bad, but just a bit annoying at times.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Borderlands 2 has a special place in my heart as one of the best coop games ever made, alongside one of the best villains ever made. There's no reason not to buy the game, especially if you have some friends to play with. It's just that fun. 

[h1]Final score: 8.5/10[/h1]"
452,one of the best games ive ever played
453,"Extremely fun and humorous no-thinking-needed shooter game. Came for the gameplay, stayed for the story and comedy. Though some side quests (and specifically Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt) felt tedious, the rest of what the game offered was definitely worth the time spending on. Dragon Keep is totally the highlight of the whole game.

9/10"
454,I've been playing this game since the Xbox 360 days. i've put countless hours into it and there's still more to do. i would highly recommend this game to anyone.
455,"you know how people say the second one of something is the best? it's true, Borderlands 2 is the best borderlands"
456,the game ever
457,Ye

474,10/10. I always find myself coming back to this game and playing for weeks. Nothing will ever come close to this.
475,help my friend made me get it
476,i will never get tired of this game.
477,"good game 
9/10 because the first few missions get boring after youve done them 20/30 times before"
478,"Borderlands, except with Handsome Jack. And a better open world feeling. All the other stuff is still here: the shooting, the looting, the on line play. Much better than Borderlands. So a very very good shooter. But you still can't kill Clap trap...."
479,anarchy stacking my beloved
480,Fun as hell
481,"You know. If you don't, look up a video.

Edit: They did the thing Creative Assembly did With TWW2 And but an ad on the main menu. This does not effect the gameplay or amazing story, Hovever is pretty scummy. Like come on, did you not see how that turned out for CA guys?"
482,"Everything about this game is amazing. 

The characters, the story, the loot progression, locations, weapons, everything here is perfect. All of the characters are really charming and fleshed out, I was worried that claptrap would end up being a ""jar-jar"" but he ended up being a really funny character. You can constantly find out new information about the characters. 

I didn't play BL1 first so I was actually really surprised by the Angel plot twist. Handsome Jack's development as a character was very cool to watch be played out. One of my favorite boss fights ever is Control Core Angel. Staying spoiler free, everything that happens in this bossfight is just perfection. 

The loot is done perfectly in this game. You're constantly getting new guns, or you can farm bosses you've killed for their assigned legendary (which is a pretty ingenious system). All of the locations are absolutely amazing.  The gun-play here is near-perfect. All of the legendary and ""unique"" weapons are, well, very unique. Each having their own play-style that can easily fit a build you are doing.

The only nitpick, I can think of, is that there are slight performance issues and bugs. Overall, this game is perfect, and has near infinite replay value (which I heavily value in games), can't recommend it enough."

499,game is fun. story has shitty memes. but gameplay is really the only reason to play it if we're being real
500,"This game has to be one of the best games ever made. The first Borderlands is good, but this is just on another world.
It has action, humor, fantastic writing, a story that keeps you hooked until the end.

First time I played this was with a friend back in 2014. It has aged like fine wine.
As I played it again in 2022 I can't say thre's anything bad with the game at all, except some bugs with the terrain.

10/10 - Played this 3 times now and will do it again."

502,"Lots of fun but I couldn't download the Final DLC bcz it came out 7 years later and was unavailable in my reigon. Otherwise, I've put more than 250 hrs into this game on Steam and other platforms combined, it's that good. Lot's of things to do."
503,"started playing co-op campaign about five years ago with a boyfriend, bought again recently to play again.

Boyfriend: 0/10
Game: 10/10"
504,Best game ever
505,It's a great game but it's DX9 and it doesn't really support modern resolutions. There is a way to make it play on a 4K screen using NVidia control panel scaling. It's okay but just know that you're not going to get good graphics.
506,really good would play again but my peins broke so i cant anymore

518,"This was only recommended after 5 hours of play time, but after completing the campaign and Tiny Tina Expansion on Xbox, this will always be one of my favorite fps campaigns to play with friends or alone."
519,"It is the core of this franchise. Borderlands one might have started this, but the second one is the heart of it. In my opinion, it has the best player character selection, a very strong story, and AMAZING DLC. if you have ever looked at this franchise and wonder, how the F*CK did they come up with this stuff? Their ideas started here. This is the seedlings of all the great ideas. if you like looter shooters, and don't mind crude humor from time to time, I highly recommend. I clearly have given a lot of time to this game alone (almost a whole year) and I don't regret a single second."
520,Yes
521,Best game on steam
522,"Upsides: fantastic main story with a brilliantly written villain featuring a varied cast of highly memorable characters. Tons of replay value

Downsides: the New Game + features can be pretty clunky and the music is a bit bland"

557,"I may not have many hours here on PC, but I played the ever living shit out of this game when it came out on the PS3. I dumped at least 200 hours into that game and have such fond memories of it. The amount of content and replayability is insane, the gameplay is fun, and the story is great. Thanks to PC modding, this game has still been able to stay alive for over 10 years now. I even transferred my PS3 saves so I could continue progressing (I only had the Tina DLC on my PS3). I can't recommend this game enough, so buy it whenever you can. Recently, I got into playing it with friends for the first time (and I was able to introduce them to the game), and I've never had so much fun. This game is my childhood, and it'll always hold a special place in my heart.

TL;DR: buy this game."

562,"Easily one of the Best Games of All Time. It's so easy to start playing and then realize it's been 8 hours by the time you finally look up. A Looter Shooter like no other, with enough content to satisfy every urge for chaos, destruction, and a good story. The Story to Borderlands 2 makes you feel like you are the only thing between Handsome Jack and the world, which is truly an epic feeling. Borderlands may have moved on from this gem, but it will forever be a shining example of a game done right... if you ignore the occasional bug, haha!"

592,"Do not be fooled by my hours on PC. I played primarily on PlayStation platforms (PS3/Vita/PS4). I've beat the game on Normal mode 3 times, and done UVHM on Zer0. I'm working on getting Salvador to UVHM on only Vita. To date, this is the only Borderlands I've played but I loved it all.

This game is so good I'll play the Vita version at 16 FPS. Play it anywhere: on a plane, on a boat, in a car, in space. It's on a ton of different platforms but this one is the best because now the Pearlescents (other than like, the Bekah which was already great) are genuinely great guns all around and there's a ton of other fixes in the Community Patch. It's a whole new way to play the game and I have yet to try it but will here soon. Also runs at high framerates and still looks good.

So yeah. Play it."

594,"Went into it with no clue whether I would enjoy it or not. Played through it and I have come to the conclusion that although I'm a primarily fps tdm player, this game is for me. So give it a go even if you don't think it's your thing as you may be surprised."

599,One of the few games I've bought multiple times just to play on different consoles. It's in my personal top 5 favorite games of All Time.
600,good
601,Probably the best borderlands game in the entire franchise. The great thing about this game too is it tells you stuff about the story to keep you on track with the story without giving too much detail away from the first borderlands game.
602,This game makes my loot driven lizard brain overheat
603,"5/10, Incredibly overrated

Can only play 1-2 hours at a time without getting bored from the long distances between objectives and meaningless mobs"

607,Classic
608,"Very fun to play. I've enjoyed this game since 2014, the gameplay still holds up.
The balancing in UVHM could use a rework since the enemies are still OP despite the potential of having plenty of OP weapons yourself."
609,I love this game and every dlc is worth it
610,good shlooter
611,Good game
612,hehe. Nice.
613,The only game where I can kill people and not feel bad about it...even friends.

616,"bad game big number no good
"
617,yuh
618,One of the best Borderlands games in the franchise by far! Played this on pretty much all platforms and still just as fun on PC with the wonderful addition of mod support:)
619,Why can't all games let me play as Krieg
620,yes
621,"awesome, emotional, fantastic, extraterestrial, struggling."
622,yeah
623,"Everything about this game is amazing, 10/10"
624,"Its the best co-op i have played
"
625,"If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
"
626,"Very fun game with lots of replay value, strikes the perfect balance between engaging story with a satisfying duration while also being short enough so recurring playthroughs don't feel super dragged out. The character selection is fairly balanced though salvador is kind of in a tier of his own the other vault hunters are more or less on the same level and just like the pre-sequel there are 6 total vault hunters you can play as resulting in even more replay value, this game is also the easiest to farm which makes getting powerful loot less of a headache, AND handsome jack is a very fun villain. The only real issues I have with this game would be the gunplay isn't super satisfying and playing through true and ultra vault hunter modes don't really alter your playthrough at all; just changing the difficulty which is fine but i wish you got maybe a new mission or side area or even some extra story bits for playing through the game again on a higher difficulty. Base game is a solid 9/10 but if you count ALL the DLCs that come with the handsome collection and commander lilith then it drops to an 8/10 imo, headhunter packs are kind of whatever, digistruct peak is a gigantic chore and way too repetitive, hammerlock's hunt is just flat out boring, campaign of carnage and the pirate one are pretty good and i love torgue but they have a few annoying parts, commander lilith's areas are way too big and the difficulty spike is kinda nuts and i think the villain is really boring; honestly the best DLC is of course dragonkeep, it's big but doesn't slog on like commander lilith and the main story has enough character variety to keep me interested plus the final boss is fun and pretty easy to farm."
627,"lol they still have those midget people that are like midgets, damn"
628,come join the meat train
629,Its Borderlans 2. Yes yes and yes.
630,"fun
"
631,"It's a great game but is barely playable to due performance and optimization issues.  Primarily with vsync, gsync, microstuttering, etc If you don't mind modding the game and going through hours of trial and error to get a smooth experience - and you succeed?  Then yeah this game is beyond incredible.

It's been a very....very...long time since this game has released.  There has even been sequels...  If a company can't patch their damn game to make it playable out of the box, then they shouldn't be allowed to release anything else.  There should be some law preventing this.  I'm sick of being ripped off and having the modding community fix things while the company profits.... anyway enough complaining...

Once I upgraded my PC, and dedicated my entire weekend to getting this game running smooth - I was actually rewarded like I never have been rewarded before.... It's so....SOOOOO GOOD!

I have almost 100% stable 144 fps at 1440 (2K).  It took me a while to realize the game doesn't implement gsync unless you're in native resolution.  You can't upscale.... at least I couldn't.  If anyone reads this and knows a way around it - please let me know.

Needless to say I bought everything else they made within 2 days of optimizing.

And it's ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT!

....and that's all I have to say about that."
632,"great story, great characters. awesome villain."
633,"Love the RPG Elements of leveling up your character and gaining new skills and builds for the different characters.  Story is great, DLC can be stretched out but is still good.  Don't like how the drop rate is horrendous for rare and legendary guns and equipment.  Will need help from other players when playing endgame content.  One of my favorite games of all time, just wish it had the drop rate of borderlands 3."
634,Yea
635,the endgame content is amazing
636,easily the best borderlands game ever
637,ive been fucking farming a lyuda for the last fucking 3 hours i got 4 nukems and like 10 vuruks fix your fucking game

644,"Great looter shooter, tons of content and fun to play with friends."
645,got boring
646,i like loot. this has loot.
647,"TLDR; Holy Fuck

This game is often referred to as a masterpiece and a phenomenal game and all I can say is throughout my playthrough of it there was no point where I found myself wondering why. This game will have you go from being an undercover pizza delivery man to kill the off brand ninja turtles, to starting up a gang war between some Irish lads and some guys who like to race, to hunting down the off brand donkey kong, to throwing a birthday party for a robot who gets depressed when only you show up, to getting yelled at by a guy to shoot him in the face and when you finally do so getting awarded with him shouting ""THANK YOU"" as his bloody corpse drops to the ground. The absolute best part is that is all just side content and the game definitely has a shit ton of it, but where the game shines is the story. I can easily say this game has the best villain I have ever seen in a video game, the game gives you a basic run down of how you got where you are and shows you how handsome jack betrayed you in the very beginning of the game and leaves you to pick it up right after being betrayed. Throughout the campaign there will be things handsome jack does and says that will leave you wishing you could put a bullet through his skull that very second. Once you beat the main campaign you aren't even close to done, the campaign will leave you right around level 30 if you do a handful of side quests, that being said the max level is 50 if you don't decide to tap into TVHM which is essentially new game plus. If however you do go for TVHM then you will start right back in the beginning of the story but you will keep your character progression such as your guns, level, skills, upgrades, basically everything except for the story progress and every enemy will be scaled up to your level but they will also be more difficult than they were the first time around. When playing in TVHM the max level gets brought up to 61 just so you can be even more powerful. After beating TVHM you will unlock UVHM which is the same type of thing but the max level goes to 72. I know it seems like half my review was talking about the new game + aspect of the game but I want to clarify you aren't required to do that stuff, people just do it to hit max level and get the best gear in the game. Now, I have spoken about side content, I have spoken about the story, I have spoken about TVHM and UVHM. What else could there possibly be? Here my friend is where the fun begins, you end off UVHM and then you get yourself up to level 72, the fight for sanctuary dlc gets you up to level 80, now you are max level. Here is where you jump into all the dlc content which are basically there own stories and some great ones at that, given they aren't as large as the base campaign but they will still bring you across new locations and tell you some pretty awesome stories whether it be one where you are a pirate on the hunt for treasure or it be one where you are basically playing DND in borderlands, they are all very unique and fun to play in their own way. After that there is a thing called OP levels which there are 10 of, its basically to make your character even more of a badass so essentially if you are level 80 OP 10 you are basically level 90. Now you start raiding, just like other games raid consist of very difficult bosses that are meant to be tackled as a team with a game plan or in this case a solo badass like yourself. These bosses will be the ones who have all the guns and gear anyone could ever want, all of the great legendary items, all the upgrades you need, these are they guys you will get them from. Now you may be wondering, ""what if I get all the gear I want, what do I do then?"". Well my friend, this game has multiple characters to play as and none of them play the same ;). WELCOME TO PANDORA, KIDDOS!"
648,good game
649,"Still a really great game after all these years. Timeless game. Liked to play it back when I had a playstation 3 and still do. Lots of variety of play styles with each character (even though some have just 1 meta style that everyone uses, but you can be a rebel and do your own thing too).

Always fun and some laughs sometimes. Best to buy the whole package, with every dlc and all for much more fun"

654,ok

656,It's the best Borderlands game in the series honestly. The others are good but don't compare to Borderlands 2. It has everything from fun gunplay to tons of replayability. Very good time killer game.

Better with friends, still a good-to-great game alone. It holds up well despite its ""age"", gameplay-wise, which is always a welcome pro.

I'd grab it to play w/ others if i were you. And although you could say there are far better games for online co-oping nowadays, BL2 is one of those timeless choices that it's kind of hard to really go wrong with.

STEAM 

Ladies and Gentleman, Steam! This game, right here, right now, is the one.

I recommend this game to any PC Gaming Fan.

Rest assured this beast of a game runs on Low End to Very High End Builds flawlessly (well usually)

The only real issues are with crashes with the Ultra HD Texture Pack but that can be easily resolved by...

Guess What?

Removing it.

and if you like the visuals (me) that the texture pack gives you then keep it on. Its a win, win really.

In a nutshell, if you want a game to play and you got the money this one is the one people!"

771,"nice

772,"Hands down one of the best games of all time.

TLDR:
This game is a must have for people who want to experience a compelling narrative with good gameplay.

It surely defined the FPS genre and paved its influence for other FPS games to come in the future. The cell shaded artstyle really immerses gamers in the vast world of Pandora. This leads to many players having a lot of room for exploration and to enjoy the well made level design and world building this game has to offer.

The quests are very flawlessly made with good writing. Side quests also have a sense of correlation with the main quests itself and develops its characters and story with it

The characters in Borderlands are well written and contain exceptional voice acting backing up the dialogue. Combine that with the entertaining humor the characters have to offer and you have yourself a video game classic. Similar to how the questing works, each character, whether minor or major, appears to show relevance within the main story itself and are not present just for the sake of being present.

Gameplay is simplistic yet enjoyable with the 4 main classes to choose from, each having different quirks and abilities to obliterate your foes standing before you. With that, you can count on this game for its massive replayability given its diverse set of skill trees per class accompanying the massive amount of lootable weapons and items from the game (again each with their own different quirks and gunplay) makes this game enjoyable for its replayability and first hand gameplay.

As I said before, the cell shaded art style are pleasing to the eyes and still holds up for today's standards for graphics. Though the characters don't seem emotive all the time along with their static mouth movement without facial animations whatsoever can be a little odd, but again the voice acting compensates for that.

The antagonist, Handsome Jack, is probably one of the best villains in video game history. His constant trashtalking to the player throughout the main course of the game is entertaining.

779,"Borderlands 2 in 2022 is a strange, albeit positive experience if you play with friends.

The game's humor really hasn't aged well.  It's quippy and sarcastic, and it really does feel like some of those old impact font memes have been brought to life.  The lol so random philosophy works best when applied to the way the game generates weapons, less so when used as the punchline of a joke.  As a kid, I truly got a kick out of these things, a first person shooter being self aware of genre-tropes, and not taking itself too seriously.  I loved the Bane, Face McShooty et al.  I still do.  I just find the humor wears thinner and thinner as I get older.  This could be entirely a personal preference, and it's very possible the jokes may land for you, and if they do, that's awesome.  My issue is that when the reward for the quests progress individual storylines in callous and sarcastic ways, as jokes, I have a hard time connecting with the  world of Pandora.  Quests typically do not have multiple outcomes, and so the roleplay elements are limited to how you will build your characters combat skillset and weapons arsenal.  It is a lot like a dungeon crawler in that way.  Playing it alone, in a vacuum of sarcasm and snark, feels hollow.  

So, having come to terms with the fact that the story hasn't retained all the magic it did all those years ago, screwing around with a four-man squad absolutely does.  The world itself is full of varied environments that are fun to explore.  There are hidden nooks and crannies and references everywhere.  It's still beautiful to look at, the cell-shaded graphics still pop.  Quests can be a little same-y after a while, typically boiling down to ""go here, interact with an item, kill waves of enemies"", but when I have my buddies by my side, swearing at me for being downed too quickly into the mission, calling me a smooth brain and talking about how they're all romancing my mother, the games humor begins to make more sense.  The game's chaos feeds an attitude in group play that somehow always brings us back to our youths.  Foul-mouthed idiots with impossible guns fighting impossible odds, the game works so much better as a backdrop to the chaos you bring into it, and not as a driving narrative.  It's humor, wince inducing as it is when playing alone, facilitated our immaturity quite excellently, and that is a tremendous strength.

From a gameplay perspective, shooting is good, not great by today's standards, but very serviceable.  The guns are unique and varied and you will eventually find a build/gun combo that chews through enemies like nothing.  And then another one.  And then another one.  The replayability of this game is through the roof.  

Overall, this game is awesome, but you should definitely play with friends."

816,"[h1] Review[/h1] 
Buying the handsome collection rewards you with all DLC except battle for sanctuary for this game. Included is also the pre sequel (which barely anyone plays) and its DLC (strangely as it’s not really made clear that you get it too!). Sadly, there isn’t a complete pack of the franchise which includes all DLC yet! Played the game back when it released, revisited it just now.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
Personally, I feel the game did everything a sequel should do. It improves on almost every aspect of the previous game. Not only is there a broader variety of weapons, but also the classes improve which is the main aspect why I like this one a lot. Classes in the first game had their abilities, some focus more on them, but its mostly about the passive damage output you can create. Especially elemental damage.

Now elemental damage is still important, but due to the new slag element which increases all non elemental damage after applying it, makes every normal weapon also worthwhile. Especially on grenades its useful, as you don’t need to swap between weapons. Except when playing the gunzerker who can dual wield two weapons. Although In this game acid is more important than ever and electro element is even more useless as there are barely any shield based enemies, mostly enemies wielding armor, which is nice that they added a yellow health bar to those enemies to differentiate better.

Driving physics are also improved and the weapons on those are actual useful now. Also driving back and forth between places is reduced, as driving, getting out of the vehicle and walking back to your car took the most time. You can teleport to a lot of places you visited.

Classes itself also not only offer better, more fun abilities making the class building way much more fun, but also they offer different playstyles with having different skill trees you can freely distribute points in to make a build you seem the best right now. Or most fun.

Quests are also now more varied, offering not only kill quests by adding unique encounter that have somewhat weird storylines and a funny outcome. Luckily gone are the very long fetch quests, like collecting weapon parts and added are side missions which offer better rewards, like when shooting a boss, you may kill them in a specific way.

Not everything improved as they sadly removed the revolver weapon type, although they are now considered pistols, there aren’t that many revolvers anymore, which often focused on low magazines and high damage output. Also, they added a really dumb shift key system, where you had to check the developers twitter page to punch in a code to receive keys which opens a box that includes rare, strong weapons. Without them, I sometimes felt doing not enough damage unless I resort to grind. 

Balancing wise in most cases I didn’t feel that overpowered or underpowered even when not grinding a lot or doing every single side quest, this although changes when you consider DLC

[u]Story[/u]
Now the game has an actual interesting storyline, with a very memorable villain. Old player characters are now main storyline character that offer quests and are intertwined with the story. It doesn’t offer a really good one, but at least one that keeps you going a lot.

Although the games “ humour” might be not everyone’s cup of tea, as I always thought its mostly cringe, than funny. But that’s okay, I like some cringe at times. 

[u]Sound[/u]
Although the OST scrapped its more interesting tracks, the one has more electric focused music themes. Personally, I like this kind of stuff more, the combat tracks especially are to my personal taste better although a bit less memorable. It says a lot that the one track I remember the most is an electronic remix of a song from the first game,

Voice acting is again back, with many different languages includes. People also talk more but there is always still the risk to proceed to far or do something that cuts off dialogue.

[u]Graphics[/u]
The biggest change isn’t the graphical aspects itself, like textures and the general quality of it, although those aspects improved a lot. I always disliked how undersaturated the first game looked. A lot of things looked washed out and more grey than it should, although you could argue this art style fits the game more. I like the brighter colour palette.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
This game gives you a lot bang for the buck. A long main storyline with a lot of replay value to the very different playstyle in the various characters the game offered. As a sequel it improved basically all aspects from the first game, especially the gunplay is much more satisfying. Highly recommend if even if you don’t want to play it in coop.

838,"A humorous, engaging look into a sci-fi universe riddled by chaos, war, and fun. With a plethora of missions, easter eggs, DLC, and characters (not to mention one of the best villains I've ever seen), Borderlands 2 might be one of the best games in the Borderlands series to date. This game was my first introduction to FPS games, and I've fallen in love immediately. Every time I play this game, I find something new, and I'm finally starting to feel like I understand how strategy games work. While having some outdated jokes or titles here and there, it's worth playing. If you enjoy games that are fun to play both solo and co-op, this is for you."
839,This game is fire
840,"gud game
"
841,"The borderlands series as a whole shows what a good singleplayer rpg looks like, and borderlands 2 sets the example for all the others in the franchise. The gameplay and pacing of the story within this game is the best within the franchise, and one of the main reasons why the newer games are lacking is because they really outdid themselves with this one. All of the DLC's add amazing amounts of content to the already content abundant game. If you so choose to take on the harder difficulties past TVHM, be prepared for a struggle. Yes, this game makes you work for your loot, but damn is it worth it. Farming bosses just to get the single drop that you want is honestly fun and its so satisfying to finally get the legendary, pearlescent, or effervescent that you want. The only negative things I have to say is that some of the Torgue side quests are so painstakingly tedious that you will find yourself scanning youtube and old forum posts for tips and tricks, but I reccommend this anyways as they really help with bosses and what not. Speaking of that is the only thing I wish this game still had, a thriving community. It is not surprising to see all of the youtube videos for this game to be 4-7 years old, I really wish that they would come out with a remaster of this game or something to fix some of the old issues and bring the community back. Borderlands 2 is the best game in the franchise and if you are debating to buy this game do it and don't look back. You won't regret it. And definitely pick up the game of the year edition if you do to get the real good DLC's."
842,"This is the game I've bought the most times... for some reason. There's just never any hesitation when someone new discovers this game. Its easy to pick up, hard to put down. Not only one of the best FPS games out there, but one of my favourite games of all time."

850,"I've played this game for nearly 1500hrs, and it is for all intents and purposes one of the best games I've ever played. Except I can't give it a positive review anymore, because it's no longer a ""Game"" to Gearbox/2k, but a tool  to harass people with unwanted advertisements. Not to mention these useless and greedy updates more often than not actually break the game on most systems. Something fishy about that don't you think? Game was pretty much near rock solid during its time in the spot light and even for the 7 YEARS I waited anxiously for the next installment. But now they've got ads that they shove in your face before you even get to see the main menu, then once you start playing it'll most likely CTD within an hour or so

And just in case inshallah someone from 2K or Gearbox reads this, doing shit like this is not how you maintain and grow customer relations. And until you stop harassing people who aren't buying your arguably inferior new products, they won't even give them the chance they might actually deserve."

889,"When someone ask which game can pass the test of time, I believe Borderlands 2 can. A great shooter game with interesting weird stories, amazing characters and outstanding voice acting especially Claptrap and Handsome Jack. They are my best two characters in the game.

Rating: 100% (+100%)"
890,Many guns that shoot
891,yes

899,"One of the greatest games in my opinion. So much to do, so many guns to get, so many stairs that  YOU can climb. 10/10 game"
900,IS GOOD
901,"I pre-ordered this game ten years ago, and am still having fun in it. They decided to push an update, Lilith's DLC, and the Ultra HD texture pack only for the Windows version, and push some one- off update for OS X, so each of the three OS versions (Windows, OS X, Linux) can only play with themselves last I checked. Windows can only play with Windows, Linux with Linux, etc. Didn't feel like paying Aspyr to update the ports I guess. So if you're in Linux you'll have to run the game in Proton (preferably Proton-GE) to play with Windows friends. Here's my launch options to get PhysX hardware acceleration working and some other stuff:

PROTON_HIDE_NV_GPU=0 PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 DXVK_ASYNC=1 DXVK_HUD=fps,gpuload,compiler %command% -nomoviestartup

The writing is fantastic, all the non-cosmetic DLC is good, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is AMAZING. The gameplay loop is really great, finding new guns and messing around with your character's skill tree. I mostly play MMOs so am used to min-maxing everything I play, but in Borderlands 2 I have much more fun looking for guns that do random shit like fire homing bullets, turn into a turret when you reload, shoot exploding swords, etc.

Buy the game of the year edition on sale and once you're comfortable with the game, look into modding. There are a buttload of fun mods available, all usable in co-op. Also this was the last Borderlands game with funny jokes don't @ me."

Helena Pierce: ""We've hijacked the train that runs through The Dust. If all goes well, we should get to Sanctuary in a day's time. Hyperion hasn't diverted any troops from New Haven to pursue us, and a sandstorm has devoured their nearest frontier town. We just need - oh, damnit - everyone! Get away from the windows!""

Sir Hammerlock: You've discovered one of Helena Pierce's audio logs! She was a lieutenant in the Crimson Raiders -- the anti-Hyperion resistance. I'd be very interested to know what became of her. If you could find the rest of those audio logs, I would be more than happy to pay for them.

Handsome Jack: ""Hey, everybody! How are ya? Jack here!""

Wilhelm: ""NOBODY MOVE.""

Helena Pierce: ""What is the meaning of this?""

Handsome Jack: ""I'm sorry, what was your name?""

Helena Pierce: ""Pierce.""

Handsome Jack: ""Well, Ms. Pierce - and please don't tell me it's 'Mrs. Pierce' and break my heart - this train doesn't belong to you. So why don't you turn around and face me, pumpkin?""

Helena Pierce: ""This train was commandeered legally under the -""

Handsome Jack: ""Holy nutballs! What happened to your frickin' face?!""

Handsome Jack: ""Oh yeah? How about this - lady? - I don't even know what to call you: you tell me why you look like you headbutted a belt sander, and I'll let all of you go right now.""

Helena Pierce: ""My husband gave me a skag pearl ring. The pearl released hunger-inducing pheromones.""

Handsome Jack: ""Oh. You know what? I am so sorry. I - I just... Forgive me. Where's your husband now?""

Helena Pierce: ""He's dead.""

Handsome Jack: ""That is a heartbreaker, but...[gunshot, followed by death scream] you got something in common with him now at least!""

Handsome Jack: ""Hohohoho... holy crap! Did you see her head? It was like - PBBLLT! Wilhelm? Kill these savages.""

Wilhelm: ""UNDERSTOOD."" [gunshots, followed by screams]

961,"I'll be honest, the game is ok but overall it gets boring after a while of just walking around shooting stuff. I like that theres so many gun options and weapon choices but the game overall feels boring after a while. Ironic since I have almost 2k hours on Destiny 2."
962,good looter shooter game if you want to have fun
963,"I played before B3 - this one is just archaic and vintage, old systems, don't keep with times, game is just old - period.  If you want to join to borderlands world - just start with part 3"

965,"maxed out a character to lv 72 within a week of playing, still can't go for op levels because of the absence of lilith dlc in the big collection bundle. i'm not paying that much for a small addition to levels (which is more than the price of the actual game bundle fyi)"

976,Very fun game to play w/ friends!
977,Note to self: Buy DLC's when there is a sale.
978,Cult classic everyone should at least try this game.
979,"A great game that I've played many times over. Favourite villain of the series by a longshot, and DLC's which provide some nice variety (Particularly Tiny Tina's assault on Dragon Keep)

A standout for casual play, to use some abilities and shoot through missions. Thankfully this is the better best sense of humour in the series before it fell off a cliff with Borderlands 3."
980,"OVERRATED AF - GARBAGE - FETCH QUEST MMO GARBAGE - FEELS LIKE A CHEAP MMO.  basically this game is an mmo, replete with fetch quests, respawn points, mobs which agro on you which are fairly tough and deadly - and dont forget the grinding!  its not good enough to hook ppl into spending on it every month so it got released as a normal title, so u cant unsubscribe!  looks good but major idiotic flaws take what had potential to be very good into the AVOID category - its just frustrating, coz they nearly had it right.  problems: mouse look vehicle controls ffs!  backtracking constantly through already completed areas where the enemies respawn and repopulate!  invisible edges everywhere, no quick save OR MANUAL save!  no health that u can use as needed.  enemies are marksmen while running and jumping everywhere, does not respect players time, often when your game is saved and you quit it puts u back to previously cleared areas miles from where u were and repopulates the entire area you already cleared with all the enemies, including mini bosses.  gimped controls where some keys dont work when you press and it feels like youre stuck on an edge but arent.  dont know how this game is considered so highly as far as ive seen.  waste of time.  can be fun but be warned."
981,"Dear Gearbox, we're fully aware your new game exists, we just chose to not to play it because it's inferior to your old ones, therefore putting ads in your older games about it won't do anything just annoy players. If you do this when the game was announced / about to be released, fine. But months after release this is nothing more but a scummy marketing attempt to make more people buy your new game. Not to talk about that you putting ads in your games introduced new bugs, and even made the game unplayable to many people in the past 2 weeks."
982,"Nah. Love this game but Gearbox shit its pants with the Shift bull**** they implemented. Can't play with my friends anymore, oh well. Thanks Gearbox."
983,This game made me happy
984,I enjoy this game.
985,Love the game but if your quest farming don't forget to save before the farm!
986,every game they made after this has been awful
987,just a fun game overall!!!
988,The game itself is fine but the ingame ads pushed with the help of mini updates are not. Those ads ingame for old games are a disgusting practice and any company doing that is not worth buying products from
989,great
990,"Man, I don't think I've ever played any game as much as Borderlands 2.
It was such a technological jump, skills got better, Siren kicked ass, the quests were outstanding and everything was just put into place. Absolutely loved it and still it holds a dear place in my heart.

- Fast pace
- Cool combat
- Funny and scary bosses
- Cool story
- Loving the classes
- Loving the weapons even more
- Absolute and utter chaos everywhere

What's not to love."
991,"I love this game.

I do not love the scammy piece of crap that is Wondelands.

Therefore I do not want my game to be broken for a week just so I can be spammed by intrusive ads for something I'm not interested in.

1018,Kaia
1019,Nice
1020,very good very nice
1021,borderlands 3 was not the same. Never finished one play through there but I did multiple here. And getting legendary guns is more exciting here because it's actually rare (I don't farm btw). Worth having this game even now. Having some friends to play with will be even better and much faster!!
1022,"Probably my most played game across all platforms (1.7k hrs in total, I believe). It's nearly 10 years old now and is starting to age, some of its parts are inferior to other games in the series: writing is worse than in The Pre-Sequel, while overall gameplay, gunplay and build diversity is far, FAR better in BL3. Still though, despite its age, it's the most consistent game of the franchise, providing lots of content and some good laughs. I highly recommend though to try it out with BL2Fix or UCP mods, since vanilla with all its flaws and balance changes has aged quite a bit. Still a good game after all. Here's hope that Gearbox will put their shit together and will never ever release something as half-baked as Digistruct Peak. Borderlands 3 is a prime example of what they can get right (the gameplay, the free content, balance changes), while Wonderlands DLCs are an example of the contrary.

If you've never played it - give it a try, it's a good overall introduction to the series. Just don't forget UCP mod or something similar"
1023,borderlands two is the best borderlands game. it has amazing characters and the graphics look amazing for a game that like 5 years old. I love the open world and also being able to play with your friends is a big plus
1024,(wasd) only ghamers could understand this
1025,"fun game

1026,i think it is cool there is a vary fat lady i feel if she fell she couldn't get back up they also have guns

works good on linux pop os."
1039,very fun
1040,"The game is excellent! The franchise experience seems to be very well preserved in this edition and it was also my gateway to the Borderlands universe. I especially emphasize the construction of the characters (with mega complex personalities), the soundtrack and the art direction of the production. Without a doubt, I couldn't compare the experience I had with my gameplay to any other game; everything is especially unique. I suggest you play in sessions with friends, so that the campaign really lives up to the fun that the game is committed to offering.

As for the amount charged, I suggest waiting for some promotion, but I also don't think the original cost is high, as it is a great investment."
1041,DDD
1042,very addictive and fun to play with friends
1043,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1044,Guns = Fun
1045,"yes
"
1046,"Wow is this long. At least it isn't as insufferably long as Borderlands 3.
The gunplay is tolerable--better than its predecessor. The UI is slightly improved as well. The story isn't very good, as usual for this series. It is crude and distasteful in places. Still a lot of walking/driving over the same areas over and over, and killing the same groups of bad guys over and over; a borderline walking simulator.

Don't waste much money on this, but if you get it free or very very cheap, at least you'll be betting a fair amount of content."
1047,"litterly zer0(you know if you know) complaints I have with this game, the thing I recomend is to get the free HD texture pack before you start your first game.  Also, dont forget your missing out if you dont buy the handsome collection."

There's a multitude of weapons and a much-appreciated skilltree. The story and humor are also good and the inclusion of characters from the previous game is well-executed. The gameplay itself makes even replaying encounters multiple times very fun."

The story, characters and gameplay are all taken up to 11 with better variety of guns, missions and vehicles. The dlcs make for an even greater experience with more missions, character leveling and greater challenges. Highly recommend!!"

1083,Still the best BL
1084,"This game is the best of franchise (out of 1, 2, 3, or pre-sequel). It has the best story, best wit and re-playability. Lots of fun with mates, and the expansions are also well worth it, especially now you buy it all cheap. Mega amount of loot: including guns, shields, grenades. Adapt them to your character, and develop your character with the traits you like best."
1085,A fun looter shooter. Lots of options when its comes to gear as well as play styles. Holds up quite well today and is very repayable.
1086,fun game

1088,yes :thumbup:
1089,Literally one of the best games of all time
1090,When the first Borderlands came out I was amazed at the way it was.  Now this second outing enhances the first and builds on it.  Still vastly replayable.
1091,get better guns and the health bars go down faster 👍
1092,gud game
1093,"Good game, probably best of the series or second best to the most recent. Haven't played it yet so I can't say for sure"
1094,"Okay I love this game, here are some quick thoughts and opinions. 

TLDR it's near perfect on its own, in my eyes minor tweaks can make it the best. 9/10

Pros: 
+ super replayable
+ farming for items is fun but not obnoxious
+ DLC's are all great in their own way
+ timeless graphics
+ game can be played on many devices, it is after all a 10 year old game now
+ handsome jack
+ no ava

Cons: 
- gunplay does lack a tad bit compared to bl3, but otherwise it's fine
- can be tedious late game
- OP level grinding sucks
- the reliance on slag kinda ruins fun aspects late game IMO
- many items are nigh unusable in uvhm and beyond, some were never good (most seraphs)

All in all my main gripes are with the unbalanced mess that is the endgame, but many of my complaints can be fixed via light mods, like the UCP, BL2Fix, various gear overhauls to make them more viable (variety is fun!), etc.

I see myself putting hundreds more hours into this game in years to come."
1095,good shi
1096,"Everyone knows this game. Still fun, 35 years later"
1097,"very fun game to replay
"
1098,"I highly recommend this game. It is a good game by yourself. But with a friend it is a fantastic game. Most of the DLC's are alright, but the base game is where the best content is. I would recommend trying the DLC's if you finish the game (If you finished it you probably liked it). This is also an easy game.

And it works on M1 MAC"
1099,Wacky gun go brrrrrrrrrrr
1100,Classic
1101,Purdy gud
1102,GOOD AS ALWAYS
1103,"I'm surprised I never gave a review for one of my favorite games of all time. That's a disservice.

This game for me is just a perfect memento of the era it was released in, and I love it for that. To me, a core game that I think everyone should at least touch once, not necessarily beat it. Everything about it was so well done (for it's time) and I love all the aspects within. I'm currently starting up a run that I plan to 100% with a friend modded, I'm excited for that!"
1104,Borderlands 2 is an all time great game. Be prepared to immerse yourself in endless hours of shooting game heaven.
1105,classic game Been playing since 2012. the jokes do get old after awhile tho
1106,"Totally not advised. 38 hours of my journey was three times trying to get into this game. Mob density makes solo gameplay cheesing, cheesing and some more cheesing, you cant even get some classes to work in solo without getting mental struggles, if you are a solo player, please consider twice before buying. Oh and also excessive dialogs that plays when you are fighting some dumbfuck mob type called stalkers? Yeah they are icing on the cake, you are having a mental breakdown over fighting 5 mob group and Claptrap is screaming on background is just made me break my F4 key along with Alt. 

Looking back now, I bought it for 25 TRY, which is equal to 1.5 dollars novadays, but it was around 4 dollars when I bought it. Even at 4 dollars, i regret it, at every cent of it. And even considering I worked for 12 dollars/hour at US when I bought it, I regret it more.

Also, looting parts of it is really good. Loot drops are satisfying, boss kills are satisfying, but considering my gameplay, in 38 hours i only had 4-5 hours of fun/satisfying moments, rest is just forcing myself by ""it gets better endgame"", but fucks sake i will not try again for the fourth time.

To vote this, fight for your life, out of ten."
1107,goat
1108,"The short of it: great game! The Handsome Collection is the way to go if you are interested in Borderlands 2, it is the cheapest option, contains all DLC (except Fight for Sanctuary), and Borderlands:TPS.

After picking up Borderlands 3 as a free Epic Games drop, I ended up buying the season pass bundle and sunk several days worth of playtime into it. This prompted me to relive my enjoyment of the earlier Borderlands games from the PS3 days.

Borderlands as a series presents RPG elements that aren't quite as heavily involved as games like Fallout, but flexible and robust enough to give you the desire to try out different builds, different gun types and setups, and similar.  Borderlands 2 specifically builds upon the strengths of Borderlands 1, while missing out on some quality of life that players have become familiar with as of Borderlands 3, though not bad enough in my mind to turn off any fan that was introduced via Borderlands 3. Some of my enjoyment likely came from a nostalgia factor, recalling my days on the family couch on PS3, and the use of a controller even on PC suddenly felt well controlled and familiar (I don't play anything else with controller on PC).

The good: story elements are fun and enjoyable with humorous characters and dialogue, gunplay feels fun and rewarding in the sense that blasting enemy health bars to zero via head shots prompts you to keep moving and killing enemies. The length of the game is quite good, even if one were to stop at a single playthrough on normal difficulty, you get your money's worth in time spent, especially if you like the ""extras"" like abundant side quests. Loot options are very high in number, with different gun types, rarities, and lots of legendaries to farm/chase. Three skill trees per vault hunter offer lots of mix and match build options to test and enjoy.

The not so good: as Borderlands 3 has now been out a few years, we have to recognize the areas that were improved in BL3, but now feel lacking in BL2. Gunplay and quality of life are the two main areas. BL2 has no ""one click to refill ammo"" at ammo vendors, no automatic pick up from opened chests/boxes, though these things can be sorted by use of mods. The campaign mechanic in the game is good for some, while a burden to others. Personally I prefer the single playthrough long campaign of BL3. In BL2, the campaign is situated into 3 playthroughs at rising difficulties (Normal, True Vault Hunter, and Ultra Vault Hunter mode). Overpower levels extend the difficulty yet further beyond UVHM. All this said, there is truly a TON of playtime to take in with this game.

The other games in the series are equally excellent. Given the price of the Handsome Collection, this game is 100% worth a try if you like any form of shooter RPG, looter shooter, etc.

Also adding some notes on what the collection includes as I struggled to find this detail in my initial research, having not played the game since PS3 days.
The Handsome Collection - includes BL2 and all DLC except for Fight for Sanctuary. It includes Borderlands: The Pre Sequel and all DLC. BL2 Game of the Year on the other hand includes LESS DLC than the Handsome Collection.

Without Fight for Sanctuary, the max level is 72 and UVHM Difficulty with OP 8. With addition of FFS, max level is up to 80 with UVHM OP 10 levels.

My enjoyment and time spent here prompted me to pick up the original Borderlands again, this time the GOTY edition on PS4."
1109,"For a game where every guns here are procedurally generated, I'm surprised that Gearbox hasn't implemented NFT in their game yet"
1110,"There is little class build flexibility. Going into New Game+ runs, viable build options became increasingly restricted. Most encounters boiled down to the same thing. The grinding which became important late game didn't do any favors for a formula which was already strained to keep things interesting. As for the humor, I enjoyed the second and third playthroughs of the game much more with the dialogue muted.

Still, I'm giving a recommendation because you can't be too picky if your requirement is a co-op game for 3+ players. The multiplayer worked most of the time."

1146,All in all I probably have a year of my life in this game. Its one of the most content filled games you can get for $10 and I cant recommend it enough.
1147,"Good game. Lots of stuff to do, cool characters to do it with, and a great story to go with it."
1148,"Story totally uncompelling, humor lame in spite of the obvious ton of effort they put into it. I guess it's kind of good if you like shooting at things. That might be my problem. Shooting at things just isn't super interesting for me."
1149,"This may not be the OG Looter-Shooter, but it is the gold standard.

The game is one of a kind, beyond the dragon's hoard level of loot you can find and farm.  It presents you with a host of amazing (and flawed) characters you grow to care about and whose fight you can really get behind.  Handsome Jack truly is a villain you can love to hate, hate to love or fully support as the story progresses, and the motivation for his actions makes you stop and question what is going on in the game's universe that THIS was the only solution.

Yes, there are times the games makes it VERY clear you need to get friends because this was never meant to be a single player game.  Enemies and bosses love to materialize out of no where and kick you butt to next Tuesday and ""helper"" characters don't seem to understand that when your ability to resurrect is based on getting the killing shot them killing all the enemies in the area is a bad idea, but with the right guns and perks, you can prove the game wrong and push ahead.  There are challenges on top of challenges that will keep you coming back after the credits roll, the DLC adds to the game's universe and the character's stories and, more importantly, the game's loot!

My only complaint is with the last DLC released for the game, which tied it to Borderlands 3.  First, the way they slammed characters from the various Borderlands ""expanded universe"" together felt awkward and the story they provided deserved SO MUCH MORE than the 3.5 hours devoted to is.  It should have been its own game."

1167,"A must-play for any fans of the FPS genre. The mechanics encourage diversity of play and cooperation, but the game allows the player the freedom to choose what they want to do. Just about anything you want to do, Borderlands 2 says ""Yes."" A fantastic game, and one of my all-time co-op favorites."
1168,"At the time of this post, I have 462 hours played. Less than 20 minutes of my time has been spent with another player. Everyone talks about how great co-op is, but I adore this game as a single-player main. This is definitely worth a grab, especially if you catch it on sale. The Handsome Jack Bundle is pretty sweet.

My only negative would be that the Commander Lillith DLC is not worth $15."

1170,Its good i think

1173,"Borderlands 2 is both a massive step forward for the borderlands games and yet a colossal step backwards. Gameplay wise the game has had massive improvements, the addition of status effect weapons add some element of tactics to the battles outside of just throwing on your strongest gear and turning everything in front of you into paste. Story wise the games story pitting you against the insanely charismatic handsome jack kept me engaged straight through to the end. However i have to level a heavy amount of criticism towards the unreasonably frequent and rampant jokes thrown in anywhere they could stick. The original borderlands had a sense of whimsy with their references and jokes but showed an even hand in balancing its story with its laughs and made its world seem ridiculous but sensible in a way. Borderlands 2 goes full on clown shoes and the tidal wave of humor it beats you over the head with really steals any sense of realism from the world and makes multiple replays better done with the game muted. Really hope some restraint is shown in future games."

1176,"This was a wonderful waste of my time. You might be asking. ""Yothan, What could you possibly mean a wonderful waste of your time?"" Its simple, I played these games out of order and did the second before the first. Honestly, I felt like they took the first and created the second off of their improvements that could have been made. Such as a bigger story, more dialog, and better weapon handling in terms of scoped shooting. All together I would deeply recommend such an outstanding game to anyone who desires both story and action."

1196,"Borderlands 2 is the best Borderlands title period.

With the constant stream of new weapons, shields and class builds, a player can find themselves returning to this title over and over with it's nearly endless replay-ability. In Borderlands 2, there is a play-style for every type of person. Not only is this game packed with content, but it regularly goes on sale for a huge discount.

Buy this game with the Game-Of-The-Year bundle. It's worth it.
I also recommend playing this game with a friend of two."
1197,more like bored lands 2
1198,"4/5. I have many, many more hours on this game on PS4. It's almost like the Mortal Kombat of the 21st century, there isn't a lot of logic or reason to how (or why) this game is so good, it just sort of works. Not to imply it's not a good game, because it is. The story is much better than what you'd expect from this kind of game, and the gameplay speaks for itself."

1211,One of the greatest games of all time this game was the pinacle of co-op shooters.
1212,If loot thrills you this is the game for you.  The combat can get a bit repetitive sometimes but there is enough challenge at any level that it never gets Skyrim high level kinds of easy.  The characters are humorous and the atmosphere changes a fair amount but honestly borderlands greatest drawback is the repetitive run and gun play style.    I still really enjoy these games but it isn't something i can play for long periods as a few frustrating deaths and the idea of going through the meat-grinder i just ran through again is off putting.  That being said i take a break and come back to it a day or two later and it's flashy and fun again.
1213,Great gameplay
1214,Improves on the original. Get The Handsome Collection.
1215,nice game textures are a bit old but it is way more enjoyabel than a lot of other games out there

1218,"Borderlands 2 is a super replayable, extremely fun game. The art style isn't for everyone, but there is so much good content in the game. Lots of fun references, lots of fun mechanics, and overall a solid 9.5/10. Borderlands 3 improves on this game somewhat, but I still find myself loading this game instead."
1219,"BL2 is the best game out of the trilogy, and while vanilla is great, I would definitely recommend modding it. Big fan of the BL2Fix mod, as it adds a lot of QoL improvements, like cutscene skips, read-only farming at the press of a button, and increased XP gain during UVHM to reduce the grind.

As good as this game is, though, don't pick it up unless you can get it on sale, and don't get FfS unless you can hit a sale too."

1254,great game
1255,"The original game is super fun. Once you beat the game, and you can do a rerun, it sucks. Everything is so OP that you are doing 4-5 CRIT headshots (8k pts each) with a 2200 sniper rifle to get a kill. Any weapon you used in the first run-through is completely worthless as it seems every enemy has at least 100k hit points and your staple assault rifle with 800 damage needs about 25-30 hits to kill even the most lowly enemy. My suggestion is to never do the final mission and kill Handsome Jack. Then it should be an enjoyable experience. I only played the DLC after beating the main game, so I hope it makes it more like the main game before the massive over-power. It is sad that I did 145+hrs and now the game is 100% unbearable and unplayable."

1274,"15 Dollar DLC for a 10 year old game... you tell me.

Otherwise, Fantastic. Tina DLC was fun, All DLC's are virtually short with few side quests, something of 30 total missions per.. I mean its an overall great ride and a throwback from the old console days in 2012. If only my 4 Horsemen team was still together from that time period.

If you haven't played Borderlands before (Shock me if you are of that small percent) just please do not start with this one. 3 was okay but the most repetitive of them all, and but BL1 sets the story and BL2 is the real tale. You've got to show love to them all but I personally mark this one as my favorite.

Thanks for looking, and I hope this helps you understand that it's totally worth buying, just consider that newest DLC to not be what you need.

The developer has to maneuver between two extremes - an exact repetition of the original and an overabundance of innovations. In order for the game not to be stigmatized by one of the popular labels of “no longer the same” or “old cabbage soup”, it is necessary to understand which elements of the gameplay of the series are conceptually important and do not allow changes, and which ones allow and even suggest them. Borderlands 2 is just a successful combination of the new with the game atmosphere that everyone loves."

1360,Borderlands 2 is very good but it's a bit laggy so you have to put the game into offline mode to get it to run smoother.

1370,"awesome game, love it."
1371,"It's literally my favorite game, Its so worth a play and I really hope you try it out! The story line is interesting, the LOREEEE is fun and wacky, And the characters are deep and relatable! Hands down my favorite game of all time"
1372,murder is fun but grinding for an incendiary fast ball for more then four hours is not
1373,HAHAHAH IT COOOOOL BITCH
1374,gUN

1376,
1377,pov: angy
1378,Fun So play And expiernce the best game made in 2012 hands down
1379,Favorite game
1380,"This is just purely one of the most entertaining and fun video games I have ever played. The characters are fun and the gameplay is fantastic. There are certainly ""meta"" builds in this game, but the build diversity is quite spectacular. This game also has a pretty good difficulty curve with its overpower level system. It may just be nostalgia from my childhood, but I think that many of the jokes in this game still land, mostly because of the delivery of Handsome Jack, who is just so fucking funny. The violin moment at the end of the Wildlife Preserve mission is still one of my favorite moments from any video game. There is a reason why the reviews for Borderlands 2 are so good. Just buy it and play it. You will not regret your decision."
1381,"This is the grad daddy of all looter and shooters, play it and you will never forget it"
1382,good game
1383,"at first it wont be fun but it will be more fun after so
me hours"
1384,"kill stuff 
loot stuff
stuff get stronger
kill stronger stuff
loot stronger stuff

1387,"I like when work.
but when brok I want bonk my head"
1388,Fun.
1389,Better than Borderlands 3 and all its dlc
1390,"The classic kill and looter, with some great characters to boot!"
1391,best borderlands game
1392,"after 85h I finished main story uvhm and played 2 dlcs

the main game is ok it has a good story and great gameplay
the problems start with the dlcs. there is a lot of gender politics in them, side missions that don't serve anything but to project the dev's political views which gets very annoying
and the amount of these dialogues and quests increases each DLC

if you hate gender politics don't play this"
1393,This game is a blast.  I've played through it as each of the characters...multiple times as the mechromancer ;-)
1394,yes
1395,"nice game

1409,Best Looter Shooter that runs on Linux / Steam Deck; possible tie with Borderland: the Pre-Sequel depending on what classes you like.
1410,"played for 30 hours have yet to see the border of the land

1415,Tis good.
1416,"Very repetitive. Many of the quests are run to the other side of the map, then back, then back again, and so on. Main game is extremely short and generally easier than BL1, with the only thing saving it being the DLC, but that's an extra cost. For the base game, the playtime doesn't match up with the cost. There's an obvious large amount of recycling of areas from BL1 and between areas in this game, so it's clear they put minimal time and effort into it, relying on the success of BL1. Loot is terrible, with >90% of chest/dropped loot being white/green, and the rest being blues with the very, very occasional purple, and so far one legendary.

Using eridium as a separate currency is fine for unlocking SDUs, but its drop rate and the SDU costs makes earning enough to buy them extremely grindy and monotonous. AFAICT, the best way is to collect a bunch of money, which is useless in this game save for using the slot machines (vending machines almost never have anything worth purchasing, unlike BL1), then sit and play the slots for a couple hours, because that's fun. And do that over and over every day until you get enough eridium from them to boost your backpack space to the point it's marginally ample (with FIVE different elemental types, six weapon types, plus mods, relics, shields, grenade mods, and the stupid skin customizations that constantly take up space instead of just automatically activating, maxing out the backpack space at 39 is ridiculous). The slots have a ridiculously low drop rate of eridium, whereas they have an equally ridiculously high drop rate of grenades, which are not only annoying for obvious reasons, but because regardless of how low you turn the volume, the explosion is LOUD. Don't worry Gearbox, it's not like people play games with headsets and don't want a loud explosion going off every 20-30 seconds while grinding for hours for a stupid currency to make the game half playable. And, of course, they couldn't put a vending machine near the slot machines THAT GIVE YOU TONS OF USELESS LOOT, so you have to constantly run back and forth to free up backpack space and keep going, all to get eridium.

Not only do all the elemental effects make the backpack space laughably small in comparison, but they don't even always work right. Obviously fire and shock won't work on skeletons, but corrosion surely must, considering they're wearing literal armor, and it's supposed to excel at...armor. Yet a high-level, high-damage corrosion gun was barely doing a dent to them, and I had to switch it out. And I equipped a shield that ""grants immunity to electrocution,"" then tested it by destroying a shock barrel, and quickly died followed by an immediate death in FFYL. So yeah, that's great. Though not quite as awesome as climbing some rocks looking for a secret way to a chest in a locked room (not for the loot, since, as mentioned, I knew it would be junk, but for the fun of it), only to get stuck in a hole between an invisible wall and a rock and pillar that I couldn't squeeze through. I couldn't even kill myself to respawn, and of course there's no option to get your character unstuck, so my friend had to run five minutes all the way to the beginning of the map (we were [i]right[/i] before the boss) and travel us out. I've also managed to get the cars stuck where they shouldn't be able to get stuck.

One positive, almost, is that there are several different characters to choose from, and I've tried out four of them so far. Unfortunately, while this [i]could[/i] be a lot of fun, it means repeating the same exact quests and fights over, & over, & over, & over again, made worse by the fact this occurs once you ""beat"" the game and move on to the next playthrough, another cheap method for Gearbox to increase playtime with minimal work. And even though you've already gone through the same stuff three, four, five times, it doesn't matter, as it makes you watch all the cutscenes and wait for Claptrap to talk and open doors, etc, EVERY...SINGLE...TIME.

The locker to share items between characters is great but far too small to really be useful, especially when you're playing more than a couple. With four characters, I spent probably close to an hour last night just switching back and forth from one to another back to the first back to the second to the third to the second to the first to the third...you get the idea. There really should be an increase in its size for each character you have, and act as an armory to store items to use by any of them.

The Moxxi guns are kind of nice, but often mediocre for their level and you'll usually have something better, and they're only useful for healing, but I'd rather do more damage than get a tiny bit of healing, since if I kill stuff faster, I won't [i]need[/i] the healing. And it's a total crapshoot whether she'll give you one after you tip her three or four times or if you can tip her a hundred times for nothing, with her just rambling about one thing or another which, again, gets repetitive. And when she finally [i]does[/i] give you one, hopefully you're not picky about your guns, because I kept doing it one time trying to get one with decent sights and after giving me four all with crappy sights (iron sights or a high-zoom optical, neither of which belong on an SMG), I finally just gave up. Which brings me to another issue: zoom. Regardless of the gun or zoom, but significantly worse with higher zooms, whenever you're zoomed in, your panning speed is far too low, and there's no way to adjust it without also turning up your non-zoom panning speed. This makes many guns too slow to track targets and, regardless of stats, I toss anything much higher than a 6x for sniper, and other guns that would otherwise be great. It shouldn't take 20+ seconds to turn full circle zoomed with an SMG or shotgun.

Another fun glitch I've encountered a couple times is when dropping an item, it will sometimes go [i]through[/i] the floor or wall and disappear. The last time this happened, I could still ""see"" it when getting close enough and looking around until I found it, and could pick it up again. The first time it happened, my friend had opened the Gearbox chest and got an assault rifle, and was giving me his old one, which likely would have been a big improvement for me, but when he dropped it, in went through the floor and was gone.

I've also had the game crash at least a few times, and partially crash a couple, which means it's crashing in some sense about once every 15-20 hours. It's also crashed for my friend once or twice. I found BL1 to be highly buggy, and BL2 has proven to be not much different in that regard, which sadly isn't surprising.

Finally, as if all that wasn't bad enough, there's the fact that Gearbox/2K (I'm inclined to believe it was more 2K's doing due to past behavior, and I've already decided due to that to not buy any more of their games, and this just reinforces that, but Gearbox likely had some say and allowed it) [i][b]REMOVED[/b][/i] content from one of the DLCs and put it in a new DLC, forcing players to [i][b]PAY AGAIN[/b][/i] for content they'd already bought.

I'm sure many will look at my playtime and disregard this review, or want to complain that I left a negative review with so much time played. And with as much time as I've already played at the time of this review, I'll continue playing more, likely much more. First, I've already paid for it, so I may as well. If I hadn't, I may have just skipped this one. Second, I'm playing with a friend. Third, despite all this, I do still overall enjoy the game, at least when I'm actually playing, i.e. not sitting there playing the slots for an hour or two. Fourth, literally a third to half of my playtime is just sitting in Sanctuary, either playing the slots, testing out weapons, switching between characters to transfer loot, etc. Finally, regardless of anything else, the DLC scam is enough to not only earn a negative review, but a refund IMO."
1417,better with mods
1418,hairy bawls
1419,"Haven't played a lot, or finished the story. It's fun though."
1420,just play it.
1421,"This game was on sale and knowing nearly nothing about it I decided to download because I wanted a new game to play. And woah, I've put in more hours into this game than anything else in recent years and there is STILL lots of content to explore and different campaigns to do. If you like shooters, if you like comedy gold that isn't overplayed or forced, if you like RPG's with good customization options, this is your game. 

Seriously you won't be disappointed. Also no, I was not given this game for free, this is an unsolicited review. It's just that good."
1422,"This is my favorite game of all time. I've played through the campaign countless times. Each hero is fun to play and the game still makes me laugh after all this time, I'm still finding new hilarious details."
1423,"Good.. i guess. Look, Borderlands 1 was my childhood game (yes im not that old) but Borderlands 2 has a weird feeling to it, The trailer for the game is to me not like what the game feels like, But if you mysterious or survival games then you should probably check this game out.

1432,"it's a good game , but haven't finish it yet. game keeps crashing  when facing Jack in the last fight.

1434,great game
1435,"Despite the hours recorded on steam, I have played and completed this game before in a much longer session and what I have to say about Borderlands 2 is.........pause for dramatic effect......its a good game! 

Unique characters, cool art style, lots of weapons to destroy enemies and a good storyline to follow. If you are a loot hoarder like myself then you will love collecting all the guns and add-ons in this game. Boss battles are fun, though you often fall into the bullet-sponge battle montage against foes, emptying round after round into an un-moving monster.....but you have plenty of interesting weaponry to do so. If you love wacky FPS shooters, looters and humour peppered in your game then this is one for you!"

Borderlands 2 took most of the best aspects of Borderlands 1's proof of concept, and improved upon them in a much more complete experience with great characters and diverse uniques, most of which can now be farmed as specific drops from different bosses. If you like looting and/or shooting this game's a no brainer"
1465,"Out of the first three Borderlands games (1, 2, and Pre-sequel), this is the one that captivated me the most. It has really good quests and story that kept me hooked. It's fun and challenging, and probably even better with friends. I would definitely recommend picking it up."
1466,No.
1467,Kill or be killed...great game
1468,good and true
1469,prolly the only game where DLC's are 100% worth it
1470,I love this game. Funny and witty in every sense. The game makes fun of itself and it's just a great pass of the time with a new way to play the game over and over without losing interest. I love their recent games too. Worth checking out if you love fun open world games with boss fights and explosions

"
1501,"Borderlands 2 - достойное продолжение знаменитой на весь мир Borderlands. Снова миллионы оружия, сотни квестов и заданий. Интересный сюжет, а дополнения отличаются от оригинальной игры, от чего в дополнения также интересно играть как и в саму оригинальную игру. Снова мы встречаем героев из первой части игры от чего становится приятно на душе :)"

The definitive looter shooter all others have to measure up to. With 6 characters to choose from and dozens of skills for each there are almost as many ways to play this game as there are guns that can drop in it. 3 base difficulties and post-game OP levels ensure you are always able to play the game to the level of challenge you want."

1535,"Really didn't get on with this game at all when I first picked it up, I'd only played much simpler FPS games, but once I got the hang of how it handles it become a favourite. It's just a shame that I came too late for most people because I would have liked to have played more with others."

1540,"i have a massive skill issue and am playing on a godawful PC, but good game"
1541,"So. Let me get this straight. I've had this game for nearly ten years. I bought it in a store on my birthday. It was pretty good. I liked it. It had way too many splash screens and menus, but it was alright. Then, at some point in the past six months or so, Gearbox added on their own launcher and DRM bs. A game I already bought. And played. For ten years. 

This is why people pirate games.

Fuck aggro narcissistic roid head, Randy Pitchford, and his penchant for underage squirt porn."

1574,"Absolutely love Borderlands 2, the series in general honestly. But guess what? Over the course of this game being out, it broke. You CANNOT get normal drop rates unless you install Mods from 3rd party websites. I've farmed over 50 hours of bosses for some specific things and I have not gotten ONE. Conference calls ALWAYS non elemental, even RARE BLUES not dropping in some of the DLCS. If you want to play for a bit, do it but the end game is dead. F U GEARBOX"

1584,"As someone who has thousands of hours on console, Borderlands 2 is well worth the purchase, there is so much to do and the replay value is amazing, by far the best fps rpg game out there."
1585,Tons of Bandussy. 11-3 / 10
1586,"Borderlands 2 is easily one of the greatest games ever made. This game is really fun and immersive and it's a first person action/ rpg loot game, and its an amazing sequel to the already great borderlands. However what makes this game unique is the cell shading graphics and open world areas which are filled with so much exploration. Although borderlands 2 is an amazing game I can assure gamers that this game will never get boring as it easily one of the most replayable games ever, and has a great co op experience. I highly recommend this game."

1590,You won't even realize you spent half of the day on like 3 quests only.
1591,Defenetly recomnd
1592,"My favorite game of all time. I've played hundreds of hours (mostly on console) and played every character to level 72 OP8 (when that was still the max) and I still go back to this game. Easily the best in the series from the writing, to the characters, guns, levels, etc. I think BL3 has the better gunplay and combat overall, but I always find myself going back to BL2 over any of the others."
1593,good
1594,"this is literally peak gaming. play it if you havent you f**ing loser

1610,Yes. Still gold.
1611,I like to clap trap.
1612,"its good stuff, solid game all around and tons of fun, got over 1000 hours on the console version and got the pc version to play with mods. 10/10 would buy a third time."
1613,fuck you for killing Roland and Maya in BL3 just fuck you
1614,"Borderlands 2 exemplifies the best of Borderlands. If you loved the first, or have ever wanted to check out this game I would just buy it now on sale. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods is what make the game even more fun because they drop while you play the game and you can get some high powered guns to run through the story if you are trying to get to ultimate true vault hunter mode. The DLC is also very great."
1615,borderland
1616,"Best looter shooter out there. The borderlands series is unmatched in the genre. 
Best villain in the history of gaming, some of the most memorable characters in gaming. Some of the best boss fights in gaming. This game is one of the greatest games of all time. Between my consoles and my PC I have lost hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of hours in this game. Let alone the other entries in the series.
The classes you can play as are all memorable in there own way with the exception of maybe Zane. Multiple playthroughs are recommended as each playthrough will be played differently based on your build and weapons. 
That said, one playthrough is enough to experience what this game has to offer. All DLC are bangers too, especially Assault on Dragon Keep"
1617,"JUST A EXCELLENT GAME
"
1618,This game is objectively terrible. Lol
1619,"Overall amazing and still stacks up to this day. No matter how many times you play it, it pushes you every single time. Always a great game to get and play with friends to increase the fun and chaos"
1620,"Phenomenal game, Amazing villain, and Amazing story. The gameplay is pretty good and the amount of guns is pretty nice as well."
1621,"What I don't like about this game is that it's ultimately just fetch quests.
It's not as open as it wants to be, it's a lot of hub worlds that feel pretty empty, pretty samey.
It's better with a friend, but still feels empty. 
I guess it's just not for me."
1622,WHY IS IT WANG CHUNG
1623,Very nice game the graphics are good
1624,Super Great All Around
1625,"One of my favorite shooters of all time. Been playing this across various platforms since it came out. The story is great and side quests are a lot of fun. Gunplay and character abilities are definitely the highlight of the game, alongside the loot game."

I played borderlands the pre sequel on my ps3 before I got this game on pc, and holy shit both of them are the most fun I had in my gaming life. I bought the handsome collection and it came with every dlc for thr game avaliable and holy shit that's too much and Its fucking amazing how much play hours this game has stored for everyone. I fucking recommend it and you *really* need to get the handsome collection as fast as possible because you might miss the opportunity of your lifetime. 9.8/10 could use more movement I think."

1680,"Pretty fun to play with friends, beat the game in 2 days because it was fun"
1681,"If you don't find this game funny, I don't know what to tell you. Some of the finest comedic writing of all time, regardless of medium, and some of the tightest FPS gameplay ever with fun RPG class mechanics added to sweeten the deal. It's a masterpiece."
1682,not bad ngl
1683,Solid addition to the Borderlands series as it heavily compliments and complements the original game!
1684,"i played the borderlands as a kid, growing up me and my dad would hop on our ps3 and play for hours. this is by far one of my favorite games ever"
1685,"This is Randy Pitchford's finest hour, and it's still like a 7/10. 

Peak Gearbox is an average game with below average AI and Slightly above average gunplay which is dependant on RNG to decide whether you shoot a guy 3000 times or 30 times to down em. 

Consider buying if you enjoy OCD gameplay where you grind for a chance to get a chance at the one variant of a gun you want from a specific enemy or boss for 30 hours, and then find out the gun you wanted is actually garbage. 

Jokes aside. BL2 ain't bad, but some of this stuff didn't age too well (for me at least) and sometimes the effectiveness of your loadout being RNG dependant can be infuriating at the higher difficulties. I genuienly enjoy the first game better purely for it's simplicity and how weapons are a bit more straightforward, keeping even underleveled weapons relatively effective. 

Also Randy Pitchford posted a video of a cat being abused on Twitter once and defended it when people called him out. Yikes."
1686,"Let me start this post by saying: Your time is the most valuable thing you have in this life. That said, the game is 5$ It should be free. Heres why. To date, if you're running windows 8 on up this game more than likely will not run on your pc. Do not take it from me, just research ""Borderlands 2 freezes up after continue"" ""borderlands 2 freezes up on load"". You get the idea. So many game companies these days feel as though they can sell you a product that does not work. As if its your problem to get it running from the ground up. Sure we could notepad++ the shit out of it, and we have...But why, why is it the consumers problem who is paying for a product. Why isnt the game free if its not even going to work. Nostalgia brought me back because of how much i love this game. And my time being wasted is what has brought me here. To save you the hassle. Either patch a few things to get it running on modern systems, or make it free."
1687,.
1688,"good game
"
1689,"damn this game truly are addicting. 30 hours in, and still finishing the side quest before facing the handsome jack. perhaps i will invest more my money on this franchise in the future. 10/10 will loot again."

1702,"beat the game on normal mode on 360, decided to get it on steam when there was a sale on the GoTY edition, came with a majority of the dlc, online is fun and i can actually aim without being on controller. 10 outta ten, great game worthy of buying, but would wait until its on sale and get either the handsome collection or the GoTY edition for the dlc, 8 bucks is a steal."

1733,good
1734,Very enjoyable
1735,"Ah, Borderlands.  While I do enjoy the first game from time to time, Borderlands 2 is the pinnacle of the franchise.  I enjoyed the sequel too but the antagonist in Borderlands 2 is the perfect villain.  Plus being able to choose between six different playable characters is what makes this game so great compared to the first and third games.  I've played this game on... I think I'm up to about 5 platforms now... Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC, PS4, Switch.  Yeah, and I've enjoyed almost all playthroughs. (Can't quite get behind Zero or Sal's play style)"
1736,This game is amazing. The only 2 things holding it back is the difficulty spike from True Vault Hunter to Ultimate and how you need to rely on slag to win and how tedious it can be to get to OP10. Just give it Borderlands 3 type movement and it'll be an instant 10/10
1737,It gud
1738,best game ever
1739,buy it

1750,"A classic game, the best in the series, and honestly nothing else will probably ever top it in terms of creativity of guns and other loot."
1751,"What can be said that hasn't already been? One of, if not the best, looter shooters of all time. Chaotic writing mixed with blood pumping gameplay is best way to describe this game. Handsome Jack is one of the GREATEST game villains of all time. The amount of fun archetypes that can be used gameplay wise is also impressive. Been playing since 2012 and still can't get over how much I love the characters and world of Pandora. The one con I will say is one most people won't have but coming from the first game Borderlands 2 did change the entire tone of the series to come after. This is easier to notice when playing both games back to back. Worth the full price and dlc"
1752,"Hi Logan :)
"
1753,very fun
1754,mad max
1755,Amazing game for its time. As it was recently on sale alot of people who have moved over from xbox have bought this game again and it is no surprise either. Incredible story telling and rich in things to do in this game after completing the game multiple times guides to help new players scattered everywhere and ontop of that fresh mods coming out all the time keeping this game alive and amazing to keep playing over and over again. DLC is also amazing aswell and definitely worth buying when or sale or from a place like cd keys with a loving community helping guide you in different ways.

Do yourself a favour and pick the game up as it's often on sale, in terms of DLC all are fantastic aside from Sir Hammerlocks Big game hunt but the best value would probably come from the Tiny Tina DLC.

1763,very fun game to play! if you have friends
1764,guf gmae 10/10 best out iof the seris
1765,fun
1766,i love this game
1767,"One of the most Constructive games I've played in a long time. Even if you haven't played the first game, the game doesn't rely heavily on you having knowledge of the first game."
1768,"I am a 58 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Borderlands 2. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Borderlands 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90’s, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing Borderlands 2. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. Borderlands 2 reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."
1769,better than destiny
1770,I guess it's good  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1771,Much coool nicenis totally radical dud hily recomendddded

1773,I'd spent more time on it if it wasn't laggy af even though my laptop specs met all the requirements.
1774,"I advise against getting the GOTY edition, if you are going to get the handsome jack collection, it even comes with a (detestably worse) game with most other DLC's"
1775,Its borderlands <3 wub wub wubwubwub
1776,yes
1777,og gasssssssssssssssss
1778,"My favorite utterly twisted humor, and the only FPS I every truly got into. Love the characters, the styling, the storyline. Great replay value."
1779,minecraft skins
1780,"The peak of Borderlands. When the humor was great, the characters were well written, and the potential for the future of the franchise was still exciting. I mean, imagine how great Borderlands 3 could have been if they kept this quality up. Shame, really. 

Buy Borderlands 2. Play the ever living hell out of it. Then don't bother with the rest."
1781,W game fr
1782,"Played this game since it came out, still playing it today, still amazing!"
1783,dicks are for chicks
1784,Good game and is always fun
1785,Tector Hodunk says you should buy this game
1786,This is by far one of my favorite CO-OP games of all time!!!!!!!!! Especially with all the DLC. I have played this game on every console imaginable and will continue to play it forever.
1787,shooting people simulator
1788,Good Game
1789,"I haven't finished the story yet but so far this is everything I wanted Borderlands 1 to be and more: great environments, top-notch gameplay, great villain and a great story (so far). Might come back to edit this after I finish the game."
1790,very good
1791,Great mix of RPG and FPS games
1792,"Come on its Borderlands 2, hands down the best game in the series."
1793,I Think This Game Is Really Good If you like Adventure And collecting Weapons And becoming Stronger

1802,sex when
1803,"i have never spent more than 80 hours in two weeks on a game before. The game is great, but its horribly balanced in OP lvls and UVHM cuz of slagging."
1804,I got brain on my shoe... I like it.
1805,"It is everything the first one was, but with a better story (that is to say, there is a story) that ties into the rest of the series. If you like your loot n' shoots, this just adds more content to the mix. Is fun with friends and can be scored on sale pretty often."
1806,"1/10 I am severely addicted to this game 

I only play this because I used to be a Destiny (1) player, and I hate Destiny 2

Otherwise pretty meh but severely addicting once you start getting to Level 50 and even more so when you are Level 80 and are capable of getting end-game loot, the guns are mostly shit and only a few are worth keeping. 

A pretty good way to sink and completely waste your time too.

I already have 113 hours on this month alone (Combining both Steam and Epic as I originally got this game for free on that platform and transferred my save file over to Steam, I got this game because of the sale + all DLC's excluding Lilith)"
1807,"Improved on the first game, better story, returning characters, handsome jack."
1808,My chest is HUGE!!!!
1809,No Hesitation

1835,Midget goes crazy
1836,"One of the best looter-shooter games ever made. There are hundreds of good builds for the different classes, the multi-player is really good and helps you get better loot drops. The DLC's are a MUST buy, they not only have great loot and bosses, but good story, huge new maps, skins, and vehicles. The only thing I don't like about it is the sheer length of time it takes to get specific gear for your builds, you can easily dump hundreds of hours into just grinding for a handful of items."
1837,"pretty fun
"
1838,"After a long tough fight, it crashed without save, fxxk !"
1839,"Over a decade old, and it's still one of the GOATs"
1840,It is a good game but its way too hard for any new player. 1. the rescue mission is too hard. 2. shields are just annoying 3. too hard to level up

1861,"Genuinely love this game so much.
Mad Max Fury Road is one of my favorite movies and I love some of the aesthetic similarities. 
Gameplay is fun, I usually hate FPS games but have enjoyed every minute playing."

1913,"This game really takes me back.
when Borderlands 2 first came out on the PS3 my dad and I would play non stop for hours on end, we would have the best goddamn time. and now playing it by myself all these years later I'm reminded of how much unbridled fun there is to be had playing this game. thank you Gearbox for this masterpiece, it continues to bring me so much joy."

DMCA people for making VR mods?

fine, but they wont get money from me ever again. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. how stupid are they, tons of people have bought multiple of their games specifically just because there is a VR mod for it. including myself.


im so sick of these anti consumer practices in gaming from people who are filthy rich already.

theyre more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ focused on how other people are making mods for their games...LIKE FULLY MOTION CONTROLLED VR...THAT THEY ARENT...than actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ making them all function. its so pathetic. bioshock ports ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ do not work without MODDING THEM. some of the files are literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken. i wish youd never been able to buy any of the companies or IPs you did.

 and yeah, i know that borderlands 2 has a VR version(that they fucking make you pay extra for) which...for anyone that hasnt tried it. it FUCKS YOU RIGHT IN THE VESTIBULOCOCHLEAR NERVE> they ltierally should change the name from borderlands2vr to PUSH BUTTON TO INDUCE VERTIGO.

1960,all around my fav game since i was young
1961,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

1974,Amazing game well worth the money
1975,"This will always be the best Borderlands. No matter how many borderlands they come out with, this is the best one.  Still, the name fits, every map feels a bit confined. Makes you know that you're really, on the ""borderlands"".  

Overall Review: Can Claptrap even clap?"
1976,😄👍
1977,Not the worst Borderlands
1978,its grindy af
1979,the first playthrough SUCKS it has trail missions etc but when you get to 2nd playthrough and 3rd it becomes so fun to play gun play is craz and fun raid bosses
1980,"The game it self is good but me coming from newer titles (Destiny 2), Borderlands 2 has started to show its age in not such a good way. This is my first borderlands game and first impressions were mid at best, the movement is dated and the basic and more common guns are inaccurate and for some reason your character aims down their sights like they have never touched a gun before. The game is filled with many invisible walls and rocks that that makes your feet to not function and forget how to use them. Vehicles as a method of transportation are alright unless your car gets an air time of half a second which will lead in to it spinning out and loosing all speed, and the invisible walls I mentioned earlier are amplified here to stop vehicles from entering places that looks like they can fit and if you hit any walls with your car at a high speed, you will bounce off it (which is kinda funny not gonna lie). The characters and story of the game are nice.
TLDR: Good characters and story ruined by mediocre gunplay are horrible movement"
1981,"I am a 48 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game (still crazy to me). I haven't played this game for a few weeks but here is my story: I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now.

I rate BL2 a 10/10 would highly recommend to any fans of chaotic looter shooters that have  great characters and a memorable story."
1983,"you can make money,"
1984,"soooooo swaaaaaaag
"
1985,This game is just plain awesome and that's all there is to it
1986," Probably the game I have the most amount of hours on due to playing the game since the release, hitting level 50 in the very first day it came out along with playing it on xbox 360 then xbox one and now PC although I've had it on PC for years I only recently started playing it more on PC than xbox one due to the countless play throughs I've had on my xbox. The greatest game in the series, although it probably isnt the best at anything except its farmability and its main villain.  My favorite game of all time."
1987,"""Hey, buddy! It's me Roland! Let's kill Handsome Jack and then we'll ALL go out for milkshakes!"""
1988,"While the game itself isn't bad, it is too over-hyped and some flaws are unfixable even if you mod the game.

The game misses atmosphere. Everything looks a bit bland and repetitive. Not serious enough for a serious game and not wacky enough for a silly game. (this is the one thing BL3 did better).

Most characters are 2-dimensional and their dialogue get boring quick.

The leveling feels like I'm carrying a carrot on a stick at all times. The more I level the harder new areas.

Enemies are bullet sponges (especially in the beginning) and shoot with the aim of a storm trooper, which makes the game pace slow.

Bullets are not that plenty in the field and you tend to run out of them quickly.

Enemies also respawn immediately after leaving and coming back to an area. which sucks if you are doing side quests. together with the level being set at first entering an area makes the thing completely boring.

The difference in level is just ridiculous. and the damage scaling is insane. This is the problem with all BL games. 

The game is also very black and white and too tame at times (humor wise). It is also filled with the same cliches over and over. 


Now, the guns are cool and there are plenty of them. But this alone doesn't carry the game very well. With limited inventory, be prepared to sell most of your loot and hope you didn't sell some damage type you'll need in the next zone. 

I know I listed a lot of negative remarks, but the game isn't that bad. It just isn't good. If they made to story better, the characters likeable or the terrain more atmospheric. Just something that stands out besides a billion guns, the game would be quite good.

"
1989,zone out listen to music game
1990,"Should go without explanation. Even after all this time, after thousands of hours and multiple play throughs, I can still launch this game and have fun playing it. Xbox 360, PS4, and now I'll be playing (and probably modding) for PC."

2005,"best one, only gets worse from here
"
2006,Just play it - you won't regret it.
2007,"Pros:

- Great graphics with a pretty unique visual style
- Tons of costumization options
- Tons of weapons
- Tons of different open world maps
- Plenty of achievements
- Plenty of Enemies and allies
- There's clever puzzles and missions
- Gearbox doesn't abandon the game, keeps close to it despite the game's age.

Cons:

- It's somewhat easy to find map related bugs and texture mistakes.
- I've found a few bugs that instantly kill me for whatever reason (not allowing me to get downed, it just instantly kills me when it shouldn't have)
- Multiplayer can be often problematic in lag related issues.
- The movement mechanics can be pretty annoying to work with due to them being quite bouncy, meaning you can jump into the wrong hitbox and bounce off a cliff or into a dangerous area.

----- Comments -----
A bit of a bias review as I have always loved the borderlands franchise, however I am always surprised to learn of more people that hadnt even touched on of these games. Borderlands 2 is considered the best of the borderlands in general, even the artstyle while crude is still great. I personally have finally moved on to the Wonderlands, but this is still an amazing throw back to play with friends."
2014,"I love stealing my friends loot. [i]Borderlands 2[/i] is a really fun game which allows you to spread communism while playing it. [b]„Ours”[/b] means you can take whatever you want and it's great when loads of excellent gear is beeing dropped by defeated enemies. [b]The game is really fun, complex, well written and graphics are nice for your eye.[/b]

Just buy it, gather some friends and make them mad by catching items midair."

2017,"This game is personally my favorite game ever, and I think it belongs in the top 20 games of all time."
2018,games kinda bad
2019,"Tried to play this with my wife, so I bought two copies, but when trying to just start the game itself, it would freeze and then crash, or it would freeze up and I would not be able to click anything, having to task manager to close it. Very frustrating, I dont understand what is wrong with this PC version, played fine when I had it on console."
2020,awesome
2021,this game is cool i like i t its better than metal gear rising

2031,I've played this game since it came out on different consoles and i for some reason can't stop playing it!
2032,just get the 3rd one instead
2033,"This game is one of the best looter shooters out there. All of the unique guns and quests, my favorite quest is this quest that all you have to do is shoot someone in the face. But the game is very funny also with some crude and dark humor. All of the characters are great too, but some of the side quests are a little bit boring. Besides that the bosses are great, it is multiplayer, I could go on and on about how good this game is. This is an easy 10/10 game."

2048,"Fun fun fun fun, It never seem to run out of things to do in it there is always side quest, farming for the best possible guns, shields, relics and just constantly starting new games etc.. i like this borderlands more then any other for the pure sense of the enjoyment and nostalgia i get from playing it. i have been an active player since the first borderlands, i never get bored with it."

2084,Good
2085,"It is Diablo 2, with GUNS"
2086,"As everyone should already know, Borderlands 2 is the ultimate looter shooter and the perfect game to pick up and blast through with a group of friends in co-op!
It's packed with quests and environments, an interesting plot that expands on the original featuring plenty of hilarious characters (yes, even Claptrap) and the overall gameplay loop, although fairly simple, is wonderfully executed. Lock and load, Vault Hunter!"
2087,"An amazing timeless game that you can play for hundreds of hours and never get bored. Tons of customizability in terms of the builds you can create by choosing different characters, mods, skills, weapons, modifiers, etc. The story is great and the best out of all the borderlands games imo and the gunplay works so well in this game. The graphics hold up really well for this game being made like 10 years ago. Also the multiplayer is fun you can play up to 4 player co op, but its still great in single player too. 10/10"
2088,"SUPER FUN TO PLAY ON MACBOOK AIR M1 !!!! APPLE SILICON FTW!

2094,Borderlands 2 👍
2095,The only Boardlands game you need. Seriously
2096,"A game in which you will hear excitement looking at the next purple or yellow cannon. And shooting with them at different enemies, don't forget to scream like a psycho :D"
2097,"Gonna say this right now, this game made me a fan of Borderlands immediately.

Personally, I wasn't a fan of FPS games. But then this and the Fallout Series made me feel otherwise. Borderlands 2 is a game I became so attached to because of it's characters, story, humour and style. It became one of my favourite games of all time and I'll probably go back to it after I'm done with The Pre-Sequel, since I'm doing Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. 

Also if you're interested in some DLC, I highly recommend getting the Handsome Collection for the full experience of this great game. However, for some reason, ""Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary"" isn't on that collection so you might have to get that separately."
2098,ok
2099,good

2114,funny game
2115,Guaranteed to get a laugh and a cry out of this game. Maintains emotional scenes while keeping hilarious snippets everywhere else in side quests and dialogue. Highly recommend!
2116,"This game is incredibly fun, and if you get stuck on a level, you can just go to a different location and farm levels/weapons. Farming isn't tedious like in other games, and there are loads of different areas and quests, particularly if you have the dlc, which I would recommend getting. It's super fun, and there's always something suited to your level."
2117,"very excellent game, so much fun killing enemies and getting cool interesting guns"
2118,Isa good a show
2119,gregory is an idiot for not letting me play with him because he hates me but this game is still very good thank you :)
2120,"I have bought, sold, bought, bought, bought, and bought this game. it's pretty fucking good."
2121,borderlands co op is fun 9/10
2122,This game is a masterpiece!!! Also play this game with friends. I prefer LAN
2123,Can't say anything negative at all
2124,LOVE KILLING PPL
2125,i keep coming back to it. try it out...
2126,"My personal favorite of the Borderlands series, It has the best story of em all, The dialogue doesn't seem as forced as it does in Pre-Sequal or Borderlands 3, Though the 3rd has more mechanics like Vaulting and Sliding and gun skins n such, it just doesn't have the same Appeal, not to shun the 3rd I think it's great."

2137,"Overwhelmingly the best Borderlands title and maybe even the greatest looter shooter of all time. Games are unfairly compared to this game even today. It's not even a question, how have you not bought or played this already? Get the the GotY edition or the Handsome collection. Play it with friends, play it by yourself. It's good.

This game is 10 years old and I still think about the time I spent playing this as if it was yesterday. Fuck I'm old."
2138,if you hours of fun guns and blood then this is your game.
2139,loved playing co op with friends
2140,will always be my all time favorite game.

2158,"This is hands-down the best coop looter shooter.  It's better than every other borderlands game I've played (tho I haven't tried the new Tiny Tina standalone yet), and there are enough side-quests to make each playthrough different, if you're skipping quests you outlevel (particularly if you get the expansions).

There are 4 major expansions that extend the base game, and while the hammerlock one is tedious the others are all magnificently enjoyable.

There are 4 classes to play, plus 2 more via DLC.  Within each class, there are 3 skill trees that can be mixed and matched with talent points, leading to a huge number of playstyles that can be adapted.  This also adds a ton of replayability - e.g. playing zero with a straight-sniper spec and playing zero with a majorly melee spec are totally different.  I thoroughly enjoyed every class except for the soldier - and I'm an odd duck there, most people I've talked about BL with love the soldier.

The multitude of guns in the game take a bit to get used to - ""feel"" is just as important as their stats.  I learned this mid-way through my first playthrough, where I swapped to a new gun that seemed a complete upgrade by stats but lacked ""oomph"" when I actually started fighting with it.  I was able to buy back the old one from the vendor and sure enough, went right back to being a badass.

Also, brag time, I one-shotted the bunker the first time I fought it in an amazing feat of luck that I haven't been able to reproduce in my zillion playthroughs since then (sniper spec zero with a green quality torgue shotgun, fired from stealth as it was passing overhead - I'd gone to pick up a coop player and they got second wind so i just shot at the nearest thing, Bore is wonderful).  We thought it was a joke boss but then it started dropping decent loot, so we googled it.

The plot is kinda forgettable, and the humor is more silly than witty, but the mood of the game is usually playful, making it all worth paying attention to.  I am a little annoyed at how much praise you get for the events of the opening cut-scene (""You faced handsome jack and LIVED!""), which happens before you've even selected your character, and the whole ""vault hunter"" thing is pretty meh.  Just excuses to kill stuff.  The Tiny Tina and Torgue expansions are both amazingly enjoyable in their writing, however.  Nothing deep, just silly as hell.

TL;DR:  Like shooting stuff?  Like loot?  Like coop?  Then BL2 = yes."
2159,"got a legendary on the first boss xd
very fun
u shoot things"
2160,All borderlands is great but this one is the best. They got a lot things right.
2161,Played this on console...been playing this on pc too. Def a great game
2162,I just have one question and one question only. EXPLOSIONS??????
2163,Veri gud. Wish I had someone to play with... :(
2164,A great game with a surprisingly good story for a comedy!
2165,E
2166,"I played this game for about 6 years on console and know it like the hair on my nutsack, but the fight for sanctuary dlc fucking BLOWED, sure it added new gameplay but that shit RUINED the value of a legendary with the dlc handing them out practically for free, with easy bosses and even QUESTS that gave legendaries... don't play the dlc itself but def get it for the new level cap, other than that the game is a MASTERPIECE of game design, with a story and gameplay that surpasses ANY game. it also outclasses its predecessor bl1 which is although a decent game, bl2 just added so much more. you should try bl1 for ""lore"" despite it having little to no actual story to it."
2167,very fun fast pace. awesome guns
2168,Amazing
2169,"cute asf
"
2170,"i am coming to this as someone who didn't grow up playing it... 

this game didn't age well, its clunky and chaotic in ways that just dont mesh well with modern players like me. ik a lot of people will stand and die on this hill just as militantly as NV. So to that effect, to each their own. I really did give it a try, but its just not for me.

I don't reccomend this to young / new people who've not grown up with the BL series ESPECIALLY if you do not have friends. I did, again i tried super hard to like it. just didn't pan out."
2171,"Look at my hours.  You see that?  yeah, I have reinstalled it like 10 times.  Trust me its worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2172,good game very addicting
2173,I'll never stop coming back to this masterpiece. Worth it at full price and on sale. Get it immediately.
2174,"Steam Deck exclusive update loses save files and forces Proton. Native Linux compatibility, formerly flawless, destroyed by update. Linux version will not run, crashes to launcher. Windows version is trash.

This was evidently done in the name of cross compatibility via Shift, but this update is pushed ONLY on Steam Deck. Two other Linux boxes in the house have no update.

Sure looks a lot like intentional sabotage of Valve's flagship product on this title. Makes me wonder how many other Linux games are about to be broken by ""upgrades""."
2175,The game should already have split screen try playing it with my friends at home but cant waist of money.
2176,bloody screen
2177,"this one guy in new haven, right? city's burning, people are dying left and right, yadda yadda yadda... this jackhole rushes me with a spoon. a fricking spoon! and i'm dying laughing, right? so i scoop out his stupid little eyeballs with it, and his kids are all, waaahh!, and, he can't see where he's going, he's bumping in to stuff, and ah... i don't know, maybe you had to be there

the moral is: you're a total bitch

10/10, would recommend -- there's a pony made of diamonds named 'butt stallion'
i personally love the whole borderlands franchise, i've loved borderlands since i was a kid. i grew up watching my uncle playing it whenever i would stay with him over the school holidays

i love everything about this game ranging from the art style all the way to the soundtrack and gameplay! it's witty, funny, engaging, and challenging - it can get a little frustrating at times, but it is super satisfying to finish a mission. i can't wait to get a pc so i'm able to play borderlands 3 and tiny tina's wonderlands without it making my laptop explode"
2178,best game ever

2180,"Imagine Space/Sci-fi+The Wild West+Comedy+Fps+Open world, and you get a game that should suck and make no sense, but instead you get a masterfully crafted open world game, with everything having care put into it, with lovable characters, this game is worth buying at anytime of the year!

2189,It's a good game.
2190,so good
2191,great game! its amazing and absolutely hilarious the guns are funny and feel good and the game even runs on my crap computer. Ive only had a few problems such as one time and etype weapon just dissapeared from my inventory. either way its a good game
2192,"Absolute classic. One of my favorite games of all time. Play this one first if you're a series neophyte.
Starting to show some age, but still incredible."
2193,good game
2194,this game is amazing and that i only used to play on my xbox but now i fount it again and all of my childhood came back and that it still is enjoyable to this day its an very addicting game and that i reccomend to anyone who wants to play this game for themselves i say go for it.
2195,best game ever pls buy this game for maximum chadness and abosuluter redpillers
2196,"This is my favorite borderlands game above all the rest, they just did something right with this game that i cant quite put my finger on that makes me always wanna play it and i enjoy it so much, it clicks with me more then the other games in the franchise. good humor, fps,and the chaos of higher levels, and a decent story with old good lore (before BL3 :/) and the dlc were good fun too (am not done with em but been loving em), always a top pick in my book for good looter shooter fun."
2197,I used to play the trilogy on a console before and of course they are super challenging to play for me. However Borderlands 2 always have a special place in my heart because of it's extensive gameplay and play time. Although this game has released nearly a decade ago it still worth the shot to buy it and revisit it again as it has alot of replayability. If u wanna get it better get it now since its on sale!

2237,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Might have slightly worse gunplay than 3 and wonderlands but this has plenty more entertaining content and characters."
2268,"I have less time played on PC but, I've owned every Borderlands game on every console/platform possible and spent thousands of hours in these games, without a doubt Borderlands 2 will always be the best in the series. Story is fantastic, guns are awesome, characters are phenomenal, so many things to do. Endgame can be challenging for sure but, that's part of the charm."

2305,"One of the best games I have ever played, I have been playing this game since it came out when I was 12, I first played on Xbox 360, got all the DLC, then had the handsome collection on PS4, and now have the handsome collection on PC. If you like a good story with one of the most iconic video game villains of all time, this is your game!"
2306,"There's Borders, theres Lands.
There's critters, there's cans.
There's guns, there's mans.
There's monies, there's hands.
It might be worth your time, and might be more fun than OnlyFans.

Take a trip, give it a chance. There's also a pretty Siren girl, but whatever you do - keep it in your pants ;)"
2307,alwayss good
2308,"long completely pointless unskippable cutscenes, just getting the refund rather than even bother finding out anything else about the game"
2309,i love the borderlands games so much and 2 was just as gud as the other games.
2310,"While the gameplay mechanics are outdated in today's standard. The story is still a solid experience, an overall better story than Borderlands 3. Now there’s only two main reasons in considering buying Borderlands 2:

•You have friends to play co-op with. As the solo experience is pretty lonesome.
•You’re waiting for a bigger and/or better Borderlands 3 Steam sale deal."
2311,yes
2312,ULTRA GOOD
2313,I forgot
2314,"THE looter shooter experience. Widely regarded as the best game in the franchise it holds up the fight to that title pretty well. I've played this game twice through on PS4 and once on PC and I can guarantee you that even after going through all the DLC's (which are all SUPER worth it, my favorite being Tiny Tina's Dungeons and Dragons inspired DLC), I have still not even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.

The wittiest, funniest, lootiest, shootiest game with a PLETHORA of ways to play and customize your character from appearances to weapons to gear it just...doesn't...end....and it's freaking awesome.

If you are a slut for loot like me, this game is a wet dream. If you hoard your inventory and maximize your garbage to sell for the most potential profit, this game is amazing. If you love vibrant, open worlds with lots of fun places to explore, characters to meet, side quests to do (like, a lot of side quests to do), planning skill trees, this game is a treasure trove. It has something for everyone and having COUCH COOP it is one of the best FPS experiences gaming as an industry has to offer. This game is just....really good, y'all. If you are a nut for anything in those steam tags you will find it in spades. I don't think I need to sing its praises but really, this game is just a ton of fun solo and with friends. I heavily recommend picking up all the included DLC because it is all refreshing, offers amazing new items, characters, classes, stories, maps just...everything."
2315,Crashed two times while in the 10 minute long unskippable intro scene and forced me to replay it. Uninstalled
2316,"The grind for loot, so you can grind for better loot, which will allow you to grind for even better loot, that will let you grind for more loot, that will............"
2317,Improves the first game in all areas!
2318,:) loot go brr
2319,"The best game out of the series, amazing story, amazing game play, amazing character and customisation, and the best villain of all time in video gaming, i don't have a lot of hours on PC as i played on my Xbox when i was younger but still definitely recommend in 2022."
2320,"It's the classic looter shooter that i would say, most people should try at least once."
2321,Loved it too
2322,"Hardcore action, treasure hunting, awesome gunplay, what's not to love? Awesome game, especially when you can play online with friends."
2323,gigachad game+ like to blast midgets with bane smg because it is funny
2324,"I grained The Bunker to THE Slam for a month everyday, around 3-4 hours. Did not get but I will do it again and am doing it again. 10/3.33"

2354,Best game in the franchise.

2367,You're SKAGBAIT. grinder
2368,"9.5/10
One of the best game I have ever played.
Amazing story and staggering gameplay.
Has 6 distinct characters and 3 different difficulty modes.

Not 10/10 because the game should have an option to skip cutscenes. It becomes annoying to watch the same cutscenes again and again as you will be playing this game more than once for sure.
"
2369,"This game is 10 years old (at the time of writing) and I'm hooked. I've got a steam library full of games; old and new,  classics and indie. I downloaded this because I played og Borderlands years ago on 360 and liked it but it didn't have that rpg element that modern fallouts ""attempt"" at so it felt like a fun shooter with a bit of a story but not much more. The story aspect of BL2 is engaging immediately, the characters are unique and entertaining. I'm really enjoying myself and understand why BL2 is regarded as the best of the series."
2370,"Compared to the previous game, Borderlands 2 has made great progress. In the process of playing, I have not encountered any bugs, which I am quite satisfied with. The game is also equipped with a lot of firearms and equipment. The gameplay is very good, you won't feel the repetition of the plot, you will see many kinds of monsters in the game, all kinds. The style of painting is partial to animation, a style of futuristic style, but I don't particularly like games with futuristic style, so I didn't immerse myself in the game. The only downside is that the picture quality is very rough, if you mind, you can ignore this game. Overall a good game, but I don't think I'm going to go any deeper into this game."
2371,It is good
2372,"I love this game, i will be playing more"
2373,easily one of the best game i've ever played.
2374,"Years later and still the best looter-shooter to date. I still find myself coming back to this game on occasion.

This game was when Borderlands/Gearbox had a higher funny-to-cringe ratio and frequently goes on sale. If you haven't played it yet, consider doing so."

No major characters being slain for no good reason. Fast paced and a smooth flow from one quest to the other.  Great shooter game. Even better with more people.

2416,"An absolute classic. I love this game and will probably keep coming back to it for years. It's extremely fun to play with friends, and I've also had a lot of fun replaying things by myself using different character classes. I have yet to find BL2's equal in the co-op loot-and-shoot genre."
2417,very good game
2418,I've played borderlands 2 since i was a kid and loved it. I bought it again on PC from Xbox and still would recommend this game to anyone.
2419,gun
2420,:)
2421,its fun and really exiting even for an older game and its got some funny parts to it especially if u like dark humour
2422,"The best game in the Borderlands franchise without a doubt. If you want to try borderlands, get this one."
2423,Its a good game just a bit repetitive.
2424,one of the best games i have ever played
2425,There is no gun
2426,"Good graphics for the time, nice, relaxed gameplay, in depth storyline, good gunplay, amazing game, would recommend to anyone"
2427,shit game.
2428,"Many hours played, will play many more!"
2429,hot
2430,"this game is the funniest first person shooters i have ever played. the comedic writing of anthony burch coupled with the great combat and really cute style makes this game a must-play. 10/10, 100% reccomend. it is worth your money :)"
2431,Future classic. Always going to be a staple of the FPS genre.
2432,moxxi
2433,ye amazing
2434,"I am reviewing the Mac Version, I will not going into the detail of the game, the game itself it's good. I am very surprised how well this game running on Apple silicon, feels like native, run on native resolution and still runs very smooth.

The Mac port is very good on this one, so if you are Apple Mac user and looking for a games to play with but kinda not sure will this game runs well on your mac especially ARM powered macs like M1 M2 stuff, this game will runs great on your Apple Silicon Mac.

Tested on M1 MacBook Pro (2020) running MacOS Monterey 12.4 from External Drive.

2440,Good game
2441,"I love this game, it is so addicting, but some of the challenges you are gonna really have to want i.e would be the circle of slaughter quests but it is great game with a great story"
2442,"Quite a nice game overall. Just what you'd expect from a looter shooter. This game might be 10 years old but it's still fun nonetheless, the only thing being outdated jokes.
Personally, navigating is confusing sometimes and it feels as if the game isn't very well polished. Sometimes it's annoying but the gameplay does make it worthwhile. 
If you're planning on playing through once only, the GOTY edition should be enough.
However, the handsome collection does have DLCs (which I haven't gone through all of them yet), and more levels (for replaying over and over again.
Only get it when on sale, I just thought 92% was a really great deal xD"
2443,this is the shit right there man

2459,"Super amazing game! I've already played it multiple times with a different character each time. There are 4 from the base game with 2 more additional characters from the Mechromancer and Psycho packs. Each character has their own unique abilities (from locking an enemy in place to summoning a huge, floating, robotic torso with claws that can also shoot a powerful laser from its eyes). My favorite would be the gunzerker, Salvador. I'd never thought I would enjoy dual wielding a Rocket Launcher with a Sniper rifle before.

The gameplay is mostly shooting (which is a lot of fun!!) but occasionally the game tries to throw a curve ball and makes you jump platforms. Enemy variants are mostly the same with a different skin or look depending on the location the game is taking place. The game also has these super hard bosses called Raid Bosses which have their own gimmicks as well, but shouldn't be too annoying once you know what to do for each.

The looting part of this looter shooter shouldn't be troublesome until you get to the hardest difficulty available, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, which makes you change your load out every 4 to 5 levels so that you could actually kill a normal enemy. The grind for certain equipment would be eternal, especially if you're trying to get the perfect equipment for each character. If you're achievement hunting like me, then this is entirely optional as you can acquire most achievements for this game on the normal difficulty.

This game is super fun, especially when it's played with other people. You can bond with them by doing missions, killing raid bosses, or arguing over a weapon with great stats for over an hour."

2462,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
2463,Game is mostly monotonous and you just going somewhere shooting and progressing on story that's it. Game just keep repeating itself but Tiny Tina's DLC is the best one and better than main game. Overall good game i do recommended.

2472,good game
2473,"A classic, you already know about BL2... it's a shooty game with light RPG elements.

Personally I think the Borderlands series isn't going to hold up well as the years go by, the game was awesome in it's heyday but I think it's really underwhelming in 2022. I look back on it with nostalgia but every time I load it up it can't hold my attention for longer than 10 or 15 minutes."
2474,"Do you like guns, do you like explosions, do you like EVEN MORE GUNS that make EVEN BIGGER EXPLOSIONS.
 then this is the game for you.
In all seriousness I played this game a whole hell of a lot on console and its the bomb here too."

2483,"This game is excellent. Purely the best in the series, where the first Borderlands game is second.

I don't know where to start? It has an amazing story! Even greater gameplay! Awesome Voicelines! - apart from annoying Claptrap I really enjoy playing it alone or with friends, which is even better :D

I highly recommend you play this game, even though it is NEARLY 10 YEARS OLD ALREADY, so don't expect too much comparing it to todays games. Back in 2013/2014 this was peak game.

10/10."

Borderlands 2 seems like a VERY good game. It seems relatively well made,  and the mechanics are tight. The story, from what i've experienced is slightly interesting, but doesn't captivate me."

2548,"I greatly enjoyed the Borderlands series when it first made its debut. Back then unlike now I was a strictly console player, so I missed out on a lot. So when I started PC gaming this was one of my MUST have games. And of course I had to go all in, as any endearing fan would, purchasing all the DLCs I could nab ^_^  Its a wildly additive game; one of the few I would recommend to any and everyone."
2549,Haven't touched this game in years but back when I played it had no FOV/aspect ratio settings and gave me severe nausea.

Additionally, you can create and specialize your characters as you want. I recommend this game to anybody.

2569,Borderlands 2 is the first game I played in this series and i still think it holds up amazingly. The replayability of this game is near unparalleled and I love coming back to it on occasion
2570,"Top notch story telling, and the greatest villain in video game history."
2571,"got it on discount, all for less than 20 USD,  have a lot of content, the classes have personality and the coop its great. you have to take into account theres a lot of fetch and grind, I suggest to play it with friends if possible.
I play warframe on a regular bases so this game feels like a great in between games filler from when you need a break or want to play something aside your main game.

2591,"Play this with friend is just another satisfaction i've never felt in the most games (tho i played with random players out there). Not to compete, not to show-off."
2592,"Loved this on Xbox when it first came out, and love it on PC today."
2593,I Have bought this game and the handsome collection 3 times now. And replayed it 5. Its the best if you can manage to get some friends to help you.

2595,Buy it. Play it.
2596,fun
2597,"game good monke love
"
2598,Unbelievably Mediocre the combat revolves around basically a bunch of shooting a little bit of getting behind cover and a little bit of abillities the enemy variety is very low with most enemies being 7 types with different health pools damage types and amounts of damage. The characters have personality but the dialogue and cutscenes are sometimes unbearable. The only reason to play this game is to have some brain dead fun with friends or if u just want something to grind for a little while. overall a solid 6 out of 10
2599,yes
2600,Really fun game
2601,"cool guns, fun dialogue, cool graphics"
2602,Borderlands 2 more like Borderlands Boo

2606,YES ! it's a very fun game.

2608,I burned a short man alive and he liked it.
2609,My favorite of all the Borderlands games.  I have over 100 hours on steam and soo many more on Xbox. It is a fun game to get together with friends and do a play through every once in a while.

2616,Lots of guns to choose from and is a very detailed gun. Many different ways you can go about pursuing the storyline.
2617,I would recommend this game but I prefer BL3
2618,game is fire
2619,"good game
"
2620,"The gold standard of RPGs as well as FPSs. What more could anyone say? If you hate bathroom humor, maybe not for you. Otherwise, if you're a gamer of any stripe, you will LOVE this game."
2621,"borderlands 2 review 4/5

borderlands is one of the best co-op games ive played, even single player for that matter. the gameplay consists of you getting a quest from someone, do what they tells you, return to the guy and receive your reward and you do this for the entire game but that dosen't get repetitive because every mission is completely different and unique all with there own jokes and little story's. while you do these missions you kill enemies and pick up there loot witch might be better then yours. the loot in this game consist of shield guns and class mods all of which enhance your character making you stronger.
"
2622,very good all characters are fun to play and guns are fun to use
2623,"Decent sequel, but I remember having more fun in BL1 with my friend. We couldnt finish this one."
2624,I only played the main story and I can only say: masterpiece
2625,guns.
2626,"Borderlands 2 is one of the greatest games of all time.

and i dont just say that.

its the game series which spawned the looter shooter genre.

not to mention the fact that BL2 is gigantic, you spend at the very least 140 hours on 1 single playthrough, inlcluding every DLC.

add to the fact that there are 6 characters with which you can play with, and all of them have their own unique abilities, so you can play the game 6 times over, in 6 different ways.

the game came out in 2012 i believe, its still popular and beloved, as a matter of fact, they released another DLC a week or so ago.

nearly 7 years after the initial game release.

speaking of DLC, the best one of the game imo is Tiny Tina's assualt on dragon keep.

nearly everyone that played the game agrees on that.

its so big, if they added 20 orso more missions, it could have been sold as a stand alone game.

that is how massive BL2 truly is.

and BL3 was recently announced, it was stated that BL3 is even larger in scope and storyline than BL2.

if you want to enjoy a quality

storyline single campaign game, BL2 is your game.

its the only game that comes to mind.

i used to be of the opinion that the Witcher 3, Skyrim and Fallout NV held the trophy for greatest single player games of all time.

but BL2 isnt just a contender, it might just take the whole cake."

2633,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."
2634,BL2 is the best of the series by far.

2648,"1.Shooting is BAD compared to the first game
2.Jack was cool
3. Dlc Repeat Jacks Villain type too much
4.Shooting is REALLY bad kinda unnatural thats the best i can explain
5. Game was funny and i very much enjoyed the dialog when i could hear it
6. The quests go from explaining good reason to go said quest or giving funny dialog to ""why dont you go kill this thing :D""
i like this game but since roughly 90% of this game is shooting stuff i cant give it a thumbs up with the weird shooting.

not really my cup of tea anymore but since i spend a lot of hours on ps3 playing this game its really good if u have a friend to play with"
2662,"Still a fantastic game even 10 years later! The game isn't perfect as it has problems with UVHM scaling being ass, getting OP levels is ridiculously grindy to get, balance issues, and a lag in COOP. But despite some of these shortfalls, there's a reason people still actively play this game to this day. Its a loot shooter done right, you have to farm to get some of the good weapons and it feels great when they drop but its not so rare that it becomes tedious, unlike in BL3 where you shit legendaries left and right and has no feeling of being rewarding. 

This is game is the definition of when you and your friends want to play a coop game, so you start a new run in his game even though you beat it with the same friends 3 years ago :)"

2674,It is a wonderful experience to get although my one complaint is that the Commander Lilith DLC does not come with this bundle and isn't free for owners of the Handsome collection like it was on its release
2675,"this is the best borderlands i have ever played in my life, I played all the other borderlands games and wonderlands on my Xbox one and none of them even compete with borderlands 2. for anyone wanting to play a game that's first person and can grab loot from chest or killing your enemies, this game is perfect for you then. I hope one day, gearbox can make another borderlands game with the borderlands 2 gameplay."
2676,"Good fun, if you like shooting and looting, which I do, especially with friends. The fact the bad guys are so charismatic too, and the main characters too, SOMEHOW the barely ever speaking player characters are too!"
2677,game is good
2678,"I would 100%, 10/10 recommend this game. This game is equal parts funny and bloody. If you like action packed games, I'd say this might be the game for you. I love the art style of the characters and I love the game play. Each character has their own set of skills and the game is more fun when played with DLC's (which, might I add, tend to be on a mighty fine sale most of the time... Definitely worth it) and at least 1 friend. It is fun to play by yourself but I think it's more enjoyable with at least 1 friend."
2679,"its cool
"
2680,"came back to this after several years, enjoy it a lot more than the other borderlands games, 3 included. Handsome Jack will forever be one of my favourite video game characters, voice actor is superb."

2690,"The game is fine if you grew up with the series as I have.  If you want to play this game because of the hype?  Don't.  While this game has plentiful side quests that mask the slow progression of the game and frequent ammo shortages,  other entries in the series will suit you fine.  When you get to the 3rd playthrough and unlock the real potential of the classes, you may wonder why the game wasn't this much fun on the 1st go.  Ammo Regenerating Sparkly Weapons certainly helped, as did Chain Lightning Grenades - all provided by DLCs rather than the base game.

Again,  as someone who grew up with the series, this is a good game that better games have supplanted. BL2 is not the be-all-to-end-all.

I ended the game and I didn't get to the bottom of my skill tree. I never once felt like I was properly playing Krieg.
If you like exchanging your time for numbers going up in an extremely slow way that isn't satisfactory, and a campaign that sucks absolute balls on how shallow and a nothing burger it is, play this game.
It has big time progression issues. You're supposed to play for like 100 hours more after the campaign ends or something. Bugger off."

2791,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

2833,"A good game with lots of ""features"""
2834,"So, where to start?

As a big fan of the original, there were aspects of #2 that put me off a bit when I tried it out back in the day. Some time went by and eventually I decided to give it a second shot. I guess the minor issues I had were no longer important because the second time I got sucked in and couldn't put it down. 

[b]For the Uninitiated[/b]

The Borderlands games are looter shooters. That means there is a heavy emphasis on grabbing the best, shiniest stuff you can find to replace your old stuff as you level up. You get a few classes to choose from (more with DLC), and each one has various skill trees for the player to choose from. It's like if Diablo had a baby with a FPS game; this is sort of what you would get. I have a feeling that the entire series was inspired by Diablo FPS hybrids like Hellgate London.

Gunplay is great, and the old styalised approach to the aesthetics mean the game still looks alright long after its release - the same goes for the first game. 

There is a story and it's a fantastic one to boot; I often see folks praising a plot while forgetting the most important factor of all: It's execution. Or as the old saying goes, it's not what you write about, but how you write it. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better example of that in another game. Borderlands 2 has a 'main' plot, but as things progress it becomes less and less important as the games main antagonist progressively ups his game in his attempts to stop you and kill all of your friends. He's an awful, horrible man but the game actually manages to help the player understand a bit of the mind set of villains who truly believe that they are the heroes of their own stories.

My only con for the game would be the loot; much like the first game, #2 suffers from drowning the player in garbage pickups, where eventually only legendaries or super-high randoms matter. Everything else gets immediately sold without a second look. This single factor is the main reason folks praise Borderlands 3 so much. For me, meh, I've gotten over it long ago, and I'm okay with keeping an eye for legendaries or jut high stat items, but it is a valid criticism of this game and #1. Otherwise everything else in this game shines, and with the vastly superior story to #3 and the huge amount of DLC content, if you're on the fence about whether to get this or 3, well, you can't go wrong with either but I'd recommend this over #3 any day. #3's lack lustre story and characters means you will have to rely on the loot factor and gun play to keep you entertained, because nothing else really will. Borderlands 2 has you hating the main antagonist so much that the idea of putting a bullet between his eyes eventually has you frothing at the mouth in anticipation. Can't say there are many games out there that wrote their bad guy this well.

This game has something for everyone, being accessible to all, allowing for seamless co-op and replay-ability to your heart's content.

The story in the main campaign is one of the best I have ever experienced, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is even better, with Handsome Jack being one of the best fictional villains ever created. 

This game has so much to offer, in terms of story, gameplay, co-op, discovery and so much more that it falls nothing short of a 10/10."

2947,"Probably the best looter shooter ever made. Gameplay is top tier undoubtedly, but what I loved the most about this game is how simple yet deep its mechanics were. On the surface, you shoot, use your abilities once in a while to get out of tricky situations and that's it. The game is very easy to pick up and understand. While being simple for casual players, it's got stuff for hardcore audiences too like Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and raid bosses. I have over 80 hours on just a single character (there's like 7 of them) and I still have 2 DLCs left to complete. The amount of content available for the money is simply unreal."
2948,its gud

2964,its good and fun
2965,"Even with Borderlands 3, in my not-so-humble opinion, Borderlands 2 is the pinnacle of the franchise.
"
2966,"100/10 great experience. Game-play is smooth and easy to pick up while giving plenty of opportunity for challenge. Missions are fun and there are PLENTY of them to complete. As a completionist, this game really gives me a run for my money. With multiple characters each allowing for a different play-style, this game has a high value in regards to replay-ability. My favorite aspect of this game is the seemingly endless kinds of guns. I found myself constantly switching out my guns and laughing at many of the names. I absolutely adored the feeling of playing this game. Jumping felt floaty but not OP and shooting was smooth and just fun. Sometimes I wouldn't be in a fight but would just run, jump, and shoot just for the fun of it.  

It is fun to change up the look of your character but it isn't super extensive. The art style is wonderfully reminiscent of comic books. And the visual effects are great especially for the time of the game's release; they hold up pretty well today. The music hits hard and fits in with the feel of the game, making you feel really awesome during the fights. 

If you love flawed but fun characters, this game is for you. I loved all the characters even the ones I was meant to hate. Except for the fire themed boss at the beginning; he can jump off a microwave please and thank you. Wacky and eccentric can be used to describe each character, and I loved hearing all the dialogue. Everyone in this game is a massive jerk, but I came to love each one. 

So if you have loads of time to kill and any of these things pique your interest, PLEASE give this game a go. You won't regret it!"
2967,Fun looter shooter from the 2010's
2968,It was okay
2969,"I love everything about this game. The guns, the gameplay, the art, the humor, and the ever charismatic and funny Handsome Jack."
2970,they have guns in this game kinda neat
2971,all borderlands are so damn good
2972,yes good game yes
2973,TORGUE
2974,"First Person Shooters is generally a genre I'm not all that fond of.   Yet this game (a full decade after release) is still a go-to title to play either as single player, or have complete mayhem with your friends.  Graphics still look great, gameplay and controls are tight, hilarious and memorable characters, good story, incredible villain, great RPG elements and skill trees, funny outfits and customization, infinitely replayable,  DLC is fantastic as well.  I'm trying to think of a negative........Ummm, Zero's special move kind of sucks compared to the others.....so there's one thing.  I'm grasping at straws here.

 Still easily the most enjoyable FPS game I've ever played, and one of my favorite games ever.  Again, that's coming from a game genre I generally don't even like all that much.   This thing has aged like a top-tier scotch and just never gets old.  If there's a better FPS out there, I can't wait to play it.  I hope the devs are still getting royalty checks off of this masterpiece....."

2988,"Let's just say, hypothetically Borderlands 2 is a game."
2989,"this game is very good for my autistic baby brain.

10/10 would play every when ever I play"
2990,"I am not what I, myself, would consider a fps gamer. I prefer other types of games. So this was very,very, different from what I usually play. But it’s fun. Seriously, the way I actually, consciously have to apply logic to this game is fascinating to me. I need to consider what types of guns I like, fast-slow, more damage or fast reload. It's different but fun. And more engaging than I though.
And the art style! While a bit dated, it looks fun and fits the genera perfectly! It's good- the story- sorry only chapter 7, is alright so far, not the most driven but it’s also not supposed to. 
It's fun to play without stressing out over making hard decision and just have some fun time running around and feeling like a badass- hopefully. Maybe. I have my moments, alright!"
2991,"i have been playing borderlands 2 sense it released and i loved it i just bought it on my new laptop and it is so much fun im in memory lane playing this 4 years later is it like going back to RE4 i love this game so much stupid comedy soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many guns and a lot of fun 10 out of 10

3027,one of my favorites
3028,"Who doesn't love this gem of a game? I played this constantly on my Xbox 360 and tried to grind to get every achievement.
The story is brilliant. A funny antagonist Handsome Jack that always keep things entertaining and fresh. So many unique characters that are so hard to hate but so easy to like. Nothing about the story feels dull and they really nailed the nail in with story.

The environment is always changing. One minute you're in The Tundra where it's icy and cold, but 30 minutes later and you're in The Dust, a desert wasteland with new characters to meet and new quests to complete.

Side quests are unique and are always fun to complete (well most of them, there are a LOT of them) with so many different rewards it's hard not to touch these side quests

Obviously the guns, and shields, and grenades, and relics, and class mods. I probably don't need to explain much here. But literally millions of different items. All different, all unique and are one of Borderlands biggest features. Most of my hours come from grinding certain bosses. (The Bunker being my favorite(But damn only a 93% Sham)) If you like to grind and are wanting the best loot this shooter is for you for sure.

Lastly, the DLC's are so much fun. I thoroughly enjoyed every single Borderlands 2 DLC. The worst one IMO is Hammerlocks Hunt but still even that DLC had some great moments. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is an absolute must and if you get the game it has to be the GOTY Edition. It's more than worth it.

My scores-
Gameplay- 8/10
Story- 9.5/10
Graphics- 8/10 (if you like the style)
DLC- 8.5/10
Better With Friends? Yes (still fun solo)"
3029,"very good, but ultra good if played with friends."
3030,just loads of fun
3031,Hello! - Steve
3032,"Best borderlands game. Pearl balance is unfortunate and should be similar to Borderlands 1 but its too late to fix balance now, maybe add some new guns for a remaster. 72, op 8 should be max lvl. Hopefully a remaster is in the works that implements improvements such as: auto eridium pickup, farmable mission rewards, skippable cutscenes, teleport to car, fast travel from anywhere, legendary/pearl/effervescent drop notifications, and the lvl decrease to 72. Mechromancer could use a skill rework to allow for builds that dont have to utilize anarchy but as I said, its probably too late to fix balance."

I mean theres some bugs like the enemy just fricking float (it scared me to death) but its hilarious. I'll give it a 9.5./10"
3048,absolute perfection 100 % get worth the price absolute masterpiece 100/100
3049,"Bought it on console when it came out -- found the writing unfunny and horribly irritating, the voice acting and visual design merely abrasive when it didn't slide all the way into being directly unpleasant, the reward mechanics unengaging, and the gunplay mildly diverting but not particularly special. Bought it on PC years later at a huge discount, and discovered to my astonishment that I liked the gunplay a little better on PC."

3079,"Second and arguably ""the best"" release of the franchise. If you like any of the other incarnations of this franchise then this is a ""must own"". If you havent played any or owned any of the other versions then get this one first. It will tell you whether its a genre you will like, is slightly more fun than the first one, has a DLC (assault on dragons keep) that will tell you if you will like the new ""Wonderlands"" release, but it has a completely different theme than the original, this game, or Borderlands 3."
3080,"This my second Favorite Borderlands, Buy The Handsome Collection for 9 buck when Sale u got Borderlands 2 Full DLC and Borderlands Pre Sequel Full DLC, Kinda Worth it tbh. Btw i found World Best Lasagna Recipe(12 Servings/Portions).

Ingredients
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
¾ pound lean ground beef
½ cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
½ cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions
Step 1
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Step 2
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Step 3
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Step 4
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
Step 5
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving."

3095,"This game is unbelievably fun. It's comedic, builds upon the first game as its sequel, does the looting system very well, has a balanced and fair gameplay loop up until UVHM, and will keep you occupied or intrigued with elements of the game for hours upon hours. Been playing this game since I was ten, and I've probably totaled over a thousand hours between Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. In 2022, the game still retains its fun factor and will keep you wanting more. This game is the peak of 2010's looter-shooter era of gaming."

- The amount of content in this game is amazing.
If you've ever wanted to cross the ""Border"" of total destruction, then you absolutely have to play this game.
- You can choose between 4 characters. (you can also choose one from dlc).
Each character has their own unique personality and playstyle.
Axton: The Commando: Axton is able to deploy a Turret, a mounted gun that can be upgraded over-time with skill points
Zer0: The Assassin: Zer0 is able to deploy a decoy of himself and enter an invisible state.
Maya: The Siren: Maya's skill gives her the ability to suspend foes into the air, leaving them defenceless and immobile
Salvador: The Gunzerker: Salvador is able to dual wield two guns (of any type) at the same time.
The dialogue, or at least the jokes, are outdated, (what else can you expect in a game that's almost a decade old), but still pretty funny.
- Bloody lot of  funny and epic missions from main campaing and dlc. (There's a mission titled ""Shoot This Guy In The Face"" where you have to shoot a guy in the face). Pretty simple huh?
But to finish this game u have:
""Collect 139,377 brown rocks
Defeat Ug-Thak, Lord of Skags
Pilfer lost staff of Mount Schuler
Defeat Destroyer of Worlds
Dance, dance, baby!""
- Amazing NPC characters like Tina, Claptrap, Mr.Torgue, Roland, etc.
- Weapons are very unique, modifier to them, and one well-rolled gun can end up being a gun the player uses for a very long time, (Kill things to collect guns, Collect guns to kill things). Best part is, enemies will react to the type of damage they're being hit.
-(Bonus) Here is a quick introduction guide for new players:
Find gun.
Shoot enemies.
Get better gun.
Shoot bigger enemies.
Get even better gun.
Kill a boss.
Get a super gun.
- Borderlands 2 is in my opinion the best game in the series.
It got more loot, more explosions and more badasses.
and that is pretty much all you need in a Borderlands game.
I recommend playing this game with friends to do more destruction."
3112,very niceeee
3113,"Best game series to ever exist, I encouraged everyone to give it a shot and see if you like it."
3114,funny fun and dlc grand
3115,"before i played this game i had no friends, no girlfriend, socially awkward, and a disappointment to my family.  

Nothing has changed, great game though would always play"

"
3125,Very good time with friends
3126,"the amount of content in this game is amazing, nine hours in and I'm with a friend, grinding small midgets that jump out of cardboard boxes and drop very overpowered and diverse weapons. There's apparently 2 extra difficulty modes with extra loot and more content. Crazy good value especially in a pack and on sale."
3127,one of my favorite run and guns probably my first but i know i have like an hour but thats because i just switched to pc and bought the handsome collection otherwise i would probably have over 100 days of Gameplay. so i defenitly recommend this game
3128,great humor great story lots of guns lots of shooting to do what more could you ask

3135,"Honestly you don't start truly enjoying this game until your 2nd or 3rd character, easily the most re-playable Borderlands game. Allegiance/challenge playthroughs and dedicated legendary drops is what keeps me playing."

"
3152,"From what I played it's great, but I need to play more of this. However, from the little I've played, it's a really good game - but I do recognize the flaw in my review that I have not played much of this. However I seek to rectify such mistake by playing more of the god damned game. 

But from what I've played, it's a great game, I highly recommend it. I played the first one a lot on the Xbox 360, that was a good game, this is a good game, maybe, probably, I don't know. I haven't played it much, so I guess I should play it.

I think I'll go play it now."

3160,This game ruined my mind.
3161,"I first played this game back on the 360, Twas some fun early years of life. The replay-ability is really good, the grinding isnt too much of a hassle to beat the game (level 80 OP 10) and the story and humor are both awesome, all around a great game for anyone thats bored of the classic cash grab type games *cough* borderlands 3 *cough*"
3162,tis gbood
3163,"Certified classic game, even though the game is super old i'd say it is one of the best looter shooter out there.

Despite the QoL of Borderlands 3 and its gunplay, the story and post game mechanics is just a lot more enjoyable."
3164,Yes
3165,fun

3169,i hate my friends
3170,best
3171,"is good
"
3172,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?
Probably one of the best games ever made. The mix of good game mechanics and hilarious writing make it a joy to play through. Very rarely do I sink this much time into a game, and I plan on coming back for more long after this has been written.
The first play through solo will be great, but I could imagine the solo replay value dropping significantly, especially if you are a completionist.
The true experience shines through when you have people to play with. The character voice lines during battle are amazing, and higher levels as well as New Game + will require increasing amounts of coordination and strategy.
Also easily playable even without having played the prequel games. If you haven't already, just jump right in. I'm excited for you, because you're in for a treat."

3187,nice
3188,Playing solo pose it's own challenges since most of the bosses are easier to defeat in multiplayer mode. But it's fun nonetheless
3189,destiny 2 if it was a good game
3190,i bored lands
3191,"hmm. borderlands 2 feels like a post-colonial wild west war fantasy put in a pink sand box.
i think it is a bit childish and conservative.. conservative in a pink way:
like watching fox news with tank girl grafix, cover the brown, so that it looks pink..
but John Wayne in a punk rocker outfit is still John Wayne with a pink hat..not funny, also not frightening,
but just the biting establishment cowboy telling a mediocre fantasy story..
I  better liked playing Rambro in Broforce, because it is already an oversized figure to laugh about.
or brutal games like doom for the reason of simplicity: you don’t need to fight there with thin story, 
moralism, nihilism, or fight with economics (because there is no shopping center for weapons in hell, but just  monsters that keep you entertained )
 in borderlands2 you are kept busy running around to collect gear, weapons..
or you get money out of boxes to  buy weapons in shopping centers for weapons..
you get them until you find out that you need better weapons, and you run another round to get more..
 bloody economics, burning corpses and bad jokes. hm.

but maybe i get old and expect too much of gaming being just a casual gamer anyway..
i will gamble around with borderlands2 a bit more and try to give it a chance, we'll see.."
3192,booty cheeks play something like  vampire survivors for just 2.99$
3193,"A couple of points if its first time playing Borderlands 2:

> Yes, the first boss is really hard
> Yes, side missions are important to gain level ups/peaks/better guns
> Yes, the music does get intense in big battles which makes it better
> Yes, you will have a favourite gun and then 30 mins later realize the gun was actually terrible and you have better guns that would get the job done so much quicker that whole time
> No, the guy on the cover of all the Borderlands games is not your friend. He is the most annoying, frustrating, craziest son of a bitch that you will be happy to see when you need a kill for 'Fight for your life'

Takes a while to get use to the handling of guns and understanding what to do but I'm having a lot of fun with it. Story doesn't interrupt gameplay so its pretty much go in and shoot"

[b] Only child, [u] no friends [/u] that [strike] I [/strikethrough] own the game to play with [/b] or anything like that though. I wish I could play it and experience some of the co-op. Games are always more fun with friends. So I recommend this game to all! Partly sooo that I can play with someone and beat it together? LOL. No really tho, it is a great game the first of any borderlands I have tried. 

Just got the 3rd one too, the first wasn't on sale so I skipped it and read about the lore and watched a vid about it as well lol. I am just saying I know it would be more fun with friends, its got fun characters and great game/gun play makes for fun play in my books."

We defeated the devilishly good looking Handsome Jack, freeing Buttstallion from her seemingly unending servitude. But it would not be my last foray on Pandora. Nay, I returned, not once, not twice, but many, many times as if I were an addict returning to his favorite spot to score his drug of choice. And now, years and years later, I return, once again."

3319,"This review is actually for Borderlands 3 cause I don't have it on Steam.

Borderlands 3 is just a clone of the game Apex Legends. So many of the gameplay features and abilities stem from this game and are plagiarized by this relatively mediocre game. First off, the abilities. I tried playing Zane Flynt, and his abilities are basically exact replicas of abilities from Apex. First off, his decoy. Zane can make a decoy of himself for a period of time. I wonder where that's from! Oh, wait, that's Mirage's ability. Not original! On top of that, his personality isn't even different! They knew that they were plagiarizing so they hired a voice actor with an accent and payed him to make even worse jokes than Mirage. Yet I and everyone else who's played Borderlands 3 and Apex Legends caught them in the act. Next, Zane's other ability, a deployable shield. Hmm, doesn't that sound familiar? Maybe it's cause it already exists in another game, Apex Legends, in the form of Newcastle's tactical! It is the exact same, except the devs decided to spice it up a bit and allow you to shoot through the shield. Well, at least there's some originality. Oh wait, never mind, that's [i]Rampart's[/i] ability! They may as well have copied and pasted the game files from Apex and just called it Borderlands 3! Furthermore, Zane has a deployable drone, much like that of Crypto's drone. Except they must have checked Apex's game files for a future Crypto buff and based the drone off of that, so that people wouldn't suspect anything. However, I will not be tricked that easily! Next up, gun shields! Whose famously powerful ability is to wield a gun shield while aiming down sight? Gibraltar! Except the Borderlands 3 devs thought that they could trick us by putting the gun shields [i]on[/i] guns instead of being attached to a specific character. Nice try, Gearbox. In conclusion, Borderlands 3 is just a copy of Apex Legends and no one should ever play it. Play Apex instead.

Now, I have not finished Borderlands 3 nor have I played all the characters, so I will have even more examples of the theft Borderlands 3 has committed against Apex in the near future.

PS - Don't listen to anyone who says Borderlands 3 is like Sekiro. They are lunatics."

3351,"This is one of the best games ever made imo, there is thousands of hours worth of content here, with all the DLC you can level each of the six characters up to level 80, and then 10 OP levels, there's MILLIONS of guns to collect (yes, really, there's that many).

Borderlands 2 builds on what the first game introduced to gaming and is still the gold standard for looter shooters."

3376,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.

Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards. And i ran out of space"

3397,"This is the most balanced and fleshed out experience of the borderlands franchise, and easily has hundreds of hours of content. The loot is extremely varied and has a ton of interesting interactions with the different classes. This results in a very strong theory crafting experience that is fun from the first playthrough to the hundredth. The difficulty also encourages build diversity and experimentation by forcing you to start on normal mode, then forces you to learn the actual mechanics by the time you get to UVHM. Unfortunately, the addition of OP10 difficulty kind of throws things out of wack, and really limits build diversity at end game, but there are mods to restore the game to OP8 as the cap, or you can choose to not engage with the OP levels and just enjoy base UVHM difficulty which may be a good compromise depending on how much difficulty you are looking for. All in all, this is the benchmark for looter shooters, and none have really measured up to it in my opinion, and with the sales that come around for the handsome collection every so often, it is one of the best deals in gaming. Strongly recommend."

3421,Heh 69....I played this game on console for basically 10 years now I played the closed beta for the game then on a older steam account and have continued to support the franchise since day one have played all the games and would recommend them to anyone games newer ie: BL3 & TTW will take time to be masterpieces and will become amazing games as they are. The franchise has a love that not a lot of games capture anymore. So i would recommend trying it you never know you might replay the game even with 9000 hours lol. That's a lot of time but hey I still love them just like day one and you will beat the game faster each time. Btw as I am writing this today is my birthday may 23rd Have a great day everyone. :)

3426,"I used to love this game as a kid and played it a lot on the PS3. But coming back to it as an adult I realize just how much is wrong with this game. You can cut out like 25% of this game's ""content"" and it would just be a superior product. The game doesn't need challenges. The game doesn't need achievements. The game just needed more of what everybody wanted. Guns. And good gunplay. As it stands however I am incapable of having fun with the game anymore.

PS: I realize that every Borderlands games have the same issues. And as such I won't be buying any of the other ones because of that."

3437,"I literally got it for free and I don't like it. The story didn't pull me in, despite the well acted characters, the art style is master class cel shading but it doesn't quite fit the kind of FPS it wants to be. It wanted to be Destiny 2 before there was a Destiny. Looter shooter paradise, but I can't stand it. The highly frequent change of weapons and equipment is far too fast and leaves players with weapons they are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with, unless you love this kind of game and are used to it by your 10th replay. Controls are fine. Upgrade tree is fair. But most else just keeps me from justifying putting time into finding fun in this series. This game most of all."

It's not because of the gameplay, but because of the known and consistent 'Out of video memory' issue that has plagued this game for years and that the developer didn't ever bother to fix.... My idea of fun is not to have to replay a whole section because of these constant crashes. Playing around with the video configuration does nothing. I am running the game with a RTX 3090, so the video card is definitely not the issue.

Also, the collision detection in this game is crap.... Running into a pebble in the ground is the equivalent of running into a wall. You seriously have to jump over a tiny rock.... pathetic."

3581,"Ok, I've played this game for like two and a half hours so why bother leaving a negative review? The answer is simple: If your game is bad and the player isn't having any fun, that is showing from the first hour. Two hours into the game and I'm literally so fed up with this game, that I feel it deserves it. 

Let me shout the basic problem that is obvious from the first minute: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME SOLO. IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED SOLO.

The game does a lot of things right: It has a lot of character, it stands out from other looter shooters. The graphics still hold up because they are stylized and unique. The quirkiness of the characters and the funny dialogs. The lots of interesting loot and the core gameplay of the first borderland

BUT this game is designed to be play coop, and playing solo feels like playing it on super hard mode. It's not that it has too many enemies, but too many different types of enemies at once that hinder EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR STRATEGIES. 
Let me give you an example: You go to a place and you start shooting and the bad guys shoot you back. In NO TIME your shield is down because the snipers shoot you from afar, so you take cover. AT THE SAME TIME, Psychos rush onto you, literally draging you out of cover. Normally, with a party you would have support, but now you're so you are alone. You switch into something for close combat, which renders you useless because even with shotguns and grenade launchers the enemies take to many hits because IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED COOP. So you kill the psychos, barely alive, health does not regenerate, everybody is shooting and you die. A lot. 

So the progress I made was not by skill but by sheer persistence, dying and reviving and dying and reviving. 
It's a good game, but not  for me and IT SHOULD have been calibrated for solo action like ALL the other looter shooters out there."

3594,"If you ever plan on making a looter-shooter, take notes from this game.

Visuals still hold up, for the most part. Going for a cel-shaded look helped mask this game's age quite well, at least for the most part. There's gonna be a few chunky textures, but it shouldn't stick out too bad.

Each character has their own unique personality and playstyle, with diverse enough ways to shoot the bad guys that people forget that, at the end of the day, they are just shooting bullets at anything that moves. Zer0 snipes from a distance, Axton blows shit up, Maya inflicts various status effects, and Salvador's literally too angry to die. Best part is, this is just one playstyle for each of these characters. Zer0 is as effective as a sniper as he is in melee; it all comes down to how you build your character.

Weapons are wholly unique, even the ones without any unique modifier to them, and one well-rolled gun can end up being a gun the player uses for a very long time. Each manufacturer has their own gimmick, something BL 3 would take even further, yet that feeling of each gun being unique still remains, to the point that you may recognize some guns having parts from other manufacturers, leading to interesting combinations between the characters abilities, and the players guns. Best part is, enemies will react to the type of damage they're being hit, from being disgusted that they're covered in Slag (my favorite voiceline remains from the Goliaths begging you not to swap guns after slagging them) to screaming in agony if they're set on fire.

Enemies pose a constant threat to the player, unless severely overleveled. That being said, severely overleveled enemies can still be taken down through the tried and true practice of moar dakka. Though there are certainly easier and harder moments, you'll never find yourself feeling bored or overwhelmed. A huge part of this is the Fight for your Life system, effectively giving you near infinite second chances, assuming you can continue killing at increasingly rapid rates, as each time you enter this mode, your bleedout timer decreases faster.

The dialogue, or at least the jokes, are outdated. Then again, what else can you expect in a game that's almost a decade old at this point? (I mean, it has references to double rainbow) In a way, it's a time capsule of how things were, with there being a lot of subtle references and puns that are either way too on the nose or hard to get for some people. Still, I can guarantee you'll at least have a good amount of chuckles, if not full out laughs, throughout the game. And when it's time to get serious, this game can get serious.

Overall you have an amazing and charming game here. This game set a standard that no other game has managed to achieve since; even with Borderlands 3's improved gunplay. Likewise, it has also set a standard in the industry, one that very few games, if any, can even hope to reach.

If you plan on playing this game, I implore you to play through it several times on the increased difficulties. You'd be surprised just how much a difference TVHM or UVHM can make."

3602,"This game is generally better than the first Borderlands in pretty much every way aside from the atmosphere - which isn't that important. Anybody that enjoyed the first one will certainly enjoy this as well, and I would still recommend it to most people even as their first entry. If you are interested in story however it does draw a decent amount on the first game especially in terms of characters so you'd want to start there.

If you're a more casual player and would play through the game one, maybe two or three times on one or two characters, and aren't too worried about getting to max level or playing end game content I would say this game is fantastic and easily recommended. If you are a more hardcore player and would want to do endgame content and fully complete the game, I'm not sure I would recommend it as much. 

The endgame, including a fairly substantial grind to reach max level, requires you to play on the hardest difficulty (UVHM) after completing the game two other times first, all on one character. (I truly don't understand how people slog through getting more than 1 character to max level, I barely managed one.) On this final difficulty, the enemies always scale with your level, so grinding to get a few levels will not make things easier, and in fact will probably make it harder since your weapons will be less effective. In addition, all enemies have 4 times the max health of the other difficulties, and also have a large amount of constant health regeneration. In my opinion, this makes the game pretty un-fun since it essentially requires you to use only the best weapons, and to min-max your skill build to one of very few options that will work. You're also pretty much required to use Slag to kill things, which means either switching weapons constantly or getting certain skills that tend to only apply to when your Action Skill is available. This all combines to take away a lot of what is fun about the game in the first two playthroughs, which is mainly the guns and loot. You can often find new guns, shields etc that you can try out and some will be fun and you'll use for a bit. On UVHM, you pretty much have to use a very small subset of unique/legendary weapons to be effective, which removes a lot of the fun of opening chests and getting random loot. In addition, a majority of the best weapons and items will require you to farm various bosses to get them. So you either have to struggle through without them, or farm the same item countless times as leveling up just a few times will make most of your current gear obsolete. 

The big endgame challenges that this all leads to are the 'raid' bosses. These are big boss fights that were designed to only be completed in co-op, but you can still take them on solo. In my opinion these bosses are not fun at all to fight and are generally badly designed. First of all, if you want to farm them you almost always have to run through or clear an entire area first. You have to do it after EVERY kill. There's only 1 of them that I remember that is reasonably close to a fast travel point. To me this says that they don't even want you farming these bosses - instead they want you just killing them once as many of them also have a one-off mission to kill them as well. Many of these bosses also have completely unavoidable arena-wide AOE attacks which makes little sense to me. These bosses also cost a decent amount of a pretty rare resource to spawn in, which you have to pay again if you leave without killing them. This combines with the fact that you still incur the full penalty of the death system, which is losing a huge amount of your money, to make these bosses incredibly frustrating, if not downright impossible to learn on your own since you will run out of money for ammo. On top of all of this there is little incentive to even fight these things as you're already to required to have pretty much perfect gear to kill them, so their loot won't make a huge difference. The other endgame challenge is completing a 'raid' challenge in the more traditional sense, to allow you to get gear over the normal level cap. This is a bit more fun than the bosses but is suffers from similar problems in incentive and learning, especially as a solo player. Generally, if you want to play only solo, I would avoid even bothering with the endgame and final difficulty. If you still want to 'complete' things in the game you can do them on the lower difficulties.

All that being said, I did still enjoy my time with this game overall. It was mostly near the end of may playtime that these issues cropped up as they are mostly just with the endgame. If you're co-op focused, not interested in the endgame, or if these issues don't sound so bad to you this game is certainly a must-buy, especially considering how cheap it gets on sale."
3603,its great
3604,I've never played a shooter game like this before and I'm bad at it but I think it's fun and there are characters in the game that say funny things so it's quite entertaining.
3605,great game
3606,"This game comes off as a more finished version of the first Borderlands game.
It’s a good game, but it's not a masterpiece. Pretty standard FPS fare that demands to be played co-op, the solo experience tends to be a little monotonous; go here, kill this, repeat.
Graphics are good and some missions are well designed but the overall story is not that intriguing."
3607,"I just keep coming back to this game and playing it over and over. Loot, loot, loot, shoot, loot, etc."
3608,"Beat the base game in around 25 hours as you can see. I have a lot more playtime on console, but that's from a different time in my life.

This is indisputably the best Borderlands game you could possibly play.. everything about it is perfect. The only bad thing about it is that there isn't enough content (there's loads but after you beat it you definitely want more... and borderlands 3 barely scratches that itch.)


This is a masterpiece of a game. I grew up one Borderlands 1 and 2, and getting to play 1 then 2 later in my life really was special. I don't think we take enough time to appreciate the classics or gems from our youth because we're too caught up playing the new hit game. I feel bad for taking this long to express my love for this game in a review.

The story, characters, environment, VILLAIN, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, and so much more, were done masterfully and beautifully. I really miss this version of Gearbox.. I miss the old claptrap. The old days. The glory days of people playing BL2 for the first time. I'll never forget it. I love Halo, but this game will always have a special place in my heart.


These next parts will include my personal insight on the good in this game. There is definitely a little bad, but so much more good. So who cares?


STORY: My god. I genuinely cried when you-know-who died when I was younger. I spent many hours with him in BL1.. my first character. I didn't even expect it tbh. This game really tested the boundaries and limits with what it can do.

The twists, the atmosphere, the sense of urgency but not too urgent. The memories. The story is honestly amazing. I don't care what anyone says. Sure, you can say it's 2-dimensional. I can say screw you. I honestly haven't ever seen a villain-in anything, not just video games-this good. I was sad to see him go. Borderlands 3 has got nothing on Jack. He's a tool. He's a cheat. He's literally an @sshole scumbag.... but a good @sshole scumbag. Especially if you find out more about his lore in a different, albeit lesser, borderlands game. (dlc for him in 3 is disgusting, story wise and character wise. Terrible portrayal of Jack, and idk if it was even the same voice actor? Gameplay wise it was ok. Nice loot I guess. Iffy boss fight.) 

bottom line is- you loved this guy. you hated this guy. you loved to hate this guy. perfect villain with a perfect ending.. if you haven't played through borderlands 2 you literally need to play this to see what I mean. Trying my hardest not to spoil this ancient game lol.

CHARACTERS: Man am I glad they made this when they did.. the voice actors are actually GREAT in this game (cough bl3 cough cough)

Seriously tho, my sleep-deprived unfunny jabs aside, the cast is incredible. Aside from your average NPCs that scatter the area all around you, the main and side characters in this game are a treat. I have no issues with a single one. They're all original and make you feel a need to keep playing to see where this all goes (I love claptrap from BL1 and 2 and his voice actor, fuck you. He is the greatest. BL3 claptrap is mid af..)

*ahem* .. Anyways, yeah, I mean there isn't much else to say about this part tho without spoiling too much. Although I will say that the characters in this game shine. I'd say they stack up with most other games you could throw at them. There's so much life and feeling behind them. That's what you get with good voice acting.. we need more of that and should really honor our actors more. (btw they took crucial characters almost out completely in BO3.. three perfect ones are only in the game for.. maybe one mission or two? Then they're just MIA. Nice, new, crappier Gearbox. Take more characters away and add worse ones, please, I beg of you!)

ENVIRONMENT: I absolutely love most environments in this game.. (I despise the starter area, but 5 playthroughs ago, I loved it. Hell, it's still beautiful and perfect but I've played the game so much, it just feels dull to me now. I'm definietly biased, but it's a great area. Full of nothing.. water.. and death. But mostly nothing.) 

Not just where the game takes you, but the design of each area as well. You can really tell they put effort into where you go. I will note that the level design is hit or miss in borderlands 3. The gameplay/gunplay in borderlands 3 is literally the only reason I trudged through it.. that and to see where it went. Didn't go anywhere I liked, but now I can say that with confidence! :)

VILLAIN: Jack>Twins from BL3. Yeah, I said it. I'm biased as hell, and I literally despise this guy. He is such a jackass.......

Again, can't say much without spoilers. But even the intro to this game paints a pretty picture of the murderous cat chasing cat roles you will experience in this adventure. I wish the casino DLC from borderlands 3 was in this game instead.. that could've possibly been the best one of them all. Oh well.

GUNS: This game is a first person shooter role playing game, with color rarity loot drops. Not just guns, but mods for your grenades, stats, and a fancy shield like Mister Chief himself.

The guns in this game are plentiful and just so are very forgettable.... except for that one. You know the one I'm talking about. That gun. That gun you always think about. It's special. You're not quite sure how it works. But you love it. You need it. You want to hold it in your arms like it's your special baby, then you use your special baby to murder the ever living shit out of anything that looks at you funny. 

Fanboying aside, guns are good. Lotsa bad ones, for sure, but that's the whole point. 

(btw, mine are the infinity pistol, and the shotguns that shoot globs of stuff. Yes pls.)

EXPLOSIONS: BECAUSE.... REASONS! KABOOM! (I'm American, I like explosions. Ridiculous ones that may or may not be comedic in nature.)

SO MUCH MORE: Yes. Co-op.. boss fights that make you wanna cream.. vehicular manslaughter (not the best but for your first time it feels fun af) Survival horde mode (could be better but it's there.. and memorable. I raged.) Gambling. I have wasted too much on those damn slots. Comedy. Like.. real comedy. Not this half-assed Outer-Worlds Borderlands 3 PG-13 PEGI 12 2022 horse sh1t. Game has some serious giggles, chuckles, and maybe even a laugh or two in it. Was sad to see it go. Customization was awesome af.. I spent about an hour mindlessly typing away every stupid code that the OG lords of Gearbox bestowed upon us online just for a bunch of skins and heads I'll never use. Why? Because I needed them. Now I need more. You can even respec your points if you wanna switch it up. Hell you can spend countless hours and never fully get every single perk unlocked. ((I usually just make a new character but there is a NEW GAME+ MODE! Good games do that.. especially ones with cool loot. i.e. dark souls)) I assume in NG8 or somewhere around there you may get every skill. Idk. Yeah.. the replayability itself makes this worth buying on it's own. Definitely get the collection and not just this game, but if you can't, get this.


TL;DR, just buy this game. Like I just said, if u can't get the handsome collection, just get this standalone. You won't regret it.. unless you end up feeling like it's a grind. I mean, you'll get new guns that do slightly or VASTLY different things. It's a shooter that literally will make you smile.. or instantly want a refund. If it's not for you, that's fine. But you should give it a chance :)

Cheers! See you in the Borderlands <3"

3639,"This Review is segmented into two major Perspectives, and these do Oppose each other:
Single Player - Good
Multiplayer - Not so much

Rating*: 18+ (Mature Content, and Adult Humour)
Genre: Loot and Shoot, Substantial Comedy
Controller Compatibility**: DS4Winodws Required for Sony DS4
MOD Support: Some (Full DLC Required)
Value***: The Standard Price is a bit much, so wait for a sale if you're not made of money. It does come on sale regularly enough, so you shouldn't have to wait too long.

Single Player Experience:
It's a good game, with hours of gameplay to be had. Though note I said Good and not Great, since there are a few issues with the Drop Rates (can be fixed via Patches), and the Game can have a few bugs that require a restart from a Previous Save Point. Some aspects of the Game can be bypassed with certain tools, and thus you can avoid some of the issues that you would otherwise run into. For the best results and Player Experience, get the Full Version of the Game. There are a few MOD's that can improve the experience further, and remove instability. I'd still recommend taking brakes, where the Game has chance to Restart, just so that the Cache Data can clear, as this is a Game that gets Cache Memory Issues, that can Corrupt Save Data. Luckily, somebody did make a Tool that can Alter Save Data Files, so this will minimise the impact if you've forgotten to switch game off every couple of hours.

Multiplayer Experience:
This is a Game that does have various means of connecting Multiple Players into a single Match. Note, Results will vary drastically based upon your Connection Stability (note I said Stability, not Speed). While having a Fast Internet Speed is recommended, it will be pointless if it's not stable. The Game will Corrupt over time, and thus, you'll need to Stop and Restart periodically for your Game to remain 'Clean' and free of corruption. I found this out the hard way on other Platforms, but the reason remains the same. The Multiplayer Back-End isn't great, and this can mean that your Game will randomly disconnect at High-Traffic moments, where a lot of Data needs to travel over a short period of time. If you have a LAN Mode Session, using Wired Connections through a properly configured setup, then Multiplayer will remain stable for longer. However, if you're Online over Unstable Networks, expect to have problems. 10-20Mb/s isn't fast enough, so if you get any Data Packet drops at that speed, don't expect to get anything done at all. 1Gb/s is good, just so long as you're not losing too many Packets too often.

WORDS OF WARNING:
Don't play the Game for 24 Hours in one Session, you will brake your Save Data. I know, because, me and my father did exactly that, and the Save Data got so badly corrupted that we had to Abandon the Saves, and start over. Please take brakes and allow the Game chance to clear its cache (by turning it off, and restarting the Application). For Single Player, I'd recommend every 4-6 Hours, though 8 Hours Sessions shouldn't brake the Game. For Multiplayer Games, especially if there is a poor connection or if there is a full session (4 Players), restart your Game every 2-4 Hours, do not exceed 6 Hours if your Connection is poor (assuming it hasn't already disconnected by then).

* The way I Rate a Game is based on International Standards, but some Games will be rated higher than the International Maximum Rating. I've rated this as 18+. This Game contains Graphic Content, though there are Paintball Settings that can minimise the Gore. There is also frequent Sexual References and Comedy that may be funny, but quite rude. Some of the Idle Comments will make you laugh, but there are not suitable for anyone not old enough. If you're playing this with a younger person, just make sure they are not playing as Gaige while getting the 'Slagged' Status Effect (purple stuff), as she will sometimes comment about it, and while the comment is funny, it is of a Sexual Nature. MOD's will change the experience further, so depending on the MOD, you may want to mind the Volume.

** Please note that some Games that Support the Sony DS4 Controller, may still display the XBox Buttons. Also note that Counterfeit DS4 Controllers may yield mixed results in functionality, please use Genuine Controllers / Game Pads.

*** The Value I put on games may be a little warped as I consider £20 GBP as the Top-End of what I'll pay for a Game. Considering the amount of Content, and the way the game is meant to be played, I won't say that it's not worth £35 GBP, but waiting for a sale is highly recommended."

Sound travels faster than bullets when trying to ambush enemies. Countless shots of mine fired at long-range have hit a shoulder or nothing at all thanks to bandits snapping their necks 180 degrees to face me.

Borderlands' ""loot treadmill"" is still terribly paced, with weapons you use to remain viable in combat usually being a compromise for larger numbers rather than what your skills, class, and playstyle were consciously built towards. Enemy levels scale so rapidly that gear is outmoded within four levels, and drop rate doesn't pick up the slack.

What this leads to is all too many scenarios you're [b]guaranteed[/b] to end up in wherein enemies are bullet sponges. If you think critical hits and skill with First-Person Shooters can compensate for this, then you haven't factored in enemy resistances or the titanic gulf that exists between yours and an enemy's DPS unless you nearly match their level with your character's and gear's.

Unless you follow whatever META exists for this game using external guides, or grind blindly for levels and better loot with side-quests for every hour of main story progression, you'll be stuck turtling until RNG takes pity on you. The writing of these side-quests, like the story at large, covers a spectrum of spork-raising scene queen on 2011 MySpace and [b][i]the most insufferable and juvenile[/i][/b] Wattpad edge when the game tries to take itself seriously.

The less said about the story, the better. Any potentially significant moment in this game is let down by writing that sounds like a 13-year-old's spastic contributions to a D&D session their older sibling begrudgingly let them sit in on.

[h1]The jokes never landed for me, but then some people enjoy eating fiberglass insulation in their spare time.[/h1]

[b]Side-note: Thank god I'm not Anthony Burch.[/b]

Character classes don't truly come into their own until subsequent playthroughs. A solution to this would've been granting more skill points per level up until level 40, and then tapering them off until they reached a new skill point every two or three levels by the extended cap of 80. I'm not a fan of my reward for tolerating this game's unskippable Wattpad-tier story being the privilege of experiencing it two more times.

The ""Second Wind"" revival mechanic that pops when you kill an enemy when out of health within a time limit is still just as much of a kludge as ever.

Gearbox can't be bothered developing better movement options, stealth that works (missiles and tentacles still track you when using Zer0's Action Ability), or even preventing enemies from last-hitting a target you've been lighting up and stealing your revive. You still don't get a Second Wind if Damage over Time knocks you out after an engagement and there are no enemies left.

Credit where credit is due: The art direction comes closest to anything that could carry this game. The bootlegged Code Hunters aesthetic is as good as ever, however slimy their use of it is without compensating or involving the original artist in any way after ripping a quarter of their short film.

But then, Randy Pitchford's got bills to (not) pay and mouths to feed in exposure for voicing a recognizable series mascot. (Ain't nothing in this world for free... unless it's the ""privilege"" of voice acting.)

The music ranges from good to tolerable.

[h1]Overall I rate Randy BoBandy's Adventures in Borderline Embezzlement of Sega Development Funds one ASS out of BAD.[/h1]"

3701,
3702,Very fun
3703,"so far liking the game, the only issues i really have are the overabundance of useless dlc and the fact that typing in a few codes gives you an overabundance of golden keys you can spend to make the game trivial.  On my first run through, it's what ended up killing the game for me and i got bored and left. I think a main component of a Looter-Shooter is the unmatched feeling of ecstasy when a boss drops a legendary item or something hard to get. When you have 100 codes you can copy and paste in to get that out of a chest guaranteed to give you nothing but that it tends to kill that aspect of the game. Although i could be wrong about all that what do i know, i only have 17 hours lol"
3704,BO R DEE RL AND
3705,How do I get this for free
3706,Just Stupendous.
3707,One of the best games that has been created and given to us on this earth
3708,"This game combines excellent gunplay with hilarious characters and dialogue to create a very fun, complex, dynamic, and overall well made game. Highly recommend this game for lovers of the looter shooter genre!"
3709,"I always thought this game was overrated, until I found out that I was just not gaming"
3710,"easily one of the best games out there with a hateable villain you can't help to love. countless hours you can pour into this game with a lot of mod-ability for even more fun. i highly recommend this game, even at full price it is a steal."

3716,"Played this game on my xbox 1 when it was on game pass back from 2019 to early 21 Loved it so much I decided to buy the Handsome collection on sale and almost completed the presequel and just finished the main campaign of boarderlands 2 and cant wait to finish each dlc 1 by one especially the Tiny tinas assault on dragons keep and finishing the Pirate dlc i was working on for a little bit! 9.5 out of 10 would definently recomend to all my friends and ""WOULD SELL MY LEFT KIDNEY FOR CL3PTRAP on a moments notice"" also this game is basically If Ryan Reynolds was pretty much every character but they all conflicted with one another on everything and Killed random Npc's for stupid reasons for comedic effect and then pretty much say ""well that wasn't supposed to happen, Anyways here's your reward vault hunter! also my favorite characters top 3 are 1# Marcus munitions ""Buy from anywhere else and i'll have you killed"", or ""buy a gun already"" or ""yes my guns were tooken of the bodies of dead adventurers!"" and 2# Scooter ""CATCH AAAAhhh RIDE!"" and 3# Handsome Jack Literally all of the Voice lines from him are golden eseciall since he still thinks he has the moral high ground and thinks he's like KIng arthur so just buy it you wont be dissapopinted!"

3720,Dook hut no fapping
3721,"very good game
"
3722,"Though i like the graphic style and jump range it feels to me as an extremely unsatisfying game: 

-the backpack is absolutely useless: alltogether you can only carry 4 guns (which are essential, because u need different weapons for robots for example) and very little ammonition: there are no portable medi kits 

-there is no box or inventory beside- so keep those damn four guns in hand and backpack or let it be: while i took loot and brought it to the trader i had to drop my gun, the game bugged, sytem crashed (as it does too often on my ryzen 7 5800x with rtx 3070) and the gun was entirely lost: Neither my pc nore the cloud remembered that there has been that gun...

-in focusing ennemies the scope swings like player is drunk as f... while the ennemies are intelligent enough to predict where u shoot and fast enough to avoid getting shot (as Neo in Matrix)

-other weapon or shields might have their advantage but there is always much of an unconvinience: what does it help if a shield has double capacity but takes half of your healthyness...??

The videosequence which is shown when you die takes about 13-15 seconds.... gets embarrassing after a short while!

Like this it´s not much fun,- I am dissappointed!

besides it is almost impossible to tab out of the game without bug or system crash."
3723,fun
3724,"Just a reminder that Gearbox blatantly plagiarised this whole franchise from ""Codehunters"" by Ben Hibon.

3739,"WTF? The DLC package ""Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary"" is not included in the GOTY nor the handsome collection bundle? I don't recall exactly when did I bought the collection but I'm pretty sure it was after the release of this particular DLC and I had always thought I had every DLC, until today. 

Of course I did not went through and fully check ALL FIFTY-TWO DLCs inside the bundle, naturally you would thought they had included everything for a TEN-YEAR-OLD game!"
3740,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
3741,love this game 10 out 10
3742,"well i love this game but obviously i have to downvote it since i was 45 hours into my game and the save file says it got corrupted completely out of nowhere so now im restarting, extremely frustrating"
3743,"You want replay value? Stop looking, you found it. I probably have 500 hours on this game including my hard copy and time played on xbone. This is one of the best games ever made. It just is. So if you havn't played it by now....stop reading f'ing reviews and download the blasted game you SOMBITCH."

3763,Great!
3764,This game is best one in the time that come out but now these days people try to catch best graphic things if you waiting game that similar to like GTA or something ur expections way too high. Im playing this game because first time i see this game when I was 9 or 10 years old and this game was like my life . So you can buy this game in a discount.
3765,"reminds me of times where life was vibin, good ole borderlands
"
3766,the amount of guns in this game is as massive as the number of minutes I have spent playing this connected to steam. worth playing if you're into guns and hilariously weird bosses.
3767,"I have played through Borderlands 1 as a single player and with another player.  I am not a big video gamer, and found Borderlands 1 to be right at my skill level - easy enough to learn and plenty of story - I played through twice with each character.
I then bought Borderlands 2 looking for the same experience and it has not disappointed.  The graphic are a little more cartoony, but, over all, it is a fun game.
I highly recommend both games to anyone looking for a ""loot and shoot"" with a good story line, unique and interesting PC's and NPC's, and, evidently, a lot of  ""in jokes""."
3768,Got all BL2 and DLC for 15 bucks on sale. Plenty of time into the game. Well worth it.
3769,The best looter-shooter out there for sure prob the most re-playable game ive played
3770,"One of my fav games to play with friends. recently got it on steam even though im a console player so I could play with the PC gang, and golly. Mouse + Keyboard controlls are another kind of beast."
3771,good
3772,"The best borderlands game by far. I've played through this game I don't even know how many times and it's great every time. Great story, great jokes, great bad guy. I've bought this game on I think 4 different platforms now, 10/10 would buy again."
3773,"Favorite game of all time, played on pc, xbox 360, and xbox one and every time it is just the best experience"
3774,best ever
3775,"the definitive looter shooter, bought this game again on pc for the modding capabilities, good stuff"
3776,"Game: Shoot n Loot

School: Shoot N Scoot"
3777,Nostalgisch game if you have not played it i highly recommend to try it out
3778,"Fucking Hilarious and Heartfelt game that will probably never be lived up to, even though the gunplay is dated."
3779,"it is gud
"
3780,Nice
3781,Ugly game that pisses me off just for existing
3782,"This game makes you feel rewarded when you get the legendary item you want
"
3783,idk
3784,put corrosive damage on myd ick
3785,goated
3786,he is indeed handsome
3787,"To this day still One of (if not) the best Fps Looter RPG's Ever made and that's just fact. in all honesty, buy this game instead of 3 You'll get More Playtime and Enjoyment out of it."
3788,FUCK CLAPTRAP HIS MOTHER HUNG HERSELF
3789,Cool Game
3790,"While still a fun experience solo, this arguably THE best co-op game out there. You're gonna enjoy hours of fun gameplay, constant bickering over who deserves that gun or not, and while some of the humor is dated, some of it still warrants a chuckle.

Absolutely loved this game in my youth, and it's nice to see that the love hasn't changed after all those years.

10/10, would absolutely recommended swindling your brother, friends, and partner out of a legendary drop"
3791,Funny inni
3792,"Hello Everyone!

Again an old game what I just try to overview and play out. A couple of days when I finished the campaing with the Mechromancer and start again in the harder mode.

When I got this game I didn't like it because I don't understand what is important in this game. Is very simple like in Diablo or every RPG based game. Have to over leveled with your character and try to loot overpowered weapon for your character. Why? Because I'm not really a multiplayer guy. I love to find everything alone a game like this. In my tempo. This is a multyplayer co-op game and I'm not a skillful gamer as well so I needed a bit more time and see I just finished at the first time and I want to go through again with other characters. With other players I always felt pushing forward the story and everything and I can't understand what is happening. Killed one boss and just jump in to the next one because somebody open a door or pull a leveler.

About the game.

The first part the Borderlands was a bit harder and a bit bored as I remember. This one the second is better in every way. Bigger maps, better weapons and really funny story after the part one. Especially liked so much the side missions. Now I bought the DLCs so I'm very curious what other missions I've got.

So after many years I installed back this game and playing with it a big smile on my face. Or I just a bit older?


I'll update this review when I've got more influence. Maybe after this I go back to part one and will play out as well."
3793,jack is the best character ever. The story is great and the side missions are even better. This is one of the only 10/10 games I have played
3794,"The best Borderlands to date (2022). Funny story, interesting characters, exciting game play, and several hours needed for completion."
3795,amazing
3796,Has everything you liked in Borderlands and improves upon it in every way except the loot drops. I would say that loot drops for legendaries needs a buff. Other than that a great game that you can sink quite a bit of time into.
3797,an all time classic
3798,y e s
3799,ITS IGHT
3800,"It is BL2.
What is wrong with you?"
3801,Far better than 3

3803,bordalands
3804, i like everything about the games
3805,new opp pack in the air this gas or what
3806,STAIRSSSS!!!!!!
3807,"This game is as amazing as the first time I played it as a child. It's graphic quality is still great to me, and I think the story is better than Borderlands 3, and the opening scene will always be amazing."
3808,Moxxi has just HUGE tits. I mean some real serious knockers
3809,best game ever i do recommend this game fun to play and funny too
3810,good

3824,its a yummy game
3825,"A little backstory; I bought and played Borderlands 1 around 2010/2011 for the Xbox 360. I remember having so much fun i couldn't stop playing it. By the time i really completed BL1, Borderlands 2 was released.
I was about 17 years old and had no job or means to earn money to buy Borderlands 2, so i couldn't play it until i believe 2014 where i found it on sale at a local shop and bought it for 15 Euros. As much fun and nostalgia i had the first playthrough i never bothered to really complete it like BL1.

Now i'm 27 and made the full switch to PC, i have a 1080ti so it handles PhysX great on 4k.
Around 2 weeks ago i jumped into the game with the Handsome collection, first thing i noticed is that the game aged incredibly well, wether it's the 4k update pack or the gameplay it still is very good. I chose Siren (ofcourse) and started playing the game from beginning. 100 hours further i completed the main quest 3 times which means i am in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and maxed out my level at 72. I had the pleasure to play to all DLC's except Commander Lilith which i am about to do now. I farmed Pyro Pete a few times but still haven't touched any other raid bosses or side quests! The only thing i don't particularly like in BL2 is the 
""futuristic"" ""unrealistic"" looking weaponry, now i know this game isn't for it's looks, but if you look at BL1 or BL3 for that matter, the guns look alot more natural to real life, the physics or specifications, etc.

My overall conclusion of this game is quite simple.
If you enjoy shooting and looting, you should've played this.

3830,"In a certain quest, some guy asked me to shoot him in the face. So I did.

9/10 would play again, the only complaint is that it should have more fast travel locations :("
3831,;)
3832,it makes me lol instead of mald
3833,"best game to play with the homies fr, boring when you're alone though"
3834,I like when I dump 100 bullets into a loader and it keeps saying no
3835,"its a weird game, start is pretty boring and then u get skills n stuff and its fun, but afterwards it just starts getting boring again, story is good and gameplay is decent, can't imagine playing this without dlcs though.
late-game is basically lvling urself until max lvl and every couple lvls you go farm a legendary gun or otherwise ur damage will start to fall-off, once you reach max lvl and do a dlc-arena-thingy u unlock the ,,op'' difficulties where the enemies are a level above you; up to 10, basically meaning that there are 13 difficulties in this game, well atleast for op difficulties you dont have to replay story, just the arena, also story is short; a lot of sidequests tho that are pretty good buuuut after u done all that ur just stuck there shooting at dogs for millions of damage and pray that maybe they drop u a class mod that you need( it took me 10 hours of farming a rare enemy type called ,,tubby'' to get the exact type that i needed for my character :| ) .
i recommend only if u just go for normal difficulty story and the side-quests, if you intend to go any further you may suffer boredom"
3836,fun art plenty of content and contention.
3837,I love this game so much. Well worth the money.
3838,DUNNO WHY BUT THIS GAME STILL IS KING ABOVE ALL THE OTHER BORDERLAND SERIES I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE NEWEST one BUT i bet this one is good enough
3839,Perhaps the handsomest game ever created
3840,a great game but needs a little bit of work
3841,"really good game

3857,This game is just simply incredible. that's all.
3858,h
3859,Game's great. Get on sale if you want but still worth base price in my opinion.
3860,"usually I hate rpg games, they are boring as hell or straight up broken. but for the first time I picked up this game, it blew my mind away. It has a pretty good story, looks like a 2017 AAA title, and the gameplay is godlike fun. i been hearing about borderlands 3 gameplay is better than 2, i can't wait to buy that game"
3861,noice

3864,This game made me fall asleep on multiple occasions even with friends idk how randy achieved this
3865,fun
3866,Very fun.
3867,game is good but still not that great if i didnt paid this game is really good
3868,This game is the best borderlands game. it's one of my favorite games and I've played hundreds of hours over multiple consoles. Mostly I've played single player but this game truly shines when you're playing with friends. A great way to waste your summer 10/10
3869,gug
3870,just amazing
3871,"Fun game
"
3872,great game. Still like it more than there first and bl3
3873,"Pretty good game, i had so funny moments in this game, but i got some rages at some points, but thats okey, good game !"
3874,"Great for people who are into looter-shooters. Otherwise don't buy this game.

I am aware that it has good opinions, because it deserves them - but not every game is for everyone, and I'm not going to recommend it for anyone who is not into looter-shooters."
3875,"Bought and played this back in the day, loved it.

Now the game won't stop crashing in current day with a better PC.

Please fix this game."
3876,I downed 8 hours in my first game because it was so much fun
3877,after 10 hours or so i made the decision to play the 3rd one soooooooooooooo
3878,"naughty game
"
3879,Best borderlands made.
3880,"A quirky game that somehow weaved its characters, environment and writing together (what seems masterfully). Just don't expect this quality in its other titles as it seems they just hit a different stride with this one."
3881,Bond with your favorite friends by incinerating your less liked friends for guns.
3882,"You could call me a Borderlands fanatic, I absolutely LOVE the series, and they get the most replay of any game in my library (The Division being a very close second). 

Borderlands 2 is my favourite of all the games in the franchise because it's story rich, and easy to follow. The humour is unrivalled, and the gameplay is the best, and pretty much all the missions are fun, while challenging. The DLC is fantastic! It has the least amount of \/\/()|<3 content (practically none), which I appreciate, as the Pre Sequel, 3, and TTW gets progressively heavier in that aspect. I play games to escape the real world, I don't need to deal with it in video games."
3883,"To get the most out of this game, play it with 3 other people. That being said, this is a fantastic game with fantastic gameplay and a fantastic story. It's absolutely worth your money."
3884,Been playing borderlands series since the game 1st released. I played on the console versions before I had bought the Pc.
3885,Still a classic!
3886,"loot
"
3887,"ok

3888,x
3889,"Absolute Classic. 

I have been playing this game since launch on my console as a kid and decided to get it on my PC after a couple years of not playing, and I gotta say it hasn't lost it's charm."
3890,"I've done two playthroughs on Normal - one where I stopped with like 4 main missions to go and one with the unofficial community patch where I beat the main game.

I enjoyed the game well enough to play twice (though separated by several years) to say I recommend it, but that's about it.  I'm hard pressed to say if it's a great game or if it's even that much better than the first one.  I played solo and didn't really have issues.  However, my biggest gripe for a loot based game is that I didn't find the loot to be very good for me.  Maybe it was partly from playing on Normal, but it felt like I was just not getting the good weapons to compete against the enemies I fought - for instance, there was a period where level 18 gear was the best I found, but it wasn't doing enough against the mid level 20 foes I was facing before good weapons finally dropped.  I didn't really need to grind or anything, but it made the fights long, tedious affairs. 

It was also annoying trying to traverse large, open maps with foes dangerous enough to be a threat, but low level enough to not give any XP to actually make it worth dealing with - yet more often than not, it was usually in areas where I needed to be for a quest where I couldn't exactly ignore them.

I also liked the concept of a second wind - kill an enemy to get another chance at life to be nice in concept, but it didn't work more often than not - often I was killed just as the last enemy died so I couldn't get a kill or like above, I had weapons that just didn't do enough damage.

Maybe if these things were better, I wouldn't have felt burned out after 40ish hours and would be interested in playing the DLC or higher difficulties, but as is, now that I've finally beaten the main story... I  find that I don't really care to play any further.  TBH, I didn't find the story that interesting though I actually liked most characters (except for Jack who I just found annoying rather than being a threatening or cool villain - it didn't help that he ended up being the easiest fight in the entire game)."

3900,"10/10, not as fun as Borderlands 1, but Borderlands 1 is an 11/10."
3901,I have played the s*it out of this game! Maybe re-played it over 10 times! Definetly one of the most enjoyable games out there! -Specially if you play with friends :)
3902,girls be dating someone like handsome jack then surprised when he throttles a puppy

3911,"its a fun game that i can play for hours had it on the xbox 360 and its the first game i played 100's of hours on it
"
3912,"Best game I've ever played. Literally has not got old in 10 years. You bored of playing normally? Challenge runs. Play with friends. Play without friends. 1Life runs where if you die you delete your character. (These are my favourite).

There are 6 Characters all with multiple different ways to build them at endgame.
There is a main game, 5 big story DLCs and 5 small story DLCs.
There's 2 dlcs that raise the level cap and add a new endgame challenge and a system to increase the difficulty of all the content in the game.
There are like 6 Raid bosses which are seriously hard to take on and a great challenge for the most part, especially with friends.

Like holy shit this is the pinnacle of what games should aspire to be. And it was made a decade ago??

Buy the game."
3913,Borderlands 1 is better

3932,"Classic, one of the best games ever

3933,"Best Borderlands, best looter-shooter.
"
3934,game very much fun yes
3935,"A great buy nowadays, a ton load of content, a bunch of replayability and one of the best antagonists ever. Getting BL2 is a no brainer"
3936,Fan-Dabby-Doazy ... just buy it ... you won't regret it.
3937,"Probably a great time if you're into Looter-Shooters.

A boring grind for everyone else."
3938,fun
3939,"I'm honestly surprised i only have 16 hours on this game, it feels like I have alot more. Very fun game, and I have to play it more. The missions are super fun, and its so great testing out all the different guns to see which ones fit your playstyle. And if you're a bit lazy, theres a bunch of codes you can reedeem for mid-late game guns."
3940,Run and Fire game... just like the first one. It was the same with more characters and some new skills
3941,been playing this for years and Im getting back into it. It's a load of fun if you fall into it : )
3942,Awesome game! I've loved it since it came out. Has all the rpg elements I love with the satisfying gameplay of a shooter.

3944,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
3945,"good shit
"
3946,Well it says I have played for 3887 hours so I would say I am PRO Borderlands 2....
3947,"My favourite ARPG!

This game is always just engrossing to play, every time. While Borderlands 3 does raise the bar, it gets several things wrong, and 2 is still the best in the franchise.

Advice to buyers:
 * Get all or most of the DLC when buying the game. The base game is great but running a linear story over and over isn't the true experience.
 * There is an unofficial community mod - it's worth setting this up if you're going to start playing.

3949,Boring as hell !!

3951,who doesn't like this game?
3952,tuns of fun even in 2022
3953,"my favorite part was when handsome jack said ""i guess the borderlands 2 were the friends we made along the way"""
3954,This game is 100% a must play comedy is a bit dated in it but as someone who has gotten everything except the cobra ive poured hundred of hours across xbox and pc and i still find it fun
3955,"This Game Bussin

3956,"It's a great game, I've made many friends playing it"
3957,"⚙️One of my all time favorite games and quite possibly best sequel to any game out there , literally improves EVERYTHING from the first Borderlands game ! ⚙️ 
- Interesting story , great characters , badass villain , kickass gameplay ! 😎"
3958,"VERY fun much grinding/farming if ur into that wide gun selection decent story better on pc than console imo.

3960,Very tasty
3961,I've played this game for years and continue to play it to this day many memories have been made and I still enjoy this game
3962,"It is fun
(even better with BL2 reborn mod)"
3963,Great game but a little old
3964,"one of those games you just dont play, but on the occasion you do you end up having more fun that expected."
3965,Borderlands
3966,"Borderlands 2? More like borderlands poo! Because damn it's so bad. No joke i've been playing with my friend, the dude literally got all the best gear while I had to mag dump into the easiest of grunts, which in return made my friend get a million levels ahead of me which then I couldn't grab any of the better weapons because they all were leveling up to his level.

Not worth it in the slightest."

3970,aaa
3971,"absolute banger. this is one of those classic games that every self respecting gamer should play, like halo or minecraft. one of the greats."
3972,Played thru this game over a dozen times on PC as well as on Playstation. One of the few games that have replayability. Can never go wrong with BL2.
3973,timeless
3974,gud
3975,AWESOME! in every way. Especially visually.
3976,ok

 Medium."
3980,fun co-op story (!!)
3981,"gud
"
3982,EXPLOSIONS?!?!?!?!?!?
3983,"Solid game. I have even more hours in the xbox 360 version. To level up completely and do some end-game content you end up playing the main story at least 2 or 3 times (Normal Mode, TVHM, and UVHM). This is not required to beat the game but is necessary to beat some additional bosses. 

The DLC is also worth it. I would suggest doing them after the first playthrough though to avoid fatigue."
3984,Radical !
3985,The KING of looter shooters. Not even it's could reach the levels of greatness of this game.
3986,"One of my most favorite games, have it across multiple consoles. couldn't recommend it enough!"
3987,funnyyyy
3988,"I love this game
"
3989,"it is a looter shooter and a rather well made one for it's time
the story line is a bit lacking and plenty of plot holes but the settings plays in to it, not to heavily
a few good jokes here and there, 
all in all a fun game and yes it is better with friends"
3990,I like to kill things with neato cool weapons to pass the time...
3991,"Legitimately the best game ever made, cope."
3992,yes
3993,great game. thankfully I caught the sale just in time. Hopefully they have a sale on Borderlands 3 pretty soon. :)

4006,One of the greatest games ever created by mankind
4007,Pretty fuckin legendary
4008,"I discovered this game sleeping over at my cousins and he left his PS3. I played it for around 2 hours and was immediately in love. The humor, the gameplay and the overall atmosphere of the game is amazing. The artstyle keeps the graphics crisp to this day. I will never forget staying up til 2, waiting for my mom to come in yelling at me while playing this game with my cousin and brother. Love y'all at gearbox for making those memories happen. God bless"
4009,Very yes in my opinion.

4011,its a fun game (especially with cheats lol) with friends its even better and it is a nostalgia trip if you have played before.

4014,good
4015,"Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The only two games I enjoyed from the company. Sequel only cause the horrible voice acting was charming in its own way. I know voice acting. I've done great things with it myself. I could voice many many different characters and you'd never know it was me AND with twisty personalities. So not bland and actually fun to listen to. Honestly though horrible in the sequel. I know those first stages of voice acting I've been there and if I ever got the chance to voice act in maybe the fourth game for a main playable character who's actually in the story line and not randomly fazed out of existence. I'd like to work with some of those moon voice actors. Charming. I don't know where this went, but yeah. I'm hungry. I'm going to eat. Enjoy the review. Those two games I mentioned? 9.99999 out of 10 for my own specific preferences of what makes a borderlands. Stupidity and intense fun with stupid story lines that make no sense, but keep a goal while being crazy at the same time. Enjoy enjoy nothing left for me to say. Help me voice act for the fourth game and I will literally put most if not all the money I get from it into charity and the fans on my channel. I'll giveaway the game if they drop it all that. Not a chance in hell I'd be considered, but here's for dreaming I can make someone come to life in the Borderlands series of games someday. Peace and loves and kisses and smooches and twister and all that."
4016,"all i've got to say is...
this game is hilarious, fun, and flashy. worth money, and it's even better with friends."

4025,I get paid to kill myself. Couldn't ask for a better game.
4026,"Borderlands 2 got me into video games. I first played this on my laptop in high school many years ago and it quickly became an obsession. A few years after I graduated I got it for PS3 and while adjusting to the console was difficult, I now play a wide array of first-person shooters on my PS5. The whole Borderlands series is amazing; I also highly recommend the new Tiny Tina's Wonderlands!"

4045,"I first played this game when it came out on xbox and beat it with my dad, I was 11 years old and we beat all the games quickly once they were released. This game series is one of the first games I played with my dad so I have very fond memories, and I will always recommend this game to anyone who will listen. I definitely prefer the keyboard and mouse version over the xbox controller just because things are a little more precise and I can manage the controls better now that I'm older! Anywho, check it out!!!"
4046,The best of the series imho. A looter shooter that just hits all the right notes from beginning to the end.

I've finished BL1, Pre-Sequel and Borderlands 3.. all of them have been fantastic to enjoy.
I thoroughly recommend this game to any FPS/RPG fan."
4055,"Interesting 2D graphics, smart story, lots of humor and crazy dialog.
Also many side stories, besides the main one.
I have spent hundreds of hours playing it... and not bored of it yet.
Small bugs from time to time, but I can live with them.
A must play in my opinion!"

The definitive looter-shooter."
4063,awesome game fun to play funny all around great game
4064,no
4065,It's a good shooter and one of the few funny games that's actually funny. A must have for any fans of shooters with a sense of humor.
4066,"a nice take on the first game that expands on the original's near flawless combination of rpg and fps mechanics, and adds a fun story with interesting characters, as well as a ton of new weapons and gear with unique abilities that let you customize your character to suit your desired play-style. i spent countless hours tinkering with different combinations of abilities, gear, and weapons trying to find just the right setup for me, which was always gratifying. massive replayability with it's different game modes and challenging endgame content. i cant recommend this game highly enough."

4095,"Pales in comparison to the first in the series, and emblematic of problems that will plague the series going forward. Only fun with friends. Low replay-ability. Grind driven. Bullet sponge nonsense. Low-brow comedy. Low pathos and emotionally manipulative. The series is all downhill from here."

4115,"After all these years Borderlands 2 still holds up as one of the most enjoyable FPS made. I remember playing it back when it came out on console, and the nostalgia of playing it now brings back such great memories. It still hits you in the feels, and makes you laugh. The story, and characters are so well written, and immersive even after all these years. Everyone should spend some time in Pandora. Highly recommend if you ever find it on sale again."
4116,one of the games ever made
4117,one of the best games ever made. still playable after all these years unlike most other games that came out that time. will continue to play until i upgrade my pc to play 3rd game
4118,"not a bad game,when i played i didn't like this genre of games but now i kinda like it a bit.prety good shoting expirience and story but i didn't complete the game.just buy it from g2ais way more cheaper there"
4119,Great game. Better with friends. :D
4120,"Great game, lots of fun, and engaging story line.  Better with friends, but even decent for solo."
4121,Very fun. Had a lot of fun with the squad.

4129,"Even after so many years,this is still an awesome game and I am enjoying it tremendously.
If you have not played this game yet,I can strongly recommend playing it. The campaign is so much fun and the narrative is really quirky. Top marks."
4130,
4131,"I get that's is an RPG. The characters have a lot of personality, the humor is witty, and the artstyle is unique. However, the amount of loot really ruins it: why do I have to stop and check every single 'uncommon' and rarer drop to check for an incremental upgrade? This ruins the flow. Stopping to pick up a paltry amount of ammunition when you could have just made it an auto-pick up when passing by while items, on the other hand, require you to open containers.

If you don't stop and check for upgrades while looting? Punished. You'll cross a randomly generated gem that could've really helped you out. If you don't stop and take the time to open containers, you'll run out of ammunition: not because you have poor aim, because enemies are bullet sponges (which isn't a bad thing, albeit making enemies smarter is better in my opinion). 

The game's old. I get it. But I don't get the hype. Probably only nostalgia since there's so much of this game that's a chore. Maybe if I were a kid that had only this to play and no obligations to attend to, it might be an ok game."

4148,"Borderlands 2 Storyline:
Borderlands 2 begins five years after the events of the original Borderlands. The Atlas Corporation has been put out of business and the Crimson Lance is gone for good. But where one weed has been uprooted, another has taken its place, and Hyperion is that weed.

Hyperion has taken control of Pandora, and its leader – Handsome Jack – has stolen credit from the original Vault Hunters for both finding The Vault and taking down The Destroyer at the end of the first game. Jack has made everyone outside Hyperion into outlaws, including yourself, and it’s very much a case of killing him before he kills you.

Borderlands 2 Characters:
The Vault Hunters from the original Borderlands do make an appearance in Borderlands 2. Now though, they are non-player characters, and seeing them as part of the game world does feel a bit odd at first.

The sense of humor and personality that characterized the first game has been retained, in large part via the excellent voice acting. Claptrap returns as a star performer, and is humorous and lovable in equal measure, but there are plenty of new story characters all of whom have fantastic depth, and do a great deal to bring the Borderlands 2 world to life. Chief among them is Sir Hammerlock, a cybernetic hunter with a totally exaggerated English accent and a glass eye (obviously).

That said, the humor does occasionally fall flat, with overused and outdated internet humor (‘U mad bro?’) deployed to extreme levels. This is a subjective thing, some will love it, and others, like us, will feel it’s a little cringe worthy.

As for your character, you can chose one from four classes; the Gunzerker – a stocky, gun-toting soldier capable of dual-wielding any weapons; the Assassin – a stealthy sniper, who can distract enemies with decoys and inflict massive damage on a single target; the Siren – a support class, capable of controlling enemies and healing team-mates; and the Commando – a skilled soldier with a personal, mobile turret.
Thankfully these characters can be customized, so now your character will have a fairly unique look. In Borderlands, you would often find yourself in a game with four identical Soldiers barreling around. Now you can easily identify your team-mates by their unique customization and the identity tag above their head.

You’ll still find enemies such as the Skags and Spiderants roaming around the levels of Borderlands 2, as well as the usual Bandits and Psychos. But they’ve been joined by a large host of other enemies all intent on your destruction, including a wide range of heavily-armed robots, rock-tossing Bullymongs and lethal plant-life. All in all – plenty of stuff to fill with bullets, or grenades, or whatever the hell that gun of yours fires.

Borderlands 2 Weapons:
With Borderlands 2 following a similar cycle to the original Borderlands offering, your survival still involves guns. A lot of guns. There were 17 million separate weapon combinations in the first game, and though there are no similar details yet for Borderlands 2 (Gearbox is claiming the number ’87 bazillion’ but we’re talking that with a pinch of salt), we’d be surprised if the number wasn’t similarly enormous. The game uses a system that randomizes your weapon drops, so you have to find the right gun for you, rather than being able to customize it yourself.

Weapons come from a variety of makers and roughly suit different play styles. Jakobs weapons for example have a distinct Wild West feel to them, and will fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. By contrast, guns made by the Dahl Corporation are more often built for use at longer ranges, with semi-automatic firing and scopes.

Weapons can also come with elemental bonuses, including incendiary, frost and corrosive damage. These bonuses have particular usages – corrosive weapons are particularly effective against robots and armored enemies for instance – but using an incendiary weapon against a fiery enemy is almost useless.

Borderlands 2 Graphics:
 The characteristic cell-shaded look of the original game makes a return for Borderlands 2, but the whole game looks infinitely better thanks to a much wider color palette and a real variety of environments.

Initially you’re dropped into an arctic wasteland, where you’d be forgiven for thinking that the environments are as dull as the first game. But passing through this early portion of the game opens up the world of Pandora to you, and you’ll find it a whole lot more interesting to look at than it was three years ago, including lush, green highlands and sprawling urban areas. Unlike the original, the Pandora of Borderlands 2 now feels like a real world that you can explore.

Borderlands 2 Gameplay:
Though Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter by nature, the game is based around traditional RPG elements. You complete quests and kill enemies to earn loot and experience, which lets you level up, grow stronger and unlock new abilities.

In terms of items and abilities, it doesn’t feel like you can create an omnipotent character anymore. You will get stronger and more powerful as you gain experience, but choosing items often involves a real trade-off. For example, really powerful shields often decrease your total health, so if you come up against enemies armed with shock weapons (which are very powerful against shields), you’re automatically in a tough spot. The most powerful weapons often have severe downsides, allowing them to tear through your ammo reserves, or resulting in incredibly slow reload times.

There’s a visible, conscious effort to make Borderlands 2 more balanced than its predecessor, and those that played the original will notice small improvements across the board. The inventory is much easier to deal with, items can be easily moved around and compared, and now you can mark trash or favorite items. This sounds simple, but it means you can sell all your trash at once whenever you reach a vendor machine, which is incredibly useful. It would also have been useful if you could mark items as trash as soon as you picked them up, but sadly this has been omitted. The quests themselves are pretty rudimentary in nature, and almost always tend to involve finding or fetching something, or killing someone. There could be a little more variety in quests and objectives, but the quest system is just a story-telling framework in Borderlands 2 – an excuse to get you to go somewhere and shoot things. And that’s what the Borderlands franchise is, and was always about.

Borderlands 2 Multiplayer:
Borderlands 2 multiplayer gameplay is much the same as the single player, but the difficulty ramps up heavily when you get more friends involved in co-op. The difficulty level adapts to the level of your characters so if you’ve got four fairly well leveled friends in a game, be prepared for some serious battles.

Also, be aware if you’re playing with random online gamers that there is no loot system other than the ‘pick up everything before everyone else does’ method.

Outside of the four-player online co-op, there is two-player split screen co-op (though not available on PC), but the enemy level will adjust to the highest character level, so if there’s a big gap between you and your friend, be prepared to die. A lot.

4150,it's pretty okay
4151,luvette
4152,Good
4153,My personal favorite game of all time.  There is a lot of fun times to be had with this game solo or with friends.
4154,great game
4155,"What can I say about Borderlands 2 that hasn't already been said? The game is incredible and still holds up to the qualities we expect with current standards in gaming. The looting system paired with the gun-play make the game and series iconic, deservedly so. 

I like how different factions in game make different weapons in the world, all with unique styles and perks (my favorites are Tediore and Bandit). Handsome Jack is a WAY better antagonist than The Twins were in BL3 (let's not talk about that game anymore) and much more interesting overall. The dialog between characters and the environment are hilarious, especially during the story. Gameplay is excellent with a nice feel in difficulty varieties depending what you're doing, like raids or questing. Good selection of skins and a solid, friendly community that welcomes discussion and co-op gameplay! The DLC's help extend the life of your gameplay along with the level cap increasing as well. 

I've had Borderlands 2 since release on PS3 so there's plenty of great memories to relive playing this again. The game is amazing and sets a formula for success that unfortunately a lot of games now adays forgot. Extremely fun to play alone, even better with friends. 10/10 would scope into Moxxi again ;p"

4189,"I tried the first Borderlands on release from Blockbuster (yes, really) played 4 hours of it and asked my mother if we could go back cause I hated it. I wanted to try these games again. I bought this massively on sale over a year ago and have been putting off playing it since then. I finally installed it and ya... my opinion hasn't changed this game series really is just not for me. 

I am not sure what exactly it is about borderlands that turns me off so much. I hate the art style, it looks like garage. The humor is just embarrassing never funny just cringy. The writing is just terrible. The characters are what a 8 year old boy with a social disorder thinks is badass. The gun play feels super floaty. None of the guns feel like they have punch to them. The ""bonus"" sniper rifle I got just feels like a nerf gun. The gun design looks terrible. Every gun look like a toy. I for me its just death by a thousand cuts there is so much about this game that just isn't for me that it makes me turn it off with in the first few hours of playing it. 

Its a game designed by a pair of pair of overly complicated Buckle boot-cut jeans."

if you don't like Looter Shooter, you can also use a save editor to use weapons you like in the level you like and if it is not too over leveled, it will still be fun to play (I played it like Doom 2016)

so it's a win-win situation <3"

If you want to have a challenge playing I recommend the Assassin class, if you just want to go at a breakneck pace I recommend the Gunzerker, if you want to play as the game wasn't intended but still have fun try the Psycho Class. The story is fine, but it's the game play that keeps making me come back. I would say give it a try, and the Tiny Tina DLC is pretty fun :)."

Not sure if the story will be different for other classes but I played Zer0 and I feel really disconnected with the character. Surely he doesn't say anything, I get it. But I can't 'see' his emotions or feelings during any quests or interactions. Without connection to the character, it feels like a generic shooting game. Surely it's fun, but it doesn't have any impact on me and I will forget it as soon as I play another game."

4290,real good game
4291,"Borderlands 2 is the second entry in the critically acclaimed ‘Borderlands’ series. This game, in my opinion, is the best in the series, and here’s why I think that.

+ Really good story
+ Awesome Campaign DLCs
+ Lots and Lots of loot to be had
+ Each character is fun to play as (with 2 being DLCs)
+ Lots of action and things to do
+ High replayability
+ Funny and good writing (much better than Borderlands 3)
+ A villain you will love, and love to hate

That being said, there are a few things I actually dislike about this game, and I’ll list those below.

- Legendary loot is extremely rare, and can take hours upon hours of grinding a boss for a legendary you want
- Playable characters rarely say anything or react to anything story-wise (they do talk though)

This is a really fun game that will keep you engaged and entertained for hours. This is even more true when you get the DLCs. Wait for a sale, and then buy the Handsome Collection and the Commander Lilith and the Fight For Sanctuary DLC, as it’s the only DLC not included in the Handsome Collection.

Doing this, you’ll have access to all Borderlands 2 DLC, as well as Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and all it’s DLC’s. You’ll get two games, and everything they have to offer.

All-in-all, this is probably my favorite Borderlands game. You won’t regret getting this game, especially in the way I recommended picking it up. This game is essentially a must-play."

4306,yes
4307,Yea

4322,Nice Loot-Shooter. Crazy to its best.
4323,Looter shooter at its peak
4324,Best Game in the series. I keep coming back to it when I want that Borderlands feel. Especially with how disappointing BL3 was.
4325,this game is perfection
4326,it fun
4327,"Its funny, I've played this game for years and for some reason I keep coming back. BL3 had a nice run for awhile but i came back to 2, Wonderlands? yeah its fun but I've still comeback to this one. Highly recommend the Exodus mod or if you want to get real crazy Randomizer is insane! I think I can speak for majority when I say that this game will NEVER get old. For those that want to try their hand at making their own weapons you should try out gibbed, maybe you want a vanilla experience but with a little spicy action for those legendaries, check out the loot midget mod and have an 100% spawn chance of them jumping out from almost everything you open (sanctuary in scooter place is full of fun lockers with this lmao, open em all and try not to die to chaos), I could go on and on, this is my fav game ever tbh and it'll likely not change."

4351,After what seems like for ever and over 12 playthroughs on xbox360 and xbox one I have finally sat down and played the DLC for this game for the first time. and all i can say is it was damn well worth it. Borderlands two is 100% in my top 3 games of all time. this game still holds up to todays standards and does a lot of things other loot shooter rpgs cant. 10/10 game
4352,I mean pretty good.
4353,best FPS game I've ever played !!!
4354,wub wub wub
4355,"Replayed this game multiple times over the years. Gunplay is great, graphics stand out, and storyline is fun and immersive. 10/10 would recommend. I have previously owned the DLCs and would recommend all of those as well. Personal opinion is that the first part of the campaign (before unlocking vehicles) is a little annoying. Still good tho"

4359,only 2 hours in but already a fun game. great mix of FPS and story.
4360,Where is my Butt Stallion when i need it?
4361,"played this since it came out and playing after a 2 year break, feelsgoodman, fun co-op, balanced/unbalanced loot rates, depending on if you're grinding savage lee or not, fun bosses and balanced leveling system"
4362,"10.1 hours to get to level 19, but Handsome Jack is easily the best main villain in the Borderlands series, don't @ me you pleblets."
4363,"Most people will tell you this is the best Borderlands game and that's fair and valid but personally I recommend Borderlands 1, it might be a little slower paced but the guns are more realistic and what I mean by that is a shotgun shoots like a shotgun and a sniper is a sniper unlike newer Borderlands where guns shoot rainbows and shotguns shoot slow moving blue projectiles,  the story is better and it definitely had more love put into it, with that said Borderlands 2 is the perfect balance between fun and realistic and dumb and goofy and I recommend it."
4364,"Played this a LOT on the PS3. Such a fun game that definitely expands on everything good that the original Borderlands had, while not including anything that isn't needed. Still like it better than the third installment. My favorite thing will always be its diversity of maps and ecosystems."
4365,fun game. play it dude...yes!
4366,"This is my very first Borderlands game I've ever playedand I really wish I have played on the first game. This game does follow up years after the events from the first one. Regardless, the game is pretty amazing and challenging. Also the artwork capturing like a graphic novel. the game play like shooting many different types of guns is ridiculous because there are over millions of types of guns you can find and they are never the same. The humor of this game is hilarious with so many funny dialogues and pop culture references. The multiplayer mode is phenomenal because you can have anyone join in the fight at anytrime and its still hard to fight off crazy baddies in a barbaric planet called, ""Pandora"". You are a badass Vault Hunter to find the secrets of the treasure that lies in the most barbaric planet you've ever set your feet in. Fight off the most imperialistic gun company that tries to hunt you down."
4367,At the beginning of the game Handsome Jack told me to kill myself......feel in love with the game right then and there.
4368,Love it
4369,Game good if you like good games
4370,its fun and cool
4371,
4372,very good lots of memories
4373,"I Endorse this product, event, or service"
4374,"Gearbox's idea of difficulty is giving enemies way too many advantages on UVHM.  Aimbot enemies, bullet sponges, insane damage increase, enemies rushing your position, rocket, grenade, and missile spamming, enemies way too good at dodging,  health regeneration, etc...  Gearbox goes overboard with the difficulty and forces you to use specific gear and builds to have a fighting chance."
4375,Its a fun game but HOW ABOUT WE STOP RELEASING UPDATES THAT ADD FREQUENT CRASHES. Ive deleted the game and redownloaded it many times but it keeps crashing during Scarlett's DLC. Something to do with the textures and I cant fix it. Everytime it crashes I basically have to redo the ENTIRE area AGAIN because of the way this game's retarded save system works. Make the game save more frequently first off and fix the dlc's. Ya'll broke it so please fix it.

I would recommend you get the GOTY on sale and then get the handsome collection. I got the GOTY 50% off so that was 8$. And then steam said, ""Handsome collection: save 92% on the 42 items that you don't own"" so I got it for 8-16$. Nice deal! Overall: 9/10. Great game. Well thought through. Few bugs!"

4468,it's pretty fun
4469,"played on epic games before, so I don't have many hours on here but I can guarantee that the game is amazing. In my opinion even better than it's sequel. Along with the DLC's the game is at its peak.
Graphics could be worked on but that's already fixed in the next game so nothing to worry about that, there are enough weapon to pick and choose from so your slag build can be just perfect. Also in my opinion, the bosses are amazing."

4490,"You're lying to yourself that it's a good game, just as I lied to myself. It's addictive, not fun. The proto-live service before Bungie solidified it as a genre with Destiny and interwove it with MTXs. There's about 10 hours in here of goodness and fun, the rest is grind and bullet sponges."
4491,A really kick butt and chew bubble gum like game

4502,"really good, brings me back to the days i used to play on Xbox 360"
4503,co-op looter shooter but you can't play with friends without 40 hours of troubleshooting
4504,One of the best game I have played in last 10 Years !!!
4505,good game great to play wit the bois and beat the shit out of them in a duel 10/10
4506,fun
4507,"The only Pain in the ass is not having 10$ to get the Pass for the DLC
Other then That I Strongly Recemended Tho it has Gore and Cussing Its a Fun game"
4508,Awesome game if you play with 3 other friends. The story was  nice and the gameplay is basically a shooter rpg. Claptrap was really funny.
4509,ive missed it
4510,"I love this game, however I do not recommend purchasing it on steam (or other pc platforms).  At least for me the performance of the game dips significantly after the release of the newest dlc to promo BL3, Commander lillith & the fight for Sanctuary.  I don't know if this is a pc spec compatibility thing with it being a much older title nowadays, but my setup is still fine with the newest installations of the game so I'm unsure of that factor. That being said, check this game out on another system, I myself have owned Borderlands 2 on ps3, switch, steam, epic, ps4, switch as well as having gifted ps4 copy (it went free via handsome collection to psn subs) and on certain steam sales gifted copies to friends so I cannot recommend bl2 as a game enough, just saying if you have a switch or ps4, get it there."
4511,.
4512,yes.
4513,Borderlands 2 and the Borderlands franchise is one of the best video game series ever created. The ineffably unique game design and art style leaves much to enjoy while playing. I have played through this game as every character multiple times and have yet to feel a sense of boredom or apathy in doing so. I would recommend it to anyone who loves action & adventure who is above the age of 15.
4514,Played once Never again
4515,"This game sits as one of my all time favorites. From playing it with my brother to grinding out levels late on a school night. This game never gets old for me. The slap stick humor usually hits and is funny without being overly graphic or offputting. The story alone will last you for hours but to fully experience what this game has to offer will take hundreds of hours. I've played this game on almost all platforms. Xbox 360, Xbone, ps3, Ps4, and now steam."
4516,"listen i love this game, but not the level 72+ kinda love this game"

-3/4

-2
tablespoons all-purpose flour
-3/4
teaspoon ground cinnamon
-1/4

Heat oven to 425°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.

In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.

Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.

4556,"Been playing borderlands since the Xbox 360 days so after I decided to buy it and all its DLCs on PC, I've enjoyed it every single bit of it having friends join along with me and enjoy watching friends struggle on certain bosses while sitting there.

I really recommend this game if you're wanting to have a Chill play through by yourself or with friends."
4557,yo this shit MONK! Best borderlands game my nutsack
4558,Fun for the entire family! all jokes aside it is a great game that really set the name for loot & shooter games having played this game for over 100 hours i can safely say that it was amazing having played through this game and with handsome jack hands down being one of the best villains in video game history. i love the scenery in this game altough sometimes i wish there was more fauna to go around. there is a lot in this game to be discovered and a lot to do even post game you can still work your way through two more difficulties namely True vault hunter mode and Ultimate vault hunter mode. it feels very satisfying to eventually make your way up to godhood and one shot most of your enemies on the highest level and difficulty. for the most part i would also say this is a great introduction into fps even tough it is not pvp. this game is a must get.
4559,yay
4560,One of the best games I ever played ... Its gameplay is super cool and has surprises every time ... I love it ...
4561,"It's a pretty damn good game. Almost lost a friend for arguing over loot though, but I guess that's part of the borderlands experience."

4574,"Incredible game with an amazing story, graphics, ambience, dialogue, basically everything.
Character development through the game is one its strongest points for me, V is basically a blank space for other characters to grown on, and that's alright for me. Your dialogue choices matters a lot, able to change the entire flow of a conversation into a pleasant or hostile one.
Gameplay was not one of the main points for me but could be really satisfying, so many builds and different ways to play, i mostly used revolvers through my experience, blowing enemies heads off was really enjoyable. Quickhacking is a really fun and different way to play, with some advanced quickhacks i could sit my ass watching camerass and killing enemies across the street without taking any damage whatsoever, also making bosses suicide is really fun.
Interactions between Johnny and V was definitely the BEST part of the game for me, never watched Matrix or any of the John Wicks but i absolutely loved Keanu Reeves performance, giving some much needed lighthearted moments at times while also being a delight to listen to. Absolutely nailed that lovable asshole persona to me, i'd definitelly recommend buying the game just to listen to his amazing character. Johnny Silverhand is awesome.
Amazing game, if you can get past some T-Poses and still loading objects it's an amazing experience, one of the best game experiences i've ever had."
4575,game sucks... dont even own it and i know its bad #TinyTina for the win you losers lol.

4595,Very Funny !
4596,"Yes, 100% yes you should play this game. I am not a fan of ""Looter Shooters"" normally but I enjoyed every bit of this game. I would say that I played through the game in multiplayer and a large part of that enjoyment was the company that I had. However the game does an amazing job of being serious and funny at the same time. I feel that they have managed to touch on some sensitive topics without making them a big deal and without losing the humour that the game has. I would love to see the writers of the game write a TV show as I think it would be amazing. Seriously play this game. Now off to play Tales from the Borderlands for a bit of a change, only a bit."

4605,"If you're playing this on Linux or Steamdeck make sure to check the ""force the use of proton"" option in the steam settings. There are two versions of this game, a linux native and a windows version. Linux native hasn't been updated since the death of steam machines and appears to be locked at 20fps on my system regardless of settings. Windows through proton works better than native"

4647,love this game
4648,"I'm sorry, but I cannot seem to understand the hype of this game, let alone, this franchise.

First off, this game is so poorly optimized, cannot maintain a stable framerate during fights.
The world feels too big and empty, I can't really know where I'm supposed to go just to progress the story. I really do not wanna bother with side quests. If you know me, I love RPGs. But a Shooter and an RPG combined just don't seem to work together for me. I personally hate how much negativity almost every NPCs are, just makes me want to kill everything in this game, but I sadly cannot kill a single NPC in a town.

I just cannot give the Borderlands franchise a chance, I'm done with it."

4733,Funny to play as a looter shooter
4734,"Amazing game, really love it and all of its dlcs, played almost all of them with my bestfriend, it really is lovely."
4735,Still the best Borderlands game by far.
4736,"10/10 would recommend. Super fun when you're playing with friends, and well, the game is just as fun if you don't have any friends to play with. Definitely the best game out of all the other games in the Borderlands franchise."
4737,fun
4738,"If you have read forgotten realms books, you might know the story how bruenor battlehammer crafted the ""aegis fang"" . This game is what happens when bunch of people ding their legendary craft at the sametime.

The new games in the franchise are great and give me hope that the ""never again"" part of that story does not hold true. 

Random things i am missing in the sequels, jaw snabbing sound the rabid stalkers make, scooter, threshers, and to some extent the rarity of oranges and pearlescent.

4762,Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games! I played it on ps4 and now I'm playing it again on pc. Tons of fun to play alone or with friends.
4763,"Fun looter shooter with MANY hours of content. Easily the best game in the franchise. Has a ton of variety in most aspects of the combat (ex: guns, gear, skills, etc.) and plenty of DLC content. Still have fun on it with friends even today. Story is not a strong suit, but best of the borderlands games. Overall 9.5/10 game for me."
4764,classic! one of my all time favorite games. i havent played 3 yet but there's no doubt this is the best BL game out there!
4765,It's... it's Borderlands 2. Why are you bothering with reviews? Have you been living in a wall sphincter your whole life? Just play it already.
4766,"Disrespectful towards the player, grating and with a terrible balance. A looter shooter that has a tiny backpack that is almost impossible to upgrade, horrendous balancing and, ultimately, boring. Walk about to find absolutely nothing of interest. Recommended only for those with 0 culture in any area, or those with the sensibilities of a pile of excrement."
4767,Worse than pre-sequel.
4768,"Been playing the series for a while, definitely will say that 2 is my all time favorite of all 3 games. It's just a good trip down memory lane."

4780,This is good fun with plenty of humour thrown in.
4781,"Pretty fun game, very likey the quirkiness"
4782,"Best Borderlands game in the series. Best dialogue, jokes, and characters. The open world can be a bit empty at times but the nostalgia and overall experience is great especially with a friend to play with. Once you play this game the others will feel dull in comparison. 8/10"

This is the only Borderlands that you really need to play. This was made at the Apex, the Peak of story and gameplay. Highly, Highly recommend that you check out this one above 3."
4826,My balls? Itch
4827,The last great Borderlands before they went full-garbage-can Woke.
4828,"Wonderful game as the first one !
(it shows 83 minutes for me, but i did the Borderlands 2 from the Handsome colection version on... hum... Epic...)

Not much change in fact, it does exactly what we want it to do : have fun in open grounds, slaughtering hordes of enemies with crazy weapons, while doing quests, all this wrapped up in a great universe with really smooth humour.

Only little flaw is the balance of level : when you progress the level is right, but when you get to levels 35 something, it gets either too easy against common enemies on common bosses, or impossible against challenge quest bosses (i was maybe a little too greedy, i don't know). I wish it was more about killing a clever enemy that moves differently than just shooting everything you have while waves of sudden death stuff strike you and you don't know what's happening."
4829,"One of the best games i've ever played in my life, great story, good humour and some badass guns, all around a 9/10. Has some issues but they can be overlooked when you're busy kicking ass and getting your ass kicked"

4870,"Borderlands 2 is the second entry in the critically acclaimed ‘Borderlands’ series. This game, in my opinion, is the best in the series, and here’s why I think that.

+ Really good story
+ Awesome Campaign DLCs
+ Lots and Lots of loot to be had
+ Each character is fun to play as (with 2 being DLCs)
+ Lots of action and things to do
+ High replayability
+ Funny and good writing (much better than Borderlands 3)
+ A villain you will love, and love to hate

That being said, there are a few things I actually dislike about this game, and I’ll list those below.

- Legendary loot is extremely rare, and can take hours upon hours of grinding a boss for a legendary you want
- Trying to obtain all the DLC can be a hassle
- Playable characters rarely say anything or react to anything story-wise (they do talk though)
- Currently no true cross-platform play (you can play with friends who own the game on Epic via Shift, but you cannot play with friends on console platforms).

This is a really fun game that will keep you engaged and entertained for hours. This is even more true when you get the DLCs. Like I said previously, the DLCs can be a hassle to obtain, but here’s what I recommend for them: Wait for a sale, and then buy the Handsome Collection and the Commander Lilith and the Fight For Sanctuary DLC, as it’s the only DLC not included in the Handsome Collection. 

Doing this, you’ll have access to all Borderlands 2 DLC, as well as Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and all it’s DLC’s. You’ll get two games, and everything they have to offer.

All-in-all, this is probably my favorite Borderlands game. I even went through the trouble of getting all achievements for it here on Steam, and I’m still working on doing so on PlayStation. You won’t regret getting this game, especially in the way I recommended picking it up. This game is essentially a must-play."
4871,yes good
4872,Great Game and an instant Classic to play!
4873,the one game i always come back to no matter how many hours i put into it never gets old !

4902,"Super fun game, the graphics took some getting used to after playing the first borderlands (GOTY enhanced) but nothing too bad, the amount of gameplay in the DLC is crazy - particularly Tiny Tina"
4903,"The pinnacle of the Borderlands franchise. Yes, Borderlands 3 added a ton of QOL adjustments and improved the smoothness of the overall control, but nothing beats this game. 

This iteration had the best group of characters, best villain, the greatest comedic moments, all tied into that looter shooter goodness we all crave. Even better, the DLC was fantastic. Yeah,  Hammerlock's was fairly average, but Torgue's DLC was chock full of fantastic humor and enjoyment. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is probably the best expansion the series has ever seen, with some fantastic character development which really hits you. 

There were moments in this game where I literally laughed out loud because events were so wild and incredible. If you have never played this game, or the Borderlands franchise, this is a must buy. Especially if you have a group of friends to run thru together. It's pure co-op gaming bliss. 

And best of all, the writing is totally devoid of any fan fiction level, author inserted Gary Stu/Mary Sue characters like Borderlands 3 (aka the Ava project)."

4923,"Borderlands 2 has always been a game I've heard about, played some of (at friends houses) but never really got to experience. That is, until a franchise sale some time ago, and now I am playing it. After playing it  for  a short time, I am very glad I finally got into it. Very unique style for its time, with a cool comic book feel. But aside from some nice visuals, I think the game has a real charm for its humour, kind of self aware, kind of quotable like a movie, not genius but still enjoyable. Yet to play more quests but the missions I've done have been interesting and memorable than something like destiny or risk of rain.

All in all, keen on the rest of this games story, and can recommend this as a nice single/co-op loot n shoot to play. Very friendly for people new to the genre"

Even though you are doing the same thing over and over again, it doesn't get boring because you are constantly getting new gear and unlocking new skills. There is a lot of replayability in this game because you can try out different characters, different loadouts and different playstyles. But I felt that the difficulty is a bit inconsistent, most of the game is quite easy but there are some  difficulty spikes in certain missions"

4952,Truly a Masterpiece of a Game. Sure it may be a little out of date now but in its hay day this was truly an addictive and fun game with tons of content and entertainment. If you are wanting to get into borderlands but are unsure where to start I would start with the remastering of the first game. Once you play that which is a great game itself. You will come to this one with the same wonderment and excitement that I did when first playing.

~pros~
-really fun
-good story
-full coop gameplay for up to 4 players (can be more than 4 with the unlimited coop mod)
-very well optimized 
-low spec requirements meaning its perfect for low end gaming pc or mid-high tier laptop
-easy to edit save files and create modded characters and weapons 
-character customization (not full character customization but unlockable outfits
-full of easter eggs and pop-culture references and jokes including a minecraft easter egg in late game 
-looter-shooter/rpg style gameplay with character leveling and skill points with tiered weapons 
-many grenade mods (vanilla/base game item) you can select any nade you want ""grenade go BOOM!""
-vehicles in certain open areas 
-lots of loot
-lots of chaos

~cons~
-a bug can occur where it says offline in all player slots and wont let you play online (its caused by a bad network file in your game files verifying will fix it almost always) 
-the hd texture pack dlc caused a lot of texture pop in and frame drops and bugs for me but your milage may vary
-CL4PTR4P is annoying
-the game can get extremely hard sometimes if you do quests underleveled 

~tips~
-if you tip moxxxie enough (inside mad moxxxie's in sanctuary) she will give you a gun or 2
-redeem all the available shift codes for golden keys google them and make a shift account 
-golden keys are used for the gold crate in sanctuary and gives you better loot the higher your level
-if you want to edit saves use gibbed save editor from nexus available here https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/21
-also the steam version is more moddable than the epic version
-gaige is a really good character to use she has a mech she can summon to kill enemies for you 
-play with friends its much more fun with friends 
 
my overall thoughts of the game are that you should definetly get a few of your friends together and play this game its amazing 10/10 could not recommend enough

I have around 2000+ hours on ps3-ps4 and I still play this grindy game to this day. This game is all about the story, the boss fights and the loot. If you love grinding and shooting, this is THE game. If I could, I would give a 5 stars"

It's a great game to stay in on a weekend with a group of friends & shoot sh*t up! The more friends you play with the more wild the game gets though. 

After playing the 3rd entry to the series, I appreciate borderlands 2 much more. The humor is better & less cringe & handsome jack is a great bad guy. Oh, & yes borderlands 2 is an old game but, Still holds up very well here in 2022. If you don't already have this game, Make sure to get yourself a copy."

5013,"Welcome to Pandora kiddos, Borderlands 2, this blast of a game is so much fun, The story itself I will not spoil it for newcomers. Let’s just say “it’ll blast you and your face out of the sky”. Gameplay-wise it’s generally fun with over 17750000 weapons (yes I am not kidding you) to collect and use there will always be a new toy for you to play with.. don’t take it out of context. Yes most of them are reskins but that’s gotta be expected. Punching and hitting enemies with melee is also a feature but you’ll barely use it unless it’s a dire situation. The game’s comedy and timing is actually really good and enjoyable, all the characters are and can be funny at the right moments. The world itself is disappointingly ok, you will be walking and driving around an open part of a map with seemingly nothing around you, there are occasional side quests and an most parts of each map have 2 fortresses with enemies, but that’s pretty much it. Graphically I think it’s beautiful for a game made in 2012, facial animations can be awkward but all in all it’s pretty gorgeous. I haven’t exactly found bad bugs cuz I either glossed over them or didn’t exactly find them awful, sometimes I’d see a rag doll glitch out or I would see a graphical bug that lasts for two seconds. I recommend it for anyone wanting to play an interesting kickass game with hilarious characters and cool weapons."

5018,"In an RPG, gear is mostly for your paper doll on the inventory screen, even though it sometimes shows up on the character model, which is really just a 3D paper doll. Your gear’s personality is in the stats. Sure, maybe your pauldrons have spikes on them. That’s pretty cool, but I bet you’re more interested in the effect on your stamina or dexterity. Best case scenario, there’s some sort of particle effect on whatever sword you’re using.

Borderlands 2, an RPG, isn’t shy about numbers. Lord knows I spend enough time comparing the stats of pairs of guns. This one has the bigger magazine, but that one does a smidge more damage. A lot of playing Borderlands is the headshotting and careful shield management, so I don’t have to sweat the numbers too much.

After the jump, the numbers are just the beginning.

But unlike your spiked pauldrons or glowing sword, a gun in Borderlands 2 is so much more than its numbers. Borderlands knew this and Borderlands 2 knows it even more. A gun is the way you hold it, its heft, its kick, the noise it makes, the spin up of the cylinder, the muzzle blast, the way the magazine sticks out at a funny angle, or the reflection in the eyepiece on the sights. A gun is the grip, the barrel, the spitting shell casings, the slap of your palm against a fresh magazine, the decisive metal pieces sliding into place when you chamber the first round. Some guns shoot acid bullets or talk or fire better when aimed. In most action RPGs, the characters are the characters. In Borderlands, guns are people, too. They parade before you on the loading screens. I want about 80% of the guns I see on the loading screens, and I don’t even know their stats.

Of course, the characters are characters as well. It’s always nice to do whatever the left bumper does and sometimes my character talks. But this is a game played in first person. This is a game that features my gun as prominently as Tomb Raider featured Lara Croft’s ass or Doom 2 featured a double-barrelled shotgun. Borderlands 2 is a shooter through and through, and its action RPGness is always in service of it’s shooterness.

Much like the first game, Borderlands 2 can be curiously user-hostile with its interface and pacing. Gun and quest management are particularly awkward. Character advancement is molasses slow, with meaningful rewards for leveling up few and far between. A new system of “bad-ass” ranks dribbles out absurdly incremental improvements that at least apply to all your characters, but I couldn’t care less about a +.2% increase in my loading speed. As an action RPG, Borderlands 2 is mostly about actually playing rather than the rewards. It’s so full of clever touches, and collectibles, and achievements, and funny jokes, and (mostly) easy co-op play that it doesn’t necessarily need faster leveling or better loot progression.

This “actually playing” part is also where the story comes in. There aren’t many action RPGs or shooters worth playing for the story. But there also aren’t many action RPGs or shooters with the writing, sense of humor, and sense of set pieces as Borderlands 2. I’m even tempted to roll out the phrase mise en scene as it might apply to a shooter, but such an academic fancypants terms doesn’t do justice to set pieces like Tiny Tina’s tea party, or Shooty McFace’s brief appearance, or Scooter’s poem for his girlfriend, or how the characters from the first game are used.

I guess the best way to put it is to say Borderlands 2’s mise en scene is so kick-ass that I’m wondering how it happened. I’m not terribly surprised that the studio that made the first Borderlands has created such a wildly good gunplay-based action RPG. But I’m surprised that the studio that stitched together Duke Nukem Forever and all those Brothers in Arms games has also made it such a joy to discover for reasons other than the awesome guns and gunplay. Bravo, Gearbox.

Verdict: 10/10"

5023,"Used to love this game, however recent shift integration has broken the multiplayer experience and locks the game into a loop of ""creating multiplayer session"" with no way to escape other than using alt+f4 or task manager to force close the game, I can not invite friends through shift even though they are online, my friend who has the epic games store version has the same issues and can no longer go online also. the game is no longer co-op.

If you just want single player however have at it as that seems to work just fine.

If the issues are fixed i'll change this back to a positive as it was a great game but for now its unplayable for me and my friends."

5031,"Multiplayer is fine now. I don't know what was happening. 4/16/2022

I have played this game probably since it came out in 2012. It says I have just 60 hours on it, but I have played it for many more hours on PS3. Mostly because my 10 years younger child brother would want to start over to create another character that he'd be happy with. It's not that he was unhappy with his current character, but he would see something else he liked on YouTube and would want to try it. We restarted the game so many times. I thought it was annoying and would try to burn through searching Bullymong piles over and over as fast as I could, but I still enjoyed the game and it was still challenging. It's really fun to feel strong and play the different characters with their unique playstyles that are customizable through their skill trees and complimented with the weapons you get. My buddy and I don't want to play LoL or Dying Light 2 right now and apparently he hasn't played this game so I don't mind starting over all over again for the hundreth time."

5034,"One of my favorite games of all time, I've played through it several times and still love the story and characters.  A great game to play solo or with friends."
5035,NOTHING IS MORE BADASS THAN TREATING WOMEN WITH RESPECT
5036,I love this game so much! I do all the side missions i can just to get more of the game.
5037,"What the hell Gearbox! I come back to BL2 for some loot and shoot fun, and all of a sudden, I'm getting major intermittent stuttering while running a RTX 3060, 16GB or RAM, an i5, and on an SSD. For whatever reason, it has something to do with the Shift server login, because if I play it offline, I have no problems, except that I keep getting asked to login to Shift every damn time I pause the game.

5044,"The frame lag issues make me wish I could get a refund on this game. I have spent countless hours, gpu swaps, FRESH OS INSTALLS, settings and time online troubleshooting this. Its the GAME. Massive stuttering issues every 3-5 sec with 60fps smooth frames in between even on the menu screen. 

WIll not pay for another boarderlands game again."
5045,Game is BUSSIN
5046,OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
5047,Wicked fun shooter.
5048,One of my favorite games of all time i miss those days of playing this on xbox and its still as good as i remember
5049,Great!

5051,Cant play online with friends due to shift network error. Not worth the buy in its present state.
5052,One of the best games ever made hands down.
5053,ive played this game for years and it is awesome and cool and I love it. dont look at my hours its not accurate I played on xbox 360 before shut up
5054,funny
5055,"lots of guns so that's cool
"
5056,"Damn it, this is the moment when I'm internally broke. On the one side the game is so fun, on the other some of the mobs are so OP (Super Badass Pyre Thresher) that I sometimes don't have fun playing this.

So despite the fact that I don't put BL 2 away I definitely DO NOT recommend this game for it's frustrating design of gameplay combined with too strong enemies."
5057,"You need a SHI(F)T account to run this game. And it requires network connection to Gearbox servers, even for single player."
5058,"The randomness of the gun, the overall playthrough is awesome, the characters are funny and Clap Trap is ridiculously comical!"

5061,I get to kill midgets and fat twats 10/10 i also got to kill a ugly tiny pp man named jack and got to fuck a giant monster
5062,yes
5063,get it broski.
5064,2022 Still a good game. You can play even on i5 processor and no graphic card on low settings
5065,guy told me to shoot him in the face so i shot him in the face
5066,I was really hoping to leave claptrap into a ice  fishing hole to rust
5067,It Good Game For C-OP Play
5068,Boom Boom Pew Pew better then borderlands 3 and everything they have put out since.
5069,good times
5070,cant play online with a friend
5071,"Out of all of the games before Tiny Tina's, this is easily hands down the best Borderlands game released. I've completed the game on 5 separate characters on PC and when i used to play on console. if you don't already own this game what are you even doing? 1674/100"
5072,"a great story and it was a big part of my childhood, ive put thousands of hours in on my playstation and I hope people enjoy this game as much as i do"
5073,good game i would say in my opinion i like the game my friend and i beat the 3rd one so i would recommend it
5074,Classic. Wish the Pre-sequel and part 3 had lived up to this one.
5075,"This game is a classic, and it has some of the best writing in any game I've ever played. Handsome Jack is the man... the man you love to hate, yet you hate to love... and that makes you hate yourself a little bit... But life is pain, so you suck it up... No one lives without getting their hands a bit dirty, right?"
5076,favorite borderlands game... originally played it on xbox
5077,No online at all. this is unacceptable for a co-op game like this.
5078,My favorite of all the Borderlands I have played.
5079,"Love the game, brings back plenty of good memories...however, far too many problems trying to connect to friends (or just playing online in general)."
5080,BALLS
5081,Amazing gameplay and controls.
5082,Great game. Loved the story. Catch-A-Riiiide...
5083,Yes
5084,Good
5085,Played even more back on console.  It's ok.
5086,Play as a mad man who kills mad mans...
5087,"amazing
"
5088,its ok
5089,"I definitely enjoyed this comic art style shooter game. It is a wacky, fun, and filled with interesting characters. It's also very low stress, since there are virtually no consequences to failing or dying."
5090,Waste of time. This game hasnt been playable since the day I purchased it. Thought I would give it a go as by now it surely must have been fixed. Nope. 3 years later on a brand new PC and HDD and it's still unresponding.
5091,best game of all time
5092,"I've played over 100 hours of Borderlands 2 on Xbox 360. It works great on PC too. Good story, fun variety of classes and skill trees, and a million different ways to play. I would highly recommend playing with friends!"
5093,
5094,good
5095,can't play online.
5096,its very fun
5097,"It good, basically doom but more cartoon like and less blood."
5098,One of the best games ever made.  If you like looter shooters it's a must.
5099,Is good game
5100,fun game I like getting loot!  Get the same mobs over and over to get more loot.
5101,great game
5102,best game

5104,fun
5105,"B O N G
"
5106,
5107,even after 6 years i still remember the location and the place where i first got to play this so for me its a great game that i like.
5108,"I've played this game since it's release, and every aspect of the game is amazing. the story into the guns and even side missions, the only thing i can generally dislike is the much more difficult late game going into level 50+"
5109,i like that i can play this game offline and it will also save my progress along with all the different classifications on your people and weapons them self.  the love for this game mainly comes from years of playing and i do recommend the DLC packs.
5110,Yes
5111,slab
5112,the when
5113,Very fun.
5114,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhiiiiiiii love it!
5115,Lots of possibilities without feeling too overwhelming.
5116,great game series
5117,Graphics: Paper Mache
5118,"The graphics in this game are refreshingly different than most other games.  The backgrounds and characters are drawn with a cartoon style, which I am enjoying.  The gameplay is responsive and the sound effects are great.  Highly recommended!  AND It plays FLAWLESSLY on Linux Mint 20.3!!!"
5119,genuinely one of the best games ever made. As it is an old game there are a few minor bugs but the game play still feels crisp and fun 10 years later. Would recommend all of the DLCs' as well.
5120,good game
5121,meh
5122,"Love this game, and loved it since release. It's known to have issues at times. After a month an a half of personal troubleshooting it seems like I might actually be able to play it beyond the first mini-boss fight."
5123,Great game. Greedy developes.
5124,Epic game
5125,"Ever since the update to the shift system 2 years ago, the game is impossible to play multiplayer. I'm half convinced that they ruined the game just so they can sell borderlands 3. Still, it was a fun experience while it lasted, and it's still great if you enjoy single player."
5126,"All time Classic
"
5127,worst game ever. weapons are too weak with low capacity. you need to waste 200 shots to just kill a creep with no armor. i don't know why people say this game is good
5128,I FUCKING LOVE LEAN
5129,awesome one of the best
5130,good game
5131,fun game
5132,The Count from Sesame Street is less obsessed with numbers than I do when I play this game.
5133,Have loved this game for years <3 and still do! always entertaining and always fun to co-op with friends!
5134,"I'm not the person most into first person shooter games, but I've always loved the Borderlands series, even the pre-sequel that was so hated on. But this isn't a pre-sequel review, this is a BDL2 review. 
The wacky, crazy characters, action-packed psychotic gameplay, dystopian environment, the multitude of enemies and monsters lurker beyond... and perhaps the best villain, Handsome Jack. Every character has such a unique personality and gameplay. This fusion between first person shooter and RPG made aspects such as the skill tree or cosmetics even cooler. Even side characters make the world of BDL richer and thrilling.
But BDL can't be BDL without the cartoonish features, array of weapons, numerous elements (slag, fire, electric...) and lunatic gameplay. There are just an infinite option of weapons, grenades, vehicles. Every run feels so fresh and new. The joy of getting that gun you farmed for, that 97% Sham shield that is so rare. It never ends, not till TVHM, not UVHM. It's the spirit of BDL.
And yes, sometimes it gets a bit boring to farm.
But who really forced you to do it? Because its borderlands, its the world of lunatics and cults,
and you're free to do whatever you like, and push onwards... forwards and ahead."
5135,Still rocks
5136,"This is YOUR looter shooter, and mine"
5137,fun
5138,gamne so fire
5139,fun but the UI is dogshit and it's glitchy as fuck at times. not to mention that the inventory system is doodoo ass cheeks
5140,"Fun w/friends

5142,just a lot of and replayable

5145,Great co-op!
5146,"I played this game when i was young and loved it yet never completed it. Definitely a great game and I recommend it, waiting for myself to have a game drout and decide to attempt to take this game back up and finish it ^^"
5147,doppe a rope
5148,GUNS GO BOOM
5149,GOOOD
5150,Great game and the GOTY edition is a super value!

5152,guns go brrr

5164,Gam
5165,hella fun
5166,Borderlands 2 has been the best experience of any co-op FPS I have ever played. Buy the game if you haven't.
5167,FRIENDSHIP! COMRADERY! EXPLOSIONS!
5168,hermoso
5169,Absolutely wonderful and so funny! I love this game! If you like shooters this is wonderful and a great story as well

5175,it's a fun game
5176,very fun for people who like dungeon looters mixed with a shooter and roleplaying games
5177,"this game is sick, really grindy but overall this game is a masterpiece"
5178,Love the humor and the sexy play time
5179,It's Borderlands 2. A near perfect game that still plays better than all the Borderlands games that have been released since it.
5180,yumyum good game because it has good stuff and story lines
5181,"Imagine Borderlands 1 without the fun, or better yet - Borderlands 1: General Knoxx's Armory."
5182,yes

10/10"
5191,NICE
5192,"Good story, get good guns to get gooder guns"
5193,"Borderlands 2 is an amazing game that i would recommend to annyone, but when Borderlands 3 came out it was way more superiour in combat (defenetly not in story). So id recommend this to story invested people who can grind for hour's at a time for something a little better each time it even drops, id recommend Borderlands 3 to someone who is not as much story invested but more combat invested because as i said, it's far more superiour in combat. ofcourse id just start with recommending the whole trilogy to story people but this game review is about Borderlands 2. Not all of Borderlands."
5194,"Warning to anyone walking into this game without knowledge of the commander lilith dlc garbage. After reaching level 72, you will not be able to go on to level 80 or OP levels in the digistruct pack because the company did a cash grab and now requires you to pay another 15 bucks to play that content that you otherwise paid for. If I had known this, I would not have bought this edition. It's grimy and they should be embarrassed. 

Until they make commander lilith DLC free, there is no way I could ever recommend this."

It's fun, it's stupid, sometimes funny and visually an intriguing game that at the time I think it was a graphical masterpiece.

Its not a 10/10, but it doesn't need to be to be classified as a classic."
5207,Awesome game!

I've played it ever since I was a young kid in my childhood and I plan to keep playing it for years to come, it's incredible"
5228,.
5229,I like this game
5230,it was great but kinda hard and i haven't reached the end of borderlands 1 it was super cool and looked really cool as well i'd like to see another one come out in a couple of years

5239,I WOULD recommend this game but NOW this game has WAY too many issues I cant play the game without it stuttering every 3 seconds. FPS Drops Constantly even at the LOWEST SETTINGS its simply unplayable
5240,"amazing game, would absoluty love if writing and gameplay and size were built on in new titles"
5241,10/10 would recommend playing if you still haven't yet and you can always come back for the memories as it's still a fun game even in today's standard.
5242,i like
5243,a fucking classic with fucking dope ass guning fucking up bad fuckers. oh and face mcshooty. may your wisdom live on.
5244,I love the shirtless dudes 🤤🤤🤤 PLEASE ADD NUDITY OPTION??
5245,"borderlands 2 was one of the games i started playing back on the xbox. i had to get it for the unofficial patch on pc and its good have no complaints. The game has lots of replayability and you can always go for a different character or a different build. you can play 4 player co-op witch is great and they have great comedy inside the game too. would highly recommend
"
5246,"The undisputed [b] KING [/b] of looter shooters. Borderlands 2 aged like fine wine, and still receives the occasional update keeping it fresh and living. It's shockingly cheap for all the time you can get out of it; a great modloader tutorial, and overall an amazing game. 

10/10, absolute classic.
TL;DR - More addictive than meth."
5247,it's fun
5248,"iits sickkkk
"
5249,"Awesome game! One of my favorites of all time. Great shooting, lots of guns, the dialogue is hilarious. Just really such a cool game."
5250,"legit one of the best games ever made, the villain handsome jack, the best character in all of gaming, the characters are fun to play as, even the dlc is some of the best in gaming, if you can buy it, do it"
5251,love this game
5252,it's a fun game if you don't mind farming a little for xp or items. the story is pretty descent but the characters can have so many fun and different builds.

5254,"1 Player: Run and gun let's blow some things up woo!
2 Player: Roughly the same, but with a friend.(Arguably the most fun)
3 Player: Enemies are bullet sponges, you're playing this because you have a 3rd friend you don't want to leave out.
4 Player: Your guns are like throwing toothpicks and every enemy can lop your head right off, not to mention you're getting zerg rushed. (Arguably the least fun)"
5255,gud game
5256,Yes
5257,.
5258,This is the only game that matters.
5259,"This game still has appeal.. its a crazy nother world, but lots of shooting and looting, I'm not a fan of the epics .. I like good old fashioned run and gun .. Borderlands and Borderlands 2 are great, although they have their downsides, The games can swing wildly back and forth between frustrating in some of the quirky junk, and the silly time trials .. boring, also the arid lifeless environment, dark caverns, etc, can become boring.. still, te games offer a lot of fun too."
5260,nice
5261,"This is an initial review - I've only beaten the game once and have played for about 30 hours. 

This game is a lot of fun, if you're looking for a shooting game where you can kill a wide variety of enemies and collect loot then this is the game for you. Usually I'll listen to music or zone out while I'm gaming but the characters in this game are so interesting that you want to play with sound and learn more about them. I've never played a game before where every character I've met was a contender to be my favorite. You meet one character and think, ""Wow this guy is awesome"" and then you meet the NPC in the next zone and now she's your favorite. Almost every character is highly entertaining and there were only a few that I was indifferent about. Jack is one of the best villains in any game I've ever played, he's methodical, funny as all hell, yet very intimidating and threatening. 

Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it. I have yet to play the other Borderlands games or the Vault Hunter mode but the base game is well worth it. 

"
5262,Very fun :D
5263,muy bien
5264,good
5265,"While the graphics sometimes look dated, Borderlands 2 is still an immersive world with hilarious dialogue, fantastically written characters and fun and frantic gameplay. Highlights include:

[*]Missions that feel like playing along with a protracted joke set-up, like the one where you have to reinstall the robot AI core that promises not to try and kill you. Spoiler:[spoiler]it lies, repeatedly.[/spoiler]The conclusion to that one had me laughing out loud.
[*]Handsome Jack, possibly the vilest and most charismatic antagonist ever written.
[*]Guns that you'll be torn over discarding for something with more firepower because you're in love with their animation.
[*]The charming village of Sanctuary and all its polite citizens."
5266,"best borderlands, dont buy 3"
5267,bl2
5268,idk when or where I got this but I don't play it
5269,this gae is so good
5270,"The Borderlands I have gamed are, BL, BL2, BLPS, and BL3. 
The publishers only thought about classic video gaming from the '80s and '90s and not present-day gaming and uses of the internet.  As well the BL publishers did not think about out-of-game politics.    

Most short story missions will take in time about one hour, if the gamer does not make an error, with the player.  Long story missions take at least two hours, and there is always a story mission of three hours in each game.  Who can game for this long and not get hacked or this much free time on a week night.   

All the borderland games themselves are pretty good and is where I met some good friends, but now there is rarely anyone in co-op games with random's persons'.

The game's dark humor and dark graphics to go along with the darkness can sometimes get to ya in a bad way ;(  

I like the persons' I have met in the BL games, and am glad to have bought the set.  Once you meet someone persons', you can game many different games with all your friends."
5271,very poggie woggies definitely made me go myehhhh
5272,"Game good, very fun. Bad guy funny. :)"
5273,Good game. I own at least 3 copies of this game

5280,I LIKE THIS GAME LOTS OF FUN :]
5281,"While Borderlands 3 had some QoL improvements, Borderlands 2 remains the peak of the series."
5282,Borderlands Pog
5283,"Great game. Awesome story!. Borderlands 2 and 3 are really similar, both have a great story!"
5284,"A game I have played several times over, and keep coming back to it for another go. Over 650 hours to date, so well worth the money.
"
5285,"lots of content to explore. Has a lively community. Can be  challenging, and stupidly difficult if you play hard enough."
5286,zero is hot
5287,"yes
"
5288,"I love this game
"
5289,"A bit longer than it should be, but the whole looter shooter thing is hella good. Also, revolvers feel glorious in this"
5290,good
5291,"I have had to go in and rename the launcher in order to even get it going, then it have issues maintaining a connection to Steam and locks me in a load loop.  I have tried th fixes for that and none of them have worked.  I wish all of these had appeared from the beginning but it worked fine for the first day, now I can't return it to Steam."

5298,"it's a great open world and replayable game def better with friends
"
5299,fun stuff
5300,Best of The Series
5301,This is a top 10 game of all time for me. I can't say enough good things about it.
5302,"As janky as this game is, it's the most fun type of jank possible. Most bugs tend to accidentally make the gameplay even more fun than it would be otherwise (e.g. gunzerk crit stealing) and you practically have to go out of your way for any experience ruining bugs/crashes. The net code is also super jank but thankfully not in any way that makes hitting your target particularly difficult as a client rather than host, yet again almost all game breaking net code issues require you to do something intentionally. Personally my biggest issue with the game is how overpowered certain weapons are, especially in normal mode, though that's not a problem if you aren't the type of person to overly min-max. Add in the community made mods that completely change the meta and you have one incredible deal if you buy the handsome collection on sale for ~$10 usd"
5303,"The complete Borderlands 2 package is, without a doubt, one of the BEST deals in gaming history. 

For a game that came out in 2012, it holds up in an incredibly robust way 10 years later from just a gameplay perspective. It may lack some tropes of newer games like standard mobility gimmicks (sliding/clambering), and the port may have some wonky menu controls, but the game is very easy to acclimate to quickly and vastly rewarding for prolonged experience. 

With a dummy stupid amount of weapons across a vast swath of archetypes to choose from, an incredibly simple yet esoteric RPG system across 6 diverse playable characters each with their own unique builds, a butt ton of exploration bursting at the seams with pop culture references and childish humor, and a vast array of customization and challenges to find/unlock/discover, the complete Borderlands 2 package deserves a place within your library if for some dumbass reason it isn't there already. 

Definitely pick this up when it's on sale as the total cost is far better than it is out of season, but all in all it's not a bad purchase considering it got quality of life updates (including cross platform play) within 3 years ago for a 10 year old title."
5304,"Does everything worse than the first one, muddier and blurrier graphics, bullet sponge enemies, weak-sauce weapons, loot that is always vendor trash, getting stuck on terrain, vehicles that make me motion sick. Literally everything they could do wrong they did. This game is absolute ass, do not buy it, do not play it. The only people who could truly be fans of this series are the severely brain damaged. Not to mention the bugs, like bullets hitting invisible walls, enemies spawning out of thin air, indicators not showing up.

Edit: Forgot to mention the cringe-inducing dialogue and attempts at meme humour that makes me want to dig out my frontal lobe with an ice cream scoop with characters that never shut the fuck up, frequently cutting each other off or getting cut off by level loads. Absolutely fucking terrible, the writers should be ashamed of themselves."
5305,Down bad for Moxxi for over 10 years fr
5306,it is fun
5307,good game

5315,if you like wasting time play this game and when complete it mod the living crap out of it play it for longer good story this game has a villian you love to hate and its awsome everytime you play through it
5316,"really good

like good good

too much trolling"
5317,One of my favorite games of all time and not a fan of FPS
5318,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddd
5319,Good looter shooter
5320,yes
5321,Gud
5322,This is RIDICULOUS!
5323,"I finished the first Borderlands not long after it came out. There wasn't much to it and the side quests were the main driving force of the plot. This is not the case, however, in Borderlands 2. In Borderlands 2 the driving force of the plot are the main quests and it's a poor plot with a generic evil villain who they tried to make funny but he just wasn't. Borderlands 2 still has a hell of a lot of side quests but they're simply there to level up your character because, towards the end of the main story, they buff up the difficulty by throwing lots of enemies at you who have stupid amounts of health and can one shot you. If you die you don't go very far back, but that one enemy who has killed you ten times is gonna be there with all its health back.

I played this game over a period of ten years, from when it came out to when I finished it; constantly restarting with the hopes that this class will be better, but it wasn't. The game is just boring and far too long. Even the huge climactic battle was boring and the last boss ended up glitching and not attacking me or moving which was good for me cause I had run out of ammo and if I reset, I would have had to chip its health bar away for twenty minutes again.

I can't recommend a game I resent so much for making me loathe doing its missions. A lot of people seem to be in the opposite camp but this is just my short review."
5324,It's mid
5325,good game
5326,"This game is sick! Love the graphics, the storyline, it has a lot of interesting battles and bosses to fight, and there is even lots of missions that are fun to do. Sometimes a piece of shit might kill you or you die a lot even if you get lots of xp and cash but other than that everything the game has to offer is amazing!!! I will keep on playing it and i'ma buy Borderlands 3 next and continue these great classic insane story mode games...

Can't wait to see what's next from the franchise and the company.!"
5327,"Eh, its okay"
5328,Dis Mah Favorite Gaem!
5329,"awesome game, its really worth playing especially if you play with friends."
5330,shooty gun
5331,wow this game is pretty cool
5332,"Worse than bl3 cuz the gunplay is pretty damn clunky nowadays, but I can't hate this game when it does so many things great. If it was remastered it would be better than bl3."
5333,claptrap
5334,It's great
5335,"The best thing about BL2 is that most people can enjoy it. For casual players that want to enjoy a good story with fun side quests and solid gunplay, youll enjoy BL2. For the hardcore players that want to grind till the end of time with the game, you can also have a lot of fun with this game."
5336,yuur its a goodie
5337,"10/10 but i wish claptrap would be quiet 
"
5338,"Good game, would highly recommend if you're a  fan of looter shooters."
5339,love it 10/10
5340,"Amazing, i've played this game and the ones post and previous as soon as they released and i love every single borderlands."
5341,Nice game.
5342,I got this game when it first came out and honestly forgot about it. But I recently finished the main story and it was super fun. I like that I was able to play with friends even if we were at different parts of the game. It does suck that you cannot cross-play with mac and windows rn due to updates but besides that this game was super fun and now I'm working on the DLC's! :)
5343,"Borderlands 2: The Electric Tail of Pikachu is a massively enjoyable ride perfectly balancing the goofiest and silliest story with the most dramatic and emotional punches I have felt from a video game in years. The gameplay is outstanding, a highly enjoyable open world looter-shooter with a plethora of sidequests to do that the game can easily eat up your time. I have played it quite a lot on XBox, and only 46 hours on PC, however I have only gotten about 3/4th or 3/5th through the main story and haven't touched the massive amount of equally fantastic DLC. I highly recommend buying this game, specifically look for the Handsome Jack Collection so you'll get all but one of the DLC, or find something that also includes Borderlands 1 GOTY Edition, as that game is also very very good."
5344,One of the best of the best of the best of the best.
5345,now this is a fun game 7.2/10
5346,"Fairly entertaining, closely similar to the first one. Loot, shoot and explore at your own pace. Almost limitless amount of weapons and play styles."
5347,Rad
5348,Easily the best game out of the borderlands franchise :)
5349,"Fun and crazy with a lot to do, if only the level didn't have a cap. and allowed you to get all perks but still fun as hell."
5350,Classic.
5351,"Terry Pratchett once wrote that Tolkien's Lord of the Rings has become a mountain to fantasy, with his effects appearing in all subsequent fantasy like Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. ""Sometimes its big and up close. Sometimes its a shape on the horizon. Sometimes its not there at all, which means that the artist either has made a deliberate decision against it, or is, in fact, standing on Mt. Fuji.""

There is a point in a game genre when mastery is reached; where the core formula is so well-implemented and rehearsed that all further deviations or experiments in the space live in the shadow of the definitive game. For metroidvanias, that game is Hollow Knight. For soulslikes, that game is Dark Souls 3. For western RPGs, that game is Skyrim. And like Tolkien in fantasy or Mt. Fuji in Japanese prints, for cooperative shooters, that game is Borderlands 2.

Is it a perfect game? Hell-the-fuck-no. The story is serviceable at best, the higher levels are a massive grindfest, the variety of the game's loot evaporates when discussing viable high-level builds, and the game's pacing, especially surrounding its early story, is best described as a one-legged man in a sprinting contest.

But despite that, there's so much Borderlands 2 does *right* that makes it almost impossible to beat, even by its - by all accounts excellent - threequel.

First off, this is a game that was built in the heydey of the 360 era, which means content aplenty, pleasing visuals that bridge the gap between basic and detailed, excellent DLC and no microtransactions. Coop is  where it shines the most, of course - Borderlands in general is the last vestige of an era of couch coop splitscreen - and the game's best experienced with one or more friends. But even solo, the game looks and feels like it was built at the height of the AAA games industry, with a huge budget, wide creative control, representation without tokenism, and tight gameplay that - while not necessarily the deepest shooter on the market - is certainly one of the widest.

Outside of moment-to-moment gameplay, while the story can best be described as an extremely long and crude belch - mostly interesting for reasons well beyond anything the story itself does - the game's cast of characters and its voice acting are charmingly obnoxious, loveably tropey and crude without being overly offensive in a way that simply isn't possible in a modern world where a trending twitter hash can end entire careers (and sometimes deservedly so!).

Overall, Borderlands 2 is a game that's 10 years old (at time of writing) which, between 360 and PC, takes its place as one of my most played games of all time, superceded only by MMOs and Minecraft. At various points I've mastered every character, beaten every obstacle, discovered every secret, and still, 10 years later, I return for more. It's not just nostalgia talking - BL2 is the type of game that simply doesn't get made today, but which will hold up well past tomorrow. It's the kind of game I'll be booting up and replaying another 25 years from now, the type of game I built friendships over back in the 2010s in high school and hope to someday play with a wife or a kid. Its the kind of game I look to when designing my own, to find a model of what was done right.

It is, simply put, a masterpiece, and an absolute must-own for anyone who enjoys coop, shooters, or both."

5413,/
5414,it gud o ya
5415,Borderlands 2
5416,good gem
5417,"The game is fun because it allows you to kill stuff like GTA, but allows for character development with the NPCs. The 'Loot and Shoot' aspect is also quite nice as you can achieve weapons from completing missions instead of directly shooting the 'bad guys'."
5418,One of the BEST games ever!
5419,literally the best looter shooter EVER !!!! I only have a few hours on pc but i have Hundreds on console. one of my favorite games and will definitely will be in my heart for many years to come. i have been looking for a game similar to this but ive come up empty each time. stop reading this review and just get it already. you wont regret it.
5420,"just play it you well see
"
5421,"'
"
5422,"Skip this one. Both Borderlands 1 and the pre-sequel are significantly better games. BL2 is balanced terribly, looting is crap, and the chance of finding good legendaries is abysmal. None of the playable characters are very good, and at no point in the entire game will you ever feel powerful. You pretty much just barely scrape by through the whole game, spending way too much time in ""Fight For Your Life,"" and killing most bosses by ""death running"" them. The story is okay, but it's a slog to play through, and the online play is spotty at best. The worst part is that you absolutely CANNOT play how you want to play. No matter what character you use, you have to spec a specific way or you'll just die constantly. And in order to play on the higher difficulty, you HAVE to have very specific legendary equipment, or you might as well not even bother. It's also incredibly hard to play solo. Borderlands 2 is by far, the weakest game of the entire series. I recommend skipping straight to the pre-sequel, which is actually playable. Watch YouTube videos for the story beats and Tiny Tina stuff if the lore really interests you. It'll save you a lot of time and frustration."
5423,"Awesome game, ahead of its time. so much to do."
5424,"I'm a little teapot, bloody and cut. Here is my handle and here is my butt.

5427,Hell of a game
5428,is pretty good my guy
5429,Easily the 13th best game i ever played
5430,I like the storyline and the interface of character interactions. Missions are fun and the humor plus great graphics make Borderlands 2 an overall favorite FPS. Highly recommend premium version for skin and weapon upgrades.
5431,is not as violent as it says
5432,"GOOD 
"
5433,"I've played 22 hours on PC but I've played for (easily) over 500 hours on console. I don't want to say I've played any more than that because I don't have any certainty if that would be true or not or to what extent. This game is one of the very best games I've played. There is an amazing story to this game that I wish other people could experience, although it helps making the experience more enjoyable playing with friends. It was the go to game whenever I got home from school. The grinding and the guns you can get is truly an experience that can only be lived in Borderlands 2. RIP YOTESLAYA..."
5434,ver gud
5435,"Years later this game is still amazing.  Highly recommend, timeless graphics, great gameplay, and hilarious story that is way better than bl3."
5436,"good shooty gun game and stuff, bit dated no ledge mantling or anything like modern shooters. a few minor odd performance issues (crash to desktop in the opportunity area for some reason and alt tab can freeze my game half way through my first play through) from it being so old but nothing so major as to prevent someone from finishing the game.

great if you want to check out the more classic borderland class trees and experiences, it worth play as gage the mechromancer from the dlc for whole other style of shooter play -700% accuracy +700% dmg boost paired with 50 of missed shots bounce back at targerts and do 50% dmg.... you just shot the floor next to so some guy and your 1000 dmg rifle bounces 4000 dmg bullets back at them.....and if you hit directly 8000 dmg its like what...."
5437,"contrary to what's on the record, I've been playing borderlands 2 on this account for more than 50 hours. It really is a good game even though i only started playing it around a year ago. still holds up against some of the more later games that has been released in the last decade"

5453,"Only really play if you have friends or if there are other people available.

like for the zany insanity of everything, hate for the grind and long walks. Up for the environment and aesthetics, down for the single player loneliness. improved variety, abysmal drop rates, as even if I get legendaries, they're for other classes 20+ levels, which is too many hours to get for me myself. Got ran over somehow by the train in Lynchtown when walking in once (about two characters up from the top of the train airlock) and bad luck never stopped from there.

ATM, feel like buying the Handsome Collection is a mistake, as I don't wanna finish the DLC, and Commander Lilith DLC is separate for an extra $15"

5458,"Recently replayed this, it still effortlessly holds up against modern looter shooters. 

Brilliant"
5459,it is the best game ever it is also my first game i ever played 10-10
5460,I NEED MORE I NEED MORE I NEED MORE I NEED MORE GUNZ
5461,possibly the best borderlands there is amazing game if your into 1 person shooters maybe give it a go
5462,"This is one of my all time favorite games, the characters are unique, fun and exiting. The gameplay does not feel repetitive. As a solo game is really fun but as a multiplayer player game, that’s where it really where it shines. With friends it’s a game that never leaves your heart."
5463,Good
5464,It's a very good game
5465,best game ever made

5480,awesome game!
5481,freaking noiceeeeeeeee
5482,"GG, good plot and characters but the terminology / slurs used are very outdated and need updated."
5483,It's a solid Looter-Shooter
5484,good
5485,It's a classic.
5486,Loot. Guns. Action. Arcade looks made real and general redunkulousness. If you want a game to shoot baddies with your buddies this is a good one for it. The loot makes EVERY gun (almost) a different gun. I played a TON of Zer0 and enjoyed it thoroughly. I miss him in three.
5487,A definite favorite
5488,The story is very playable as its action-packed style and intriguing script gives it enjoyment as well as memorable gaming moments and funny quotes.

5498,"splendid videogame
"
5499,One of the best FPS games I have ever played with amazing DLC to top it off!
5500,"Best of the series storywise, passable for gunplay, and doesn't contain Ava


A win in my book


But seriously, there's more content in this game, despite being so much smaller than 3. More side missions, more unique enemies, more bosses, the headhunter fights are fun, the main DLCs are awesome (especially Torgue's Campaign Of Carnage), the villain is fuckin' iconic, and the locations don't feel as barren and lifeless as they did in 3


Worth getting. Use the handsome collection bundle and get everything you don't own for a solid discount. Many hours of content, and a New Game+ mode, ensure you have plenty of reason to solo this, or play with up to 3 friends."
5501,Great game
5502,"Had a ton of laughs and an amazing time with my friends but it was fun playing and farming solo too.
Also Mr. Torgue is the best character in any game ever, followed closely by Tiny Tina.
Buy this with dlcs so you don't miss out on gaming's best character. EXPLOSIONS!!"
5503,Moxie is hot
5504,"Honestly, after playing all the borderlands games, this one is the best. 1 was also good, 3 was okay, don't play the pre-sequel. Just stick to this one."
5505,"at long last, i saw her standing yonder pon the hillside, and lo, there i stood, to call only to the wind: ""yeah,  it's a pretty good game"""
5506,"i cant get passed this stupid bloodshot stronghold place and btw im rating it lower not cuz of the story and the gameplay, i ranked it lower cuz you depend on the game to save ur progress and sometimes it makes me restart things, and next since its old the game acts weird sometimes, other than that ill give it a 8.3/10"

The main antagonist is one of the best I've seen (ily Jack)

5550,"If you liked Borderlands the original, you will like Borderlands 2. Borderlands 3 has a gun the fires guns however, and I think that's just silly. Kind of like Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks. Because no one expects the Spanish Inquisition!"
5551,"Excellent game, great strategies required with weapons selections.  The first 3 releases of the franchise were quite interesting, with a good story line and battles.  Unfortunately BL 3 was a huge disappointment, with a story derived from man-hating fems without some agenda.  I would highly recommend BL1, BL2, and the Prequel. Great games with lots of DLC.  BL 3? Don't bother."

5577,"good game, great story, amazing traveling locations, pretty Awsome soundtrack(check out the ttdk OST its really good) and great guns 2 use."
5578,"This game is the best combo of looting, shooting, and humor.  It holds up after 10 years and has more heart/character than Destiny or any other title in the genre.  If you have never played BL2, start immediately... it is worth all of your free time."

5610,"Like the first game in this series, I had a lot of fun playing it! The story was dramatically improved from the first too, which was fun!"
5611,This game was fun
5612,"Very good story, gameplay, and jokes. In my opinion it's the best Borderlands game."
5613,good :)
5614,Fun for the whole family.
5615,it's feckin great
5616,good game just play it ...!
5617,I've had papercuts more amusing than the script in this game.
5618,its fun
5619,Good o'l loot n shoot

5621,"Dogshit. The single most buggy game I've ever played, and I never even got to play it. I had dealt with at least 5 individual bugs (3 literally game breaking) before I even gained control of my character. So great that there's no support anywhere for this game. Not like it would matter, since I'd just encounter another bug right after solving the first one."
5622,h
5623,"Edited! Great game, sadly couldnt finish because of freezes on last boss... but at last i found solution - freezes were caused by aoe skill on my char - Gaige, needed to rest a skill tree and all correct. Game is amazing and worth buying."
5624,"Its Borderlands 2, what more do ou expect?"
5625,Very nice game to play with friend
5626,Just rubbish. Gun fights are shit. mates made me play it and its sooo fucken bad
5627,Writing a game review is such a personal thing... I don't want to go there.
5628,The story line is hilarous kept me laughing even though i died many times.  Defintely adult oriented. One of the best RPG shooters out there.

5634,"Finally finished the game, overall it's fun. I don't like replaying to max a character out and the new DLC is just painful honestly. Play it with some friends for maximum fun."
5635,BORRRRRRRRRRINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG
5636,yessss
5637,"At the moment I only have 5 hours in the game - which isn’t much , yet I’m having so much fun!
I’m actually an epileptic person, so playing this game is very uneasy and hard for me - it’s a very flashy game and there isn’t a way to make it less live risking for me so me and my friend ( shout out for shifty!! :D ily ) are playing in 40 min sections in the game with less brightness to prevent seizures. Which is very uncomfy but def worth the effort!
The game is very funny, visually entertaining and interesting to play! 
I’m really not the type to play 3d games and violent games, but borderlands 2 is def an exaction !! 
I hope I won’t take it back as I’ll play the game. Good night! :D"
5638,yes
5639,"Seminal gaming experience. Literature for our age. Also, Pimentacos."
5640,I very much recommend this game for new borderlands players

5642,"Best Borderlands game ever.  Granted ive only played 1 and 2, i still vote 2 for #1."
5643,"fantastic game, great story, great game play. 10/10"
5644,"Easily the best looter shooter. If you have friends, it's even better. If you can all play consistently and be a similar level, this is the best Borderlands by far. If you're friends can't play as often, or you're that one friend (me) who's never leveled up, Borderlands 3 is better for co-op because of the level balancing mechanic. For reference, when my friends first introduced me to Borderlands back on Xbox, I bought this one on Xbox and we played 15 hours straight. I don't play anything longer than 3-4 hours without breaks ever.
Story: 10/10
Gameplay: 9/10 (Guns are weird lets say that. If you don't mind it then it'd be 10/10)
Co-op: 10/10 easiest thing to do
Solo: 9/10 it's a challenge for less experienced players but it's completely doable.
Humor: 10/10
Soundtrack: 10/10"
5645,"killing psycho fun
"
5646,"If you're considering getting this game - just get it!  It's got a great script (funny dialogue, plays to the humor of Gen Z a lot), fun combat, and a really unique art style.  This game has aged super well.  If you're unfamiliar with the play style as I was, think of it as similar to Fallout, but the storyline is a lot more set and it focuses on the run and gun mechanics."
5647,good game
5648,"Gameplay and storyline is unmatched.  For an ""old game,"" it's stellar."
5649,good
5650,"Fun concept and well thought out for 2012, worth it. Even the DLC's are worth it
"
5651,"no excuse not to buy when its on a special like i did, i now own it on both xboxs and pc. still holds up as one of the best looter shooters today"
5652,borderlands 2
5653,good
5654,I have played this game since I was a child. It is amazingly well built. The storyline and villain are amazing and the jokes land nearly everytime. I have bought this game on every console and device I own that its compatible with. If you are looking for a good fps this game is a good one to play. Every character has unique skilltrees and have extremely flexible gameplay styles.
5655,Kinda fun but gets abit long
5656,"very gud
"
5657,Borderlands is just a masterpiece
5658,"I really recommend this game if you're ok with grinding for loot, it is a fun shooter and even more if you're playing with friend.
This is one of the few games I would say that this is a must play for gamers that like shooters."
5659,very fun
5660,I've got many hours into this game and it is a classic. No issues running it with a newer system like other older games I've played and one of my all time favorite games. You're doing yourself a disservice if you never play through the game at least once.
5661,Yes
5662,"READ BEFORE BUYING:
I've played long enough to know what this game's problem is, so I am going to do it quick and easy to understand (normal modes is basically a tutorial, real game is Vault Hunter Mode, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and 0P+1 to 10)
>You play the game as intended, make your way through countless bulletsponges.
>You finish the quest and find a huge loot chest at the end of it.
>You get 4 shitty green rarity grenades or 1 green rarity bazooka.
>This keeps happening over and over again + having to deal with bulletspone enemies.
>Your weapons get extremelly underlevel.
>You do no damage to enemies while they one shoot you, you get fed up.
>You investigate ways to cheese the game, and discover chest farming.
>You pick the most optimized and fastest chest farming option.
>Go to that location, get yourself to the chest, you find everything sucks too, Quit & Save, Continue.
>Repeat the farming of the chest + Quit & Save + Continue.
>After maybe 3 or 5 hours you finally find some decent equipment that match the level of your enemies.
>You start to enjoy the game again.
>You level up.
>The enemies level up.
>The guns that took you soo long to get through countless hours of tedious and repetetitive chest farming are now useless.
>You must find another optimized way to farm guns out of a chest or you stand no chance against the enemies.
>If you still keep trying to play the game, then you force yourself to sit and repeat the same process of Quit & Save again even more.
>After another long time you find some usefull weapons that they will soon enough become useless and underlevel.

This game is fun, honestly, its really beautifull the design and all but alot of things suck alot, the nature of the game makes it so that your guns suck, or if they dont suck, they will suck eventually.
You are always thrown into battles and combat where there is little to no cover, what kind of shooter has no cover? wtf?! most bossess have huge AOE and you have nowhere to seek cover, so you end up one shoted, you die alot, until the game decides to nerf itself (yes, this literally happens and one famous known nerf is the Overlook beacon mission) Bossess have massive AOE with tons of damage and you have no cover and without any dodge mechanic.
Basically this game is only playable if you have extremelly powerfull guns, guns that you only can get through gruelling wastefull grinding and farming, farming that will drive you insane eventually.
But this game can be fun, it will be fun as long as your guns dont get underlevel."
5663,i beat this game on the ps vita
5664,"I really enjoy this game. I remember when me and my sister would play borderland together, and this game kept enough of what the original had that I actually haven't had that memory corrupted. I genuinely love this series."
5665,Overall one of my favorite games for many years.
5666,nice
5667,"a sexy maniac named a diamond horse after me, except he didn't and was actually degrading me which was hot 1000/10"
5668,"In my humble opinion, its the greatest game ever."
5669,"Borderlands 2 is just a got to have game, if you like massive looter shooters this is the game for you, i've played this game from the start of it time back on Playstation 3 and still absolutely love it, yeah the intro is slow but once youve done it multiple times you kinda find new ways to make it a bit quicker, the whole load of DLCs for the game are actually amazing with just as good story lines as the main story, you cant go wrong, if anyone would like to play some time please feel free to add me up on steam and just message me ill jump straight on im usually on it all the time anyway, amazing story, amazing graphics and one hell of a game, 10 years old and still got the same buzz and excitement as i did when i first loaded it, GET THOSE GUNS OUT AND GET LOOTING PEOPLE! stay lit and loot well peeps :)"

5694,cool game
5695,very pog
5696,It's a shoot and loot with a huge storyline and great co-op capabilities.
5697,"The first Borderlands game I ever played, I first played this game at a cousins house, and I knew I was in for a treat the moment the intro played. After a while I eventually got the Handsome Collection on PS4, and I enjoyed every bit of it. Now, playing it on PC, I am once again reliving those days of enjoying my time exploring the many corners of Pandora, and experiencing the story and its characters all over again. The story is a surprisingly well written one, something you wouldn't expect from a game with a side quest where someone wants you to shot them in the face. The characters are fun, and the gameplay still holds up today, although I will admit I miss some of the quality of life changes from Borderlands 3.
All in all, if you're looking for a good time, fun characters, and all the loot you can have, this is the game for you."
5698,it's cool after of hard day of job
5699,I like the gun that explodes swords when you shoot it
5700,Overall a really fun game with decent replay ability the only semi annoying thing is the gunplay but don't let that distract you from how fun and enjoyable this game is
5701,"I saw claptrap's spicy photos, and purchased this game right away. No regrets, he calls himself my master and I don't care. To be honest it kind of turns me on."
5702,"very fun timeless game, easy to pick up"

5708,"Loot, loot, and more loot. Lot's of loot! 

Tired of loot? Have more loot!

In 2022, maybe a 7/10. Would loot it again."
5709,"Honestly even though the game is older it is still such a great game with hilarious dialogue, plus there's a lot of side quests to keep you occupied!"
5710,nc but only orange guns matter
5711,Buy it.
5712,Fun
5713,It is so much fun! This is my first time playing solo and it is just as good!
5714,i like it
5715,its a bit hard but when you understand the game its really fun
5716,bought it for $5 and it's still more fun than most $60 games released today
5717,better than borderlands 3. cope
5718,just a good game in gen

10/10"
5722,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, I always end up coming back."
5723,"I really had fun playing this game as an internet multiplayer with my friends during the beginning of the pandemic. Fun to play, worth your money, but we got stuck in a glitch together and had to try to play somewhere else (skipped that mission). Might be kind of old, but good, so enjoy if you purchased, and if you are considering it, if you found this on sale, I say go ahead and snag it. You will probably enjoy yourself if you like shooters. It has some roguelike elements like random loot, etc... Nice that it isn't a monetized game, so you won't pay to gamble for virtual items."
5724,fun game
5725,"This is a very fun Game, I've played it For my entire Childhood and I would recomend as it is a Very Tightly Tuned FPSRPG. God Bless in Jesus Christs Mighty Name; You can come to him and Repent Meaning to turn away from your sins, And He is willing and able to forgive you of them. John Chapter 3"

5728,very fun i recommend getting the handsome collection DLC i got it when it was on sale. Very good
5729,No refunds.
5730,"The gunplay in this game feels really clunky and unsatisfying, I don't despise projectile based shooters over hitscan shooters at all, but this game really just didn't tickle my fancy."
5731,"A long, long time ago I was told I'd enjoy this game and I was put off by the art style.  Today, I can honestly say I was a complete idiot.  Handsome Jack could possibly be one of the best videogame antagonists created.  While BL3 is definitely more fun of a game mechanics wise due to the over-use of slag in 2, the story and DLCs are truly top notch, and the writing is just an amazing snarky fun fest."
5732,It's just a really solid game. Took it up now 10 years later and the experience is still great!
5733,funny game very good
5734,"Absolutely, one of the best games ever! 
Great humor, fun gameplay, just a little grind for legendary weapons, but not too much, just right! 
Also Challenging - Simulate four players with sanboxie to increase boss difficulty while playing solo for better loot. just awesome!
just a few positiv things i remeber, i am sure there are many more :)"

5744,"The definitive ""looter shooter"", one of the few games I've broken over 100 hours on, an incredible game always worth another replay."
5745,"Best co-op game ever, YES"
5746,"If the OG Borderlands was good, then Borderlands 2 was great. They took what worked in the OG and made it better - full stop. More looting, more shooting, more DLC, more to do, etc. It was just more game. The update years after the game was released to stop gap the story from BL2 to BL3 was just the icing on the cake. Probably my favorite BL game to date with Tiny Tina's DLC being the best Borderlands experience I have had period. 

Gearbox/2K really nailed the looter-shooter formula with the Borderlands series. The gunplay is solid, the loot comes just often enough to keep you engaged, and the traversal of the world is fun if slow at times. Borderlands always seems to focus the game around having fun first and foremost without regard for anything else - its okay to have OP weapons, skills, abilities, etc. because being OP is F U N. The writing is funny most of the time and hilarious some of the time. The loop of killing question looting selling buying and repeat is difficult to mess up and Borderlands never fails to disappoint. Each entry in the series is like a candy bar: you know it will be good no matter what, but the new toppings that each successive candy bar gets makes it taste that much better. I 100% see myself playing Borderlands 17 in the nursing home. It's a Borderlands game, you know what you are getting into; play it if you are hooked like the rest of us, or don't."
5747,"Fallout, Skyrim, and Sci-Fi got together snorted a rail of white lightning proceeded to invited their Anime VAs friends over and produced this masterpiece!"
5748,"Maybe the best looter shooter experience 10 years after release in the genre, Borderlands 3 might be better, but I will stick to BL2 just for the writing and Handsome Jack, probably the best villain to ever grace our computer screens ever."
5749,good game
5750,"I first picked this game up when it originally released & loved it all the way up until I got stuck at some stupid timed mission. Except for that one mission (Arms Dealing) this game is amazing. So much content, such a long storyline, really well written, really funny, lovable characters, fun mechanics. Just an awesome game."

5776,"My favorite game! I really like the artstyle, it holds up very well for it's age. Maps are interesting and there are always some eye-catching landscapes or details I really enjoy. Characters are funny and interesting and have great depth. They don't feel two dimensional and even some mission where you have to find echo-recordings are enjoyable, even though they might not have much content gameplay wise. Enemies are extremely well done and their scaling is for the most part very well done and offer good challenge. I really like playing through new difficulties because the game introduces you to new enemies which I didn't know beforehand. I really like playing with different characters, making new builds and even farming which I hated before playing this game. And the story is brilliant. Best game, would recommend."
5777,A fun and cool game.
5778,"SUPER FUN AND THE GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD
"
5779,"One of the best games ever created. This is a MUST play for any gamer. If you like looter shooters this game is for you. I can't express the amount of fun and excitement this game brings. My friend gifted me this game, as well as the 3rd and pre sequal game. I was hesitant at first to play them because it was old and not a game I had even heard of before. Now i recommend this game to every single human being I speak to if we talk about games. Fantastic. Also, this is the best borderlands of all them."

5791,"An amazing game, that stands the test of time (though you will notice it)

This game has an incredibly fun gameplay loop, with NPCs you'll grow to love and more than enough expansions to last you a long time for a good price.

Buy this on a sale and you'll have endless amounts of fun. 

I do have to say, while the story is in many ways more enjoyable than that of its successor Borderlands 3, if you have played the more recent one then the gameplay in this one might feel a bit stiff so keep that in mind. 

Would absolutely recommend, one of my favorite games of all time. (But it goes on sale often so maybe wait for that)"

5819,it is gud game

5828,"Best FPS ever. The story line is great, and the dialog even better. If for no other reason, play this game for the dialog. The original Bioshock isn't far behind."
5829,It's kinda hard but still very good. Its difficulty and the second wind mechanic make it very high-adrenaline.
5830,yes..
5831,yes
5832,"Probably the 4th time now buying this game, transferring my knowledge from the 2000 hours I spent on xbox 360. Game good. and still the brain numbing fun I remember."
5833,"I suppose I can give the game a positive review.
Positive points: cell shading, maps, vehicles, variety of enemies, humour, companions, main story, mission backstories, character special powers, character development.
Donwsides: enemies are bullet sponges that jump here and there, game is optimized for coop, spikes in difficulty, only a handful of the random generated weapons have a real use, most of them are perfectly useless, meaning you'll run out of ammunitions for your main gun too often."
5834,10/10 game been my all time favorite would reccomend
5835,"This game is so fun. I'm only on level 11 but I can safely say that this has to be one of the most fun games I've ever played. The looting and hunting of guns, the absolute carnage, the DOOM music quietly playing in the back of your head, it's amazing. 10/10 from me."

5851,"I had a bit of an initial disconnect with this game after starting out on Crysis a few(15+?!) years ago, but as I had this game for ""free"" with a graphics card from a long time ago, I discovered that I liked it enough to purchase the whole DLC thing on Steam recently. 200+ hours later, I can say it is fun."
5852,In high school I used to play this game while wearing nothing but a mankini and a babushka and it was only at these times that I felt truly free
5853,good
5854,"If youre thinking about playing this game, just buy it. It is my favorite game of all time. 
There is no game I'd rather play at any given point in time."
5855,woahhh matching grip
5856,"Well, my review is mainly for beginners who have just started this game or willing to buy it. This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of trying.

A great game but yet I think the enjoyment will depend on how you are playing it! All that I mean, if you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s). Some who enjoys solo, they may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play with, so I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s).

This is a hard-core game for hard-core gamers. Death and incapability may happen every now and then… but again the number may be reduced dramatically if you have your co-op partner(s). There are some other advantages too to play co-op (such as, better loot, or think that while you are reloading your gun, your co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievements.

This is a long game, including DLCs and need patience to finish them all. However, as I said before, this is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywhere, so, at some point you can feel frustrated if you don’t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough. Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equipped… which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advanced.

For new players, as I was when I started this game… may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game. At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode. Once you will finish the main game… then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty. Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main story, then UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you. So take this as hard mode. There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level. but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the game, i.e. level 72. So, the main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72.

Addition as on 30th June: Since I have just finished the main mission of main game in UVHM mode so I shall suggest you if you are playing UVHM then you must carry 2 blue pistols: Potent Rubi and Potent Gorg Nozzle and always keep one of these at your one slot. Whenever you are low in health start shooting using it.

This is the review basing on my present experience of nearly 400 hours; I can update this review in the future as I shall get new experience."
5857,its alright

Has it all from a great story and characters to fun gameplay to more guns than anyone would ever need (I still don't think I've used them all to this day). You'll be enjoying yourself whether it's your first or fifth or tenth time playing. Easy to play with friends and many times more fun when doing so.  

While BL3 has better gameplay, graphics, and quality of life, BL2 is better everywhere else and still holds up in the aforementioned aspects. 

I don't have much faith in gearbox these days but BL2 is gold and will always be gold. I'll probably still be laughing at Handsome Jack's spoon story 30 years from now. If you've never played it before, grab it when you see it on sale (which is pretty often given how old the game is) and you won't regret it."

5977,"No soy fan de los shooters pues la mayoría se me hacen muy aburridos, repetitivos y con una estética muy similar entre ellos, pero Borderlands es diferente, es un shooter con mecánicas de RPG sencillas de entender, con una ambientación genial y un humor muy estúpido pero que es gracioso.
Realmente lo recomiendo, es barato y más aún si lo compras en oferta con sus DLC."

5979,Nice mix FPS and RPG

5991,"shit game will not start,same crap from 10 years ago and not fixed."
5992,funny fast paced fps
5993,its like dying light but no parkour
5994,One of the best games to co-op out there. Theres so much shooting and fun! Great times to be had. Just have to do the DLC's now >.<
5995,"Borderlands 2 is one of the most unique and consistently funny games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Genuinely fun gameplay mixed with tons of different weapon types and elements makes each gun fight feel different. When you run out of health which happens rather often, you get presented with this system that I would honestly call the ""best gaming mechanic ever"" where you can kill an enemy to get revived. It's perfect if you get killed by a minion after beating a boss but also prevents you from just reviving from bosses you've barely damaged.

While this game is a decade old, I finally managed to get through all of it and I would recommend it to everyone that enjoys shooters and the crude humor that the game presents."
5996,better than borderlands 3
5997,"Randy, fix the fucking netcode"
5998,"After completing this game several times, on NVHM, TVHM, and soon to be UVHM, I can safely say that there is no other looter shooter like this. In fact no other shooter or even any other game like this. Unbelievably fun with an insane amount of variety."
5999,endless fun

If you liked borderlands 1 and wanted exactly the same with slightly different background, it's here. For better or worse."

My thoughts:
I think Borderlands 2 is the best shlooter (Looter Shooter) you can get your hands on at the moment, I would highly suggest it over any other. 
+Handsome jack is one of the best video game Villains."

6028,best game ever
6029,online crossplay is broken hehe
6030,"Hey each borderlands game is it's own dope masterpiece. I played as Maya, the siren, who is fun to play with because you can hold enemies in place and shoot the crap out of them. Each character you play as has a ton of personality. Like Maya snorts as she laughs if you kill on a critical. And the writing is great; super funny. But the Borderlands story isn't just silly, it's fully of lore and the plot is much deeper than you'd think for a looter shooter. Just play it."
6031,The developers could literally pay you and it would be too expensive to play this franchise.
6032,real good game
6033,"IMO the BEST looter-shooter FPS ever made. This game has it all: Great soundtrack, awesome characters and voice-acting, great villains and super solid gameplay, very interesting and well developed story, amazing art style and full of quality content all around. You miss a lot if you don't play this. Just very good and solid FPS which you HAVE to play!"

6099,Its ok
6100,It's alight. Previously played it on console and it was a blast! Not much to complain about tbh.
6101,"Yup. While I still like O.G. (GOTYE Enhanced Edition, mind you...FPS and QoL options and adjustments are MINT...) 2 is DAMN close, and MORE than a worthy successor; although there are points that can get EXCESSIVELY Grind-y and Bullet-Spongy, a more concise and perfectly-delivered story, along with a MASSIVE variation, combination, & depth of scope Upgrade in pretty much EVERY way you could think of, even if some of them aren't exactly your cup of tea...you have to admire the sheer Mad Genius that is this game.

BONUS: DLC On-Point. ""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep"", a D&D themed Campaign of it's own, is ABSOLUTELY STELLAR and (if you didn't know...) launched a spin-off game where the concepts are more Fully-Developed and you ACTUALLY inhabit the ""Bunkers & Badasses"" Realm...
""Hammerlock's Hunt"" is also particularly noteworthy and interesting.

Also of Note; ""Crawmerax The Invincible"", Raid Boss Crab Worm Grand-Pappy of O.G. Borderlands sparked a Trend; BUCKETLOADS of Raid Bosses to find and Challenge, and speaking of Challenges...earn Play-Style Rewards to further tweak your build and add in a BAZILLION Guns?

YUP. 
BETTER WHEN PLAYED WITH FRIENDS. SOLO STILL GREAT.
YUP."

6106,things go boom please buy. Tiny Tina = Legend
6107,"I've loved this game for years, and am getting back into it after a while of not playing. It's still awesome"

6109,No POC vault hunters also is clap-trap supposed to be like a racist depiction? 0/10
6110,its too good.
6111,"I like how the game is so different when you play as other types of players, and can replay the same parts and they do not always react the same way."
6112,"It is so hard for me to write a review for this game. I adored Borderlands 1 in every sense that game can be loved. It was funny, it was a bit foolish, great ideas, great quests, great enemies, great loot, it had Clap Trap, it was an epic game.

Borderlands 2 had all of that also. But..... The game itself didn't transfer to a new level of great. It stayed on the same level as B1, maybe even deteriorated a bit. The quests are good, but not great. Loot is good, but not great. Clap Trap is just annoying, he isn't funny and witty as he was in B1. 

Playing B2 I had a feeling as if this game could have been DLC for B1. Nothing new, better, shiny, or revolutionary was implemented in the game that would have great impact on it. And yet, I recommended it. Why?

Well, it is still a good game. And it still has everything B1 had. And it offered almost 90 hours on single player (with all DLC's.). DLC's are more interesting than the base game, have skeletons that I liked very much, and I think that actually playing DLC's brought back some of the B1 joy of playing this game.

Borderlands 2 is a borderline positive game. I can tell that lot of effort went into the game, but also, there wasn't enough new originality added that would make me enjoy it completely. Lets hope that B3 will not be a fluke."

Slightly bias because I'd buy this game 10 more times since I love it so much. Is a lot of fun with or without friends imo, story-line/voice acting/dialogue carries."
6120,"Great game, but don't bother if you're at all interested in playing with friends. Co-op just doesn't work."

It has a good story, good game play with many fun weapons and fun playable characters (so far I've mostly played Siren and I've recently started playing the Mechromancer). My hubby has played the Psycho and he seems super fun too from what I have seen and what he has told me. The NPC's are fun and have lots of fun and charming attributes about them and they also have looooooots of funny and generally amazing dialogue that keeps you interested and completely hooked for HOURS haha.

All in all I totally recommend this game!! An added bonus is definitely to purchase the Game of the year edition and to also purchase the handsome collection to get that extra gameplay!"

6171,Funi
6172,"Very good and epic game you should try it cause yes its good 
"
6173,"Borderlands 2 plays better than Borderlands, but it still suffers from annoying missions and bad multiplayer balancing the same as BL1 did.

[b][u]Do not buy its game or any of its DLC full price[/u][/b], buy it as cheaply as you can, Gearbox does not care about you and deserves as little profit from your purchase as possible.

[h1]Gunplay[/h1]
First thing you'll come across is the Badass Rank system, this replaces the proficiency system from BL1, so now you're not locked into specific weapons, you have the freedom to try any gun you want.

Second, there is a lot more variety of guns in BL2 in comparison to BL1.
Elemental weapons are more common, how they function and shoot depends on the brand of the gun, they never feel just like a damage upgrade, they always feel like something new.

What killed my will to play is finding out the game caps enemies at level 50 in True Vault Hunter mode, you have to beat the main campaign twice to unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter mode which scales enemies to your maximum level. I found all of this out after beating all the DLCs in TVH, meaning if I didn't want every side quest to be push over easy, I would have to redo everything.

[h1]Missions[/h1]
This is a First Person Shooter, so you can't complain about the majority of missions involving a lot of shooting, what I will complain about is very frequently you have to go back and forth from the same locations over and over again

The worst offenders of the missions are the raid boss ones, where either you need a perfect strategy to kill them with solo, or you need to be playing with multiple people, because they scale to always be over leveled and can instantly kill you.
Each DLC also has their own raid boss.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
Normally when you play with others you expect things to get slightly harder, but mostly easier because you're with friends. Not in Borderlands.
When you play with a friend, everything gets a massive damage and health boost, this further increases with each person who joins you.

You may have 10,000 health and shield, but a regular enemy can still kill you in the blink of an eye just because you're playing with a friend, and they still take more damage to kill than solo."

6185,yes
6186,Better than borderlands 3
6187," Its borderlands, thats the whole description.

This is HANDS DOWN my absolute favourite borderlands game. Maya is an absolute queen and I love her so much! In all the Borderlands games I solely play the sirens and Maya is my absolute favourite character to play. Her ability to hold her own against enemies when playing solo and upgrading perks to become like a support when playing co-op. I absolutely love the villain in this game, and always feel overwhelming happiness when playing this game. Even if I have played it many times through (on the Playstation) I feel this was a great game to come after Borderlands 1 and managed to improve on many aspects of the first game. I believe I will forever be in love with this game in particular."
6188,This game is so fun to play even if you dont have friends to play it with. I highly recommend this game as it has alot of things to do and the DLC is just so fun to play.

6202,best borderlands
6203,gud gamer
6204,"My favorite game in the series by far, and perhaps my favorite game of all time. It's a fun game to play through for the first time because of the interesting and quotable story line, and the vastness of weapons (though not as vast as in Borderlands 3) can make every other play through just as fun. However, the biggest factor which sets this game apart from the other games in the series is the near endless post game options. Whether its farming for better weapons or trying to push to a new difficulty setting, once you develop a sense of familiarity with this game you won't want to put it down.
10/10 - great game"
6205,yes
6206,Fun game to play with a friend who doesnt speedrun EVERYTHING
6207,shoot me in the face
6208,"Fun game, good humor. 

One main annoying thing is map clipping issues. The toon would constantly get stuck on something, going up on a curb? Got stuck on curb. Going up a ramp? You might clip an edge. I avoided the time challenges because of getting stuck on something. Vehicle would just flip around for whatever reason.

☑ Very few
☐ Affects gameplay
☐ Initial release Cyberpunk on PS4

Rating | 86% | it is a 10 year old game, but it still holds up as a fun looter shooter - especially if you have some buddies to play through the campaign with."
6216,"This game is first and foremost, an absolute joy to play. The gunplay and variety of loot encourages you to keep playing, and the gameplay loop is surprisingly resilient. It's under-marked by an ok story and odd environments that sometimes feel poorly designed and glitchy. 

The forefront of Borderlands 2 is clearly the gameplay, and it does better for it. Each gun is unique, and even if I didn't like a gun, it was personal preference, because each gun performs well and is unique, which encourages you to try to get more of them. Aiming is snappy, and the guns are all so satisfying to use. Each class is unique and offers a different style of play and there isn't really a wrong pick. 

The story is an ok one, not that anyone plays Borderlands for its story. It's carried by its charismatic and unique cast of characters, although it does have its moments. However, you can play through this game without paying a lick of attention to the story and have a good time. 

Despite being an almost decade year old game, the graphics have aged decently. This is thanks to the cel-shaded art style that never goes out of style, although some textures look rough if you get too close. 

The game only gets better with friends. Its smart leveling system ensures everyone can play together and have fun. 

The game is however not without problems. Some parts of some levels seem poorly designed, and is easy to get stuck on geometry. Furthermore, the mini map is sometimes weird, not always being clear about exactly where you need to go. 

Unfortunately, it also falls victim to what I call the ""looter shooter trap"". While the gameplay loop is enjoyable and potentially addictive, I could easily see it taking its course. As the only real reason to play is a new flashy gun or mod, and you eventually already have that. 

Verdict: Overall, this is an excellent game. It is undercut by some minor issues, ok story, and  a gameplay loop that can run its course. However, the gameplay is excellent and varied, and playing with friends is even better. An exemplary game. 

8/10"
6217,"I was expecting a fun, fast-paced fps with a good deal of comic relief... well, sadly this is NOT the case. 
Maybe its because I have been playing ""The Division"" most of time, and when I played Borderlands 2 the shooting mechanics and enemy A.I felt like I was playing some unfinished game demo.
The CALTROP robot character is meant to be annoying in a ""funny"" way - but it's so DAMN annoying that It ruined the experience.
I don't know, maybe am I just being a Boomer."
6218,good nice fun game just buy it cheap af

"
6221,"Honestly a cult classic.... over 1,000+ on 360, 150+ on ps3/ps-vita, 300+ on one x, now 189 on steam!!! I truly love this game and have mad respect for it mainly due to its predecessor which changed my mind on gaming in a nutshell!!!

This game is jammed packed action and leveling, and if environments/biomes is your thing you're in luck champions! BLOOD, GORE, COMEDY and LOOT!"
6222,GOOD GAME
6223,"You run around, shoot things, and steal stuff. Then you can shoot people until you can steal their stuff, getting you ready to shoot the bad guys so you can have their stuff."
6224,idk short game but really fun
6225,"High praises to this game for the hundreds of hours of the great times playing this game either on xbox at friends houses, or here now on pc. Everyone should be given this game at this point, it's pure legendary!"

6255,Haha Krieg melee go brrrrrrrr
6256,get the game pumpkin
6257,Best game ever!!!!!
6258,is gud
6259,This game was fun when it launched. returning to it years later I can feel how flawed this game is. and find it comical through all the updates and dlcs they didnt fix glaring issues. Its not as great as I remember it being to be honest. probably better left in the nostalgia vault.
6260,bussin
6261,absloute pog. but it does get to the point of needing to have slag which is controversial
6262,"Claptrap's so freekin annoying. I'd erase its very own existence with each fibre of my being if it wasn't for its assistance. Minion my as*

6273,"The game is fun when it actually works, but this steam version locks up my computer constantly.  Getting tired of restarting my computer"
6274,:)
6275,very fun to play with friends
6276,good gameplay loop and fun story
6277,addiction
6278,"Best looter-shooter ever. Like, ever. Characters are unforgettable. Guns are ridiculously abundant and unique (over 100 million possible guns in game btw). Storyline is great. And if you ever get tired of the game (impossible) there are tons of DLCs and mods to download and enjoy. And the game gets even better when you play it with friends. Wow, just wow."
6279,This game is THE BEAST sure the graphics are not that good but for REEAAAL the plot 100%
6280,"Love this game, best borderlands game yet the online literally doesn't function"
6281,This is one of the best FPS/RPG games ever made.  You can play it for years and never get bored.  Finish the primary mission before you do any add-ons.
6282,GUNS GLORIOUS GUNS!!!!!!!!
6283,"Game very good i beg you buy it
"
6284,"Great fun on co-op.
lots of content and amazing game mechanics. Overall just a great game"
6285,If you dont like this game I'll eat a truck. With a fork.
6286,"shift sucks tho
"
6287,:sans:
6288,"great and fun game, i enjoyed a majority of this game whether its the funny and/or cool characters or the guns themselves, the levels looked cool and most of the enemies were fun to fight and figure out how to beat ( exceptions are the super bosses, i despise the fact that without exploits or being insanely overleveled or playing with others with meta builds, its impossible to beat them. ), overall, a great game."
6289,"Despite how great it looks I can't recommend this game - it's just too boring, the gunplay isn't very satisfying.  The missions are dull, there's really no point to exploring anything and the loot is tedious.  A million little lootboxes full of stuff you can't pick up because it's just more ammo you're already full on anyways, and cash you don't particularly need.  There's a ton of guns that all feel very same-y, randomly generated and not satisfying to shoot.  It's extremely easy, there's no real challenge and even if you do die it basically just resumes right where you were with no penalty.

The Good:
Visuals - Top notch, looks fantastic.
Audio - Great music, great voice acting.  Handsome Jack particularly entertaining.

The Bad:
Claptrap - We get it, he's 'the annoying character'.  Mission accomplished, he's extremely very annoying.
The missions - empty grind, go here shoot stuff repeat
The looting - despite having many variants of guns there's very little looting to do.
The gun dynamics - Feels bad.  Like a half-finished Unity game.
Too easy.  Enemy AI just charges at you or hides behind cover and there's really no surprises to it that I found."
6290,this funked borderlands 30 lvl solo verd mad to die suck it !
6291,Rất đáng chơi
6292,only started playing but its is a very good looter and shooter really good story the start is a bit slow but its starts getting better the more play
6293,"good gam,e buy"
6294,"herhe her
heh"
6295,best game ever
6296,Awesome loot game.
6297,farming the warrior brb
6298,This is a great game to go around and its a nice short rpg open world ish game
6299,"You've played for 530 hours
Would you recommend this game to other players?"
6300,it restarted me once i killed a boss :/
6301,le funny 2012 lut &shut is gud:DDDDDD
6302,probably one of the best team building games without the stereotypical team building bs
6303,it is borderlands 2.
6304,"a long time ago,it's a boring game"
6305,"Well, this game is 10x better WITH Dlcs but you aren't required to get them. I also personally believe that the game is better AFTER the first playthrough because then you get harder difficulties that allow weapons and enemies to scale with you instead ruining farming sources that remain low level even when you level up. For example, Knuckledragger has an amazing legendary drop called the hornet, but when you go back at a high level to farm knuckledragger, he is still level 2 (first playthrough) so the weapon cannot be used to its full potential. Just brace for it before it happens, but honestly this game has EXTREME replayability."
6306,"This game, and all the games in this series, are some of the greatest in history."
6307,I will never not recommend this game. You can finish it multiple times and always revisit in the future. Game has held it's value very well.
6308,wallworld 2
6309,"Yeah, it's fun."
6310,"really good on macbooks, however, the pre sequal isnt compatible anymore :/"
6311,its fun to blast guys away nothing bad besides needing internet to play 9.7/10
6312,words
6313,THE OG THIS GAME SHOULD HAVE NO HATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6314,if you like looter shooters and farming you'll love this game. if not go play fortnite or something.
6315,"Good 
- so much good humour in this game 
- great sci fi environment to explore
- characters have depth 
- interesting and engaging story 
- huge choice of weapons, play the way you want to
- I'm playing through solo and really enjoying it - this would be great with a friend

"
6316,"The story line of this game is just the best of all. It's Hilarious, full of joke and captiving. The quantity of possible guns is magic....I can't get enough of that game!!"
6317,"i don't understand why this game is so much better than borderlands 3, but it is"

6371,"The main story slaps and the third act hits you like a truck. The rest is now-dated 2011-type humor that makes me remember why I used to hate video games. If ""lolrandom im a unicorn taco!"" is funny to you, you may enjoy it, or at least it may not bother you. Otherwise, just stick to the main story which has enough meat to get you into the fun mechanics and narratively holds up extremely well."
6372,"This game is pretty cool, there's plenty of gun to be had here."
6373,There are Skeletons in this game.
6374,I finished playing Metro Exodus and then started Borderlands 2.  This game is SO FUN.
6375,"I genuinly love this game, would recommend to anyone"

6377,It's good.  Just buy it.
6378,its elite

6385,"I started with Borderlands three, and wanted to see the differences, now I must admit much of BL3 has streamlined some of the more tedious interface issues that BL2 has.  But still having a blast with BL2, I wish they carried over some of the classes, love the Mechromancer."
6386,Best borderlands made
6387,very fun with friends
6388,it funny guns go brrrrrrr
6389,yes. si.

6391,"good game very much fun, out of bounds glitch one might call a gift by god himself I've never thought that god was real until I went out of bounds in sanctuary and looked up to see nothing but literal heaven. Very good, do recommend indeed loved the experience."
6392,MY FAV GAME
6393,"its borderlands, dont think about it and buy it."
6394,This is my favorite game of all time. Across all platforms and systems I have well over 300 hours on here.
6395,"As far as looter shooters go, its the one to go for."
6396,"I would recommend this game conditionally, the condition being that you have a friend or a few that are willing to play the game with you. It can be quite boring to play alone, but playing with friends is insanely enjoyable. That being said, it's not awful playing alone it just is kind of empty and lonely. The story is alright, and the humor is plentiful, there's a lot of guns, some look cooler than others, some are far better than others. It's a good game. Feels like an MMO that they made into a small RPG. Of course it is a looter shooter though so the whole thing to it is the constant gun upgrades and the variety of guns, and there are a lot of different guns, so if you find a gun and enjoy it don't get too attached, you might find a new much better but kind of ugly one in the next zone or even next chest you open."
6397,Epic
6398,"such a great game, ill always come back to it every once and awhile."

6419,yes
6420,"I have not only modded this game on the Xbox 360, I have beat it many times on the Xbox 360 and love the game. The amount of friends I made back on this game was a fun time and still is even tho I have 2 hours on this game."

6427,
6428,Awesome game
6429,good game i recommend
6430,"Even though it's an older game, it has really held up well over time."
6431,"Literally one of the best games ever made imo. Amazing characters, fun gunplay, an inspired artistic style and a sh*t ton of content to do, both easy and hard.I would suggest this game to everyone that likes FPSs and a bit of patience for farming weapons at higher levels"
6432,"So like you're pretty much one of 5 guys except two of those guys aren't even guys, pretty sure it's just a guise to make the game more appealing to a wider audience, but anyways. You're one of them and like you're trying to find some treasure vault located somewhere in a wasteland called pandora, and no its not a box it is a planet but it might as well be a box that is already opened but that doesn't make it any less dangerous that some guy before you opened up some crop on that planet then closed it again. So like you're walking around and some clam teap starts talking to you like you're dead, except you're not dead and it's a good thing that the calm teap noticed that and was like you don't really belong in this pipe of dead bodies, right? Kind of suckered because the money was good but there's like uranium exposure everywhere and it's in the water which they tell you but everyone thinks that will give them anything except cancer, no it won't turn you into Spiderman, unless Spiderman is a terminal cancer patient. But they're dead anyways and it produces so much money for some handsome dude like myself, but I'm just playing the game and I still need a haircut.
So once the clam teap notices that you're not dead, he wants help to get his shit back from some boondocks mother fucker and they think they're saints but they isn't. Period.
*Skip a bunch of steps here*
So you just beat the crud out of some flint lock captain blotch and now you have the ship and you're off to SANXTUARY which is supposed to be ""safer"" than the rest of pandora but you still need you're first pistol to get along and once you have that and you're in sanctuary the game isn't even close to over yet. You still gotta go find more guns to keep in your sack. Yes you have a sack full of guns and a bag full of bullets and maybe one of those is a silver bullet but you don't know which one it is so don't go playing roulette with sussians. Maybe you can but not everyone is built like that.
So anyways, on with the frickin story <3<3<3 ... you gotta go Fite these psychos because all they do is fight and it's ruining the planet because of some purple stuff that is worth lots of dough but not the kind of dough you make bread with, it's money. And like maybe you need some of that stuff for these cooler weapons you can find but maybe not and but either way they are pretty cool and some go ""pew pew pew"" and then the bad psychos are dead.
So like you can also find guns that shoot fire, electricity, acid and explosions. They are handy to have and sometimes you can find one that does all of that, but not at the same time, it's one at a time but it's also random and it is really handy.
So that now you have really big guns you can come on over to the coliseum... maybe,I didn't get that far so I don't even know I'd there is a fight bowl or not but hey why not guess??

So like after all that I would rate the game 5 stars and u would recommend it to anyone who has like $20 /¥ spend on a game. Hand in a bucket because you're gonna need some sticky hand to hold you gun with.

5 stars would buy again I'd it wasn't already in my fucking library. <3"
6433,"fun
"
6434,"Great game, little bit boring at the end."

6438,"pretty cool game, nice story, very good if u wanna blow off some steam and kill stuff, very doom like in the killing part, heads exploding, just mad insane combat, very fun, very funny dark humor everywhere u go too, good for any mature player, 9/10"
6439,ez sledge shotty
6440,Probably just literally the most fun I've had on a video game. Handsome Jack still one of the best fictional charaters.
6441,"Nice
"
6442,"Lo jugue porque es un juego bastante popular, de hecho tengo un abre sodas de Claptrap haha 
Creo que lo mas destacable del juego son 2 cosas a mi parecer: el arte y el guion. 
El arte porque su estilo caricatura lo hace muy unico y realmente se ve muy impresionante todo el mundo. 
El guión, sobre todo por lo comico, era muy divertido el como se expresaban los personajes y el humor general del juego lo hacia sentir fresco. 

El gameplay no me gusto tanto, me senti ""obligado"" a hacer las misiones secundarias, porque si hacia solo las principales de pronto ya dejaba de hacer daño, tenia una sniper que necesitaba dar 100 tiros para matar un enemigo que ni siquiera era un jefe. 

8/12"
6443,"Me playing Gaige: Anarchy Forever! And Ever!

Also me: I lost my anarchy! This is like the worst day ever!"
6444,Don't bother if you're playing solo. Enemies aren't scaled down and they constantly respawn to the point of it being awfully boring.

6455,CLAPTRAP
6456,good game ;)
6457,very good and the art style is amazing
6458,It's a crazy game. The graphics are funky but it's part of the charm. Absolutely LOVE the Tiny Tina character. Mainly because of what she says.
6459,Just go to G2A to purchase as still cheaper than when the dev puts on sale. Dont need to speak about game as we all know how good it is.
6460,In my top 10 of all time games
6461,Simply one of the best all round games out there :D
6462,cool
6463,cool
6464,"I like everything about the game, graphics, story, gameplay, EVERYTHING. I have the whole series and play them all the time."
6465,"Very little compares to the opening of Borderlands 2 after having put a good amount of time into 1. The graphics, the gunplay, the mechanics, the skills... absolutely improved in every way. Not to mention the story! Whereas 1 felt somewhat empty and the DLC, even at it's best moments, was pretty lacking, 2 is amazing in it's own right. The characters and plot are fantastic and connect in a way 1 could never have. The DLC as well is improved by a mile, where each one feels worth the time and effort. If you didn't like 1, I can't say for certain you'd love 2, even with the massive overhauls and improvements– but if you loved Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2 will blow your mind."

6470,great game
6471,Goot times.
6472,"If you weren't enjoying BL2, you weren't using a Jakobs."
6473,this is the game that you would need to play when it came out this was a real banger back in the day honestly 10/10 you can't hate this game.
6474,I enjoy the banter between the AI and the players
6475,"One of the best games ive played in a long time
"
6476,"I bought the dlc pack for this game. And a week later they drop a PAID dlc...
Few weeks later I got it for free on epic"
6477,"very gut
"
6478,STILL ADDICTING UNTIL NOW
6479,very gud game
6480,good
6481,"if this game were to manifest itself into a humanoid presence, i would allow it to stroke me to completion"
6482,"sussy
"
6483,One of the all time greats
6484,good game
6485,good
6486,Hell yeah
6487,Played this game on PS vita and will never forget that moment beating the game
6488,"Best game ever!
Great graphics, not high rez, but easy to see and enjoy.
Fun gameplay
Unlimited guns
Funny ass dialog
Very engaging characters"
6489,yes
6490,its alright *laughs in almost 4000 hours on console*
6491,"If you're willing to put in time for good stuff, this might be the game for you."
6492,It's good.
6493,yep
6494,My favourite game of all time on console.
6495,Mexican border patrol simulator
6496,I HAVE THE SHINIEST MEAT BICYCLE
6497,Good stuff
6498,best game in the series very replayable love the game
6499,Picked this game up in 2021 and i gotta say it holds up pretty well although no splitscreen :/. Singleplayer or with a few friends its great  tho
6500,"Played 4 minutes. Get two general crashes...
non skip-able intro..
I'm pissed. Won't try to play again for some time. 
Was this game intended to works on Windows 10 ?"
6501,Played this in a free weekend about 12 years ago and enjoyed the absolute hell out of it.  Really good with a group of friends in a VC.
6502,Yeah it's pretty good
6503,"I put hundreds of hours into this game and the DLC. Even as far as a white-gear-only challenge run. One of the greatest experiences I've ever had with a franchise. You are ripping off the whole industry when you buy this game, sale or no."
6504,It is lame.
6505,"One of the best games of all time by far. It is amazing to play co-op but still enjoyable solo. After playing this game over the past 10 years I can promise that a lot of the comedy, stupidity, and grind is still just as fun as before and every playthrough feels different depending on the character. The team behind borderlands 2 made some amazing DLC for this game that is honestly even more fun than the main game. I would strongly reccomend this game to everyone and anyone as the skill level doesnt need to be intense for the first or 2nd playthrough (there are ways to make this game near impossible if that is your style). 10/10 best game"
6506,"I can honestly say this is by far one of my favorite games of all time. I have no idea how many times I have beaten the game with 100% completion. (Not on Steam, yet) I have bought the game on xbox 360, then xbox one, then bought a game of the year edition, lost the disc, bought another copy of game of the year, moved to playing on PC and now I enjoy playing it for nostalgic reasons and sometimes just for the sake of lootin and shootin. There are great elements to this game; voice acting, comedic jabs, character development, storylines, handsome Jack and I forgot the last one... but you can not go wrong by taking the time to enjoy this game thoroughly. Buy the DLC; relive the game with new characters and slag your way to shoot Handsome Jack in his pretty little vault hiding face. Oh yeah!I remember what the other element was... Explosions!!!!???? Also Mr. Torgue approves of this message and has a message of his own """"DID YOU KNOW THAT NINETY-SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL LIVING THINGS ON PANDORA AREN'T EXPLODING RIGHT NOW? THAT'S BULLSH*T, BUY TORGUE!"". You heard him, get out there, start shooting and let's get that percentage to 97% of living things ARE exploding!  Tiny Tina's Bunker&Badassses is a whole-azz nother game within a game, talking about a game, while playing a game that references a new game. You get to slap a diamond pony's azz and its wonderful. Dont become a new addition to the psycho's meat-wagon. Good luck out there vault hunter!"
6507,one of my favourite games
6508,great!
6509,Very fun
6510,good

6531,"Claptrap is a fucking piece of shit, I want to beat his fucking eye in like my mother used to since I am a complete and utter disappointment to my family and lineage. This piece of shit game reminded me why I never liked my Uncle, Chris chan. He was always weird and would touch my spring because I failed at maths. Not a very poggers time if I say so myself

10/10 IGN though I'd like more James Charles sex scenes
"
6532,"This series offers megaton of hours wasted, where you could have picked up a guitar, taken lessons and have been a rock star legend.  Oh, well...  Least I'll have my memories of all the fun I had playing it.  ;)  

Don't hesitate, it checks all the boxes a good AAA game should."
6533,"Absolutely horrible game and very disappointed. After playing the first two borderlands games, I've realized they are mistitled. The first one should have been called the walking/traveling simulator. The technology of fast travel exists in the game, yet is so spread out you spend most of your time traveling, very annoying. borderlands 2 feels much less like a traveling simulator, but feels like a dying simulator. No matter what shield I have, no matter what level I am, enemies can break through shields in one hit, then your health in another. I'm going up against enemies 2 to 3 levels below me and have a shield with 20,000+ hit points and even increases my health...BAM...downed by a simple skag. I get up and BAM...downed again. It also doesn't help that you get mobbed like crazing in this game. You'll revive yourself from a down, only to turn around to face 4 or 5 more enemies, who, guess what, BAM...kill your shield in one hit, then your health in another. borderlands 2 lacks that powerful feeling I got tons of in the first one as no matter what new equipment I find, it serves no purpose."
6534,"looter shooter 2: more looting n shooting

good game"

6544,most excellent
6545,"A vast improvement to the prior game, very satisfying shoot-n-loot design. Enjoyed the game to finish several play-throughs on different characters and the unlockable difficulties"
6546,"Fun shooter game, loved to snipe, great head shots from far away. Some parts were difficult, but still was a great game to play!"
6547,This game sucks and I'm still a virgin
6548,its fun
6549,"Iconic visuals, hilarious dialog, hours of fun. Always recommend."
6550,"axe man
"
6551,"I will give a positive review just because.  I am somewhat split on this game for the gameplay isn't the greatest and the game can feel slow, but I love the game and the characters and the humor.  This is more a looter shooter story than it is a game, so while I love it and will probably play the entire campaign, it's not quite the ""game"" I was looking for."
6552,love playing this without avery
6553,i have 570.4 hours on this game and it never bores me i love it
6554,legendary game
6555,good game
6556,I won it on every platform! Love the franchise! Can't wait for the next one.
6557,"
"
6558,good game would play again
6559,"Best action. Best HUD. it feels like i'm really playing a first person shooter. Can play with friends. The game feels like a living comic book. Cannot take me eyes away from the action. Feels like i'm really immerse into the game. The game has a variety of terrains. Yes you can customize the character. Yes you can customize the character's weapon. Yes you can customize the character stats based on the level. This game is very unique, the amount of playtime is endless. Have fun playing with your friends for a better experience."
6560,i love claptrap
6561,"Honestly, this game is a masterpiece!
The story is epic, you have tons of replay value, and you could never get bored. 
DLC is nice as well. 
Get the Handsome Collection on sale. You get this game DLC with TPS DLC. 
The only scummy thing is the pricing of the Lilith DLC, which sells for more on sale than the actual game itself.
Otherwise, this is a fucking masterpiece."

6568,"Honestly this game is a great example of quality in specificity in a big way; especially for its time. the borderlands series picks what it wants to do. and does it right, in the best possible way. especially for its technical limitations and time, no one will disagree that this game stands out as the key staple of the series. as all of the borderlands games are good-great, but none stands out quite as well as the 2nd entry in the series.

Borderlands 1 felt great to play, however the world was still building up over time and its technological limits show. overall its a good game, and the remaster fixes many of the problems it has

Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, although the technology has developed beyond BL2 its story and overall flow of game play doesn't hold a candle to the excellent writing and quest line fluidity of the 2nd title.

Borderlands 3 in my opinion comes the closest to overtaking the main staple, as the technology and game play is far greater than the capabilities of its 8 year old predecessor however it fumbles at the yard line with its lacklustre writing and the story flow not working well into the repetitive difficulty format.

So, what does this game have that both its predecessor and successors don't achieve. as both its business model, game play, writing and story flow and utilised mechanics work in the best possible way.

Business Model:
its DLC's and external purchased are 100% worth it; not only has the collectors edition price lowered over time and is extremely good value on sale, but all of its content draws out either hours of enjoyment, extensions to the games top notch story, or greats some form of worthwhile repeatability. the cosmetics it has are reasonably priced and included in whatever you need, the game sells itself as a player to player transaction, they know you want just the story DLC's available so they have the GOTY edition, they know you want a 4 pack so you can truly utilise the Co-op the game offers. and the overall handsome collection containing everything that section of the Borderlands series offers, this business model feels genuine and what a player would want to be available whatever the appeal of this game is to you there is a deal for you available.
[9/10]

Game Play:
The game play went unrivalled for a long period of time; until the most recent release the game play from title to title remained mostly the same aside from additional features, borderlands has a few main mechanics fleshed out to a great quality, Shooting mechanics like the gun variety in corporations and modifications that change stats and effects of the weapons, Looting Systems and the RNG repeatability of grinding for guns and rewards from boss to boss, Driving features that allow for extreme stunts and cool action sequences and the main staple that pulls together the looting and shooting hooks, boss battles. these battles make and break this game, as they provide personality, levity and action into the games questing acting as milestones and other features.
[10/10]

Writing and Story Arc:
The writing of this game, is unmatched in what it aims to be, it shows levity and comedy through memorable performances from character to character, so much so that it creates memorability at every level, Handsome Jack, Torgue, Tiny Tina, Lilith, Maya, Zero, Gaige, Krieg, Cl4pTr4p, d34thtr4p and several other main and side characters give excellent performances. the writing feels up to pace with the game play and story, neither stops for the other and instead they bounce off on each other providing vibrancy and ingenuity for each character giving each sequence of game play and each character moments that the player will always remember, ""Buttstalion"", ""Aaaaand Open"", ""Meat Bicycles"", ""'Sup"", ""Anarchy"", Just Torgue in general. these moments are what makes this game great, and will make it stand any test time throws at it...
[10/10]


Final Thoughts: 
This Game is not the perfect golden child of the games industry; its not the second coming either. what it is, is a product that took what made it likeable put that forward, amplified those qualities to the Nth Degree and then showed that personality in every aspect expected from a game. its writing, mechanics, business models, visuals, cinematic sequences, quests, bosses. everything that makes borderlands-its own, and everything that built the first game, with higher quality, it doesn't try anything too diver-gently new instead choosing to polish its best quality's until there's not a spot left to shine. this game could be released today and even if it didn't receive the response it did in comparison, it would still be a success as an underground title; as time passes the qualities shown stand unwavering.
[9.6/10]

""If you disagree with anything I've said, I'm sorry you feel indifferent to what I have said, but id like to know why and what your thoughts on this game are in general."""
6569,good game
6570,"when i was but a young lad, this game was the shit. im talking young. 7-8 years old here. i shouldnt have even been playing this game. hell, i didnt even understand the story. all i remember doing from that time is just running around the three horns divide waiting for another enemy to spawn. yet i still enjoyed the fuck out of this game. i think that really says something about how great this game is, even without the story aspect."
6571,"So nice I had to buy it twice. Beat it on xbox with every character multiple times, then got it again on here."
6572,Addictive af
6573,yes
6574,Cool game!
6575,"If you like piles of guns, lots to do and shoot, and a robust leveling system with a natural coop multi-player aspect and aren't put off by the cel shading, it's a no-brainer. Also delivers on every promise of the original, being an instant classic that proudly stands alongside the PC's finest shooters"
6576,"Its a blast 

satisfies my ADD with the cool colors"
6577,"Borderlands 2 has always been a favorite of mine, and with 4K graphics I can't keep myself away from the game."
6578,Its a fun game when your bored.
6579,Good soup
6580,"I can't exactly compare to some of the others on the time played but I must say that at first my friends and i just wanted a new game to play with each other - we stumbled upon this and had our share of fun. now everyone has been busy with their lives and only occasionally can come on, I myself still play this game usually as an anger or stress relief.

anyways great game 12/10 recommend especially the humor part I love it"
6581,this game is pretty swagfull
6582,Love the Borderlands series.. It basically just took what was good in the first game and made it even better!
6583,"I can see why it's fun for many, but i find it absurdly boring and repetitive. The humor just does not work with me and the plot is mediocre at best. Still, if you like to grind an open world looter shooter with multiplayer(optional) then this is for you."
6584,G o o d  G a m e
6585,Rather Fun
6586,Great fun. Looting and shooting.
6587,I highly recommend this game to play with friends and i bet that you will never get bored of this game there is so much to do in it that is fun.
6588,So nostalgic
6589,"old game, fun stuff"
6590,Is PHENOMENAL love the art style and fluid game play.
6591,ok
6592,"good game, super fun. 10/10 for clap trap"
6593,Awesome game
6594,"There's not really anything I can say about this game that hasn't already been said, it perfectly combines RPG elements, first person shooter gameplay and humor to create the timeless classic that it is. I've run into almost no technical issues in my 111 hours in the game and have enjoyed every second of it, if you're a hardcore fan of first person shooters, enjoy dark comedy, or just want a way to waste some time, then I recomend this game."
6595,bong
6596,This game....It is just a classic. It ages really well. I don't care how many times I have played it...I enjoy it every single time.
6597,"This is the best game of the Borderlands franchise, Handsome Jack is undoubtedly the best character and villain of the entire Borderlands series."
6598,"Not my thing, but it's pretty good. Great with friends."
6599,GUNS GUNS GUNS
6600,"If you think its bad, your delusional :)"
6601,"One of my favorite games to play of all times because of the design, the story and all of the humorous/witty remarks from all the characters! I highly recommend it!!"
6602,this game was a big part of me since I was young really enjoy this game. THANK YOU GEARBOX!

6611,"I was not at all into first person shooters, but a friend had Borderlands 2 on Playstation 3, and suggested we play together online. I really liked the art, and it was on sale, so I figured I'd try it out. I now own it on PS3, PSVita, PC, and Switch. The art, the humor, the rewarding feeling of completing missions, the replayability, etc., Borderlands 2 has remained a favorite, and a necessary staple in my video game collections for years. I enjoy all the games in the series, but this one is my favorite!"
6612,Its Borderlands 2
6613,best game
6614,great game great villain saftisfying gameplay
6615,"land of the border the sequel, i dont know, i havent read the manga"
6616,good game
6617," My only gripe is Commander Lilith's Fight for Sanctuary, locking your op levels unless you purchase it. Which si super scummy because you already paid for that content and they shouldn't have released a dlc that costs more than the game with all dlc's usually does which locks your already purchased content."
6618,"I struggled to get into this game, even though I really tried to enjoy it. I respect a lot of things about it: humour, action, characters, the setting of Pandora. Outside of constantly dying in gunfights I just found it really irritating and loud and obnoxious to play."
6619,"Can't save game, if I need to do research just to save a godamn game in windows 11 then f@*# it!"

6625,"A wonderful game, great story and great graphics after such a long time since release.  I adore playing the game with my boyfriend."
6626,Hard to beat how great the villain is and how many different ways you can play the game with various characters. All around a funny entertaining game. 10/10 would play again.
6627,"At times, I cant beat something so I have to grind levels to be able to beat it, which is kind of annoying, but still a great game. The graphics are unique, and the story is good."
6628,Play this with friends and you'll have a blast. Honestly solo it's still good. Don't need to have played 1 to enjoy. Def the highlight of the series.

As of this writing, Borderlands 2 remains the pinnacle of the series. Excellent gameplay and top-notch humor writing.

There's an unfortunate usage of offensive terms for some of the enemies, but it's my understanding that Gearbox is at least trying to make some amends for that in their more current games."

6720,I started playing fps games in 96. The Borderlands games are the funnest ones to play that I've found so far.

6747,"This game saved my life.

I am 28.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
6748,"A very solid sequel for an already good game. My only misgivings with the first game was incredible imba SMGs and very weird co - op teleportation desynch. Witht Borderlands 2 , co - op works flawlessly and the weapon balance has been created from scratch. 
i don't think it's worth a buy for solo. But if you have friends easy buy , and you should probably gift it to them too!."

6752,"Played so much of this game on the PS3 and replayed it here on the PC cause one of my gaming buddies PS3 died on her so me and one other friend transferred here. Although got burned out redoing it again, building up my Krieg stopped for God knows how long. Then came back after playing the BL3 (who's story is was kinda meh, the gunplay is good and all but the writing and the characters were forgetable unlike in BL2) As much as I love BL3's Gunplay the story didn't really hooked me nor did the characters. So went back to BL2 and how I missed them and the characters as well as the writing. If you haven't gotten Bl2 grab the handsome collection it goes on sale fairly often and is worth buying. Lot of Content, Lots of Characters (more than BL3) better writing, lovable characters, an entertaining villain, overall a better experience in my opinion than BL3."
6753,Very fun game! Very Cool!

6774,"Borderlands 2 — игра для тех, кто любит находить потрясающее снаряжение, спрятанное в огромной куче других вещей. Конечно, вам НЕ НУЖНО углубляться в эту игру. В первом прохождении вы можете просто подбирать снаряжение во время путешествия, выбирать вещи, которые выглядят лучше, чем ваше текущее снаряжение.

Сюжет приличный для шутера от первого лица (хотя и с элементами RPG), а диалоги часто до некоторой степени забавны. Красавчик Джек, главный антагонист, является мультяшным злодеем. Он по крайней мере, делает вид, что верит, что он хороший парень, а вы просто «ублюдок, мать твою, а ну иди сюда».
Графически игра имеет гораздо больше вариаций дизайна и цветовой схемы, чем ее предшественница (которая была тусклой). Красиво затененная графика с толстыми контурами, похожими на графический роман — это стиль игры, который хорошо отделяет его от какой-либо другой игры в этом жанре.

Действие часто динамичное и захватывающее. Игра делает достойную работу, помогая вам разобраться в различных элементах, таких как различные типы оружия (пистолет, пистолет-пулемет, штурмовая/боевая винтовка, дробовик, револьвер, ракетная установка и снайперская винтовка), важность хорошего щита или мода на гранаты. (изменить стиль вашей гранаты, включая бонусы к урону и специальные эффекты), Моды на определенные классы (устройства, которые могут повышать навыки и иметь другие эффекты, такие как увеличение скорострельности с определенными типами оружия) и, наконец, реликвии (устройство, которое улучшает ту или другую часть вашего снаряжение).

Персонажи

Есть 4 игровых персонажа и два персонажа из DLC. У каждого класса есть свои навычки, а также уникальные для них особые навыки, меняющие правила игры. Например, Сальвадор (Берсерк) будет владеть двумя пушками, когда активен его навык действия, что означает ДВОЙНУЮ ОГНЕВУЮ МОЩЬ. Акстон (коммандос) сбрасывает турель, которая наносит урон врагам и отвлекает от вас агрессию. Майя (Сирена) на короткое время блокирует движения врага, позволяя вам наносить удары. Zer0 становится невидимым на несколько секунд и запускает приманку, а его первая атака в этом режиме наносит повышенный урон. 
Персонажи DLC: Гейдж (Мехромант), запускает летающего робота, который атакует ближайших врагов, и Крейг (Психо); шизофренический мускулистый маньяк, который кидается на все в пределах досягаемости с улучшенными наступательными и оборонительными способностями и может даже метнуть свой топор в более отдаленные цели.

Игра вышла слишком охуительной для своего года - и до сих пор она есть популярной.

6775,Honestly one of my favourite games to date.
6776,"Minecraft easter egg

11/10"
6777,"This game has given me some of the best memories I will ever have with my best mate, this game is incredibly funny and just genuinely fun. Especially with friends, also the sales steam puts on this are awesome. buy this game :)"
6778,"The gameplay is fun early on but the grind is terrible. I just want to find a good weapon and mess around with it, but on higher difficulties it feels like your gear is outdated almost as soon as you finish grinding for it. At lower difficulty this doesn't matter too much since you can just use underleveled guns and have fun anyway, but eventually enemies become bullet sponges and playing with bad gear becomes a huge chore.

I want to rate it yes because I did have some fun, but I feel like the majority of the game is just painful to play."
6779,Pog
6780,Just as good as it used it be
6781,hehe me shoot rocket people go boom

6799,this is one of the best games I have ever played and will definitely be getting borderlands 4 as already completed 1 2 and 3
6800,loistava :D
6801,goobed n shit
6802,.
6803,"Most of my playtime was way back when on Xbox 360 (1000+ hours), however I have put an additional 200 hours on PC and experienced the game in it's most update form. I will be making comparisons to the games sequel, Borderlands 3 often as it is a good reference, and depending on what you are looking for may be a better purchase.

The game has a lot of content, and a huge grind to go through if that's your thing. 
The combat is fun - killing enemies feels good, and getting loot feels rewarding. Borderlands 3 improves on both the shooting and the looting, but this game is still very good in that regard.
The story and dialogue are funny and interesting, unlike Borderlands 3, which is mostly just abysmal with the occasional golden nugget.

A couple negatives however. 
As mentioned, the grind is immense. Progressing as a casual player without aid of inventory editing programs requires a few story resets to get higher level versions of essential items for your build. 
The end game also has a heavy requirement on an element type in game, slag. It increases your damage output to the point of it being one of the only ways to kill enemies in the endgame efficiently. 
Thus the endgame gameplay loop boils down to switching weapons to reapply slag constantly (unless you are Salvador, in which case you don't care because you are unkillable either way) - which doesn't exactly 'feel' good as compared to Borderlands 3 gun play.

Overall, Borderlands 2 is a great game for both single/double digit hour casual playthroughs, or triple/multi digit hour gamer grindfests to perfect your characters and their gear. 
If you are looking for a balanced goodness of both gameplay and story - get Borderlands 2. 
If you are looking for pure gameplay and can turn your brain off to bad story/writing - get Borderlands 3."
6804,I want everything you got
6805,"Lots of passion and can be a good amount of fun but is bogged down by sloppy game design, quests that either soft-lock easily or treat you like a child a force a large amount of redundant flags that kill the pacing of the game. Also the game is balanced for multiplayer due to the ""fight for your life"" mechanic, as a solo player the mechanic tends to be useless and degrading, 90% of the time the mechanic is simply a waste of time and its quicker just to end your own life when you are downed.  This also led to sloppy enemy design that essentially intends for you die and be picked up by a friend, drowning the game in kamikaze enemies is just not fun for solo players. Also be ready to watch copious amounts short cut-scenes with no skip button no matter how many times you've seen them before, be it the first or fourth play-through with a character. I would like to reiterate that the game is fun and was clearly made with a lot of passion but re-playing through the game as an adult has led to far more frustrating experiences than fun ones."
6806,Great game with amazing game play. Also has very nice graphics and for the storage space it takes and the length of the game makes it worth while. Very fun to play with friends.
6807,Good game except co-op laggy af
6808,"Now, I still need to finish the game as of writing this, but I've had only a ball of time learning how to play this with a special someone I've been playing this with. He's been a fan of this series for years so I knew I had to play one of the games with him. Once I got over the nerves of playing as a newbie with a practical veteran, I had a blast working as a team with him. Whether it be him explaining his favorite lore to me, helping me find my footing by teaching me weapon types and figuring out good strategies to fight certain waves of enemies, or me learning to not be so scared to mess up and being able to laugh with him when I get flung across the land by an enemy absolutely annihilating me, it's only brought me tons of joy. Unbiased-ness aside, the gameplay is still very engaging and the characters and dialogue are so charming and fun, I'm never bored playing it. I very much recommend it <333"
6809,SUCKS
6810,cool game
6811,"Good game very racist
"
6812,Murdering psychopaths is fun would recommend 9.11/10
6813,Still a great game so many things to do and kill. never gets old I have the full version with all addons a must have shooter
6814,this game has 5 vault hunters who are on a journey to stop the man himself handsome jack on the way in the adventure there are tonssssss i mean tonssssssssss of guns to use to defeat enemys and bosses and thos guns can be used on a ability on your skill tree everyone has their own diffrent abilitys i recommend it's fun solo but mostly with friends
6815,glitchy and cringe game. you have to restart your whole PC if you tab out or close the game because your whole computer will start to bug.
6816,CLASSIC!
6817,Funny
6818,i think it is a good game
6819,Having a man asking you to shoot him point blank in the head is the best kind of quest I could ever ask for in a game.
6820,I love this game so much probably one of my favorite games and very fun to play with friends and it has so much story and so much to do.
6821,amazing graphics and over all just an amazing game

The game is so much fun, you will literally not even notice until there is a calm moment."
6832,"Great Game
"
6833,"I just replayed this game in January 2022, for like the 10th time(my in game time is almost 500 hours now).  Bottom line is that it is amazing.  The single player campaign is awesome, its story is great and has probably the best villain of all time.  This game has great replayability and never feels like a grind.  I love this games simplicity.  You can basically make any build and have fun.  There is no crafting(which is good). There is no open world(also good).  But the gunplay is excellent and Fun!  If you are thinking of playing this game in 2022 or later I would suggest getting the community patch mod.  It helps fix some of the stuff that gearbox never got around to fixing.  Having also played a crap ton of borderlands 3, for better or worse, I can say this may be Gearbox's crowning achievement and they may never top it.  This is definitely without a doubt in my top 3 favorite games of all time.  Get this game and you will see what I mean!"

6879,"At first, the game seems great for a co-op with a friend, and so it is, until you get to know it more.

- The inventory interface and item management is literally the most tiresome and inconvenient piece of garbage i've ever seen in videogames, and I've seen a lot. 
I don't know who was it made for, but definetely nor for human beings.

- Game consists of vast spaces with respawning enemies. You have to travel by feet since you have extremely limited fast travel.
Even after finishing a mission you can't return to a base or even start of the map, so a lot of time this game will be nothing but a walking sim.

- Limited skillpoints. You can't max out all skills, if you play long enough. You can do like a half of those, and this game is not really a build game, all of those skills are good for you, so you always feel deprived.

- Scaling in the game is atrocious.
Soon you will be overlevelled and start to one-shot everything and get like 0 xp.
But you can't do anything about it without restarting whole game from scratch on a higher difficulty.
And because this game has brilliant balance, get ready for bullet sponge enemies, who will 2-shot you, and you'll need like half of all your аfull ammo and 5+ minutes of shooting to kill one of those (with no reward to make it wirth your while mind you).

- But wait, it gets better - when you reach level 50, you will get almost 0 exp even for enemies higher level than you! 
And while monsters scale with your level, the quest rewards don't so be ready to ger level 35 weapons on level 50.
So what can we do ti fix it? 
Restart the whole game from scratch on even higher difficly!
So fun!"
6880,great game
6881,yes
6882,"Whether or not you want a good online/singleplayer FPS to try, this is the game for you. Play it solo or with friends, but never buy the vanilla, [u]GET IT WITH ALL THE DLC's[/u]! Why? Because [b]EXPLOSIONS[/b]-oh and you [u]shoot unicorns at people[/u] at some point. It goes against everything and everyone and it's horribly good at it. Let me tell you why:

While the base game is a total phenomenon and crazy (in the good sense), it has major issues that the DLC's repair one by one. Issues like boredom, horrible drop rates, enhanced-legendary-super-heavy plot armor, bugged mission items, blurred graphics and character bias. 

Taken one by one, these are the issues explained:

◙ Main storyline is so short without the side quests, you can finish the whole game in 1 day in probably 6 hours. Side quests are put there for you to enjoy references and have a good laugh but they also push you to play more (basic strategy) in an attempt to get you addicted. If however you do not like doing side quests...boredom is inevitable. Besides that, most players have most DLC's so you're going to feel left out if you attempt on playing offline. I recommend waiting for a sale and getting the Handsome Collection bundle (that does not come with Fight for Sanctuary DLC, which sadly is necessary).

◙ Drop rates are horrible because farming is called farming for a reason: very repetitive, most of the times slow depending on the weapon you need, reminds me of Warframe. However this is a big issue if you play offline. Online, you can just ask someone to duplicate their legendary and you're pretty farm-free. Most of the people you will meet are friendly as ****. To add to this, farming before reaching Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is a certified waste of time because [u]True Vault Hunter mode[/u] ([i]TVHM[/i]) will give you better [i]Pistals[/i] than the legendary weapons you farm in the normal mode, and same in [u]Ultimate Vault Hunter mode[/u] ([i]UVHM[/i]) where it gives you better [i]Pooshka's[/i]. Oh you thought that's it? No-no-no, there's also Overpower levels from [u]Raid on Digistruc Peak[/u] DLC. You will feel the grind by that point. Nonetheless it pays off at the end. There's a total of 80 levels and after 10 overpower levels so keep that special Handsome Jack side quest with jumping into lava for last. 

◙ The plot armor is so extra thick, you can spawn a turret behind Handsome Jack and it won't shoot him (you can do this btw). It's so thick and heavy it broke its jaw while trying to drink water. Why? You are a random character (which you choose based on preference and all are viable provided you learn how to) who competes against a rich dude owning an entire company worth so much money (not adding those you give him by dying) that it could snap a finger and invade Pandora. You kill him. And you end up killing a GOD with a basic weapon that anyone can get. It's so bad in fact that you sit and watch Handsome Jack do something horrible 1 meter away from you and you have a gun but decide to stare at him. I'm 100% sure by now whoever made the game played with legos in the office. 

◙ If you hurry too much (as in instakill), some mission items are not spawned IN the map and remain OUTSIDE it. 

◙ The base game has blurred graphics. I'm not even sure why, I was naive enough to buy the base game first and was disappointed of the graphics up until I got the DLC's and all of the sudden it's HD. Why? Legos. I bet it was the legos. 

◙ Character bias stands like this: the best characters are the brain-dead characters (extremely advantageous to play). But this isn't much of an issue unless you like the Commando and you're envy on a Zer0 that instakills everything. Thing is...all characters are viable provided you learn how to use them and improve your skill and knowledge of the battlefield/enemies (like in every other games). BUT-and this is a warning: IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T PLAY, IT'S NO SHAME TO PLAY THE BIAS CLASSES. They are all made to be fun, and nevertheless, THEY ARE ALL FUN. Trust me I'm a Witcher. They all have fun perks and skills and very good utilities too. It's just more work with some more than others and while it does look visibly unfair, it's not about advantage, it's about players. More hardcore gamers can have fun with the Commando for example while others might not. They represent player types and if fame and recognition is what you want, remember: you're on a planet run by psychos and exploited by corporations and ideologies, there is no fame and glory, just death so have fun while at it.

The DLC's: Generally repair drop rates, provide fun story-line, more references and even better and fun weapons to use

[b]Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre[/b] ✯ / ✯✯✯✯✯ [1/5] (This...this could've been much more, but it felt like it was just thrown there. Kind of made me think it is a waste of money to even include it in the Handsome Pack, I'd add the Fight for Sanctuary in it instead and take this one out)

[b]Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax[/b] ✯✯✯ / ✯✯✯✯✯ [3/5] (Enjoyable, ok , but recycled)

I rate it F for 100% FUN, as fun as the legos they played in the office while making this. It's a must-have game in your library.

6910,"Borderlands 2 is a perfect example of a game that has stood the test of time. It is the best game to just fall back to when you're feeling down, bored of other games, or what have you. I have been playing BL2 since it came out in 2012 on various platforms. I first had it on my mac, to then buying it on the ps3, then got it on the ps4, and immediately bought it when I got my PC. This is a game that never gets boring, whether your grinding for legendary loot, grinding each character to completion, or just casually going at your own pace. That's the best thing about this game, there's no correct way to play it, play it how you like and you're going to have a great time! At the same time, it is very challenging, especially when you get to UVHM, which really puts your skills and patience to the test. 

If you're new to borderlands and considering buying it, I would 10000000000%  recommend, you will not be disappointed."
6911,Dont throw away your life.

6914,"Borderlands 2 is a just the full package when it comes to a game, you have great story with lots of interesting characters and an unforgettable villain, too much loot with an insane variety of weapons both basic and unique with 6 different characters when including the DLC that all have their own abilities, graphics that still look pretty solid after a decade has passed with a few rough edges but with the amount of content and enjoyment to be had i cannot recommend this game enough."
6915,"best game ever. Drunk, sober, naked or nude, it's the best. Yur welcome."
6916,Its a Classic...
6917,"Awesome game, loads of fun!"
6918,I think this is my favorite game
6919,"Really really fun.
Really, really funny.
Endlessly entertaining with a fantastic visual aesthetic and soundtrack.
My favourite game!
10/10"
6920,good game. well designed game!
6921,"This is an absolute lighthearted, but exciting cartoon graphics RPG action shooter including interesting, funny characters to guide the story and game play along.  The other thing that's great about Borderlands 2 is that you can jump into playing the game after long periods of not playing it.  That is, there's no serious thinking involved that relies on what you did last when you played the game, unlock other, serious RPGs."
6922,"yeah man, get it"
6923,"This is the best campaign of any game I have ever played. That does not matter all that much however, because the only reason I recommend this game is because the main villain is insatiably attractive."
6924,"Borderlands 2 where can I start with this game, it's like my childhood and I love this game so much. This game has made a very big impact on my life before I was bullied now I am a multi millionaire, times person of the year for 2006 and so much more. So if you have never played this game then please use your money and buy this game. Please."
6925,definitely fun to play with friends! would totally recommend to everyone!
6926,Yah
6927,dobra gierka
6928,"Fantastic game, period. Always a new game every time I pick it up"
6929,"Ong the best game in the Francise, The 3rd one isnt to bad but just this game the bosses are so much fun to farm and i feel like the lengedary pool in this game is the best"
6930,.
6931,still the best game in the series by far. gfx are a little lacking nowadays but it gives such a nostalgic feel still
6932,good game but hard
6933,one of the best games i have ever played
6934,one of the best entries in the series been playing this game since it released on console now modding on pc
6935,this is one of the best games of all time and the DLC's make it so much better i have spent over 1000 hours and probably haven't done half of what you can do 10 out of 10
6936,tryna play w my friend on mac and this shit dont work thumbs down
6937,This is best game ever
6938,"Fun combat, good campaign (better story than BL1 IMHO), big environment with lots to do."
6939,thats gay
6940,Simply the best borderlands game.
6941,I played the hell out of this game as a kid on the PS3. Such an amazing game with an incredible story and unique gameplay. Give it a shot!
6942,"Idk why people say its the best in the series, I couldn't even complete it, tbh liked the 3rd game more cuz it's more polished and modern
(Ignore the playtime i played most of it on epic launcher giveaway)"
6943,just kinda boring lol
6944,good game better than bl3 by a mile :P
6945,"It's just amazing. Play it. Buy it. Have fun with an insane amount of different weird amazing guns, hilarious and addicting story line - and just generally bless the day you came across this absolute GEM."
6946,fun
6947,badass
6948,"Every single bloody thing about this game is either annoying or cringe, or both. It definitely didn't hold up to the test of time and aged like milk. It's ugly, it's loud, it's scuffed, and unnecessarily grindy."
6949,"A once in a lifetime experience.
One of the best games out there."
6950,this game is just funny and good handsome jack is one of the best bad boy's in game history play the game then play it again cause you did not reach level 76
6951,Puts BL3 to shame
6952,the game was so good i spent 11 hours loading in to the game which is really fast!
6953,very good game
6954,Gooten game
6955,who needs good mental health when you have borderlands
6956,Best borderlands ever made
6957,boderlans to
6958,I had a blast playing this game with a couple friends. expecially with the expansions. loved the humor and the arcade-y shooting.
6959,Moist game
6960,"its good, but roland shouldnt have been murdered."
6961,this game is why im not single
6962,"I wish RNG didn't play as big of a role as it does, but it be do. 
Getting some guns can be a pain in the ass. 
game's funny though. 
Get it and play the Tiny Tina DLC. 
"

6964,god these pretzels suck
6965,Great.
6966,"amazing game with so much to explore and endless fun! 

absolute cesspool of a company tho."
6967,"Great game, a must have for any borderlands fans. Also if you played Borderlands 3 you may recognize some maps from there."
6968,I want to stop playing but there's a chest over there and I need to open it.
6969,"game good

6970,claptrap is so hot
6971,So much fun!!!!
6972,good game
6973,absolutely beautiful been playing it since release and gear box has done an amazing job building such an amazing immersive world.
6974,"easy.  This game  is THE BOMB.  EVERY TIME I START ANOTHER GAME IT SEEMS THAT THE ITEMS AND THE PROGRESSION WITHIN THE MENU SYSTEM ARE DIFFERENT  (?)  The  thing is that  the game seemed to me to play like  a new edition of my favorite game!  which it is and was ,, some other games have that feeling also but none of them have the the history, longevity or  the fun factor.
"
6975,ggez
6976,ye
6977,The best one in the series by far
6978,Face Mc Shooty (obviously)
6979,There's no one more handsome than handsome jack
6980,its okay
6981,8===>
6982,"one of the better looter shooters of our time, maybe the best"
6983,Borderlands 2 is the best looter shooter game I've ever played. Definitely recommend to people looking for a good looter shooter game/
6984,"All the Borderlands games are good- standard FPS with a cartoon feel, decent skill trees and weapons upgrades to keep it from getting really boring, decent replay value."
6985,"I have played all four of the Borderlands games and this one was my favorite. Gameplay was enjoyable and challenging. Graphics  were still very much  like in the first game but refined a bit more. Besidesall that, it was just all out fun discovering new challenges and finding those rare guns."
6986,"funny gun pew pew
"
6987,ME likey a lot
6988,Every single game with UNSKIPPABLE INTROS and CUTSCENES can go FUCK ITSELF!
6989,poggers
6990,Good game
6991,I love when my weapons transcend reality by floating into the ceiling
6992,Yes
6993,"out of all the games I've played, this one has the most hours consumed. Not on steam but on the ps3 and that was before the handsome jack collection which came with all the dlc for 5 dollars. This game will keep you busy for months if not years."
6994,"Good game to play with friends, get on sale. Pretty awesome if you buy it with dlc bundle, then its waaay cheaper. Also good replay value and pretty hilarious if you have 3 friends to play with, quests are super funny."
6995,Ten years later and still great.
6996,Good game
6997,"MP is dead so if you don't have friends to play with don't get this game, as a single player game it's a pretty mediocre looter shooter, nothing gameplay wise here that hasn't been done better in other games, style wise the game was kind of unique back in the day, but now Borderlands writing and art have been done to death by a milllion copy cats, watch some videos to see if you like the comedy style, if yes get it, if no avoid it."
6998,Great game. Not the best of the series but still awesome. Years later still cool thanks to codes to give you new weapons and ng+
6999,cool
7000,best game ever made (i my opinion)
7001,"Randy Pitchferd, you're a bitch, my dude"
7002,"Best looter-shooter of all time, 30k hours on ps3. :)"
7003,ummm good game
7004,"This game is awesome. I've played it both solo and co-op and both are fun as hell. The dialogue is like, funny 20% of the time, and so bad it's good the other 80%. It surprisingly makes for a good time."
7005,Reeee
7006,"Absolutely hilarious game. I will be honest, no game has made me laugh half as much as this game. The gameplay is quite enjoyable as well. Stupid amount of content. Can recommend this game in a heartbeat."
7007,Still one of the best games to play for hours on end even today
7008,"Finished this a lot of times, I love playing this game. Its fun playing alone but it a lot better playing with friends <3"
7009,GG
7010,Love it.
7011,it is good. i recommend that you play borderlands 2.
7012,Game runs smooth and I love the bosses/animations in this game!! Recommended for sure
7013,Hands down one of my favorite games of all time! the replayability is really good and its a ton of fun to bring a few friends along for the ride
7014,"Nothing new from Borderlands 1 really. 
You can still unload 3 full clips of a shotgun point-blank into a bandit's face without killing them.

Pros:
+ 4 Player Co-op
+ Skin and outfit colors unlocked with a Borderlands 1 save game.

Cons:
- Guns that don't make sense and shoot like crap. Some even verbally harass you.
- Constantly having to switch out to level-appropriate guns while not getting a chance to get used to your weapons.
- Level-based encounters. You don't stand a chance against higher-level enemies, and lower-level enemies are just annoying.
- Backtrack, Backtrack, Backtrack. Constantly have to re-traverse completed areas and again fight the respawned enemies.
- NPC enemies always have perfect aim. They can be hundreds of yards away, doing cartwheels, or hiding behind a wall and every single one of their bullets hit you.
- Game crashes without saving quite often. Leaving you with none of the gear, XP, or mission progress."
7015,im dead inside
7016,"Hours of fun, story is beyond fantastic. Constantly replayable since you can change up the character / abilities.  Dialogue is fairly mature but it's just my kind of humor. The characters are lovable, and hilarious. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously."
7017,"Amazing game.
Good story.
Much recommend.
That is all.
Have a good day."
7018,Very good!
7019,meat bicycle
7020,"very gud
"
7021,the 2nd best one handsome jack is funny and evil
7022,"There are a lot of reasons Why BL2 is so amazing. It touches on a lot of addicting gameplay concepts and ties them all into one neat bundle then injects a world of comedy into it. Most drawback and gimmicks from different manufacturers feel very tacked on for the sake of being unique like Hyperion, Vladof and Dahl. Torgue also made explosive shots exclusive to them which also limited the modifier. 

The shooter aspect is fun, so is the looting and build crafting, and then of course you have the story that's actually entertaining and engaging. It's a fun game."
7023,the lady at the gambling place has big milkers
7024,feels better than a fleshlight
7025,"This game is probably meant for anyone who likes gaming. 
That's all, this game is probably my favorite game I have every played."
7026,it good game
7027,mid game worst game in the century -my balls/10
7028,BUY THE GAME ITS WORTH TO PLAY
7029,Incredible game that makes looting and shooting fun all the time no matter how many times I've completed it.
7030,"astagfirullah

7031,borderland good
7032,I very like this game
7033,"A funny, action-packed, story-driven game with great voice acting, a good story, and a soundtrack that would make Grand Theft Auto proud. The artstyle is unique and the characters are all lovable in their own way."
7034,gud.
7035,no complains
7036,"gaem

7037,"handsome jack literally made the game. not even in a ""oh he's the best character"" way. no. he literally sat down and script coded this entire franchise. extremely sexy of him"

7041,"its very good game there is a story 
and u stop the evil side"
7042,"This is one of my all time favorite games, I've put hundreds of hours into ""Borderlands 2"" across multiple systems and all of it was definitely worth it, if you get recommended this game you should for sure give it a try"
7043,Good game
7044,Do I really need to explain what Borderlands is? Didn't think so.
7045,"best borderlands game (from when it came out to the new tiny tina game) 3 was honestly kinda dog water. 1. it did not have anything new like a new character like every other game did even the Pre-sequel. 2. it got kinda repetitive with the story line, it kept telling you to go get a vault key over and over and over. end of thingy 2 is best borderlands game period."
7046,Guns.
7047,One of the best games ever made
7048,"I played Borderlands (1) on Nintendo Switch and was completely hooked on it, I purchased Borderland 2 for PC and the experience was terrible, I could not control the player in any way similar to first game, the graphics were really poor and ended up asking for a refund.

To be fair maybe maybe Nvidia Geforce MX 330 was not good enough for the graphics"
7049,"Its Borderlands 2. Over the top, awesome, and a generally fun time. I got no complaints from a classic. Now excuse me while I try and find the meat train...I still must sample its goodness."
7050,Pure fun game and fun to play around with friends
7051,yes
7052,"the best game of the saga, to have a good time with your friends"
7053,I've put way to many hours into this game...
7054,"One of the few games I never have an issue just starting all over and playing over again. Played for years across PS3 and PS4, and am currently regaining all my progress again on PC. This game is absolutely worth the money. Pick up the Handsome collection if you can, as it comes with all the DLC and the Pre-Sequel, which will provide you with hours and hours of content. 
10/10 favorite game of all time."
7055,good
7056,135 Hours well spent.
7057,craptrap
7058,good game cool gun lots shoot
7059,"my xbox scratched my borderlands 2 disc a long time ago.
im glad i finally got over the grief and replayed this masterpiece.
"
7060,Still a great game today
7061,Fun and colourful shooter with crazy and eccentric characters and NPC's.
7062,"The best in the Borderlands franchise hands down. 

Loot and shoot whilst having fun and ready yourself to run around….a lot….preferably with friends. Mechanics is sounds and game play flow is smooth. Borderlands is not known for the story telling abilities compared to alternatives – but again – this game is enjoyed for other reasons. Great challenges are hidden within as well.
"
7063,dsasdgdfg
7064,number go up
7065,I grew up on this shit
7066,best of the borderlands games
7067,decent looter shooter. unexpectedly great writing
7068,+
7069,yes would reccomend
7070,"Play it, as long as you're willing to install BL2 Reborn. This modpack gives this old game fresh life even in 2022 with new guns, better scaling and droprates, and revamped perk trees for a few characters!"
7071,Best Borderlands. No competition.
7072,"This game is the best sequel to borderlands this game is a must try game first why are you even going through the reviews just play the game and you can type the same thing as i do yeah sure the game is hard for example it takes 5 hours to kill the WAR-DEN and 7 hours to kill the BUN-KER but besides that its a really solid game 
Tips:
Try to find the Tediore brand guns their really useful
if your new to the game pick maya the siren she has an ability called faze lock which stop an enemy from attacking but not all of them (really useful for grinding bosses)
if you are a solid good player pick salvadore the gunzerkur he has akimbo/duel weld bassicly a broken move where you can get your secondary gun to duel weld so if you have like 2 rocket launcher nobody can tough you lol
if your VERY VERY GOOD at the game pick axtone because he has a turret which not only is the best for bosses but also the end power it has an abillity to nuke it self when its placed down pretty cool
if you like assasins creed pick Zero bassicly he has a cloak abillity he makes a dupe of him and you become invisible great for if you wanna run away or get into a diffrent postion to attack enemys or boss one of the 2

and thats it sorry if its messy lolz"
7073,"Borderlands 2 - What a classic. With the best story, playable characters, skill trees, dialogue, writing, quests, and guns in the business, why play any other looter shooter?"
7074,Awesome game hands down one of my best game i've ever played.
7075,played since i was little.
7076,yeah it good
7077,Has tiny tina in it.

7093,"Borderlands 3 came out and was awful. I was unsure of whether it was just the game or it was something else. It was something else.

Wonderlands came out and went full throttle on what the problem was. Gearbox, and consequently, Borderlands, has gone woke.

Don't support them by buying this game."
7094,"This is one of my favorite games ever!  I was first introduced to Borderlands 2 from a friend in elementary school.  We were both young and didn't really understand what to do or how to progress so we both thought it was pretty stupid.  However, the summer leading to my freshman year of high school I found the game again on the xbox store.  I had completely forgot ever playing the game as a kid, but as soon as I started playing the memories came back.  Now that I understand the game I highly recommend it to any and everyone."
7095,super addicting
7096,niggas in paris
7097,"Highly recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone looking for a fun coop shooter experience with friends. The story itself is pretty basic and forgettable, but what you're really here for is deep and complex skill trees as well as hours of zany fun with friends."
7098,love it!
7099,.

7108,I just love this game. I have nothing more to say.
7109,"Holy shit this game is so addicting and once you reach UVHM it genuinely gets hard, spent hours farming rare weps and dont regret a second of it. Would recommend 100/10"
7110,very fun. one of my top games of all time
7111,"If you like over the top and zany action with a ton of weapon options, this is the game for you. Legit funny at times and cringe funny at its worst. Both Borderlands 1 and 2 are def a worthy add to your library."
7112,"I love this game, the pre-sequel was my favourite on console.
Honestly fun as hell, it does a lot for me.
There's always something to do in borderlands, and the story is honestly pretty good.
Borderlands has always been a favourite of mine and will continue to be.
When I finish this story I have set out a plan to do all the side missions. 
Can get frustrating sometimes but that's a good thing, there's a challenge to it; but not too much.
I recommend this game to anyone who likes a more ""simple"" but still ""full"" game."
7113,The best game of the series in my opinion. The player-characters are fun and unique. Fun to play alone; even better with friends.
7114,You know what is.
7115,yes
7116,"I HAVE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THIS GAME.

7123,"I'm late to the party but borderlands 2 is truly a gem! and what I really love about it is the story really enjoyable and difficulties to pass a mission. it's not like the usual missions of other games like availability of weapon and a clear objective, easiness etc.. here it's like you must develop your hunter by yourself, more like a homeless want to start a new shiny beginning in his life, searching & farming through all maps and side quests in order to maximize skill level and get some decent weapons from vaults and bosses to finish the main quests, it's not an easy game to be honest, but you like challenging games? then borderlands is the best choice for you, seriously

PS: I know it's a mistake to start from BL2 and should have follow chronological order of the series. but in the final, I enjoy it, no matter what I missed but I'll definitely buy the other ones to continue what I start."

7128,"Still my favorite of the Border Lands (BL) franchise. My favorite build is elemental Phycho, make em and urself sizzzzzzle good. The diversity and play styles of all the classes are well built and enjoyable, offering plenty of replay ability. The story line of BL is great in BL2, noticing new things even on my 11th character. If you like FPS and RPG, or just one of those genres, then pick up this title for yourself."

- A LOT of walking/backtracking

DLCs (SHOULD be bought on sale!)
DLC 1 Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty
+ An extremely fun DLC with much new content and funny, over-the-top characters.

DLC 2 Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage
+ A bit on the shorter side, but with even more insane characters than the first DLC, including Mr. Torque, which has become my favourite character in the game

DLC 3 Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt
+ A shorter DLC with many new enemies, fun missions and a hilarious villain. Overall a very good DLC, aside from the fetch quest, which requires you to rely on rare enemy spawns.

DLC 4 Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep
+ Amazing DLC with fun fantasy elements, cool narrator moments like in Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, but too much backtracking

DLC Headhunter 1 - T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest - OK
DLC Headhunter 2 - The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler - Very Good
DLC Headhunter 3 - How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day - OK
DLC Headhunter 4 - Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre - Very Good
DLC Headhunter 5 - Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax - Good

7148,Defines the looter shooter franchise
7149,"Un pur chef-d'oeuvre, si tu as fait le 1 tu te dois de faire le 2, meilleur dans sa narration, meilleur par les héros du jeu, un des meilleurs antagoniste du monde du jeu vidéo, une durée de vie vraiment convenable.
Les graphismes en self-shading, l'humour omniprésent, la tonne de quêtes, d'armes, de compétences en font un jeu vraiment incroyable, je recommande fortement !"

7158,I personally love this game and think its an all time great however the only issue is once you reach UVHM and OP levels you cant really mess around and need an exact build or else you just wont be successful.

7171,"Even though this game is old now, this game has so many things you can do with many different guns you can get. The story line  is good without is being to long or short. Just have some friends play with you sometimes so you can have more fun and have a higher chance of getting better loot. ^_^"

7178,GOOD SHOOT
7179,perfect game
7180,"B2 is arguably THE BEST VIDEO GAME EVER! Period. It certainly beat the living hell out of its ""successor"" Borderlands 3 (which is essentially a trash game). B2 is the original looter shooter, predating Fortnite et al by several years. Great game play, design, story, characters, and fantastic DLC. Plus nearly infinite replayability for years, especially with the figurative tons of fan-created mods. If you are into shooters and haven't played Borderlands 2, I presume you have been under a rock on the moon for the last decade or so. Seriously, start playing the Borderlands series, with the huge exception of Borderlands 3. DO NOT PLAY B3 unless you can get it for free, or $10 at the very most including it's crappy DLC."

7232,A storyline FPS with GTA-style missions and a Diablo-esque loot system.  Just buy it now if you're into all 3 of those types of games.  Note that the linux version is no longer compatible with the windows version so you'll have to use proton to play with windows users (but it works flawlessly in proton full-screen).

7234,ok
7235,good
7236,"You might find Sanctuary a comfortable place in the Borderlands, but guns, money, and adventure call.

Obsessively open elaborately animated chests, neutralise blood-thirsty psychiatric patients with guns stolen from your nearest toilet or mounted upon vehicles of death and destruction, but most importantly, get to the Vault before Handsome Jack does.

The DLCs are worth it.

7238,All the Borderlands are great for replay. Still play on my box and ps. Although the pre was a bad remake of 1 honestly. It does still have the same kill them all feel with less gravity.

7244,yes
7245,"To my fellow adults who grew up with this game. If you know, you know."
7246,"This game should be a masterclass in how to design and make characters. the gameplay is incredibly addicting to me for some reason and i can never really stop playing it, no matter how many times i beat it. this game is very clearly the best game in the series and i dont think its very close. the dialogue is the funniest of any game ive really played and its not even barely dated even though this game is almost 10 years old. it has a certain soul to it that can barely be matched by any looter shooter game. Handsome Jack will by far go down as the best video game villain of all time. he is incredibly funny and intimidating even though he mostly just makes jokes, but when he is serious its an insane contrast to his normal comments. this game is my favorite video game of all time."

Moxxi really good character"

Best of all 4 games in the series."
7253,"I like this game because its fun to shoot people and monsters. The storyline, the character customizations, the guns, everything makes this game so fun to play. I recommend it!"
7254,"I mean it's Borderlands.  If you haven't played this game yet, you should.  The art style is beautiful, the story line and characters are hilarious.  You like FPS?  Play this game!"
7255,I have played this game on most platforms and i enjoy this game everytime I play this game. If there is anything I could complain about this game is there is still some bugs that need to be sorted on the game before I can give it a five stars!
7256,Buying the dlc is the hardest puzzle in the game

7262,"very fun with friends
"
7263,"Fun to play with friends. In general super fun when you get the hang of it and just get to run and shoot. And I was surprised bc I didn't think I'd like the story so much. The first one was kind of ""meh"" and I couldn't really name any of the NPCs that didn't show up in this one too, but Borderlands 2? Nice. And such a good antagonist."
7264,"Good game, many content (-_-)b"
7265,"hey, for 20$, this game is pretty good."
7266,mashallah
7267,"pros: stunning presentation & style that immerses the player, jokes & voice acting, unique character designs, refined ""shoot & loot"" formula, less bugs than the first borderlands, weapons variety & gunplay, main story & side missions were entertaining, no need for third-party programs to play multiplayer like the first game did (but the experience is just as bad), the Tiny Tina DLC

cons: too much backtracking (especially with side missions) that have you going back & forth between map instances, frustrating & immersion-breaking... clown-car enemy spawning, you only get one active ability (everything else on the skill trees are passives), multiplayer experience is just as abysmal as the first game (unless you know who you are playing with)

Overall, Borderlands 2 has been on my ""to play list"" for a long time (I patiently wait for the GOTY edition for a complete experience, because Gearbox isn't known for quality & consistency when they release games).
Borderlands 2 has my recommendation."

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!
7281,"Just buy it!  

I came to the game many many years late, with all the DLCs available and a lot of information available and I'm glad it happened that way. I never dreamed I would sink as many hours into a game as I have in this, but it's just such a deep game.

I'm normally a stick it on 'normal' difficulty and finish it once kind of guy. But this game rewards you for playing harder difficulties and encourages it. The harder the difficulty, the bigger the damage numbers you deal. Make no mistake though, this is a hard game. I've played exclusively solo and this game can and will kick your ass. Think you are doing well and then...boom you are dead. And that's just NVHM (easy) mode. From there, there are 2 more difficulty levels and 10 overpower levels to unlock and complete. But you will feel compelled to do them, because more is better.

If you manage to get bored with the vanilla game, which is pretty hard, there are countless mods you can get to change things up.

In short, this must be the best value for money game out there. In fact, I've been playing games since the Atari 2600 was a thing, and I've owned pretty much every console and PC iteration along the way and played 1000s of games along the journey. This is the best, most compelling and addictive game I've ever played. Just buy it!"
7282,"Buggy, but good. A fun romp with a sense of humour and big guns. Best played with friends."
7283,i mean come on its borderlands 2 it a classic
7284,A great solo game and still great fun with friends!
7285,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
7286,Moxxi stole my tips and drank my sneed.
7287,"No, not thing, the art style hurts me inside, if you are easily entertained by things slightly funny and love random stuff then you will enjoy this game, personally, Borderlands 1,2 and 3 are a no for me. I tried to get into it, just can't."
7288,Nice
7289,"Solid humor throughout, loot system activates the old dopamine receptors like you want them to, music is unexpectedly excellent and like... they didn't have to do that? Just reeks of someone or a team who really wanted to make the best product possible. Good solo but really good with one or two friends, the interaction between abilities and drops makes for a fuller experience but all those 255 hours were not in a group, so don't worry if you don't have friends."
7290,Classic
7291,I like this one
7292,ooooh
7293,"Playing for over 10 years!!
"
7294,"I mean at this point.. If you haven't played Borderlands 2, what are you doing with your life?  11/10 would butt stallion again,"
7295,"An old game whose gameplay is still kinetic, cooperative, and sufficiently varied.
And, guns. Tons upon tons of GUNS. It's like Diablo for FPS. 
Gotta love that combo."
7296,"pros: it has gray fox from metal gear solid as a playable character
cons: the actual game is shit"
7297,"Are you playing any form of shooter and just can't scratch that hoarder itch that all games give you?
Try Borderlands 2. The looter shooter extreme that will scratch any game hoarders itch."

7305,GOOD

DLCs are amazing and expand not only on story, but offers unique items for you try on in the vast lands of Pandora! Stay safe Vault Hunters!"

Y hay muchas DLC y armas distintas entre si. Una gran variedad."
7323,yes... nothing else to say just yes

11/10"
7325,yes
7326,"good at the beginning later repetitive 
"
7327,This is wayy better than killing yourself
7328,Best of the series IMO.  First person shooter RPG with loads of loot and ability to create different builds
7329,"I had first received this game for my birthday a couple years back, I got frustrated with one of the early game bosses, traded it in. Now starting a new playthrough I can say this is the best looter shooter out there, great story, great original mechanics, overall incredible game, 9.5/10"
7330,Best Game
7331,"I high recommend this game. It is one of the best game I've played. The gameplay is so amazing and the story is top tier. I bought the handsome collection and play countless of hours.

Buying the handsome collection is great but has a lot of content. But there are some problems accessing the end game content. The OP levels, it is part of the end game content but with the new DLC (Fight for Sanctuary) it increases the level cap and OP levels. You can't access/proceed to OP levels without the new DLC. The DLC Fight for Sanctuary is not part of the Handsome Collection you have to buy the dlc separately, so keep that in mind."
7332,"This is for sure in my top 10. After beating the game so many times on various platforms, I can still find enjoyment here. The gameplay makes this game super replayable. All the different characters means endless possible builds for beating the game. I love just putting on loud music and killing everything in site. Plus its always better with a buddy!"
7333,"After spending 150+ hours with tons and tons of fun playing this game in vanilla (with TVHM + no DLCs), I still look forward to replaying it all over again! I'm gonna get the DLCs soon! Highly recommended!"
7334,roland dies.
7335,good
7336,this game gives me dementia dementia dementia dementia

7338,guud
7339,"Literally the best game I have ever played in my life, alongside Dark Souls 3."
7340,.
7341,Great with friends
7342,"I do not have enough hours left in my life to adequately express how much I love and adore this game and all of its content. I originally played this game on the Xbox 360, then the PS4, and finally now on PC. Anyone with a pulse should play this game. It is easily the most fun game I have ever played, and I have played through this game many, many times. What isn't there to love about Borderlands 2. Beautiful graphics that will never look dated, fun story, one of the greatest villains of all time, Handsome Jack, memorably, hilarious characters, and (mostly) amazing DLC, and GUNS. Lots and lots of GUNS! 
The only critique that can be made of this game is that some characters are annoying to some, and that some of the DLC is bad. While this is true, this is hardly a valid complaint in 2022 considering how cheap the game usually is. To some, the humor of Borderlands 2 is too childish. To that, I say bah humbug. If you can't enjoy goofy humor in a ridiculous game set in a ridiculous world, I feel sorry for you. It's just fun, and if you can't lighten up enough to enjoy some potty humor and innuendo, my condolences.
Play Borderlands 2, even if Randy Pitchford is a *Bullymong*."
7343,"The humor is irritating and forced, the enemies are spongey, the quests are tedious, and while there are a million different guns you'll only use a handful of them.

And I can't stop playing it for those very reasons."
7344,This game slaps
7345,"very nice
"
7346,cool
7347,agaboo arpoves
7348,It's just really boring tbh.
7349,"One of the most fun and entertaining FPS RPGs I've ever played. I got this on sale as part of the Handsome Collection and is how I recommend you get this game. You get all but one of the DLCs for Borderlands 2, and Borderlands The Pre-Sequel along with all of it's respective DLCs! I paid $20 for all of it on Steam and then got the Fight For Sanctuary DLC for $5 on Humblebundle.

Getting the DLCs is so worth it! Captain Scarlett DLC is a bit lackluster for a while until you get to the Lighthouse then it finished off with a fun challenge. Campaign of Carnage is hilariously fun. Hammerlock's hunt provides an interesting challenge even though it's a bit dragged out IMHO. Headhunter packs are fun quests that are holiday themed. But, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is,by far, the most fun and challenging. 

This game is fun solo, but is epically fun with four players. In fact, some challenge bosses require a team to complete.

This game has a lot of replay value and I just can't stop playing it. The aesthetic, good voice acting, ridiculous dialogue, chaotic battles, weapons of pure carnage, all the loot (baby, baby!!!!), and fun characters make this an all around solid 8/10 for me.

There are a couple of annoying collision glitches, but they're not common. Sometimes it takes a bit to farm a legendary you want, but is made easier when playing with other players. I tried this with an RX570 and had some issues running the game on max 1080P settings with PhysX disabled, but a GTX 980 runs this game very well at 1080p max settings. Haven't tried running with higher than 60hz monitor or higher resolutions.

$25 grand total is an amazing deal for this game and you'll very likely love it. I've been a big fan of Borderlands since it came out and it will be one of my favorite series of all time. Get it for yourself and convince your friends to play with you.

7363,Yes
7364,"Besides the main story, there are many interesting side missions and hidden stuff. I had a fun online coop play experience with my friends."
7365,pretty good game... Find myself doing all of the side missions which is very unlike me... finding rare loot is pretty addictive.
7366,"Fast-paced single player or co-op game with a lot of replayability. The main game, for a first run-through(yes, first run-through, I'll explain), took about 30 hours of playtime, and I have yet to engorge the hours I play. The game is re-playable, with bonuses for replaying whether you just want to see the story again or become more powerful(the bonuses are the gear you have when you beat it the first time... and it doesn't ruin the difficulty... the enemies get more tough which allows you to practice more strategy building).

The story is great. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for ""Princess Bride,"" but the change of pace to a raunchy, sarcastic, apocalyptic madness of action and adventure, and not to forget to mention a diamond pony."
7367,shoot gun fun with friends :)

7369,"Hello stranger! I wish to share with you my perspective, of one of my lovely games. 6 classes of your characters. All of them a unique. And random loot generator. It can make a mix of fun game. So Borderlands 2 is it. Very intrugue plot, with turning points, and ha! SKILL POINT! Three talants tree of each character. Can you imagine how long it will take to clear everything in game? I love the sense of humor in it. And of course more fun you get when you play with friends. But what can go wrong in it? Well, first of all you need preferably know the lore of game. This will double your fun. ""Stairs? I cant climb stairs!"". The feeling that game is boring might borther you, but trust me, it is not as it looks like. The catch is - hidden treasure loot, to know every point of it, it takes time. Should i mention about rising Goliath (mob, in game, just shoot in his head, wait and you will be rewarded)? TEAM PLAY, fun and endlessly weapon generator. Thats the key of this game. I think personnaly it is the best part of franchise. It is tough enough, require some skill and your mind into game. 

PC version of Borderlands 2 is best. I remember time when there worked a PhysiX. And it was really cool. Now turning in this option will cause a game crash in the beginning. Unfortunately.

And when you play with attention you can have an eye on small details of game. Survival arenas? INSIDE! It can go on, but it is best Diablo+shooter game. Have a nice fun!"
7370,Yes
7371,"One of the most fun RPG games I've ever played, I've run it through multiple times on different roles - still a blast every time."
7372,Grate Fun shooter
7373,Suck My Dick and balls Gabe

7376,nice game
7377,"it good

7378,yes clap me harder claptrap
7379,"i love borderlands 2. Is it a perfect game? no! you're absolutely going to run into weird geometry or some sort of glitch at some point. But man did gearbox hit the nail on the head with this one. It's a perfect sweet spot between bl1 and 3. It's funny, fun to play with or without friends, and has a fantastic story. Truly a gaming staple imo"
7380,The greatest piece of fiction I've ever played
7381,"maybe its violent but its long and extremly insan 
"
7382,gg
7383,good fun game
7384,g
7385,farm for 100000000 hours
7386,"it has 3 flaws, that's it.
-humor can be a little early 2000s
-borky menus, you have to watch what you're doing because they can glitch and cause you to sell the wrong item
-the loot system can be very unforgiving, RNGesus is not often your friend, so you hold onto good gear longer than its usefulness lasts sometimes

other than that, hours upon hours upon hours of fun, even after you finish the main story, there's tons of side quests, some short some long, most of which is fulfilling in some way or another. I haven't played all the dlc yet... and some of my hours are on an old locked out account. like, hundreds of them. so..."

7391,"[b]Positives[/b]

+ Solid core FPS gameplay.
+ Tons of content (especially if you include the DLCs).
+ Lots of classes to pick from (more with the DLC) all with skill trees that work well.
+ The game’s cel-shaded art style looks really good.
+ Works very well in co-op, definitely better with friends (although I largely played solo and still had a lot of fun).
+ Tons of guns with a lot of variety, lots of potential to find a few guns you really like and work for you.
+ Forgiving death mechanics - failure is rarely an actual setback.
+ Loads of interesting areas to explore - the world of Pandora feels fairly alive (bar towns with actual citizens in them!)
+ Lots of enemy variety, the alien creatures are particularly cool (and they add even more across the DLCs, particularly Big Game Hunt).
+ Enemies have a good mix of resistance parts to their body and elemental weaknesses.
+ Lots of fun characters with good voice acting, the original Vault Hunters work really well here and Jack in particular is a great douchebag villain. There are probably a few too many almost-literally-insane characters that can spout pure nonsense, but it is at least consistent with the world so largely blends in.
+ Overall the humour is consistent, easy-going, and works alongside the overall plot that can still manage to feel serious [ish]. The humour won’t be for everyone but I thought it found a good balance (for the most part).
+ Quite a few DLCs and they’re all worth playing and add more of the same goodness (not talking about the cosmetics here).
+ The vehicles are decent (not amazing) but they’re fun enough to cruise around and blast bandits in and never overstay their welcome.
+ The writing is very self-aware and knows when it’s playing on tropes or using pop-culture references and has fun with it.

[b]Negatives[/b]

- There were occasions where I felt like there was simply too much loot and the gameplay came to a halt while I did some number-crunching to try and figure out what to keep and what to sell.
- There are times where voice clips will overlap or cut each other off and you will miss an entire part of someone’s dialogue. Other times you simply can’t hear what’s being said as a voice clip might play mid-combat and you can’t hear them over the explosions.
- There are parts of the game, particularly the last quarter, where you can die relentlessly to seemingly endless explosions / rockets (even if you focus part of your character into being tanky).
- Occasionally unclear where to go due to map layout / markers.
- Very rarely had a use for money because the items sold at the vendors were rarely [if ever] better than what I had.
- Some of the balancing was off - there were sections where the basic enemies took a real beating but then the boss of the area was a complete pushover; I also found with the DLCs that they seemed to have different level caps so one was pretty challenging and another was a total pushover although there wasn’t any indication as to the order I should have tackled them in. Somewhat amusing but it doesn’t help that the tough area was Big Game Hunt with tribesmen with wooden shields eating bullets for breakfast and the easy one was Campaign of Carnage where supposed badasses were dying to slight gusts of wind.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

This game has been sitting in my backlog for years and I never bothered to play it until recently and I can say confidently that I have been missing out on a great game all this time. The core mechanics are really solid and the game has a ton to offer. It’s brimming with content, a crazy load of varied guns, fun classes and characters who are well voiced and a cool world to explore with lots of varied locations. Jack’s a real highlight as well and constantly keeps in touch with you, providing douchey commentary from the comfort of his massive H-shaped ship that constantly hangs in the sky, visible from every map and blocking out a large chunk of the moon behind it (a very memorable set-piece among others).

Borderland 2’s humour is a bit like a gatling gun that’s constantly going and spraying - the jokes keep coming and don’t always land, but they’re pretty consistent and fit with the overall world of Pandora where crazy is the norm.

For me the game started out okay and got stronger as it went on. I also thought the additional DLC areas / campaigns showcased some of the best areas and missions on top of an already competent base game. Overall I had a great time with this game and it’s very easy to recommend."
7392,happy birhday claptrap!
7393,"This is one of the best games taht I ever played, without question or doubt! Even the base game will keep entertained for hundreads of hours, and once you get into the DLC... oh boy, oh boy! I cannot recommed this game enough, wheter this is your first Borderlands experience or otherwise, if you like shooters, roleplaying and LOOT!, you will have a grand time with this certificate of pure Badassness!"
7394,"great game, love the game mechanics, cartoon-ish graphics, and not to mention the kinda bizarre-but-funny comedy"
7395,Tried to play this game three times. Could not tolerate it.

7493,spectacularly fun game
7494,"Good game, the characters are compelling. The gameplay loop is fun, game clearly spawned out of a D&D campaign. Play it once, It's not variant enough to turn into a multi-hundred hour time sink. I'd recommend swiping a clean lvl30 save file for True Vault Hunter Mode somewhere online. Because the game unfortunately ends in the normal playthrough far before you get to see the interesting work of your skill tree. For my build, the Mechromancer, I couldn't find joy in playing the game again just to see my envisioned build fully fleshed out. 

GOTY Necessary? Yes.
DLC's Good? Yes.

Suggestion: Get a save file that allows you to play the game in TVHM on your first playthrough. The game gatekeeps good content from first time playthroughs while also having no replayability.

Buy it on sale, regularly 90% off."

The graphics are pretty good too. The concept of the game is entertaining, including the story line. The boss fights are so engaging and have custom cut scenes. They capture your attention and you are completely focused in it. Overall, I would recommend this game and I think you should try it out."
7505,cool killing stuff always kill things stop hitting me please
7506,"After playing Borderlands 3 and coming back to Borderlands 2, i can say this game have the worst movement mechanics where you get stuck everywhere and jumping feels low gravity and slow, horrible vehicle control as you constantly bounces on stuff and spinning your vehicle out of control or yeets you down a cliff or onto something and you get stuck, Second Wind screens are useless as you 9/10 times cant see anything and you cant aim.

It have so many annoying issues but yet its an instant classic that no other game can beat.
Borderlands 2 still have not lost it´s fun, or its touch of madness some 9 years later.
The sheer amount content will have you annoyed for a long time.

It killed my PlayStation 3, Thanks Randy."
7507,"Super buggy, it badly crashed my computer, nothing similar ever happened to it. It felt like I've downloaded a virused game. I hate that I bought this."
7508,"for an old game, It's really well made and the combat is super fun once you get used to the aim. The humor in this game is hilarious and the enemies' voice lines are pretty funny too. If you can afford the game, get it."
7509,"Borderlands 2 is a good game

BL2 Is an example of a good looter shooter, it knows how to be fun unlike other games of the genre and the game is clever with everything involved in it (jokes are actually really funny too) the game has a good story wtih some of the best dlc i've seen as well. Not really gonna write a long review for this one just go play the game yourself to experience it you don't wanna be someone who misses out"
7510,buy it
7511,"Dont miss understand me, the game is cool and its fun to play, but I expirienced a lot of safe file issues. Often, after a long secion of 2 hours or even longer, the Game doesnt load the old progress (yes, I always ""safe and close"" before exiting). Its just frustrating to go back into the game pumped und then getting punched in the face with ur old safe..

7538,"[h1]My review[/h1]

The game is good but it's kind of average for me. I like Handsome Jack and Clap-trap, they are funny and interesting characters, but in general I thought the story wasn't amazing and the gameplay for me (playing as Zer0 sniper build) was kind of boring. If you don't have any luck with the RNG guns, then you're probably going to have a bad time.

[b][u] The good:[/u][/b]
[list]
	[*] Gun-play, if you get good loot
	[*] Interesting and funny villain
	[*] Funny moments throughout the game
	[*] Somewhat decent story
[/list]

[b][u] The bad:[/u][/b]
[list]
	[*] The game is boring to play solo
	[*] Characters and world could have more time dedicated to developing them
	[*] The story is average in my opinion compared to similar games
	[*] If you don't get interesting legendaries or good guns, then the gun-play is boring. Playing as Zer0 I never got any interesting legendary snipers or pistols through my whole 26hr playthrough.

7539,"bad game, play it"
7540,good game overall
7541,Amazing game
7542,One of my personal favorite games with its great ascetic and a fun story. The characters are both funny but also fleshed out. I defiantly consider it to be an improvement on the original Borderlands. I would defiantly recommend to anyone who likes any kind of RPG or shooter.
7543,"Jack made the game, I would hate this game with a passion if one character simply wasn't as well written as he was."
7544,It's a good game.
7545,"ya, would recommend, love it."
7546,"This game is a classic for a reason! 6 interesting character classes  to customize, in depth storytelling and the amazing loot system by which random parts assemble into random guns, shields and the like. The online component add an additional dimension. Very few games have near-infinite replay value, but this is one of them."
7547,good
7548,what a great game
7549,I wonder what it's like to have a belly button
7550,"This is definitely the best or at least second best game I have ever played in my life, it is so captivating, the areas are great, and the humor this game holds hasn't aged half bad. This is the game that I have played for years, I have more hours in this game than any other. Buy it, just because it was made in 2012 doesn't mean its an outdated shitpost of a game. This game has given me so many memories. You will not regret buying it. Trust me."
7551,Borderlands absolutely smack when playing with the boys
7552,"If you like ridiculousness, crude humour, and first-person rpg shooters, this is the game for you! Now just [insert current amount here]!!!"

7559,Its alright I guess.
7560,good
7561,pog
7562,still one of the best games i have ever played i recommend playing it
7563,connection error
7564,"Absolutely love this game and have been having tons of fun: I have played this game for 245 hours and still havent gotten bored and all the DLCs are amazing and can boost your playtime by a good 100 hours. 
First I think I should talk about the main story and I think it's very nice with some plot twists and some sad things and this game has the best villian in the whole series, it could just be my opinion but I have asked many people I have played with and they think that Handsome Jack is the best villian in video game history! Hats off to Damien Clark for delivering such an amazing performance!
The multiplayer is also very great: I haven't had a single bad experience with the multiplayer and all the people I've met playing this game have been really great people: Even though it is a sequel I think it could stand alone but they do bring back the 4 original vault hunters from Borderlands 1. Finally, I would like to talk about the community and it's great! From what I have seen personally there aren't many toxic people. In conclusion, if you are looking to start the series here or are coming back for nastalgia. I would definitely recommend and it's worth the money and if you can you should get the handsome collection so you get almost all the DLC, happy hunting vault hunters!"
7565,This game slaps
7566,GOOD FOR GRINDING ALL DAY PLAYERS
7567,fun

7569,epic
7570,Lo juegue durante casi 100 horas... hace falta decir que lo recomiendo? Un juego de 2012? Por favor.. faltaba mas..
7571,Still the best looter shooter of all time
7572,"Fuck you, buy BL2"
7573,"HORRIBLE and I mean HORRIBLE game, all the enemies are the biggest hassle to fight, all the bosses are annoying and the game overall just feels like a chore, the willhelm boss requires hours worth of grinding to barley even SCRATCH, the story itself if like a 4/10 the only considerable character is zer0 and even then his ability is not even that good compared to the godlike borderlands 1 which was perfect in almost every way, compared to this game borderlands 2 is just a shitty pile of crap, and I hate the idea you need four friends to get anywhere, probably one of the worst games I've ever played in my life, 2/10"
7574,"butiful game, 10/10"
7575,"Love this game had the mac version before it became defunct. The Guns the characters and the quests are all enjoyable especially with 3 Friends. But it is SOOO COLD SOOO COOOOOLD! 

its a great game"
7576,8/10
7577,best game i played
7578,its just a perfect game in almost every way.
7579,i
7580,"Definetely the best game in the series for me. Feels like every line of dialogue was conceived with the unique point of being stupid, and I feel like that's the whole premise of the game. It is absurd, it knows, and I love it because of that."
7581,"best game on steam, hands down"
7582,One of the best games out there
7583,had this game on ps4. best game i've ever played. this is the original looter shooter that revolutionised everything. 20/20. 6/5 stars.
7584,i spent more time check stat of my gun than shoot the enemy.
7585,"Borderlands 2 is probably the best of the series, and my favourite entry by far.

Having played a lot of the original and 2 on PS3; the looter shooter loop, tight gameplay, art style and humour are absolutely on point. Although my playtime on PC is low, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Borderlands 2 across both platforms and can confirm the PC release is just about as good as it gets.

For fans of wild adventures, exploring vast worlds and shooting everything that moves - Borderlands 2 is a treat!"
7586,"Awesome, buy immediately"
7587,"one of the best fps games ive ever played. 10/10 , i recommend everyone play thru bl2 at least once"
7588,"Very good jumping simulator
"
7589,The game's not 90 Gigs
7590,good game
7591,"Level/stats scale was changed, and in my opinion that change was for the worse. In the first game you could pick up a dope gun and it would continue to be dope for hours before you finally came across something better. In this game, almost as soon as you level up, that dope gun you just got is now meh. Makes the looting part of this looter shooter feel bad.

Also the jokes are cringe."
7592,smooth fps
7593,"To this day, no villain can come close to Handsome Jack."
7594,Please wait...
7595,This never gets old! You might... but since with age comes wisdom and more perverse sense of humor you will only enjoy this more.
7596,good
7597,It has it all.  The humor is fantastic
7598,Best game for FPS!
7599,Played it on my ps3... got it again for multiplayer. it's okay.
7600,salvador funny
7601,good
7602,This game locked up my second monitor
7603,"I would recommend this game if the things I mention get fixed.
I loved this game when I first played on my console. Since getting it on PC the game lags, freezes, and all around doesn't work on window 10. I'm really bummed because I loved playing this game and enjoyed everything it had to offer. But with all the problems its not worth playing it. I wish the company would update the game to fix the problems but I don't think that's going to happen... unfortunately. With BL3 being the new game I feel like BL2 is being pushed to the side and the people who still play BL2 are also getting pushed away. If the lagging, freezes and all the other problems get fixed I will gladly put more hours into it. But as it stands, with windows 10 and a gaming laptop the game is unplayable."
7604,play
7605,love this game
7606,AMAZING GAME!!!
7607,"shoot, shoot and keep on shooting"
7608,"I love the gameplay, the dialogue, voice acting, humour, and co-op mode, but I still hate the ending of the story."
7609,"Story is great, super long if you want to do every side mission you get. Gun's in this game aren't as good as Borderlands 1. Either way I recommend"
7610,nice

7637,"This game is blossoms after your first playthrough. its actually a goldmine of content. play around with your builds and unlock every bit of potential in these characters. the UVHM & OP levels are not unbalanced, you just need to farm better gear. still puts BL3 to shame.

7651,Its an amazing game
7652,nice
7653,"When I was a kid, I'd play outside with my friends and the neighbourhood kids. It started as a real-life Contra game where we all ran around with pretend guns, fighting off enemies all over the place. Eventually, our imaginary guns all gained crazy abilities, and our enemies and boss fights got bigger and grander.

Borderlands 2 feels like I'm playing that sort of thing again."
7654,"the game is very fun and I( hope I can play this game with others 
"
7655,10/10 classic game

7666,"its ok,

7667,Guns
7668,This game sucks. I love it tho lol
7669,"Without a doubt the best borderlands game. ive put a lot of time into this game mostly on xbox and it never gets old, its a timeless game really, you could put 2000 hours into this game and probably not even be half way done with everything this game has to offer..... so yea.... this game is really good!"
7670,"+ One of the few games which run great under mac os (big sur).
+ Great replay value.
+ Very polished experience.
+ Graphics are still not bad even today.

- First run of the campaign is too easy (no difficulty settings)."
7671,amazing :)
7672,"KREIG IS GOD

7673,Nice game to play
7674,Awesome game.  The real fun doesn't begin til 3rd playthrough when you have access to ultimate vault hunter mode.

"
7689,"big sex game, sadly probably the peak of borderlands games tho considering how borderlands 3 is mid af and the new wonderlands isnt a full game (and is also only on epic) but nonetheless this game is lit, almost all dlcs are perfect, even the headhunters are fun and if you want to max out a character it takes at least 70 hours and somehow it isnt boring, also the extra rarities are sick and hope they show up again in wonderlands and future borderlands games."
7690,Zer0 is based
7691,My girlfriend Haley recommended it to me so i got it on a sale and i like it so yeah
7692,"I like explosions, The story is pretty awesome and playing with friends makes it even better. Especially when you can level up together or watch the higher levels smash up everything."
7693,"this game is so fun i play it with my girlfriend, idk if she really loves me but im rich and i live in a mansion drive a big car that goes like really really fast and its red and umm, ummm, uhh idk man shes cool, she has cats ."
7694,good game
7695,i am addicted please help
7696,fun ass game even after all these years
7697,"One of the best FPS games in history, which is a major step up from its predecessor in practically every way. Better weapon variety, an actual story, characters that actually feel good to play... it's got it all. And it's very affordable too! Especially with the sales that drop it way low, and it's very low impact on pretty much any rig today. Just a warning for those with non-Nvidia hardware: Turn Nvidia PhysX to low. It's an FPS killer even on otherwise badass rigs."
7698,"One of my favourite games. Remember playing as a kid, good times. Still Holds up pretty well. Borderlands 3 is good but this is on a different level."
7699,"This game did not age well. The gun play is better found elsewhere, so many shooters have surpassed this. The movement is really basic, there no sliding or vaulting, you lose momentum immediately. Driving is terrible. The co-op experience is actually something i avoid, you could have players running through the entire level and pick up all the loot and ammo before you do. The level-up (no scaling) and difficulty is old-school even for when the game came out, with a lot of the game being either too easy or too difficult especially for learning players. And also, the writing is hit-or-miss.

All that said, this is my comfort game. With its age bring familiarity. With every AAA publisher trying to one-up their competitors with whatever new live-service hotness with a sea of battle-passes, sometimes, i just want to shoot the bad guy, and pick up the loot.

it really helps that this game nails the loot and challenges, so i always feel like i'm making progress even though i've played through it so many times (since Xbox360). Also, Handsome Jack is like the Squidward to my Spongebob, the Tom to my Jerry, the (insert 2 good food that go together) 

...look, the point is: he says the exact same thing every single time and i then i break his stuff. Borderlands 2 never changes and that is perfect. Endlessly replayable/10"
7700,"Repetitive boring shooting of mobs that respawn if you just walk around the corner, hitting flat textures every now and then, again repetitive shooting of mobs and finally the car...Can't imagine how stupid was the guy who developed that vehicle control system..Tried to drive over flat roud 10 times, but each time vehicle hits invisible block and falls down. Where again, i need to drive the whole way, shoot respawned mobs (that i have killed a minute ago) and try to drive that freaking road...just to hit invisible block and fall down...

Cannot recommend this game even on sale."
7701,"Best shooting RPG games. Also, lots of anime dubbing VAs"
7702,Just Awesome
7703,This game is really fun you should try it if your into fighting
7704,"i do the kill, i get the gun, i shoot the jack.


And stare at Tourge's double D man tits for several hours at a time."
7705,hours of fun worth every penny !
7706,"Spent a good 23 hours on this game and forced myself to enjoy it but couldn't seem to do so, I guess this game just isn't for me. Expect yourself to die many times while playing and if you are someone like me who gets easily frustrated, do not play this game."
7707,"Addictive, a friend introduced it so me and I was hooked. Kind of sucked in the beginning, since I didn't understand anything and my weapons were dog shit. But once I got the hang of it? Hooked for hours."
7708,I started playing this game during 2021. And it has a unique taste of art and quality. Give it a shot.
7709,A great shooting / co-op experience especially if you aren't big on shooting games in general this one is fun! Recommend playing with a friend! There is always something new to discover in this game.
7710,Spent a summer to play this
7711,Pretty nice and addictive
7712,"I AM THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

7714,gud gayme
7715,this is one of the greates games i have ever played
7716,yes
7717,"I was having a ton of fun with this game, but it became a slog to play as the issues with the game became more prevalent, with multiple weird bugs, mechanics I didn't enjoy, and the story just not being fun to traverse through. There's not a lot of things that disrupt gameplay for most people, but for me it definitely made my experience bad."
7718,Very cool! I love this game

7751,STAIRS?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7752,its cool i think
7753,Great game with smooth performance and fun missions! Highly replayable too!
7754,"Better than 3, definitely best one made"
7755,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 32 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
7756,I even got a borderlands tatt on my finger. That is how good this game is. Now go play Borderlands 3.
7757,"

7761,"I used to play it on my Xbox 360 with my friend and bought it as soon as i saw it on steam. 10\10 would recommend.
"
7762,"Super fun, I play more on console but Im on here for mods."
7763,Definitely have a friend or two to play with. Possibly the best non MMO looter shooter.
7764,is fun
7765,its addictive
7766,"I remember playing this on my PlayStation 3 a few years back, it was the only game that I ever played on it, so the switch from console to PC was strange, but I got used to it, actually much easier to play on PC imo, plus I forgot how sexy Maya was"
7767,Game Kontol
7768,Best Borderland Game.
7769,I grew up with that game on xbox 360. It's just top tier for me.
7770,borderlands 2 is the best broderlands
7771,i would recommend this game. its fun and something new. Playing with friends will make your game play even better
7772,"The greatest looter shooter ever and is one of my favorite games of all time.

Friends + Guns + Lots and lots of guns = An AMAZING time"
7773,Haven't played much... but the intro song is so good I don't even care.
7774,"cool

7775,"<3 ITS PRETTY GOOD. one of those games you can keep returning to with a few friends after you burn out with the newer games.

10/10"

7784,I LOVE THE GAME
7785,Got this game from my brother and it's been a great experience. Super fun gameplay. I highly recommend
7786,Haha maniacs go AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA but seriously I love this game it’s like new to other shooter games I play it’s random it’s funny it has many different weapons.
7787,mhm cool
7788,hansome jack is handsome
7789,"The basic story set-up and its pacing are perfectly fine - good, even. However I refuse to believe that there is a single person that likes the writing of this game, or any specific character for that matter. Whenever a character opens their mouth it’s always an attempt at humour, no matter what they are saying. Not good or even subtle humour, but just a constant bombardment of poorly-written “lol memes” and “so random xD” stupidity. The entire game is spent trying to build up the main villain as this evil dictator. He instead comes across as what a six year old child believes an evil villain to be.

Despite that, as a first-person RPG looter shooter this game is amazing, even all these years after release. If you can get some friends together for co-op you will have a blast."
7790,"Let's say hypothetically, for the sake of argument, you shot me in the face."
7791,Amazing game. Loved every minute.
7792,"introduced to this by a friend, and its awesome so far"
7793,Good game
7794,Borderlands 2: Electric Boogaloo
7795,...
7796,love it
7797,Greatest game ever!
7798,.
7799,"Yup, its probably the best looter shooter"
7800,BEST GAME EVER
7801,"Like Borderlands 1 but better. I would imagine it's a lot more fun if you play with friends, but still fun solo. There's also a LOT of content/side missions in this game, I think I did maybe half of them and still felt like the game was long for an FPS. Overall, pretty solid!"

7809,"Game is fun but can be infuriating at times, the game is fine but there is some bugs so have to restart somehow, some enemies are overpowered but that dones, final boss is too easy im not even joking, but nevertheless the game is worth buying when its on sale since its super cheap"
7810,"A Legendary Game.

Runs on a single cpu core so expect bad performance."

7841,"The rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack clack blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart toppa
Start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (is it?)
Hot enough black (for ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, boast yo' skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro
O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act
All black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano like ""una duociano"" (singing voice)
My momma told me
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream
We could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream
She only let him stick the head in

Amazing."
7842,yeah man
7843,All the fun!

"
7854,"funnest game ive played on macbook 
if your a mac user w 64 bit buy this game"
7855,Yes!
7856,"This game offers a lot of fun for a very long time with the main story missions and all of the side missions. The game's humor is outstanding, the gameplay itself is like any shooter but taken to an even higher level. The main story is good; there are certain side missions that detail some events leading up to Handsome Jack's success and his character. Overall, some of the most fun I've had in a game like this."
7857,better than 3
7858,One of my favourite games (top 15 probably) bosses are a little grindy and combat may get repetitive after some time. Over all 8/10
7859,Better then 3 so worth all the money!
7860,Guns and explosions.... Torgue approved
7861,"love it so much, one of my favourite games!!"
7862,Fun
7863,"like penis balls
"
7864,".


"
7865,fun
7866,"Borderlands 2 has a great campaign and has the best dialogue out of the entire series. One of my only issues is the fact that after you save and quit you have to respawn at the start of the area you were in, not the exact place you saved and exited. Overall i'd give 8 mutahars out of 10 mutadaddies. Stay sussy my little gamers."
7867,good game
7868,Pooped myself 4 times playing this game so far
7869,good game
7870,pog looter pog shooter pog

7878,yes just simply yeah
7879,"you murder epople and then murder people and then murder more people, is good"
7880,"Excellent shooter, extremely fun online with friends."
7881,"Wonderful game, played it the first time when it released on PS3

I Highly recommend this game! It defined the shoot & loot genre!

It has a fun and interesting story with plenty of characters to love and hate.

Getting all the achievements for this game was fun with only a bit of grinding that wasn't all that bad.

Definitely a great game (and series) for any achievement hunter to get into.

Best out of all 5 games (including telltale's game)!"
7882,"Probably the best looter shooter out there. One problem, I don't like looter shooters. 
The core gameplay is pretty fun, there are some parts that are not as fun though. I am not a fan of any section that you're supposed to use a vehicle in, and the time between fights sometimes feels too long. However, the personality and depth this game has make up for it.
Also, completely unrelated to this review but claptrap is painfully annoying after you spend more than 5 minutes with him."
7883,Good game I like it
7884,BALLS
7885,best game ever
7886,"Great combat, funny(ish) jokes."
7887,it's borderlands... enough said
7888,I havent completed the game fully but the story line is good and i reccomend it but imo its better to play with a friend
7889,snibnoib
7890,I got dieded
7891,"Was it really that hard to make a game that can function? The game has the potential to be good, but if you can't even get past the menu screen because of how unstable this application is, then you have a piece of 12GB garbage on your hard drive. My friend LilRootin tried to get my friend and I, constantly praising this pile, but the game seems mediocre at best. Graphics aren't really impressive for it's time of 2012 (Looks like an original Xbox gen era game), games bosses boil down to big damage sponges with easily learnable patterns of attack (from what I've seen on the PS4), and level design was as repetitive as it was boring. Don't waste your money or even your more valuable time on the pile this game is. I was gifted this game, and I still want the money back for him. Such a shameful waste. 2/10 at best. Fuck off 2K/Gearbox. 



/s"
7892,WHAT IS THIS GAME. SO BAD. SO UNSTABLE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT JUST CRASHES NON STOP IN THE MENU AND IS BUILT FOR 2005 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. thanks
7893,"The fact that they turned a character gay, on a dead game, just to virtue signal, should tell you all you need to know. Go to hell, Borderlands"
7894,"If you like grindy games, this is for you. Even better with friends."
7895,"very fun runs very smoothly worth the price

7897,"gg
"
7898,I've put hours into this game on my PS4 and I loved it. When I found out that all of the Borderlands games were on sale I decided to immediately buy them. I think it is worth it to buy the bundles because of how much fun it is to play the DLCs and use all of the added stuff.
7899,very fun
7900,good and fun play with friends

7965,its nice
7966,"In my personal and honest opinion I believe that out of every game I have played in my life, Borderlands 2 is the best. For me replayability is a huge bonus in any game and let me tell you over the years and through countless consoles I have to of played it 1000 hours minimum and it somehow never got old. There's more content then you will know what to do with, arguably the greatest video-game antagonist of all time, unique classes with with pretty wildly differing abilities and play-styles, a super colorful cast of charming characters, great comedy value. and all the explosions and guns you could ever want."
7967,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Y EAH LES GO BABY
"
7968,"Gameplay sucked if your LVL15 and below. Its because the random guns you received are sh1t. They feel weird and unresponsive even those with tacked-on scopes (ie, scoped shotgun and pistols). Thankfully, the game does play better once you got the blue and purple guns which have better handling and stats. The story improves too."

I would recommend this for older teens cause of the violence and brief language. 

its definitely a 10/10 game"

Best i can tell from forums and hours of trying to fix to any playable standard, gearbox happily destroyed this and the other 2 BL games in favour of pushing BL3. i get it, you make a shiny new thing, get your fans to upgrade, but throwing all the older games out with the bathwater is just childish and infuriating for us, the players.
So to Gearbox, choke on flacid dicks you corporate money grabbers, everyone else, only bother if you can be bothered modding,downgrading, upgrading, praying and otherwise screwing about with the files to get this great game to function"

The art-style was a clear break from ultra-realism in the FPS genre, and heavy use of shaders and lines became an aesthetic declaration that kept on improving edition over edition.

If you've played Warframe or Destiny, think of this as a more story-driven , contained example of these. The name of the game is weapon-hunting, and boy there are lots of them."

8025,"Ahh the game me and my college buddies bonded over. We spent countless hours in its world, the whacky plot, quirky characters and comical dialogue makes this game come to life with a one-of-a-kind experience. Not to mention the unique art form that keeps it relevant even today, the only catch is you need to find 3 good friends to truly cherish what it has to offer. I can't imagine playing it solo, I mean it's meant to be a co-op experience. Happy lootin' Vault Hunters!"
8026,slay
8027,"all categories are good but the only thing that keeping me from giving a 5 star recommendation is when i play online with my friends, either i'm lagging like the shots are delay from me shooting it to the bullets actually coming out of my gun when my friend are the host. and turns the other way if i'm the host. so fix it and DANGG"
8028,Borderlands 2 is a classic I loved every second of the game and have played every character to the max level in the base game. I've played with friends over a period of time and there were plenty of funny moments. 10/10 would recommend  I've recently acquired all the DLC and I will probably be busy with another 40 hours of this game and I have 0 problem with that I've never gotten tired of it

8034,FUN
8035,"I'd love to say this game would be better if it didn't think it was funny, but that's all the personality it has. The gameplay loop is trite and has nothing to support it. It's an action rpg disguised as a shooter and experiences the worst of both worlds. It's cheap (on sale), and you'll know if you like it. But if you're on the edge about it.. I'd probably pass."
8036,great game but the enemies are way too strong especially rpg loader pls nerf </3

Being in long distance, we thought it would be fun to try playing a game together. He was so patient with me and this game was perfect for me! I love the story, I love the side quests, I love the pre-quel, and I love the unique abilities each character has. I love the ability to play co-op with friends. Highly Recommend!"

8065,"Head and shoulders above the rest of the games in the franchise. Thanks to the graphic style it still holds its own visually and the game play is outstanding and a whole lot of fun. Play Co-op and the game gets absolutely bonkers and somehow ever more fun! The RAID bosses are great fun, even if some are just bullet sponges. Handsome Jack is the best game villain ever created."

This a shooter i could get behind i know some people don't like it but we can get away from that. Basically guns go boom and brrrrr, Some light people on fire while others may literally melt them with ACID. the psycho pack includes the most broken and OP character... KRIEG. He is the most broken class in the entire game and i can mess with it, Make a build that should't work but does? KRIEG DOES ALL THAT SHOULD'T BE POSSIBLE. Okay now that krieg section is out of the way... 10/10 would get."

8077,very good. Don't forget to farm for XP
8078,"This game is a very pretty gem, with one twist.

The gameplay is good. The weapon system is good. Character system is good. Fights are exciting. Driving is awesome. Game saving system isn't great (you don't get to save game at a random spot) and cheats seem to be disabled (you can't skip the grind when you are spawned a forever away from where you left off). Now, I perhaps wouldn't complain that much about the grind if I wasn't an aged gamer with full-time job, but I am. The game needs at least one of the two, else the grind isn't reasonable. Hence, a no from me."
8079,Yes.
8080,good
8081,"Even with Borderlands 3 out now, I still find myself drawn back to Borderlands 2. Maybe it's nostalgia or maybe it's just the sign of which is the better game - but I just feel at home in Borderlands 2."

8083,"I really enjoy playing the game; however, I love the characters and humor so much more in it. I will say that some of the guns are cool but do note that you will recycle through them very quickly unlike destiny or warframe. It is really fun to play by yourself but there is also a multiplayer option too that you can play with friends. I'd honestly play this game more for the characters and the jokes then the game itself but that is by no means a knock on the great gameplay; the story and jokes are just that good."

8108,"First of all, Borderlands 2 is, sometimes , a good game. In essence you should play only the main content of borderlands 2 plus tine Tina's dlcs and that only with you are not turned off by grinding and posses a certain degree of patience. Otherwise, this will not be a fun time for you. If you wish to hear some of my thought process keep on reading. 

The story and characters are unique and fun, the gun-play is decent and engaging enough and you have a nice selection of builds you can make with each player character. Having said all that, my main problem with it is that it gets stale after you spend a few dozen hours with it. I shall note here that  I played though normal mode and True vault hunter mode doing all the DLCs after the story in TVHM. Furthermore, i played through the content solo, have not played with friends witch would, most likely, make the experience better in the whole, although that can be said for most games that allow multiplayer.

When you start playing everything is exciting: the characters, the well designed maps, the enemies, the interesting guns and the main villain quickly made me play hours of the game and then came the catch. The game feels and plays like padding was a necessity. I quickly learned to stop exploring the maps on my own because the main-quest and side-quests made you return to the same locals very often and as such if i did explore i would retread the content pretty often which is not ideal. Nevertheless, retread content i did, i would say that at lest 40 percent of the time that you spend with this game is fighting the same enemies that you fought minutes ago on camps that you just explored. Still, the funny and cynical remarks of the npcs at every quest pushed me to do all the ones that found and similarly Handsome Jack and the original vault-hunters made me want to push the main story. 

Credit where credit is due, Handsome jack is one of the best villains in any game and the actor that played him is amazing and the same can be said to all the characters. Thus, the conclusion to the story was very satisfying even if mechanically it was not. In that sense, comes the next problem with borderlands, apart form the constant retreading of content, that is the scaling of enemies and the weapons, a two to three level difference can change the experience from pleasant to down right awful with enemies becoming bullet sponges. Thereby, one might see that loot is everything which is fair for a game that is a looter-shooter but the grind is essential to have a good time and it's profoundly boring to do with the need to save and quit and load back in to get some items that after a few hours of play will be again useless. Therefore, i became proficient at the art of simply running through the levels without fighting as in all likely hood i had already had fought those enemies or would anyway for a quest. To be fair, the former problem  starts to happen by the end of normal mode which will take you some 30 hours to beat, but still it is a problem and as i have made mention of another modes in game i find adequate to speak a little about new game plus and how it relates to the scaling problem and the padding that seems ever so prevalent.

Borderlands 2 operates in sort of difficult modes that are unlocked by betting the game multiples times, the first mode so to speak, has enemies and loot scaling with you till level 30, the next, true vault hunter mode till 50 and makes so that beefier enemies appear, you have another mode and an option to make the game scale even more ten times after that, each stage introducing a cap of enemies level and gear that you fight and acquire. The problem with all that is it plays to the very defects that i pointed out last, the scaling gets exponentially more screwed making you more and more loot dependent having to grind for gear that will now more quickly become obsolete. Hence, you might think that the solution is simply not to play and that would work if not for the game abundant dlcs. You see your character doesn't stop leveling which means that you get more skill points and health making normal mode much easier to each level you past pass 30. By doing the main story and side quests in the normal game you naturally get pretty close to thirty if not over thirty. So if you wish to do the dlcs and have any sort of challenge you will need to go to another mode and be pushed to the other spectrum of the matter. You are fucked either way basically.

Having mentioned the dlc i think it's time to the problem that seals the non recommended to me and that is the staleness of the stories in borderlands. The crux of the matter is the characters are well voiced and no story is truly awful but they get very predictable. When everything is supposed to be funny and cynical, When every character is supposed to be quirky and kind of crazy then nothing is either for you expect it all. At times it seems like that they thought that if they showed that they were self aware of the problems it would attenuate them somehow, which it didn't only leaving an even sourer taste. Likewise, the story beats in every dlcs the villains in them all are not worth the time really, if you do that content you do it for the loot and for some cool fights. What i just said applies to all the new content apart from tine Tina's dlc where the story problems are somewhat dulled. It is quantity over quality with the dlcs. 

After everything that i said about this game i still would say that i had moments of genuine joy while playing it, about thirty hours or so, the other 50 were of apathy or were not one bit fun. Perhaps if you decide to do buy it and follow what i said at the beginning then you will have only a blast, at least i hope so.

P.S.: But seriously Jack was the goat, the true hero of the story"

8114,"This game is just so good. Its story, characters and everything about it is very good. Though it may have some minor issues (mostly bugs and glitches), its a very good game. It starts off easy like most games but gets harder as you go through it, and then you unlock an even harder mode. Though one Issue Im dealing with currently is this popup that started to appear after I bought the DLCs. It reads ""Patch Required"" and something else about needing to update my game to the newest version to be able to run the DLCs that need the newest version to work properly, though it seems as if I already have the game up to date since there are no updates. This keeps poping up and I cant experience any of the DLCs without fixing this. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know."

8121,good game
8122,"its called borderlands but i didnt see any borders, bad game"
8123,I enjoy playing with friends most but besides that this has gotta be my favorite Borderlands game!
8124,"I played this game 3 years ago on my ps4 and honestly the RNG for the Legendary and Epic guns were so much better then. Even with all of its design flaws it was much more rewarding with how many Epic and legendary guns were offered. For example, when you defeat the end boss, it dropped all white guns. First I think it's a fluke but we did the end again it still dropped whites for a FINAL BOSS. Really? 

It's noticeably different between then and now how much less the Legendary/Epic gun RNG is and it makes the looting part of the game not really worth it at all. You don't get cool guns for the amount of side quests you do so what's the point? I liked this game for the rewarding aspect it had and now it's just disappointing. Why fix something that isn't broken?"
8125,Great Game especially if you are new to PC gaming I would highly recommend buying this game to get a feel for KBM. <3
8126,Fun if you start a campaign with friends in a voice call. Would not play alone or join someone else's campaign midway through.
8127,good
8128,"This is a great game in its own right, with many different sceneries, tons of crazy cool weapons, etc. Also you cn mod the hell out of this came with CheatEngine and LUA scripts.  Sick of waiting for a perfect sniper rifle?  How about 20 of them?  The world is your oyster, filled with bad guys that you shoot down constantly."

There is enough to do in the game to make you feel like it never runs out. 
I greatly recommend getting this game no matter what kind of games you are into."

8143,good game
8144,"I have played the game now for a few hours and I can say with 100% confidence that it sucks ass.
Cons.:
1. You run into Alpha walls/Invisible walls 100% of the time even when you can just jump over them couse
there halfway in the Ground it gets annoing fast.
2. It doesn't matter how much Hp and or Shield you have alot of enemys insta/one hit kill you even when you dodge there attack they kill you but if you manage to survive there attacks the game just throws another 20+ enemy at you at the same time just for Fun.
3.Leveling just gets you guns that make more Damage but gives you Enemys equally more Health
4.the Driving dynamics are worst than the Alpha walls.
5.the Guns have more sway thay a Marathon runner after drinking 50 Pallets of redbull, even drinking can only improve it (I had it upgraded to make it ""better"" no change).
6.Just Spawning in a Vehicle is annoing and it gets only worse when you can chose between vehicles
Pros.:
1.the Storry is okay.
2.you Lvl relatively fast (wich gets you nowhere)



When you get the Game for free or as a Gift you can play it. IF not than don't even waste a Penny for it there are Games on Alpha that have less gameplay bug than this game after so many years."

8153,"Very well balanced game, giving the perfect cooperative gameplay. Only con I can say is the annoying unskippable intro :D Oh and the Linux-Mac-Windows crossplay broken recently, hope they fix it any time soon."

Now I get to no life the shit out of this game on PC."
8192,"Borderlands 2 is the best borderlands game IMO. It has the best balance of gameplay, story and humor that makes you come back to it for several dozen hours.

It gave us handsome jack. It gave us Tales from the borderlands. It gave me tons of hours of fun, and it should do thr same for you.

Probably better to grab it in one of those massive bundles with all games and dlc though."

8219,"It is time to say goodbye.
I bought this game 4 times, two times  as a cd, one time as base game on steam and one time as goty edition.
After 10 years of playing this game and thausands of hours i can finnaly move on to the Bl3, i have nothing more to grind here. Today I finally acquired the 94% perfect The Sham for op 10 so i thought that after all these years i can just move on to the next game. I will never forget this masterpiece and im glad that i chose bl1 instead of gta san andreas for christmas when i was 8 years old and since then absolutely loved the franchise. This game was entertaining me through my whole childhood. For anyone who never played bl2 it is a must have to try atleast once. 

Best story dlc's to buy for new players in my opinion are: 
1. tiny tina's assault on dragon keep, this dlc is a must have its much better then the base game basically.
2. Captain scarlet and her pirate's booty, this one has some of the most challenging bosses in game and great gear +some great chest farming glitches.
3. The fight for Sanctuary, its fun to play and adds story to the base game preparing you for bl3 as well as new items.
4. Mr. torgue's campain of carnage, i cant say i enjoyed the story missions, but there are some cool weapons and bosses that are fun to play.
5.  Sir. Hammerlock's big game hunt, at last place this is the wors dlcs to buy for new players bosses in this dlcs are probably the biggest challenge and one of them is almost impossible to do without glitches and the second takes you 2 hours to spawn. There is only a one good piece of gear. Story is horrible in my opinion, gameplay wise its just a shit ton of mob clearing. I cant reccomend this dlc at all for me it was a big skip after i finished the story time and killed both bosses ive never came back to it again.

Other dlcs tier list:
1. Both new characters they are so fun to play as you can make so many crazy builds.
2. Vault hunter upgrade packs, these packs will give additional levels new enemies as well as digistruct peak and special classmodes. they are not needed if you are in it for just a few hours of gameplay it takes a lot of time and practice before you get to level 80 and farm gear every few op levels. It is a great addition if you love the game but totally not needed for this game to be at full potential bcs you will get probably bored of refarming the gear and xp for a lot and i mean a lot of hours.
3. the headhunter packs well there are only two good aditions for experienced players 
  1. Son of Crawmerax this dlc is a must have for any bl1 die hard fan as you will be able to get on the crawmerax again this 
  time without the ledge glitch (all the borderlands fans will know).
  2. mercenary day this pack will give you a lot of classmodes, xp its basically number 1 dlc to farm blue perfect classmodes  
  not bad xp farm and is rlly quick to play through so you want waste any time with repetitive story quests.

Take the other ones as a quick filler maby the water gobbler is a good xp  and red chests farm cant remember now i think that there are better red chest farms in base game.

So i hope that i might have helped you a little if you are new to the franchise and came from bl3 to try this masterpiece.

8268,mhm
8269,Good shit
8270,Best game I have ever played hands down.
8271,"Pros :
- Story-rich Game (Esp. the Jokes and the Skits)
- Great Atmosphere and Environment
- Random Stats of Weapons (which means no sh*tty weapon-upgrade grind)
- Balanced Loot
- So much thing to do (even the story ends)

Cons :
- There's no kind of Enemy Hostility, so once you shoot, all of the enemies around you will have full-force on you. This is kind of barbaric FPS game, i could say (and i'm a stealthy player).
- I played on low-spec Laptop (also using Win7), and I can't play it online or i must waiting for an-eternity of startup loading screen. (I believe i've been played this for 120+ hrs Offline), and regarding of this i couldn't play Multiplayer Online for sure. Kinda Frustrating.

Update 2022/03/18 :
The Devs Fixed the Startup Loading Screen Bugs, Which is very helpful and awesome. Now i could play with full-experience. Moreover, there's so much Redeem Code to get  Costumes & 200+ of Golden Keys (for Free Purple/E-Tech Weapons (scaling with level)).

score from 6/10 to 9/10, Game Mechanism, Story, and the Atmosphere have very big role here. And the devs also awesome."

8277,"I love how the games work, the gameplay mechanics, and the art style make it unique and different from other shooting games. also, don't forget about the character and NPC interacting"
8278,"[h1]Borderlands 2[/h1]

One of my personal favorite games, and specifically shooters. Today it's very clear how Borderlands has influenced many different games, and style of game that we see today like the looter/shooters, but I don't think we talk enough about how great of a game this is. It continues where the first left off, but with more interesting character skills, a longer and more developed story, and great comedy without. 

Additionally, it is one of the best co-op games. There really aren't many shooters that allow you to play through a campaign with four-player co-op. I feel like we get too caught up in multiplayer and competition; games like Borderlands 2 create fantastic memories with friends by combining humor great game play, and compelling characters. Furthermore, I enjoy the option to do multiple playthroughs and receive better weapons, more exp, etc. Even once you're through all that, the DLC offered is generally fantastic.

8362,It has a good story and good mechanics. Would recommend to anyone who like shooter games.
8363,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I like it so much, I've purchased it on three different systems. It probably has the best story (and compelling villain) from any FPS I've ever played. The game plays like a very good mix of shooter and RPG but I don't feel like it focuses very heavily on one over the other. I also have friends who don't usually like FPS games that are huge fans of Borderlands 2. I recommend giving it a try to anyone mature enough to handle the content and gore. The art style can be a little jarring to people who are used to photo-realistic graphics but I like it and I think it gives an interesting aesthetic that pairs well with the actual gameplay."

8369,"Probably my favorite game of all time. Not only is the game written incredibly well, the combat (the guns! and very different characters/supers) is unbelievably diverse and allows for tons of replayability. Not even sure how many times I've gone through this game."
8370,"Must have 
Must play loot n shooter"
8371,"A fantastic game! 

The Story is great, with one of the best villans in any game i have played, ive never played BL1 but the story is presented in a way that you dont need to know what happend before. 

I think the borderlands series has one of the best gamemode/play styles by far. Sure the fact that you need to complete the story 3 times can be a bit annoying but is so rewarding when you can just start going ham for the loot."
8372,This game is infinite. You can play it whatever you like and it's always will be fun.
8373,it is a challenge
8374,YES
8375,"i've bought this game on two consoles and two steam accounts, the easter eggs in this game and the voice acting is top notch. explore the maps, don't just run thru the missions and this game you will love forever."

8381,This game was my introduction to the borderlands series and it has quickly become one of my favorite game series. With its random humor and endless gameplay this game is definitely worth picking up. (Probably with the Handsome Collection) It may be an older game but it is one of the best in the series and it’s graphics still hold the test of time. So yes I recommend this game if your playing it solo or with a group of friends it’s a blast.

8404,Decent game. especially when your playing it with friends and the DLC's are a lot of fun :)
8405,"As one of the first games that introduced me to the FPS style of games, I instantly fell in love. To be honest, I’ve never maxxed out any character (my main Siren is very close though), but it’s something that I’ve replayed over and over again due to how legitimately funny and well written it is. Sure, it has some strange occurrences likely for plot convenience, like any game does, but the lore and story that we follow for the Vault Hunters, is one my favorites of all time.

I never had the chance to play through the first game, but I don’t know if I’d be able to push my bias aside for the next three installments in the franchise to give that one a fair review. So, starting with the first game I had ever played from it, and the one I went in blindly since I was given it, I was overwhelmingly in love with it from minute one. It so easily sucked me into its world and the vast adventure they laid out before us. It was something that I was able to enjoy with so many different groups of friends, or even on my own at times, and always was a talking point when trying to find games in common to play with others. I’ve honestly never heard anything bad about it, other than the art-style, the comic book-like style of cell shading, being the issue that makes it undesirable to some. Despite some of it’s darker themes and borderline jokes, it was never received badly, though I did play it quite a while after it’s initial release, when all the DLC had been released and most bugs fixed. 

As a completionist, it’s style of questing and side objectives was right up my alley. I enjoy having the satisfaction of seeing the progress of all I’ve done in a game, and Borderlands 2 rewards players for such commitment which was something I looked forward to more than anything. Almost treating the looter-shooter more like an MMORPG than anything else.

Overall, the characters, main and side plot-lines, and just the general world-building is impressive and something that has nailed itself to the top 5 games in my library, and likely will remain there for years to come."

Plenty of content, lots of loot that you WANT to grind for, the ability to play the game in coop and or solo and not be penalised for choosing either one (except for raid bosses, unless you choose Salvador the Gunzerker), great humour that the series is know for, and even a story that's pretty good. If you like loot focused games like Destiny or Warframe, play Borderlands 2. If you like first person shooters like COD or Halo, play Borderlands 2. If you don't, play it anyways with some friends. You will have a great time with this game."

8495,"Wonderful writing, acting, editing, sense of humor,,, my favorite game."
8496,A timeless classic
8497,gun go pew pew
8498,"I often find myself debating wether this game deserves it's spot as my nr1 favorite game of all time.
and then i remember and yeah, yeah it does.

-Timeless cell-shading that holds up great from low-high end systems.
-The gunplay is decent and FUN, only because Brdrlnds3 added so much more; do i now have any complaints.
the ""joke"" that they have bazillions of guns is not THAT much of an overstatement. the never-ending search for better loot is a glorious road of bullets, laughter, explosions and loooooooooooooooooooooot
-The story is decent and plenty of funny, but with some serious and sadder notes that will hit you harder then you'd expect.if you have a heart lol
also the main vilain is easily the person i love to hate most in all of fiction. best played vilain i've ever found. and i LOVE far cry :)
-Alone the game is a good way to lose 30-300h a year just having fun, leveling up a new class or trying some new crazy build from 0-max, the game literally has hundreds of hours of gameplay per year that won't get boring all too quickly. 
-with friends it has the potential to become THE game your squad logs in for the evening after work/school. Hell i even met my best friend over borderlands. ENDLESS hours of fun for every man OR woman.
>sidenote: i have convinced several of my female friends to give the game a try and they all fell in love with it, and even more so with Tiny Tina's DLC. 10/10 writing.
-the music is pretty good and i never felt the need to turn it off / replace it with my own tunes.

there are some minor faults and complains, but truely nothing i feel worthy of actually b*tching about.
sure i miss the ""sell all junk"" button from the 3rd game, but *shrug*
sure i miss the weapon alt modes from 3rd but eh
that's my point really, i can't really think of any actual issues i have with this game that don't stem from Quality-Of-Life-Improvements from the 3rd game lol"
8499,according to all known laws of aviation it is impossible for bees to be able to fly
8500,dhsfrtsbhrfisbafbsdfokjpADgdopk[hrkomegjinNJOGRNJOOKMP1290HN1N VAOKP
8501,It's ok.
8502,yes
8503,This game has more replay value than any other game I have ever played. Hands down.
8504,I wanted to love the game but the game is so boring bro it's not my fault.
8505,There's just something about this game that feels like it has an endlessly replayable early game. Loads of fun with friends.
8506,Loot Whoring at it's finest! Thank you!
8507,krieg main here. just wanted to say that YOUR LIVER WILL MAKE A NICE HOOD ORNAMENT
8508,gun
8509,;-;
8510,"I miss my 27k BA ranks from psn, but this is a grind heavy little beast of a game. Good story, good dlc, good gameplay. only issues are the modders... SMH, if you need to mod to beat borderlands, you should go back to fortnite."
8511,yes
8512,good gam
8513,"big good
"
8514,That jack dude is kinda handsome
8515,00
8516,"Lot of fun shootin' n lootin'. Before it was the hip trend with Destiny, The Division, and other crappy looter shooter clones. It's got some humor in it. Some cringe. A villain you will want to punch in the face. I keep coming back to this one after hours of it on the old PS3 back in the day.

Also, the cringe isn't as bad as what it is in BL3, but that's an entirely different story. Just enjoy the good ol games and remember why we could still have nice things from time to time."
8517,Catch a gun!
8518,"Borderlands 2 is definitely the best in the series as far as I'm concerned. At the time of writing this, I have 108 hours in the Steam version of the game, and I didn't even buy it on PC until well after I beat the game and DLC packs with five out of the six characters on the PS3, so it's got hella replayability. You can play this game over and over with new characters to check out the action skills and see how different guns work on them, or you can play it with your favorites and spec into different skill trees to still get a new experience out of it. There's a fuck ton of guns to find and play with, and they spawn with different attachments and aspects so you'll hardly ever get an identical drop, and it's always worth it to check out what you're picking up. Taking even one character from level 1 up to max level and completing all campaign missions and expansions can take well over 50 hours, and that's not even taking into account farming for the best guns or taking on the endgame raid bosses.

No commentary playthrough link: https://youtu.be/ul8GK2J8Kn4"
8519,Amazing game with an amazing storyline also can be kind of addicting would recommend 10/10
8520,"MOST FUNNEST GAME I HAD EVER PLAYED, GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS"
8521,hmm I’m thinking a 4131295
8522,Great game loads of great loot and fun refarmable boss's i feel like they ran out inspiration towards the end with the mini dlc's but it's still a quality game
8523,A F*cking amazing game I love it
8524,"Very fun game. Had played through it before on 360 and just recently finished a second playthrough. Play if looking for a fun looter shooter, can't go wrong with any Borderlands game in my opinion. Seeing damage numbers pop up above heads will never not be satisfying. Immense amounts of weapons with wacky modifiers make this a lighthearted joy to play. It isn't without it's issues; the pacing can feel very off at times, and grinding side quests to get up to level for campaign missions is an absolute slog. And it isn't very well optimized imo. But when the game is at its best and all the moving parts align it feels damn near untouchable."
8525,my dick hurts
8526,love this game
8527,"Good story, funny, and fun gameplay."
8528,"Fantastic! good story and great for multiplayer! however not child friendly, lol"
8529,"Is a solid game, a clear improvement over the first game. Tons of DLC that goes on sale often."
8530,"just not my thing, i don't like questing where you gotta find the hidden thing that's only hidden because you don't know what you can open and you can't, so you spend 20 mins trying to open everything only to find it was the thing you already tried to open it just didn't work.  clunky BS.  not fun just frustrating.  the audio is fantastic though, funny stuff, when you get to that."
8531,"The best Borderlands game in the series, hands down. One of those games that you'll never forget because you had such great times with the people you've played with and the game itself."
8532,Sick
8533,nice
8534,10/10

"
8560,its mf borderlands dawg what do i have to say to get you to buy this masterpiece
8561,this is good game
8562,Catch A GUUUUUNNNNNN!!!
8563,"I think this is the best Borderlands game, aside from some quality of life changes seen in Borderlands 3. The story compared to 3 is much better however. For $20 you can't go wrong, and I am almost compelled to buy the DLC next."
8564,good game ig
8565,"its fun no matter how many times ive beat the game theres a lot of guns, enimies, bosses to take down and a lot of playable charactors."
8566,"Mindless shooting, looting, repeat. Some funny characters. Lots of weapons to choose from. Not too difficult, but sometimes a bit grindy. Overall a fun, simple, shooter looter. The only bug I got annoyed with was invisible ledges. Pretty often you can be running or walking on a flat surface and something just stops you. Turns out it's just an uneven floor that you have to jump over. Really weird to still be in a game that's 9 years old, but whatever."
8567,Played this years ago new on Xbox. Never gets old. Still lots of fun to play today!
8568,"Great for people who don't have a decent PC. The dialog is hilarious and awesome, the revive system is cool and all until there are no enemies. 9,5/10, would recommend!"
8569,"I played for 4 hours and it is a fun game so far, however the next day when i tried to open it the game wont open. After trying for 40 minutes I've given up."
8570,one of the best looter shooters under the borderlands title if you get bored of playing this just throw some mods on it and bam endless fun
8571,"game is goated
"
8572,it very guud
8573,this is my favorite game ever
8574,Incredible replay value
8575,it was awesome
8576,Great for endless hours of fun gunplay and rpg elements.
8577,"NOT THE LEGS, NOT THE BODY, SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD. CMON SHOOT ME."
8578,"It's good for at least 1.5 playthroughs in the long run as long as you stick to the golden dlc choices (tiny tina's and torgue's are good and specifically avoid ""defending santuary"" because it is deceptively titled and will actually destroy the game world as you knew it for what (meh)."

8609,"I have well over 1,000 hours total on every console even the vita and playing it on pc literally makes it an entirely new game with the ability to download mods. I have purchased this game like 7 times and I would buy it 23 more because it is one of those games I can pick up every few months and play it entirely through in a week or so dlv included. This is the most memorable game of my life and I will play it until I die. Buy this bih."

8641,GREAT GAME
8642,Came for the shooter. Stayed for the looter.
8643,grape
8644,"So I've moved kind a backwards. Did not finish first part of the series, then completed 3rd, but cooping in 2nd is the best. Really good dialogues also difficult, cause I've managed to die several times. Love the game and recommend to everyone."
8645,i love mitchell rowell
8646,2 much fun
8647,"If you like shooters and rpgs this is one of my ultimate favorites. characters have unique abilities that were well thought out. play through is fun, and even the villain was written masterfully, I both love and despise Handsome Jack."
8648,"Shame this game runs like hot garbage, because it's one of my favorite games.

Here's what I've run into so far,
-Character getting caught on invisible ledges on the ground that you have to jump over.
-Constant Steam network disconnects that ruin co-op play, happens a couple times a day playing with friends.
-Around 1-2 hours in I'll receive an error message saying the game ran out of memory and it crashes. I googled this issue and it has happened to a lot of people. No way i'm running out of memory on a near 10 year old game.
-A perk on the Mechromancer called Interspersed Outburst crashes the game and is unusable.

I'm running on a new build with a 3080ti, Ryzen 5800x, with 16gb ram and it's been frustrating to play with the constant issues. Don't spend money on this."
8649,"Easily my favorite of the BL games, I've sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into it. All the vault hunters feel super playable, I love the story, the locations are gorgeous, music is great, and honestly I really have to shout out how they managed to make a mostly-melee character work really well in a shooty game (Krieg is great fun to play, probably my second favorite VH after Gaige). I'm pretty sure this is the game in my library with the most hours played, and I'm about to fire it up again because I still have some achievements I haven't gotten yet. 

Still have a couple of raid bosses I haven't managed to down solo if anyone wants to kill the huge freakin' varkid. xD

I'm also PRETTY sure they changed something in the RNG for raid bosses so you might actually get your Terramorphous skins and heads in fewer than the ridiculous number of tries it took me. xD"

8652,The Gub
8653,spins
8654,Fun time
8655,Been playing this masterpiece since a child and still play the game today.
8656,"If I could take the gameplay of BL3 and combine it with the characters and story of BL2, it would literally be a perfect game.  

I'd still take a well written story and interesting characters with great dialogue any day so I'd still pick 2 over 3."
8657,Best game ever
8658,"Before this game I had never played a ""FPRPG"" and it's an interesting experience. There is a LOT of loot to sort through and managing that input (and output) is a big part of the learning curve. There are some rough spots but overall this is a fantastic game that I got for a great deal because it's ""old"" - 9 years old as I write this. Which means everyone has moved on and there isn't a multiplayer experience, but totally worth it. Defeating Jack is pretty satisfying."
8659,i guess its good
8660,bababooey
8661,The best Borderlands....by far.
8662,แซ่บเหมือนตูดเด็ก
8663,One issue is I use a Mac and Public games cannot interface between the Windows OS and the Apple OS so I play solo.   Not as much fun.  Otherwise it is a great game - Loads of fun.
8664,It's both fun and hilarious.  Excellent co-op.
8665,haven't played much but i love it so much already
8666,"very seggsy game, big buff short men and robo daddys"
8667,"Great game, you should definitely check it out."
8668,"I've been a fan of the Borderlands franchise since it debuted in 2009. Up until that point I had never played a ""looter shooter"" before. Everything I remember loving about the original carries over into the sequel - the looting, the shooting, the leveling and the grinding.

The gameplay loop has always been satisfying and rewarding. One of my favorite things about Borderlands 2 is Eridium. It's used for increasing ammo capacity for a weapon type of your choosing or adding inventory space.

I do wish character creation was a bit more robust. I understand this isn't the type of franchise that revolves around seeing your character interact with other characters but I just wish there were more options apart from choosing a body skin and a head skin. Though to be fair I do like the skins that are available.

The four main characters (or six if you have the DLC) have their own unique play-styles. Whether you're into sniping, setting enemies on fire or spawning a couple of rocket-firing turrets Borderlands 2 will make sure you don't get bored.

One of the best parts, if not THE best part of Borderlands 2 is the Badass Rank system. During the game you'll have the opportunity to complete various challenges ranging from landing critical shots to winning a jackpot at a slot machine. As you complete challenges you are rewarded with  Badass Tokens as well as an increase to your Badass Rank. When you rank up you can spend your tokens on increasing your weapon or melee damage, decreasing the delay of your shield recharge, increasing you overall health and so much more. The best part is that both your Badass Rank and everything you spent your tokens on carries over to ALL playthroughs. For example, you can start the game over with a fresh character and automatically have a 5 percent increase to your shield capacity. But, you are given the option to disable Badass Rank if you think it sounds too overpowered.

I really like Borderlands 2 and the franchise in general. For those of you who have never ventured to Pandora I hope my brief review persuaded you to dive in. Enjoy!"
8669,"oldschool classic. Tons of replay value, great characters. Its just good."
8670,BAD. ASS.

8698,"Great game! Unacceptable pay to play content amount! There are far too many DLC's that require payment, not to mention I purchased the complete Borderlands 2 DLC bundle, which is 10 times the price of the base game, in order to have access to all the content and then realised there was still one massive DLC not available to me! I'm sorry but that is just unacceptable and poor business and I will not spend any money on any Borderlands game going forward due to this!"
8699,100% my favorite
8700,"I was pretty late to the party on the Borderlands thing. This game was just a lot of fun to play. Following this one, I went back and played the first and pre-sequel. good times."
8701,It a fun game to play and works better than most triple A games!
8702,"its a fun game i've been playing for years
"
8703,"Borderlands 2 introduced me to the idea of a looter-shooter, and to this day I think this and 3 are  the best looter-shooter games out there. I love how there are different gun brands that look and feel unique compared to each other. For instance you know when you get a maliwan guns have an elemental effect, or that vladof guns have a high rate of fire, or that torgue guns shoot explosives. I also like that the game usually doesn't take itself too seriously, and the cel shaded look to the game not only looks nice but adds to the game's comical tone. I especially love that you don't immediately, but instead are brought to a downed state and can revive yourself by killing an enemy through any means.

However, the one I DONT like in this game is the gun feel, which is a major issue considering that this is a SHOOTER. It feels way too much like another gearbox game, Aliens Colonial Marines. What I mean by this is that even when you are aiming down sights, more often than not, it seems that your bullets don't travel where you're aiming. I don't have this problem with borderlands 3, but I feel that nearly everything else besides the gun feel is better here than in 3.

I've also encountered a glitch that only seems to trigger during Tiny Tina's tea party mission that causes to the game to crash and you lose a bit of progress, and that includes any loot you got before the crash. Luckily I have never had this issue throughout the rest of the game, but my game ALWAYS crashes during that mission and I'm always bummed out about it so be cautious."
8704,"I feel weird with this game. It's like an RPG, but it's not. This is a first person shooter game that is trying to be an RPG game. Not good at all."

8754,"*POTENTIAL STORY LINE SPOILERS*



I highly recommend this game. It is the best one of the lot and I love all of them, well 3 has some issues and so does the Pre-Sequel, but those are more quibbles of my own.

Where to start. I love this game. It's fun. I'm still playing almost 10 years later. I played this on the 360 and thoroughly enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it now. 

The RPG elements are great. I love that you have a limited amount of skill points to put into your skills and you have to choose wisely or pay out the butt to change them (as it should be). 

The characters are all engaging even the psycho you get to use, you come to feel sorry for his plight and 3 really expands on that but I digress. Maya is my favorite, I mean she's a powerhouse and I love using her. I generally use her as a healer/mage type with guns. So fun. I fucking love Handsome Jack. He is well written. He has depth. You almost sympathize with him when you learn his story, well I did and that's good writing. Everyone is a victim of the ""Borderlands"" ethos. 

The female villains (Hammerlock's sister is a class a B) are well written, they're not just a generic woman character who has no real depth other than look it's a wahmen. Aurelia is just a greedy witch who hates everything and everyone, except Troy as we neauseatingly find out in BL3. Anyway, I just love this game.

The amount of versatility with the guns is also cool. It's like Diablo with guns. I mean who doesn't want to be a mage with freaking guns? 

So yes, I highly recommend this game. It's fun. That's all that needs said. It's fun. 

Oh yes, Tiny Tina is a fucking treasure. I love her to pieces. Badonkadonks baby Badonkadonks."
8755,I've played this game many times over the years and I cannot stop coming back to it. It's a great team with great playable and non-playable characters. I recommend playing this game through with each character available.
8756,its good
8757,"Good game, but needs more mobility in the characters like dashing or rolling"
8758,"If you want to start playing Borderlands, start with this one, it's 100% the best game in the series. There is no way you will not enjoy this"
8759,its great
8760,"Yes, I recommend this game. Story, art, gameplay and playing with friends all good."
8761,"A classic that never gets old, love the game!"
8762,"muchas poggeros 
"
8763,yes
8764,"Nice game, I really like it and there's a lot of gameplay and mode that you can do"
8765,"I hope they make borderlands 4 someday! really happy with the 3 borderlands games. Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: the Pre Sequel. Would be awesome!"
8766,"Duh.

I don't even like fantasy or things being over-the-top in general, but this is just fantastic. It only ever gets *irritating* once you hit like, level 45 - 60 if you're still running guns from your 30's. Otherwise its just a great sequel, the end game can be really, really rewarding. Incredibly difficult if soloing some bosses, but even then, after 4 hours of dying and regenerating: finally getting that kill is like finally pushing the baby out, I'm a dude, but that's what comes to mind. I mean, it can take like 4 hours to solo some bosses and it is massively painful to die 2,000 times in that 4 hours while constantly losing resources in droves. What's that? You're pregnant and disagree?! I invite you to a duel madame, fisticuffs and under-breast concealed knives only!

Oh, only that its not as painful...I suppose physically. But let's see you log in with max credits only to be reduced to scrounging for change in a mere one sitting..."
8767,hua
8768,yep
8769,its aiight
8770,so cool...
8771,It is such a good game
8772,"Guns, Guns and more Guns...what's there not to love? BL franchise is worth ever hour and every penny. Great story and Lots and Lots and Lots of death!!!....and Guns..."
8773,very coolk
8774,yes

8776,cum
8777,its great
8778,fun to shoot people with literally anything other then small dwarf man
8779,GREAT
8780,"Great game, just wish it was cross platform."
8781,"Look!  I don't give reviews because I have my own opinion on things I love and appreciate.  But I can't help but say, HANDS DOWN Borderlands is the BEST of the franchise and I highly recommend, For the price it's worth investing.  But don't just get the base game, you have to get the DLC, why?  Because once you get hooked on the characters like my favourite: Tiny Tina, Mt Torque, Clap Trap (even annyoning as he is) And did I mention the BAD GUY, HELL — Handsome Jack is the best of the best when it comes to wanting to put an end to his sinister ways.
Guns GUNS GUNS…. I love the loot drops and to see the orange legendary makes it worth the while.
I am partial to Gaige and her Mechromancer play style.
The story line, the jokes and the underlining dialogue make this game so worth the money hands down.  
My opinion don't matter … But I got to share my thoughts and in the end. I bought this title twice, one for steam and once for my Xbox.  Its worth the price even though it came out so long ago… If your contemplating going to Borderlands 3. I recommend going with BL 2 first.  
Have fun.

Cheers yo!"

8815,"Excellent game especially for less high spec systems. Becomes a little meta focused after 250+ hours but if challenge yourself to make it fun rather then efficient you'll have multipul, very enjoyable play throughts! A lot of content and the voice acting in most mission is geninuenly funny!"
8816,guns
8817,If this game can slide like apex that would be perfect
8818,"I have a confession to make: as of writing, I have yet to finish this game. 70 hours logged and I never completed the main story. I obviously enjoy the game, having logged that many hours and started a handful of playthroughs, but I always find myself getting burnt out on the gameplay at a certain point. I do intend to finish it eventually!

If you're a big fan of looter-shooters then this title is definitive. That said, you better love it, because if not then you may find yourself in my shoes and can never quite finish your serving when scooping yourself a plate of Borderlands 2. 7.5/10."
8819,Not as good as BL1 but still a very good grind.

8831,Boring
8832,"Got into PC gaming a lot later than I wanted to and have little to no experience in FPS games. A good friend recommended this to me because it was his favorite game so I snagged it while it was on sale and jumped in.

After 167 hours and having completed NVHM, TVHM, and UVHM (levels of difficulty from normal to ultimate) with Zer0, I have to say it has secured a place in my library forever. The mechanics are easy to understand and consistent and leveling is rewarding with the skill trees. Farming items requires time and patience, but getting that drop you were after more than makes up for the time spent, especially at higher levels. 

I totally recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge, a casual experience, or a classic edition to their library. Also, the voice lines in this game from enemies (especially the psychos) are absolutely hilarious."
8833,.
8834,worth it
8835,Good Game.
8836,"Don't let my listed hours fool you, I have upwards of ten thousand hours on Xbox 360 (and Xbox One). This is my all-time favorite game.

Between the difficulty modes, gear, characters, other people's characters, and the gargantuan amount of post-release downloadable content available to us in several DLC campaigns with their own side quests, there's a shitload for you to do and you're not going to get bored quickly. The replayability of this game is endless.

It's not without its flaws. No game is, and this game is far from an exception to that practically universal rule. You won't ever hear me say otherwise, not even about my all-time favorite game.
• There are so many more bugs on the Steam version of this game than I ever experienced in my decade of Xbox playtime.
• It's harder to crash from idiots on your team spamming grenades or performance-heavy guns like the DPUH, though. But also I have to immediately take that statement back because jesus christ oh my god this game crashes and freezes like a motherfucker, maybe worse than BL3 sometimes. I'm almost certain it's a memory issue - *for me*. Every single (main) Borderlands game has a memory leak. If your system has really good RAM, you may never notice any issues (if you're hosting the game).
• The balance of this game is absolutely terrible. It was much less so before UVHM existed and we all had many fewer skill points anyway, but to many players, it's still inexcusable and warrants the ever-popular ""Unofficial Community Patch"" (UCP).
• Cheaters. If you save edit your characters or even your profile to an extent, I don't have a problem with you. The problem is people who find ways to bypass the sanity check (or modify their Badass Rank to ludicrous levels) and just utterly rape the game. There are more people doing this than you might think, and it completely ruins the experience for everyone else and kills our community. There are people using strategies to bypass the sanity check(s) on console platforms too, but you'd better believe it's rampant on the (cross-compatible) PC versions of the game.
• Etc.

If you're new to the series, this game's absolutely worth buying on sale for sure in a DLC bundle, even if it's just to play with your friends. If you're a Fallout fan, I can almost guarantee you'll love a lot of things about Borderlands 2."

Although there are minor glitches that I've, personally, come across the biggest being having to watch Marcus's intro cutscene every time I play the game but that isn't game breaking. Another problem is checkpoints. When you die you go back to your last checkpoint but if you leave the game and go back you start at the beginning of the area, all enemy's including bosses are respawned but that isn't a huge problem. And those are my personal problems with this game."

None of that matters though, because even when I'm dying every other second to some bullshit enemy I didn't even see, I'm having fun. I haven't gotten very far, never really completed the game once, nevermind True Vault Hunter, but everytime I play it again I have fun finding new guns and having a different playstyle than I did the last time. Great game, better with a friend, even better with a friend as clueless as you."

8908,This game is an absolute must play. 100% recommend
8909,"Second best thing, what You can do with your girlfriend...
5/5"
8910,"This is the most mediocre I have ever played.
Playing it was a chore and I had to play it in Co-Op to have any resemblance of fun.
Also gearbox.
Fuck gearbox"
8911,"Bro, its borderlands."
8912,Its soooo goood !!!!
8913,pretty cool
8914,makes me want to lick toes
8915,"Borderlands is a first person RPG shooter with funky graphics and a very interesting plot. Fun with friends, or solo. Shooting guns sure is fun :)"
8916,Yeah dis game is pretty fun babey. I like shootin guns and stuff. a lil buggy sometimes but thats okay
8917,It's borderlands 2. 4 player co op.
8918,"Pretty fun, i just need more friends for multiplayer"
8919,"Great game, a lot of fun to play with friends. Would highly recommend"
8920,Game has a decent story. It's fun if you like constantly plundering the next item and seeing what crazy gun you can find. Not really engaging for me personally as the missions are super repetitive and don't ultimately make me feel fulfilled after completing them. Lots of today's gamers love that kind of hollow gameplay though so that's why I still recommend it.
8921,best. game. ever
8922,Great game wish I could play it. You stupid piece of trash.
8923,Better then BL3
8924,joe
8925,borderlands 2 is gearboxes magnum opus. Best shooter of it's generation. 7.8/10 to much water

8929,this game is really good the controls are good to
8930,"I don't understand the hype people have for this game, I had a pretty mediocre time.
Between the natural jank that arises from RNG and loot it ends up requiring a guide for how to play and its sense of humor is something that slowly wears at you like sandstone and wind.
I ended up just... not playing it after a few days. I've never felt like playing it again, and I regret buying this."
8931,I have a huge hand
8932,Fun.
8933,One of the greatest games of all time. Cemented the looter shooter genre and propelled the category further than other prior games.

8954,"Great game. Very quirky characters, and the villain has the right mixture of charisma, humor, and straight up sociopathic tendencies to make for an interesting game. The different characters you can play as give you different abilities, so you can keep it fresh. I personally started out as Zero, and have switched to Axton."

8989,Great story one of the best if not the best story I've ever played in a game and you can play for hours with mods and dlcs. great game 9.5/10
8990,If you're looking for a game where you can grind for hours and still have a ton of sh*t to do then this is the game you're looking for!
8991,"Wake the fuсk up Vault Hunter , we have a verminous to evolve."
8992,Best game I've ever played hands down.
8993,One of the best games ever
8994,longest midget joke in history
8995,"Absolutely amazing game, but it's programming didn't age well, semi-frequent crashes and also the game runs on 32-bit so it's likely to not run anywhere near as good as it used to. Ashamed that Gearbox also re-released the Tiny Tina DLC as a standalone and didn't even upgrade it to 64-bit. I love Borderlands but a lack of effort like this is a total shame."
8996,this game is really fun but i would be better if friends played with you
8997,10 out of 10 for everything. My favorite game

Breakdown: If you've got 5-10 bucks AND you have enough patience to run a small country this is the game for you! I say this amazing game is a 7. The game world, attention to detail, variety and when they actually put in effort for difficulty this game really shone. What tanked this game for me is awful pacing, fake difficulty (Badass just means they have more health and sometimes do more damage), clear loss of creativity after like chapter 8 and the awful AI pathing ( especially aerial Ai). Don't get me wrong it's a great game it will just get boring when your bossess/mini bosess degrade into constructors and one of the final bosess had so much health it took me nearly an hour to get it down (maybe they thought difficulty should mostly be about patience) ONE OF THE FINAL BOSSES IS JUST A RESKINNED CONSTUCTOR OH THE PAIN. or maybe my knowledge of game design has broken my enjoyment for titles almost forever, well cheerio"
9000,"as always a joy

just the chaos that it brings"
9001,"Borderlands 2 is over 9 years old but still good.

[b]What i like:[/b]
Graphics looks nice(at least with Ultra HD Texture Pack[its free]), you can tell its not new game but still holds up very well.
Runs good and dont have many big bugs(didnt encounter any crash so far, few times needed to reload to continue quest).
Gameplay is solid, weapons feels as they should.
Game is semi open world, bigger areas have vehicles you can drive and also shoot.
Characters are good, antagonist Handsome Jack is great.
Golden Keys(SHIFT codes), can get great gear and they still release codes to this day.
CO-OP and active players.
Have many playable characters with different skills and is meant to play multiple times so if you like this game you have tens or hundereds hours of enjoyment.
DLCs are good and worth to buy(with collection not separetly).
Have many Challenges you can complete to get little bonuses(kill x enemies y times, get x kills with certain gun etc), it feels you always working towards something.

[b]What i dislike:[/b]
Difficulty/levels can be messed up if you dont play as intended, you can overlevel so all enemies are way too easy or (second/third replay) can be difficult.
You dont collect ammo, eridium and money automatically[you collect if they are in ground] if you open chest(looting is part of game but still if you play long enough its not fun but chore).
You cant buy all ammo/grenades fast with one button.
Vechicles steer with mouse, you get used to it but still it would be nice if have option to use  keyboard A/D.
If you dont have friends who start same time and want play CO-OP its may be difficult to find other players with similiar level(most players now have really high levels)

[b]Which version to buy?[/b]
Game is heavily discounted every sale so wait for it.
Not worth to buy base game(GOTY version sale price is only few $/€ more and Handsome Collection is also with reasonable price). 
I recommend Handsome Collection(BL2 GOTY+some minor DLC+higher level cap+Borderlands Pre-Sequel+DLCs) or if you tight on money GOTY.

[u][b]NB! Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary DLC is not in GOTY or Handsome Collection and you need to buy it separetly! Its good but im not sure its worth full price and its not often discounted. Buy it later if you played BL2 and liked it.[/b][/u]

[b]Tips to play first time:[/b]
First finish main story then play DLCs.
No point to grind xp or loot, missions give enough and weapons are obselete fast you find better ones soon. 
Use Golden Chest if you need better gear.
If you just want to play once its not important but if you want replay harder modes later watch your level, dont overlevel much. 


[b]Achievements(if you care :P):[/b]
Not bad for such big and replay minded game, but takes some time.
You can play solo, only 2 achievements need to play with somebody but it only take few minutes to complete and its not too hard to find somebody who can help you.
Some bosses are meant to play with CO-OP partners so if you play alone you need to grind levels/gear.
One achievement is really bad, you need to kill enemy(Jimmy Jenkins) who spawn VERY rarely, certain mission can help very much to get him so if you want 100%, look some guide before playing! 
You need to buy Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary DLC to get 100%"

Graphics still hold up to this day. I wish I played this back in 2012 but better late than never. Btw if it crashes set NShitia's CrapX to ""Low"" (PhysX) and it will run fine."

"
9037,its good
9038,"Still worth playing 9 years after release, and will continue to be a worthy shooter for many years to come."
9039,"Borderlands 2, even after so many years has held up incredibly well. The story is good, the leveling system is rather stellar and the characters are all still great. The game is still beautiful as ever. 

The game does have issues though. Assault rifles are basically useless, the higher levels after true vault hunter mode are ironically one of the worst leveling systems there with how they require slag and make most other legendaries pretty useless(only one upped by borderlands 3s mayhem levels) and it shows it's age with how slow moving feels, the shooting is incredibly eh and there isn't much to improve your speed without having pretty much a whole build around it. 

The movement complaints are only really because I've played BL3 and other modern games with faster movement so they can be mostly disregarded. Also the Hammerlock DLC sucks. also the multiplayer is kinda odd and mostly works. 

Otherwise it's still an amazing game and holds up, a lot of the issues with it are mostly solved with not going above a certain level and just learning where some legendaries are and who drops them. Also on modern machines the game loads incredibly quickly, making farming so much easier. Just buy the Handsome Collection on sale and give the game a try!

Also shout out Joltzdude139, if you want info on the game he makes great videos and his playthroughs have a lot of useful information."

9056,"Borderlands 2 is a museum of memes from the early 2010's and is unquestionably a better game than the original Borderlands.
With loads of improvements, customization's and new elemental weapons. Humorous silly jokes with an amazing story line. If you haven't played this game ever, you've been missing out.

Quick side note*
Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep (DLC) was absolutely amazing, felt the love the developers had for this game."
9057,"Online play no longer works anymore and countless fixes required to get working properly. The games been left to rot, so I won't be buying anything new these guys make...

Firstly if you try to create new online game - it becomes stuck in a look forever. This has been a problem apparently since 2013 and the game was released in 2012 and it's now 2021 lol

The game force closes.

This is an old game, but not THAT old...

My pc is unimaginably overpowered for this game.

Forums plague the internet buy the 1000s of people with similar problems getting this game to run now days, but still there are issues going back long ago which were never resolved.

For example try checking file integrity and you get the error 1 file needs to be reclaimed, and you accept to reclaim it, and it does not reclaim, meaning 1 of the files in this game is corrupted.

You cannot start an online session because it trys to create and then endlessly gets stuck in a loop of trying to create for infinity.

9077,"This game is great! I'd recommend you look at other reviews and some good YouTubers to make up your mind about getting this game! 
BUT
Fight for Sanctuary isn't
Spent more on that dumb fuck DLC (not to mention it was FREE for a little while) than the handsome collection, oh and you basically need that DLC to play this game to its fullest.
Alas, the bad review"
9078,"The game's good but some of the shit that can happen really bites... take for example the whole of Fight for Sanctuary. Also if you are coming into the game expecting Jack to be one of the best villains of all time then you are sorely mistaken. While my initial rating may be misleading as I do think this is a true masterpiece, I should warn you that many things you hear about it are ill informed."

9135,Used to play this day and night in middle school on my xbox 360. I probably have more than 300 hours on it. The guns and gun play are very unique which is the reason I love this game so much.
9136,"Nice game, respect"
9137,fuck
9138,One of the best borderlands easy controls/characters to learn and amazing dlc
9139,It is really fun that i keep coming back to play it. Even after playing the other games in the series.
9140,Best game ever made!
9141,good game
9142,its fun with friends
9143,Best Borderlands in the series.
9144,Already got the best gun in the game. fun time

9149,Legendary game
9150,"Love it ....

End of story .....

sign - Rain"
9151,"Let me simplify what this game is about. 

STORY: 
So the story goes.... 
a kind robot saved you from a freezing snow place. Instead of leaving you there to die and rest in piece, he invites you to his camp. 
He talks some shit and beeing annoying at the same time, but you don mind. He is friendly. Soo...  to make the story more dramatic, his eye got snapped, and you are offered a gun to attack.  He gives you an a powerful looking rifle and an SMG gun to protect him!
Plot twist, he gives you air-soft guns,
and then the suffering begins.
After fighting and struggling killing the monsters, he give you the reward for saving him.  Wau! It's a shootgun.., such a shame. It's a nerf.
You soon regret. Dying in snow would be a better idea.


Gameplay:
As a mentioned, you get airsoft guns, like it's some kind of joke.  PS. the game is a joke itself, so it make sense. And don't worry, the game stays pain in the ass, and keep offering you different flavours of airsoft. With slightly different recoil, fire rate and ammo capacity. Nerfs are quite common too! 
So you invited a friend around to kill them all with these airsofts. Sounds better idea to finish enemies faster isn't it? Don't worry, while you and yout friend struggle to get intro the server, the game fight back.
So you finally menage to create a team together, since a previous friend of yours allready gived up on it. 
After some time you both join a game. 
Yeah don't worry, it's not going to be that easy. The enemies has also recently started visiting  the Gym, so they are stronger now.
Poor you, called for a teammate help. Now he is about to suffer too. 
But you didn't cared by that time.
You were ignorant, thinking that enemies could not have entered the gym anyway.

Afterall, getting mentally prepared and grinding the game for few hours, it started to get quite playiable. But far away from enjoyable. So you decided to stay around.

9181,great
9182,"Wonderful game, extremely enjoyable to play. Sadly the devs no longer care about updates and fixing game breaking bugs. Online Multiplayer is now a thing of the past as the game crashes on spawn, including when another player joins your session. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WISH TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS."

Yeah, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the ""Who's baddest,"" but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, when you're

Feelin' like you're feelin' now
And doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

Every time I close my eyes
I think, I think 'bout you inside
And your mother, givin' up on askin' why
Why you lie, and you cheat, and you try to make a fool outta she...

Now, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the ""Who's baddest,"" but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero

Remember we are just mercenaries( Vault Hunters) seeking glory (Vault's) and Handsome Jack is the best villian of all the universe...

9260,great 100% worth the money
9261,grinding for a weapon with the best scope 10 hours is the best
9262,Good game
9263,"That's a game for many many hours. I guarantee you loads of fun! And remember, better with friends!"
9264,I'm just doing this for the badge
9265,"I bought this on my Playstaion years ago, have well over 1,000 hours on it, bought it on PC to play it for another 1,000 hours. Love this game, EASILY one of my favorites. Shame that you cant transfer data over though, but it doesn't really matter, trophies are fun to earn. Highly suggest waiting for a sale to get the Handsome Collection simply because for like 15$ you get this and the Pre-sequel with all of the DLC. I adore this game, I love 2K, but wait for a sale so you can get everything without paying too much. Borderlands and Bioshock are easily my all time favorites and they're both 2K. Honestly, just grab whatever they have their name on, it's probably worth it, in my opinion anyway."
9266,Its alot of fun
9267,"Great game, its a shame that the follow up game a.k.a 'Borderlands 3' wasn't as good as I imagined. Also the constant need to buy a game to level up is very annoying. Other than that there is nothing wrong with it, the plot is good the game play is great. Recommend playing this game especially with friends."
9268,"Fun game with great humor, a worthy successor to the first installment. I really liked the music, just like in the first one."
9269,"Great game, don't play with 'Cones_r_us' known cheater and bug abuser."
9270,eh its alright just carried the hell out of my childhood -_('_')_-
9271,"great game, great content. it's a timeless game and always enjoyable. good with friends or solo"
9272,epic
9273,A good game. Lots of fun for friends and solo play. :D
9274,This the best borderlands has ever been. 3 was a let down when it came to story and stability.
9275,"the game is epic, there is nothing else."
9276,"The banter is great,... 2K's greedy shitty decision to not let owners reset character story and difficulty down on TVH or Ulitimate just sucks so I wont be buying anymore 2k shit. FUCK you greedy pigs. toodles!"

9288,Good game. better with the bl2fix mod.
9289,Probably the best looter shooter ever.
9290,amomgus
9291,"My favorite genres are RPG, then FPS... and this is the perfect game that mixes both. Highly recommend it!"
9292,Fun RPG with good repeatable play
9293,"Get 3 of your friends and play through the whole game together, a great experience, while borderlands 3 is more seamless for that kind of playthrough, this one is still a gold standard social spot and top tier game."
9294,very nice
9295,This always entertains and makes me laugh.
9296,FUN GAME WOULD PLAY AGAIN
9297,is it me or depending on who was responsible for dlcs the characters jump between compelling to completely insane and annoying?
9298,"Give me a legendary you tossers.

8/10 would use the Bane again"
9299,The best looter shooter game I have ever played.
9300,my favourite game
9301,"Handsome Jack. Loot of bajillion guns. Awesome story. Amazing DLCs. Handsome Jack (again). 

Now, go play."
9302,Nostalgiagoodlands 2.
9303,guns go brrrrrr
9304,Shoot enemy. Pickup gun. Shoot enemy with new gun. Need I say more?
9305,"This game aged about as well as JNCO jeans, carpeted bathrooms, or rage comics. I remember it being good at the time, but looking at it now I can't force myself to sit through it for more than about 20 minutes. However the immense, pervasive jank combined with the lackluster gameplay and cringeworthy writing makes this game perfect to test performance tweaks for proton, as it has plenty of room for improvement and it's essentially impossible to get distracted playing the game. It's also a great game to play if you're procrastinating something you have to do. Every time after I put in my first playthrough ages ago, I've suddenly realized I have something else that I need to do when I try to start playing.

If you want something brainless with a good selection of guns and attachments to play with your friends go get payday 2 or something. This failed abortion is a good mark of the beginning of the sharp downturn of quality in popular games, it's not worth your money, and it really wasn't worth it when it was popular either."
9306,"amazing game, was playable on a school laptop and has such a good story, only complaint is that the enemies get buffed way too much. but otherwise this is a 5/5 no scam no sham would buy again."
9307,"Great game, even after playing the third, I still like to come back to replay the older games. Still a classic."
9308,"Great game, played all the games for hours"
9309,still good. expected nostalgia to be the only reason I'd play but it is still better than most looter shooters that have come out since.
9310,super nostalgic and one of my favorite games of all time
9311,.
9312,
9313,Better than 1 and the pre-sequel. Not as good as 3.
9314,Love It!!!
9315,
9316,amazing game that holds up perfectly to this day.
9317,: )
9318,One of my favorite games of all time both as a Loot Shooter and in general. Still a fun play for being a 9 year old game.
9319,the 94 sham grind is giong to give me an illness
9320,its fun to shoot midgets
9321,I personally think this is the best borderlands game in the series. Handsome Jack is one of the best antagonists

9347,"Good shooting gallery, characters are funny and memorable, but lots of bugs and it may be repetitive to others."
9348,One of the best looter shooters out there. 10/10
9349,Get it
9350,The Borderlands series is one of the best that has ever graced this universe
9351,great game
9352,"SHOOT ME IN THE FACE! IN THE FAAAAAAAACE! DO IT! SHOOT ME IN THE FACE! FACEFACEFACEFACEFACE! NOW! BULLETS IN THE FACE! WANT 'EM! NEED 'EM! GIMMEGIMMEGIMME!

over all 10/10 game very good"
9357,10/10
9358,"Best game i have ever played. The story is great and can get very humorous. The only downside for me is i have a really bad computer (intel core i3) and cant really run the game well so i have to sacrifise the great graphics of the game and change some of the files around so it would be suitable for my computer, so i cant experiance the great cel shading and lighting. anyway definitely recommend this game to anyone!"
9359,"Why don't you own this game? BUY IT, ESPECIALLY FROM THE HANDSOME COLLECTION"
9360,@
9361,"A Timeless Classic That We All Grew Up With

Everything about this game from the wide cast of characters to the expansive gameworld, dialogue, playable characters, build variety, and weapons is an absolute 10/10. I've probably beaten this game like 10+ times across multiple platforms and every time is just as enjoyable as the last. The game is also the best co-op looter shooter RPG on the market NO CONTEST. Your characters acknowledge each other and iteract with the world and NPCs individually and finding a legendary weapon almost always leads to an argument on who gets to keep it. The cherry on top is the minecraft easter egg. DO yourself a favor and buy the game."
9362,This game good
9363,offensive to my mexican heritage
9364,
9365,this good game
9366,Best Borderlands.
9367,"great game, and love the series
"
9368,"Is good game, much shoot, many die"
9369,"One of the better story-based shooters available.  Quirky, well-written, addictive, and good co-op play.  Some folks have trouble with the way the art is done, though I believe the harshness has been softened, over the years.  Each of the DLCs have a different theme and feel, while maintaining the humor and playstyle of the base game.  BL1 is also very good and the remastered version is as replayable as the 2nd game.  I often replay this game rather than the more current BL3 product, which I've just never really meshed with."
9370,this game is awsome i would totally recomed this
9371,"Do not play solo.
This game was 10x more fun back in 2012-2013 when it released, being that it was way more fun with friends to play.
Nearly 8 years later, I came back to play one of my favorite all time games once more. That's when I saw the problem.
Now this game is absolutely AMAZING, and will forever be one of the best franchises on the market. 
The only problem is the lack of fun it has when playing solo. This game was a complete bore to play solo, and I didn't find that extreme case of fun I had when I was little.
In this case, this game is a 8/10 for me, but for the fact that I feel you must play with friends to have fun on this game, I have to give it a negative review."
9372,fun game. very yes.
9373,"The difficulty feels unfair. I like difficult games but not this. Good difficulty means that it's skill based and I'm just not good enough. This difficulty is because I didn't do any side quests and I am underleveled, except I don't want to do the side quests cause they are incredibly boring and repetitive and I want to get this game over with as fast as possible. I uninstalled on the 3rd to last mission. Maybe I'll come back to the game someday but that's not going to be any day soon."
9374,"Much like the first game, Borderlands 2 is a chaotic ride of guns and blood and mutant psychos trying to cut your face off and wear it. What's not to love?"
9375,DaBaby
9376,Very fun. Lots to do.
9377,"idk why but something about this game is really frustrating to me and i just cannot enjoy it, its not getting mad, i almost punched a hole through my moniter playing hotline miami and i adore that game, just something about the gunplay and movement feels incredibly clunky and frustrating to me"

Asides that, this game gets all my love for the story, characters and mayhem that you can cause."

9402,"Amazing game. You will be lost in a fantacy world for hours and never get board.

9410,"In order to fully appreciate all this game has to offer, a lot of playtime is required, but luckily the gameplay is fun enough and the character interactions are well scripted and always fun to hear again. Considering the game lets you do multiple playthroughs, they have accurate scaling and good balance to make sure you are not too overpowered or underpowered. But they left in a bunch of exploits such as item duping and xp farms which are just enough to help you get through tough parts but dont ruin the overall experience of the game. 10/10 would recomend to anyone"

9412,not a good game

9479,Very gud
9480,"So, you want to hear another story, huh? One where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad - I'm telling you anyway. First, there was the Vault, an alien prison opened with a mystical key. To the warriors who opened it, the Vault was just a container of tentacles and disappointment. They vanished into the wastelands, certain that the Vault held no treasure at all. They were wrong. The Vault's opening triggered the growth of Eridium, a priceless alien element. Soon, the rare and valuable mineral emerged all across Pandora. Its appearance attracted many. Including... the Hyperion corporation. They came to Pandora to mine Eridium, and bring order to the savage planet. Through their excavations, Hyperion uncovered evidence of an even greater Vault. Their leader vowed to find it - to use its power to civilize the Borderlands once and for all. But Hyperion weren't the only ones searching for the next Vault's alien power. The call of danger and loot is not so easily resisted. Certain warriors came to Pandora in droves to uncover its hidden secrets. Some would call them adventurers. Others call them fools. But I... call them Vault Hunters. Our story begins with them and with a man named Handsome Jack..."

9493,"The game goes on discount all the time, just buy the handsome collection when the price is right and play one playthrough. While I don't guarantee you'll like it as much as I do, I think most people will appreciate the top notch story, unique weapons and characters, and the fun of making a build work."
9494,Quite good.
9495,.
9496,"One of the big design pain points for FPS games is how to present visual information.  Human eyes, and most predator eyes in mammals, are designed primarily for edge detection.  They watch for changes in contrast and color to define edges around objects then look for changes in the edges to detect movement, with that movement possibly being your next meal.  When the ocular cortex is presented with a complex scene like say a jungle, grasslands, or other environment, the eyes are constantly scanning for movement.  In nature you can take things at your own pace, watch the same scene for a while to get used to it, but in a game, the pace is set by the developers.  Therein lies the problem with this game.

The biggest issue with Borderlands is they spam your eyes with so much visual CRAP that you cannot tell where enemies are at.  There's bloom, smoke, lensflares, crap falling on your goggles, background noise.  Because nothing in this game has detail including the background and base assets, they felt the need to put black edges around everything as a visual que to your eyes.  I've got a $4k gaming rig in 2021 and a 10 year old game plays worse than Crisis with everything max'd and looks like crap.  Seriously?  This is an accomplishment.

A lot of the issue here is the misapplication of a psychovisual technique called false focus.  Normally the iris changes dilation to focus the eye on a specific target or object at a distance until it comes into focus, but when you can't get full detail on an object or focus, the visual cortex tries to compensate.  It takes ~3 seconds for everything that spawns in to have full textures.  Pop open a container?  You have a bunch of pale cubes that take seconds to get full textures so you know what you are looking at.  Got an enemy shooting at you?  You're going to be staring at their fire for a few seconds figuring out where they are at because they are a blob cube behind another blob cube and the textures haven't spawned in yet.  This constantly engages the visual cortex to focus.  To implement the leveling system, everything has been intentionally slowed down with this technique.  Adding IFF indicators would be a big help but would also reveal just how repetitive the gameplay is, which consists of walking into the middle of monster spawns, play a RPG with FPS Elements, shoot a bunch of stuff, loot crates, occasionally level up, do side quests and the main quest, and occasionally meet a funny character.  It's like the Diablo of FPS games and the feature set of the game just reads like they kept going with a broken set of game mechanics and made them work.  E.G. You die often in this game in the middle of monster spawns, so they added a mechanic where if your player dies, you have 10 seconds to kill something to stay alive.  Why is this needed?  It's the capstone of a lot of bad development decisions.  The gameplay is more repetitive than Serious Sam.

Lots of entertainment companies make movies with the same psychovisual techniques and sometimes they fail epically.  Shakeycam is another common technique and when overdone like in the movie Elysium, it just makes the movie unwatchable.  This game is the same way for me.  After playing it for 30 minutes, I am nauseated and have a headache and feel awful for hours after.  The idea with these techniques is to disturb emotional regulation a bit and up visual stimulation to retain player engagement, but for me, it just doesn't work.  I've tried adjusting the graphical settings to no avail.  Many other games got this right; Doom, Doom Eternal, Crysis, Deus ex, heck even Duke Nukem Forever.  If you are looking for another game that got this so wrong, look at Rage 2.  The first Rage was excellent, second, not so much.

A last final poke at this game.  I've got to wait 15 seconds on startup to watch the borderlands logo jigger around on screen while it connects to some server for online play?  Novel, but if I'm here for the first person experience, why should I care?  You did away with mandatory loading screen videos and replace them with that garbage.

Not everyone is going to be wired the way I'm wired, and If you are a teenager or college student with poor parental supervision looking for a cheap game to pick up and play while pounding back doritos and mountain dew on the weekends on a budget PC, and don't mind a game that's all about grinding useless crap with no real sense of progression, this game might be for you.  The one compliment I can give it is, it's got an engaging, well-written story-line with memorable characters.  If they tweaked and fixed the gameplay to not be so repetitive and added some depth it'd be a great game.  For literally everyone else, stay far away.

9497,"I've bought Borderlands 2 many times over the years, I specifically remember the first time I played it was when an old friend of mine was visiting the area we grew up in for the first time in a long while (this was back in like 2012 - 2013), he picked up Borderlands 2 for Xbox 360 to take back home, but first all our friends played it that day on Xbox, I enjoyed the game so much I knew I was eventually going to buy it myself.

Ever since then I've always struggled with actually completing the game, it's not that the game is specifically hard or anything, what I mean is that I've literally bought the game maybe 3 - 4 times now, on Xbox 360 twice (or maybe once), Xbox One and now Steam, and I’ve always had trouble with the game retaining my attention, I've owned Borderlands 2 multiple times from 2013 to 2017 and yet, I only managed to complete it in 2017, my point is anyways that I felt like this game had a really repetitive nature to it that I usually enjoy, I just didn't for some reason with this game? 

My most fond memories with this game however are playing with friends, that's my solution to this problem, if you have a friend or group of 4 willing to actually complete the game, it's 100% worth it, however; if you're not into that grindy and kind of repetitive, guns blazing loot n' shooter type thing, I can't recommend it."
9498,"yes and no. amazing game, amazing story, amazing character and fun grind. but this is a poor port. in some very large, vast, packed areas can really dip in frames no matter your setup. i’ve tried rx 500 series cards with the 2700x and 5600x and had frame rate issues in thousand cuts. i also tried the 3050ti and gtx 1060 and had the same issues. other than that, good game. pick it up :)"

If you're going to get this game, get EVERYTHING, but you will enjoy it immensely. It's just a shame the 3rd playthrough mode is virtually unplayable as a solo. But I immensely enjoyed all the content leading up to it. Do recommend."

If you end up enjoying this, i would also recommend trying Borderlands 3 as well. Another fun game with some decent end game fun."

9594,bornalamps 2 the better one
9595,bestest
9596,"My all time favorite game. I used to play it on ps3 and had more then 200 hours put into it before even getting it on my pc. Plenty of fun, great story and fun characters. highly recommend."
9597,Gud gam
9598,Best game of the borderlands'
9599,best game ever
9600,funny mexican guy commits suicide after he lost his candy
9601,"The overall feel of the game hasn't aged well imo, it doesn't feel fun to play"
9602,one of my all time favorite games by far amazing story and game play
9603,Fun
9604,i found it a bit boring having to repeat so many sections having to return so far to the save points.
9605,"crap....



this is a damn good game...."
9606,Good story with a bit of humour as well as some challenging gameplay. I haven't attempted multiplayer
9607,walter
9608,poggers game
9609,very :pog: and occasionally :kekw:
9610,Great game spend 100+ hours in it and it is amazing
9611,Can end corona and cure cancer. Hood game!
9612,lots and lots and lots of fun
9613,"Amazing game but since i dont have the time (or the sanity) for the bl2 i dont play it but i do like how they made assault on dragon keep a different thing now so i dont have to go through hours of work to play the thing plus idk why people are complaining about it when you can get it for free on epic game
"
9614,"Super fun multiplayer
"
9615,One of my all time fav games! Can be a bit repetitive once you get to a super high level. Every few years I come back and play it through again.
9616,"Easily one of my favorite games of all time. If you haven't played this game, what are you doing with your life?"
9617,fun looter shooter with good graphics
9618,"a classic, play it with friends!"
9619,Would recommend. Make sure you start the very last mission at the beginning. Don't join a random lobby so you can have the satisfaction of doing it entirely. Other than that its really solid.
9620,it is good game you should aquire it because it is a good game and a good game is usulaly good
9621,"Borderlands 2 was an impeccable game that did so many things right. At the time it was one of the first grind and loot based games, but it featured an incredibly hilarious and motivating storyline, phenomenal gun play, great character RPG elements and a high amount of replay value."
9622,free roaming world with lots of loot
9623,its all down hill from here'
9624,Based Chad Game
9625,i hate this game
9626,i like handsome jack :)
9627,my favourite first person shooter game! would recommend.
9628,i do not own this shit ass
9629,"Only have a couple of hours on steam, but I have well over 2,000 hours on this game back when I played on console. This is the pinnacle of a solo looter shooter that's even better with friends. I can still remember the countless summer hours I spent farming for a 94% sham or a perfect DPUH, and I look back at those memories fondly. All of the characters were so well written and so unique. Not only the friendly faces in the game, but the villains in the game were some of the best characters that I've seen. Borderlands 1 always had fun gameplay but the story and character development felt kinda, bland. This game delivers on both gameplay and story. With DLC, there are 6 playable characters all with so many different builds that can suit anyone's playstyle. Even without any DLC, this game would still be a top tier game, the 4 core playable characters were very unique that it made every new run seem like a completely different game. But, the DLC just kept delivering on everything that was good about the base game. 2 new playable characters that were both insanely fun and crazy. 4 Main DLC that all deserve praise, and even the headhunter packs, allowing us to farm even more things. I could honestly talk about the game forever, but if you're someone who loves to kill enemies over and over in hopes of getting that insanely low chance drop, you won't be disappointed. Borderlands 3 though... well that's a different topic."
9630,"Linux:
Native is completely broken & out of date
Works mostly fine with Proton (standard or GE, your call), just beware Proton saves *are not* cloud synced, so back them up if you plan to delete the prefix
I had a few crashes & couldn't watch the final video of the Commander Lilith DLC, other than that all good.

This is, put simply, one of the best games ever made. If you haven't already bought it, wait for one of the regular sales & buy the whole lot."
9631,AMAZING GAME! FAVORITE GAME EVER ACTUALLY <3!!!
9632,IT'S one of the best games i've ever played.
9633,it's alright
9634,
9635,Poo Poo and Pee Pee
9636,"Fun
"
9637,"The game keeps on ""NOT RESPONDING"" for some reason. Because of that i didn't play much but whatever I played was boring at least for me."
9638,It is pretty good I like it.
9639,2 inches
9640,Waiting for the Marcus: Become Human DLC
9641,It's the best looter shooter! The best way to describe the game is that it's really fun to play. You can burn hours before you know it. I highly recommend to anyone that likes FPS's and having fun.
9642,"Highly recommend playing the first game. A lot of the references will be misunderstood without it. 

Overall fun free roam game with linear quest lines. 

Pick up the GOTY edition for all the free DLC. Once you have dlc unlocked the free roam opens up based on your player level."
9643,"All around very good game
10/10 would be Claptrap's minion again"
9644,cul gam
9645,"i have purchased this game 4 times  on different platforms, already a sign that the game is good. i have enjoyed much playtime on the borderlands series. great looter shooter with so much content."
9646,fun game for a dad looking for a single player shooter to relax to on the downtime

9651,brrrr
9652,bueno
9653,"SICK
"
9654,"The borderlands games are special. I have stopped playing this game on steam since I have such a perfect record of hours, but I have easily put in thousands of hours on steam/console/gog, and if youve ever thought about getting it, spend the extra 20 dollars and you get basically 3 games in one."
9655,"A mate got about 40 keys to special loot chest off the internet after that smooth sailing
10/10 would brake the game again..."
9656,Good game
9657,"Where is Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep?

C´mon man"
9658,its k
9659,"I've purchased this game at least 8 times. If this is your first time playing through, don't look at any guides or youtube videos. Just play the game and don't look back."
9660,its alright
9661,"Used to play this on my Xbox 360 its better on pc though.
"
9662,me and my sister played this game and didn't bother leveling up so we just died a crap ton of times trying to beat a few bosses and areas. 10/10 must play with friends.
9663,The only good Looter Shooter
9664,I recommend this video game.

9670,"Don't worry, it's a goooooooood touch"
9671,"stop wasting your time with reviews, just play the f*ckin game already."
9672,fun

9677,fun shooty shooty bang bang
9678,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
9679,"If you like MMORPG games with some chaos and MADNESS you should play this game. 
P.S I don't have much to say besides that. :C"
9680,yes
9681,One of the best games ever.
9682,great fun game yes
9683,Can't exit game window or the games glitches and i need to close it with task manager but I have played this game several times on a Nintendo Switch on game of the year edition so i think i can write a review.
9684,BEST GAME EVER
9685,gud gam
9686,Bussin.
9687,"cool
"
9688,i amm soooo fuckingg stupidd man i ne eda neww choppa
9689,"you already know how good this is. wait until its on sale, then do yourself a favour and buy it."
9690,PUNCH HIM SO HARD HE EXPLODES
9691,this game rocks i missed playing it on the xbox 360 so happy i have it back
9692,Easily a classic if you enjoy multiplayer coop
9693,everything is cool
9694,It is good
9695,BORDERline awful graphics.
9696,"why Borderlands 2 is so good
reason 1 claptrap
reason 2 claptrap
reason 3 claptrap
reason 4 claptrap
reason 5  claptrap
reason 6  claptrap
if you liked my review for Borderlands 2 
you are cool"
9697,Lots of fun with a good sense of humor along with the action.
9698,"This is absolutely one of my favorite games of all time. No amount of praise can quite capture the amount this game means to me. I have hundreds of hours playing this game with my dad on an old junky xbox 360. Even still, 1000+ hours in, I still laugh at the jokes, still have fun farming the same weapons, still come up with new character builds every so often. If you like looter shooters or even FPS in general, you will love this game. It also holds up to the test of time surprisingly well politically. I'm not claiming it's flawless, but there is so much more representation than was commonplace when this came out and I really do love it for that. If your only experience with the Borderlands series has been 3, I would pick this up to feel the real Borderlands experience cause 3 sure as hell ain't it. Every dlc is worth easily twice as much as is charged. I cannot recommend this game enough."
9699,"yuh
"
9700,very fun game
9701,"The more you progress, the more expensive it becomes to live."
9702,I ENJOY IT BETTER THEN 3
9703,It literally has one of the best villains in gaming history: Handsome Jack. This game solidified his position at the top of the villain tree.
9704,Quite the poggers game definitely withstood the test of time
9705,very good game imo
9706,"buggy a bit in co op , other is fine"
9707,b
9708,...
9709,"Great game if you enjoy crude humor and ""Funny Robots."""
9710,"Total escapism but with a hint of problem solving when trying to take down bosses single-handed - definitely encourages 'inventive' tactics (like running away...).
Great FUN!"
9711,good game
9712,10/10
9713,good game
9714,"This game is amazing probably in my opinion the best game ever. It has great combat that is super fun especially with friends and the abilities and skill trees as well as the thousands of guns add on to that fun. The story is also amazing, funny but also serious when it needs to be. To add on to the quality of the story is probably the best villain in any video game, Handsome Jack, his back story, his character development and the fact that he is a realistic villain that actually believes what he is doing is right, adds to the perfection that is handsome jacks character."
9715,It's a game about shooting and the shooting feels really boring.
9716,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
9717,"The game is solid. Classics.

I might update it after I've finished the DLCs. But the main story is just like in Pre-Sequel - sort of boring. The characters and jokes are good. But there's really nothing to catch an eye in the story itself. Especially closer to the final. So, I wouldn't score it. Just an okay playable experience like anything you might expect from Borderlands gameplay. I dunno, if any of the DLCs will come close to Claptrap DLC of Pre-Sequel, but the very first one about crazy pirate chick is so far so good."
9718,I like shiny things so this game is perfect for me.
9719,tmdmn
9720,dope

9722,"An Assault rifle that shoot electric bullet, and also a grenade when you reload it.

absolute madman"
9723,fun
9724,Yes
9725,game
9726,Just casually one of the best games ever
9727,"Borderlands is the only first person shooter/rpg that I have experience playing. I have heard it's not everybody's cup of tea for either of those styles of video games; but it worked on me. I find it like i am playing a video game version of a ridiculous 80s action film with its's tongue bursting out through it's cheek. The humor is dumb boy humor and the action is very unrealistic; but, again, it's immensely playable. The learning curve I faced the longest (and frankly still struggle with) is decision fatigue. It can take a bit to become familiar with and get used to choosing between the random weapon stats."
9728,"game good
"
9729,MUUUUURRRRRRDER
9730,If u havent played this game wtf are u doing? just buy it while its on a sale well worth the time and money
9731,Best of the borderlands

9814,Good game but you shouldn't play alone 'cause this game is repeats itself. Enjoyable just playing with friends.
9815,"Alright, so I think this is an alright game, however, it has some drawbacks. 1. It's just not my game. I was having a hard time thoroughly enjoying the game and I constantly died. 2. The Game was tweaking. My screen was turned into a square and it messed with my monitor settings so that was pretty shitty. 3. The game just seemed boring to me, I don't know what else I can say it was just, not fun for me."
9816,"I bought this game with some dlc for about £6 and ive had so much fun. Sadly i havent had any friends to play with but even solo this game is hard but still enjoyable. to beat some of the bosses you have to revive yourself a hell of alot but its not dark souls difficulty, just a challenging game. Artwork is beautifull and i plan on playing this game alot more"
9817,I enjoy playing this game with my friends.
9818,its dope
9819,It gud
9820,Fun
9821,
9822,dude this game fucks
9823,"This is still the best Borderlands.

[url=http://elinchan.blogspot.com/2020/05/dealing-with-backlog-borderlands-2.html]Full review here.[/url]"
9824,"So much lagging, very annoying with the lagging"
9825,Awesome pve game. Lots of content and storyline. It gets old quick when you continuously played the game.
9826,"Best FPS game I've ever played! After a total of 67 hours of gameplay and about a week into buying the game, I've finished the base game's main story line and all its side quests! It's so addicting, I just could not stop playing. It's a game that's fun both with friends and without. Already planning to get the DLC's!

I'm so in love with the comic aesthetic and just the overall GUI and game system. You don't have to be be monster aimlabs or master battle planners to be good or fully enjoy this game. There were also fun, simple puzzles in some side quests that was refreshing to see. So, really, this game feels like its explored a lot of genres--from fps to puzzle solving to rpg to open world to even partial dress-up--without feeling like it's all too much. it's just a jam-packed with fun!

Even after playing, you  can play it again and again to try out new choices in story, or new classes to challenge yourself. 100000000/10!"
9827,"""I'm a little teapot, bloody and cut. Here is my handle and here is my butt."""

9834,Yes
9835,"Funny, gunny, explodey"
9836,the best one
9837,"The best entry on the series, Had play it on almost every platform and I have learn it like it was the first level of Mario Bros, unapologetic and brilliant!"

9842, best borderlands game
9843,This game is still fun to play with friends. recommend
9844,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
9845,good soup
9846,gun
9847,"Borderlands 2 was my first Borderlands game, I have no idea if it's the best one officially, but I know it's the best one in my book. Other than Mordecai, who has the dumbest line in the whole game, the characters are brilliant and the DLC for the most part does a great job of expanding on them even further. 

The story and CO-OP are the reason to play this game, no worries about being better than your friends, just cause chaos in harmony together. The wealth of guns lets you be ""okay where you are"" because you're going to keep discovering place after place where you get new guns that do new, weird things. The game play is amplified by the silly, weird voice commentary and quips that pop up throughout. 

If Mad max was a comedy, it would be Borderlands."
9848,"Borderlands is the best (loot, fps, action, RPG, open world) game out there. This game has a lot of mayhem that make's it epic and amazing. It has a great campaign and co op system. I highly recommend this game for people who like a lot of action and mayhem. If any one picks the game up, let me know and join me for the MAYHEM!!!"
9849,The borderlands experience has always been a good one!
9850,best gami evar i playd so nice vray racomanda
9851,"I am not in love with Borderlands, but it's absolutely an enjoyable experience. The comedy is pretty hit or miss and a little dated, but the art style is great, the guns and abilities are fun, and the core gameplay loop is satisfying. There's a little more driving around in unexciting vehicles than I'd like, but you can't go wrong with this if you have friends to play with."
9852,"Non stop, insane, wacky, crazy fun. Is it the best FPS? I have no fecking clue. I play Battlefield once every 5 years. But I will tell you that this game, this I'll play over and over and over again. It's insanity in it's finest form. The shading graphics are a little iffy for some, I had issues adjusting. But you know, you can totes deal if you focus on how hilarious and wild this whole game is. 11/10 (I'm bad at math) will play over and over till I DIE."
9853,Honestly my favorite game of all time.
9854,Very good game !
9855,amazing game played it like 3 times fully like on my old xbox my favriote game ever. i reccomend this to any1 with a sense of humour
9856,Hard game. Would recommend playing multiplayer!! =)
9857,yes
9858,solid classic
9859,Nathan
9860,"Its a bit hard to get used to, artwork wise, but it really is a great game."
9861,set a timer while playing this game or you'll find yourself not having showered or eaten or done anything other than play for 3 days straight.
9862,"The better Borderlands 3

but 3's gameplay is really good"
9863,ya
9864,if u havent u sleep
9865,"pretty good but not fortnite, but i do like it like fortnite so pretty epic, i also have the gub so its pretty cool like ninja says very epic."
9866,"Borderlands 2, what can i say the story is amazing its Funny as hell, Full of action, It has sadness, but most importantly HANDSOME JACK BITCHES. No seriously tho Handsome Jack is hands down the best character in the game hes a comedic psychopath that has childish behavior and his violin performance after [REDACTED] died was comedic as hell. Anyways stories great, the action is amazing, tons of guns, tons of side quests, and whole lot more to do because of the vast DLC. Great base game, but The DLC's make it even better i recommend buying the G.O.T.Y pack when its on sale it has almost all of the extra content you need as well as Gaige and Krieg which are really fun classes(not the best but really fun), and thats about it i give it 11/10"
9867,Gang Shit play it pussy
9868,It's BL2. Play the damn thing.
9869,"YES, enough said"
9870,A great co-op game for you and a few buddies to play. lots of re-playability. Worth the money
9871,one of my favorite games ever
9872,yes
9873,"The writing aged like my Grandfather and the gun play aged like a fine-wine. Until you play the third instalment. The game improves on the original in basically every way, making it a straight upgrade. However, there are a lot of new gun rarities that essentially bring nothing to the table because the unkempt Harold exists. I get that certain Seraphim weapons are better under certain circumstances, but gun balancing was not done well at all. For the most part, there was no reason to grind raid bosses because random tubby enemies and the three horns divide provided everything you needed (this is an exaggeration). That's my only real gripe with the game."
9874,"you'll get lost in playing this game for hours
"

9880,fun game very funny
9881,anarchy
9882,Great game that holds up so many years after release!
9883,"One of my most favorite games. Very fun. Collecting guns, shooting, and leveling up abilities is great. Fun to play with friends. Some of the humor can be pretty cringe but there's some actually funny characters."
9884,[old coot gibberish]
9885,handsome jack is handsome
9886,"Yeah, it's pretty fun, especially w friends.
But why is valve not updating this game anymore? Smh..."
9887,"I don't even know how I got to play this game, but I enjoyed only the first 5-10 hours of it. The rest is basically a grindy mess, just like all looter shooters are and you never get to keep the weapons you like. Yes. The variety is massive, but sadly the quality and uniqueness of the weapons is not. The gameplay is mostly fun but both the story, the characters and the homour could be summarized in one word - cringe. The only saviour is Jack, because he do be kinda cool sometimes. The massive number of dlcs is also, well, unnecessary. Most of the things could have been added in updates, but you have to remember that this is 2K we are talking about, so no actually it makes complete sense 2K is an atrocious company. I would recommend it for looter shooter fans, but sadly for normal fps fans, such as myself, it's more of a hard sell."
9888,yeah
9889,"Totally recommended. But you should definitely buy the Handsome Collection than the standard Borderlands 2, trust me."
9890,The single player in this game is boring. I was told the co-op would be fun. Wrong. Playing with friends you have to be the same level otherwise the game is really unbalanced. There is no easy way of maintaining and matching levels with friends. The looting element is completely ruined by this because the guns you get will be too low level for one of you and un-equipable for the other. The cars in this game don't handle like any real vehicle would (at least in this universe) and sitting as a passenger is a good way to throw up irl. I thought I should just walk instead. Mistake. The game is basically walking simulator at that point. I would not recommend anyone play this game in 2021.

9902,Game of loot.
9903,"Its fun. great replay. played it YEARS ago, re-downloaded it and played it again. Also low key Gunzerker is GOD TIER"
9904,"Great game, played it first on the playstation and than on PC. Fun to play and very rewarding. Each class has it's uniquenesses which change the gameplay and make it worth replaying again with someone else just to catch the nuances it has for every character."
9905,You can punch robots in the face. 10/10
9906,nice

9919,funny did laugh
9920,Fun loot shooter with tons of personality. I would recommend playing with friends as well.

9950,"I played it for a little bit, its alright i guess."
9951,
9952,"Borderlands 2 is simply such an amazing game,

9984,like the dark sould of fps games. iif you dont have friends your in for a long ride
9985,Nice
9986,"Run and gun, and blow up shit.
The game can be super boring if you're playing it in single-player though, this isn't the type of game I can enjoy by myself.
The side quests also tend to get grindy, boring and repetitive after a while 

However, all of this can change if the game is played in multi-player.
There is a genuine sense of achievement when finding good weaponry and helping out your mates from a hoard of raiders.
I recommend this game if you want to play it with friends, its fun"
9987,"Pretty fun, get it if you want a fun and reliable time waster."
9988,"Very fun, it has a big map and a lot of achievements which is fun to earn."

10000,I think I'm in love
10001,This game is amazing. The story is written beautifully. The characters they are amazing! This game is everything packed in a small box that explodes into the joys of borderlands 2. I recommend that you buy the handsome collection to get the best experience. In bl2 you get to play as a cast of characters that are shown to you at the start of the game with a quick introduction at the start of the game where you get to know their personalities. Before you even begin you know which character to play as! The guns are quite fun to use and the controls are just prefect. The jokes are just amazing and are perfectly placed. All characters have a likeable personality where you feel as if you are actually connected deeply with them. Except from a few side missions all side missions are amazing and add to the story. Overall bl2 is a game that one must experience
10002,still the best loter shooter out there
10003,trash game. trash scaling. never again.
10004,"I dont like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh - Flo Rida"

10019,"Borderlands 1: Check it out! 👍

Borderlands 2: Play it to death! 🤘 

Borderlands Pre-Sequal: Check it out if you like the Moon 🌛 or australians! 😬 

Borderlands 3: Skip it! 👎"
10020,"one of the best games i've played with much replay-ability, you'll get your money worth here with DLC's that are quite good to further push its limits, playing with friends is very fun as the loot gets more and the fights get more intense (up to 4 players a server) and the game-play is challenging yet fun, i haven't had a single problem with this game at all and its good clean fun all the way with a decent sense of humour along the way that will surely put a smile on your face.... now get out there BUTT STALLION and go kill some SKAG-LICKS! xD (game rating is a clean 9.5 out of 10) LOVE IT"

10045,"Shoot bad guys, tip Moxxi, Die, Repeat"
10046,I wouldn't go so far as to say its a classic but it is pretty damn good if you like shooters and dumb humor.
10047,"Extremely overrated, don't buy even for under five pounds."
10048,baka baka baka mc-kun go for this game i bet you  wont regret buying this game and i will do  you one even better go for the handsome collection you will get two borderlands game and all dlc expect lilth dlc and you could always play co-op and if you don't have any friends you can play with then me and you can play co-op ( only want loyal friends who will play whole game with me i'm currently on wildlife preservation mission and yeah I'm a boy so don't get your hopes high but we could still play co-op cause i want a good homie
10049,Let me ride on your meat bicycle!
10050,Great game
10051,"This is my favorite game of all time. Loot, story, humor I love it. End Game everything... I have at least 500+ hours in this game but not on steam I just bought it here also. Borderlands 1 is also good, but for the love of God/Satan don't play Borderlands 3 they ruined the story and the characters."
10052,great game much fun
10053,game has provided me many hours of fun filled challenge. Very highly recommended!!
10054,still a good game

10068,Just discount that damn lilith dlc
10069,"Piece of a s**t console garbage designed to piss off players at every corner and at every opportunity. Completely unplayable without swearing.
- console controls and settings;
- broken launcher that doesn't apply any options you change in the settings menu;
- bullcrap of a story and unlikable characters;
- s**tshow of a main characters to play as;
- loud, stupid, infuriating and unkillable little tin can that accompanies you EVERYWHERE;
- tons of text info on your HUD that tears your attention to pieces with useless data;
- DLCs that cost as much as the game itself;
- minuscule action (combat) time compared to braindead running around from point A to point B.
In short: if you liked BL1 you would like BL2, otherwise - don't waste your money.
Requesting a refund."

10094,"I remember seeing advertisements for this game when I was in middle school and begging my parents to get it for me for Christmas. Almost 10 years later, I still come back to this game. From the fantastically satisfying combat to the hilarious tongue-in-cheek storytelling that still manages to hit hard with its rare emotional moments to the fantastic loot mechanics, I have yet to find a game that balances every aspect as well as this one. Absolute masterpiece."

"
10114,"The game itself is very good, the storyline is interesting and the characters are cool and fun. However the Steam PC version of this game will crash multiple times and attempting to play multiplayer is a chore and a half as the game freezes, crashes, disconnects from 2k servers and so on. If you don't care about this then you should purchase and play this if you haven't already."
10115,i fucking love this game play it then play it agian I FUCKING LOVE ITTT FUCK YEAH!!!
10116,good game funny characters nice rpg mechanics a lot of guns not disappointed
10117,"Not only does the dopamine keep coming through the excellent gameplay loop, it also features one of the greatest video game villains of all time in form of Handsome Jack. You can play this game for dozens of hours, the various classes and different skilltrees offer a variety of costumization. If you love FPS, RPG and good stories, you HAVE to play this game."
10118,"fun game
"
10119,"it's borderlands.

play this with your friends instead of dnd, because it's best if you play with your friends on a regular schedule - otherwise you'll just drop it one day.

not really worth it to play by yourself, though I will say there's enough dialogue and content that could keep a dedicated single player entertained all the way through, but even then the fact is that it'd be better with a group of friends.

I will say that an interesting thing about the co-op in this game is that it kinda expects some people to be less cooperative than others. That is to say, if conflict arises from two people wanting the same thing or something similar, there's a system built in where players can make bets on duels between them as well as trade, so honestly I think this would be an excellent trust-building game because it makes conflict-resolution so easy. Similar to Portal 2 in that sense, I think."
10120,"Pretty good game, runs out of video memory it says a lot but otherwise it's fun"
10121,good game follow path
10122,its fun
10123,it's borderlands 2 enough said. I've sunk serious hours into this game and have bought it at least 5 times across separate platforms spanning countless runs and characters it simply doesn't get old.

10136,"Timeless graphics, great mechanics, hilarious and engaging story"
10137,"Content and gameplay wise, this game is, at the very least, good.

The problem lies with the bugs, and the criminal mismanagement this game has received from the publisher.

- Just starting from a fresh Steam install, the game simply crashes on startup.

- Through experimentation, I discovered that the crash can be avoided by running Steam in offline mode. However, then everything seems to work fine, until after you quit the game and start it again, only to discover that all progress is GONE. The game fails to save any progress or settings.

- Many other reports of all kinds of crashes across all platforms.

- Multiplayer: The game was originally released with first-class Mac and Linux ports (on Steam), but these ports were abandoned and are no longer updated. Therefore, for a Mac or Linux user to play with a Windows user, the Windows user must manually downgrade their game by downloading an unofficial archive and overwriting game files.

- Multiplayer: In a recent (2020-ish) update, the multiplayer implementation was ripped out and replaced with something called ""SHIFT"", whose purpose is to enable cross-play with consoles. This caused numerous issues for PC users who wished to play with PC users.

- Multiplayer: We could not get Steam matchmaking to work at all. Invitations are sent and received, but connecting never succeeds.

- Multiplayer: LAN only works reliably if your PC has a single network interface (card). For LAN play, the game uses ancient UDP broadcast methods, and mistakenly binds the broadcast socket to a ""whatever"" network interface, causing players on the same LAN to not be able to see each other.

The frustration from trying to get this game to work outweighs anything good I can say about the gameplay itself.

10149,Disabled mac and windows crossplay. Crashed 3 times on first install. No go from me.
10150,"Borderlands 2 is a pretty solid game, but my recommendation will be a yes bordering on no. 

I appreciate how the gameplay is consistently engaging, although I do kinda wish it was more forgiving on builds and playstyles on normal mode since I'm not that great at FPS. I thought I could lean on my Deathtrap summon while starting out as Gaige, but that ended up being too slow in the early parts and I ended up putting points into Anarchy. Not my preferred approach, but it grew on me eventually.

I also felt that the side missions were becoming more and more grueling as I approached the end. At one point I just stopped doing them entirely since they weren't as interesting as the main story and I just wanted to be done with it. And although the game doesn't force you to do everything, I feel that it has more content than it needs.

The story is also not super amazing, but it's not bad, either. My experience with the characters was ostly neutral: I neither liked nor disliked any of the characters except for Tiny Tina (she's a blast). The main antagonist had enough focus and weight behind his character that drove my desire to punch his face in on the final battle, and that battle was sufficiently satisfying. Seriously, Handsome Jack is an asshole. Not necessarily a bad thing, however, since it makes for a satisfying ending. His amusing dialogue was also a lot of fun, lol.

Hey, that's a useful segue! The dialogue in Borderlands 2 is what makes this game so much fun and is the main reason I still recommend it despite my previous complaints. The script writing was both clever and stupid and really over the top. Not going to spoil anything for those who haven't played, but I will say that Face McShooty is a fun time. Goliath's lines are also a thing of gold. Pair this with the fantastic voice acting across the board, and you've got all the makings of a great comedy! I love the script writing so fucking much.

I probably would've found the looting and progression aspects more enjoyable if the combat was more to my liking. I looked up some guides for progressing UVHM, but I never actually made it past TVHM. The enemies took so long to kill that I couldn't stand playing it any longer. I got what I want from the story, so I think I'll just end it here.

It's a solid 3/5 for me.

Oh and the art was good too. Very unique style and pleasing to the eye. Not disappointed with the music, either."

10152,ooh baby
10153,SHiFT
10154,My favorite game at the time easy to run and really fun
10155,"I may have 100 hours here on steam, but as someone who played this on their original Xbox 360 with over 3,000 + hours total among many different alt accounts, I can assure you this is definitely a good cop. If you enjoy playing games with your friends and just enjoying a good game with a lot of good replayability, (Is that a word?) I think you'll love it. All the DLC is actually worth it, minus the headhunter packs. Those are just bonus honestly. But if you're really into farming and getting the most efficient farms? Get the snowman headhunter DLC. Fact of the matter, is that this game is honestly so good everyone should play it through at least once."
10156,This game is awesome.The AI is Hilarious and skilled at the same time..I own it on Xbox Live and played it Through over and over+Including the DLC's. I own all of the Borderlands games on Xbox live except the Pre-Squeal..I own all of them on Steam except BL3

Its so much fun for a few hours but the best time to play is when you have 1 or 3 friends playing with you. My only gripe is the quests are too similar just shoot here get this or kill this guy and get a reward and while granted thats kinda the whole games gist it would have been cool to have some variety and it would have been cool if the customization was a bit more in depth."

10213,"[h1]Is it worth a play nearly 10 years later?[/h1]

Released in the Q3 of 2012, Borderlands 2 achieved historical success for [i]Gearbox[/i] already by 2014 as [b]one of their best-selling games, and one of the most played games of those years[/b]. However, as nearly 10 years have passed, the standards in gaming have grown, is Borderlands 2 still something you should invest your cash and time in?

[u]In short — yes[/u]. Borderlands 2 is a one of a kind game in many regards. [b]The narrative encases a deeply depressive, yet greatly humouristic world to explore[/b]. Under the despotic and cruel rule of the Handsome Jack, acting as the main antagonist, you, the Vault Hunter aim to stop him from taking over the world of Pandora and converting it into his own image, while both being on your way to a new-found Vault, withholding treasures and weapons of otherwordly power. The road is filled with friends and foes alike, who either help, betray or annoy you (looking at you, Claptrap). You discover the traumatic stories of many characters, both on the path of the main and side missions. [b]The comic touch to all of such discouraged stories bring a blend of emotions one certainly isn't used to, making the overall gaming experience unforgettable, even nearly 10 years later[/b].

The classes provide significant gameplay diversity, you may choose a [i]Siren, Commando, Gunzerker, Assassin, Psycho, Mechromancer[/i] and combine your unique abilities with a multitude of hazardous environments, [b]turning your battleground into a playground[/b]. With loot being in an overwhelming amount, you constantly are updating and upgrading your arsenal, seeing which weapon fits you best; especially during a co-op gameplay of up to four people in total. Customization, however, is limited to a degree, yet Borderlands 3 (as in most aspects of the gameplay) has drastically improved on that, yet you are still able to create a character you're relatively, visually satisfied with. 

The quests of Borderlands 2 have taken an improvement from Borderlands 1, with still relatively being a kill and collect fodder quests, [b]the writing, presenting and acting makes the side quests quite memorable and highly enjoyable[/b], particularly the quests of the main campaigns. Especially considering the humour the series provide. 

During your exploration of the world of Pandora, you see less similar environments, which might have been tiresome in Borderlands 1; exploring the tyrannised wastelands to technologically advanced zones, viridescent fields or arctic locations, with diverse flora and fauna. And do not even get me started on an abundance of references and easter eggs you will encounter on the way, making the overall adventure far more entertaining.

In conclusion, Borderlands 2 sticks true to the virtues of the series, while adding the necessary improvements, branding the game immortal within the gaming history. [b]This is not an adventure one may overlook, especially if they are looking for a unique gaming experience[/b], even nearly 10 years later. However, I would highly suggest purchasing [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/8133/Borderlands_The_Handsome_Collection/]The Handsome Collection[/url][/b], to receive everything Borderlands 2 has to offer, in addition to the Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and its goodies, a separate Borderlands game and yet another unforgettable experience of a different calibre.

What i like about this game the is that their is a co op so you can play the story with your friends. i haven't done co op before as i have no friends that want to play this game with me, but i have seen gameplay of co op on this game, and it looked so cool. for a 2012 game, this game is still a very good game to this day and i totally recommend this game in 2021. This game also has somewhat funny humour in it, mostly the robot. He may be a bit annoying with his yidda yatter but his humour is actually better than mine, and he's a frickin robot! you can buy better guns, shields, and just make your character be unstoppable if you do it right. im still a bit of an amateur at this game but its still a heck of a lot of fun. :)"

I sincerely think the developers of this game should burn in hell for charging people money for this monstrosity. It's that bad. Don't even think about wasting your time or money on this."
10283,scooter is best character
10284,bbest singleplayer shooter ever made dont @ me.
10285,Loot.
10286,gggof fgame lapy
10287,sh*ts amazing

10289,Pwitty gweajt
10290,
10291,The games awesome the still really dang playable for 2021 if u like borderlands of course
10292,very nice
10293,This game is great
10294,there is a land and there a borders this is true advertising
10295,"Very good game, especially in the coop mode. A game for several dozen hours of good gameplay. I recommend.. 
9,5/10"
10296,yee
10297,purchased this game thinking it was a sequal to fifa12... i had quite a shock when i loaded in and had to shoot fury animals. i thought it was a build up in the stroy up top playing soccer but with 300 hours im yet to see a soccer ball
10298,good
10299,"Don't let the year it was made stop you from getting this game, its so much fun. It only gets more fun as you play more. I strongly recommend, don't die without playing"
10300,love it
10301,"This game is really great even until now, i am already late for the party but you can still enjoy playing solo because of the different classes and builds you could play with, you could also jump into peoples game for some cooperative fun, but coop is best played with friends too bad i don't have any friends online. Almost all my friends in real life are not really into video games which sucks."
10302,shooting feels very good. Sniping is the best
10303,"It's about drive, it's about power
We stay hungry, we devour
Put in the work, put in the hours and take what's ours 
Black and Samoan in my veins
My culture bangin' with Strange
I change the game, so what's my motherfuckin' name (Rock)"
10304,"The OG Looter Shooter game, in my opinion."
10305,Creo que no me habia divertido tanto jugando con un amigo a un shooter.
10306,tolerable with friends
10307,"only fun with friends, can't find any that will actually play it with me. completely boring solo"
10308,Probably the best main villain of the borderlands series is Jack in my opinion.
10309,it be bussin
10310,"It is a pretty good game but for a while now it always crashes claiming to have ""run out of video memory"".
I know that error message is a lie because it only uses a fraction of my VRAM.
It can't be that hard to make a game work. They never fixed this and I am not changing my review until they do.
Online functionality has also become very inconsistent and unreliable ever since they did the Epic Games crossplay update."
10311,"Mixed. It took some time to get into it, and the co-op play is the only thing that got me to continue playing. 

It is funny, though I missed much of the dialog because I was distracted by the action and trying not to die - of which I did a lot.  I would prefer a 3rd person perspective, I do not understand the draw of first-person-tunnel-vision. I expanded the FOV to the maximum 110 degrees, but it still feels really confining. 

I originally planned to explore all areas and do more side missions but eventually I just wanted to grind through the story to finish it. Unfortunately, I’m not very good so I end up re-playing many missions because enemies re-spawn frequently.

10316,grind
10317,A classic
10318,A classic that never gets old.
10319,"To me this is easily the best Borderlands game. 

So why is this the best borderlands game? To me it all comes down to gameplay, the most important part of any Borderlands game, if the story sucks, the game doesn't look great or the environment don't feel good then all of that can be salvaged as long as I can just grind for guns and take out interesting and fun targets.

It has a stupid amount of content, the main game is fun and you can blast through it pretty quickly, classes have pretty distinct playstyles, the guns feel really unique and have a ton of character allowing for a ton of interesting and unique builds, drop rates aren't blown up to the point of making legendaries feel completely worthless, and the areas you explore are fun and diverse. Its super fun to replay the game a bunch just to try out different classes or builds, due to how relatively easily it is to skip the main story it becomes pretty easy to just do a quick run through the game.

It isn't all perfect, Slag is a terrible mechanic that just forces you to bring and swap out between a couple of guns constantly just because it adds so much damage. Some of the bosses are just glorified health bars and while the playstyles of classes are unique they are much less exciting compared to some of the DLC classes or classes from later games. Skill trees are also generally pretty boring.

Most of that is completely fine however purely because it is just so damn fun to grind for specific guns and to run through the world filled with all its content. The end game is really fun and something other Borderlands games would kill to have.

Luckily the game has more going for it besides its gameplay, the story and side quests are filled with a ton of character, something most other games later in the series sadly lost or lacked. It created one of the most iconic video game villains. Most of the DLC also manage to keep that charm and character and deliver it in different and fun forms. Even years later it still looks and sounds great, especially the voice acting of the cast still manages to feel distinct and unique. A lot of the game is just so memorable and has such a unique style to it.

When I think of Borderlands I think of Borderlands 2, some of the other games manage to do some things better but this one manages to combine the best parts of the series and create a memorable and fantastic experience, most of all its just straight up the most fun Borderlands game. For those reasons I think this is a big recommend from me."
10320,Everybody have fun tonight!
10321,Great continuation from the first game. Lots of fun especially with a friend through co-op.
10322,Classic Borderlands would= suggest.
10323,challenging but fun singleplayer but clearly meant for coop im gonna buy it for my friend soon

10331,"endless replayability, good story, unique boss's and billion's of ways to customise (i have played for so long and still find things that i haven't seen before)

10364,"Borderlands 2 is one of the best. The FPS action is unmatched, the graphics are so smooth it's incredible, and when combined with the mood of the game, it has me absorbed for hours on end. I definitely recommend this game."
10365,10/10 - The main reason why i failed my GCSEs
10366,"Guns, guns and more guns"
10367,r wa
10368,"Simply amazing. Its the embodiment of the Borderlands experience in my opinion. The level of destruction, blood, cringe jokes and Cl4p-Tr4p awful voice make this game the best of the franchise.

I recommend it in every aspect.

11/10 Because of Wob Wob!"
10369,some times you do a little shooting and then you do a little looting 10/10 would shootloot again
10370,this game is real memories would play this all night like 500 years ago with my bro fun work

10382,absolutely a beautiful game. absolutely play it. played it since i was 10 and still play it 7 years later
10383,"9/10

By far the best game in the series. BL1 is kinda optional but would recommend first. Endless replay value, tons of interesting side quests, crazy broken gear combos, Solid DLCs, a genuinely interesting main villain and story. Between PC and Xbox, I got well over 1000hrs of entertainment and would still go back for more. BL:TPS is good too… just don’t play BL3, game sucks massive dick."
10384,Borderlands 3 is better
10385,surviva
10386,My favourite game of all time. Even as it approaches being 10 years old it is still holds up in terms of gameplay and story. The amount of DLC and expansions is insane and there is easily 60+ hours of content including them. 10/10 can't recommend enough.
10387,Booba
10388,cool game.

10400,never gets old
10401,i sure do love killing random short (and tall) homeless people
10402,one of the best co-op games
10403,"I picked this game up on a whim and instantly fell in love with Krieg and cultivated my love for guns and weaponry...however; I will always love melee as I slash and bash my way to victory. The story: cash money...the guns: only the sexiest boomsticks allowed...the gameplay: mildly repetitive but more fun with buddies.

10/10; get your crew and pop a few caps into Handsome Jack for me."
10404,"Amazing game, played it to completion on Xbox one, even more amazing on PC!"
10405,"Great game. Lots of missions and many battles. Hope to complete before end of year. 
Very much recommend.."
10406,Works perfectly on Linux! So I can work in a VM doing my job and then flip back to gaming on linux
10407,greatest game
10408,Yes.
10409,good game classic game
10410,"Classic game, good memories."
10411,"one of the best games i've ever played.
i've soaked up so many hours into this game, since i was a kid, and i still can't really get enough. 

the art style isn't necessarily rare, but it's done quite beautifully. 
there are a lot of glitches and exploits in this game, but most of them actually make the game even more fun!
this game isn't grindy at all, like a lot of things usually are, and even if you do grind, the game still dishes out threats to you every here and there, which is a really nice thing in my opinion.
there's so much quests, and DLC's, and an absolutely MASSIVE loot pool, that you can almost never get an exact copy of one gun, through your entire playthrough, from NM, through UVHM OP10. 

what makes this game even better though?
playing with friends!
playing with friends can really help you in some areas of the game, and in others, it actually makes the game funnier! 
it makes a really good experience for those trying to simply have fun together,
and with all this being said?

the mind-boggling amount of work, and effort, put into this game, can't even be described by compliments,
as they all underestimate the greatness the developers have dished out for this game."
10412,"Absolutely amazing game, I fell in love with it the first time I played, it is captivating and makes time fly by really quick. Compelling story, interesting and complex characters, beautifully made 3d world, each location in the game feels very detailed and looks special. Overall a great title. I recommend playing through every of the Borderlands' titles. It always offers hundreds of hours of fun and satisfaction. I can honestly say that BL 2 is my all time favorite game."

great DLC and Weapons as well"
10418,nice game
10419,I been playing for years on console and highly recommend this game to anyone who has never played it before. if you enjoy looter shooters this is definitely the best one in its franchise and you will get your moneys worth. Nothing is better than throwing a gun at your enemies that screams. c:
10420,Played while on acid. Was tripping mad balls. Highly recommend.
10421,It's still fun. I've played the heck out of it. The dlc kinda stinks at this point. Worth it if you can get ALL of it cheap.
10422,"The graphic aint that bad but, totally worth it! Fun game!"
10423,this game has epic snipers really recommend this game
10424,bueno
10425,"Amazing game and sequel to its predecessor. An absolute blast and much better balanced, with a far more complex plot. Cannot recommend enough."
10426,zer0
10427,"If you like looters and you like shooters, you'll love this. Many classes, such guns, very funny."
10428,"Pure chaos, a ridiculous variety of guns, weapons and shield types. This game has everything from over-the-top gun-play, fantastic voice acting, compelling villains and a simple narrative executed perfectly. Each character has there moment of spotlight. There's a reason why I've bought this game 5-4 times on 360, Xbox One, PC and PS4/PS5."
10429,It's fire.

10440,top 5 all time ngl
10441,"Good game overall, but it won't let you save manually and it's own auto-saves are proving to be very unreliable.
[Edit} Also constantly hogs my internet connection, despite the fact that I'm not playing multiplayer and have repeatedly declined agreeing to their online mode terms and conditions. This is the sort of thing that always puts me off games of this type.
[Further edit] Just tried playing with Steam offline, the game constantly complains that it can't connect but still chokes said connection. 
Too late to refund, but I am done with this BS."
10442,"What is there to even say? One of the greatest games of all time, and that's all there is to it."

10467,nice game and great weapon variety and cool characters
10468,"Borderlands 2 is a game that new gamers or those who love the series enjoy. I enjoyed the game for maybe the first 10 hours, but then the jokes got repetitive and annoying. Loud and Random = Funny!!! (To some yes, me, not so much.) I'm not knocking down anyone who enjoys this game. I love the graphics and attention to detail the game has. All the little funny things you can find around maps is fun. It's a good game to play with friends, nonetheless, so might as well give it a try (Don't let my spitefulness detour you!) 5/10 overall game"

I'm not scared, Jack -- there's nothing you can dish out that I can't overcome! NOTHING! 
NOOOOO! DAMN YOU, STAIRS! 
Dammit, Jack -- how did you know stairs were my ONLY weakness?! Next to electrocution, and explosions, and gunfire, rust, corrosion, being kicked a lot, viruses, being called bad names, falling from great heights, drowning, adult onset diabetes, being looked at funny, heart attacks, exposure to oxygen, being turned down by women, and pet allergens! Your brilliance is matched only by your malevolence!”"

10479,claptrap funny
10480,very badass
10481,YUP
10482,Fun gameplay. Fast pace. LOTS of guns.
10483,The game is good but i bought the handsome collection and it should've come with the Commander Lilith dlc
10484,"amazing humour, amazing game."
10485,Totally recommend whether single or co-op play
10486,The gun-play is so shit in this game
10487,yes
10488,"Definitely the most revolutionary and game-changing of the whole series. So much innovation and change compared to the first game, including mechanics firstly introduced here! 

A brilliant mix of first person shooter and classic RPG. It's loot systems creates a depth to combat that makes it quite enjoyable. And the different classes available allow anyone to get right in to play, from the shooter fans who will pick Salvador to the RPG fans picking the mechromancer or the Siren.

One of the best games you will even play!
Amazing story that takes u trough the planet Pandora in the most badass and awsome way possible. U will make brains explode to amazing guitar solos, slaughter monsters with a retarded robot and shoot badonkadonks at trains.
U will have to search hard to find a more random game.

I would strongly recommend buying the DLC's since they bring more story and content to an alrady awsome game!
""Tiny Tina's assault on dragon keep"" and ""Mr. Torgue's campaign of carnage"" are two DLC's that made me burst out i laugh more times then i could count."
10489,"I love Borderlands 2 its definitely my favorite game in the franchise (unlike Pre sequel, that sucked) I have thousands of hours on this game on console and it definitely is the most fun ive ever had while gaming so if you have the money buy the handsome collection it was one of my best decisions ever"
10490,it's ok
10491,"Awesome game, good story, cool characters, tons of cool weapons, so much DLC and expansions, one of my personal favorite games of all time! Can be kind of grindy and long but if you want a good story and tons of stuff to do its a great game."
10492,"Excellent villaing, gameplay, and story! Love this game!"
10493,"a true classic at this point that will hold it's own for years to come, I remember skipping school the day this game released to go pick it up from gamestop and play for the rest of the day, if you somehow haven't played this game, do yourself a favor and jump in"
10494,This game is amazing to mess around. Especially the guns. Love those throw to explode guns.
10495,"This game portrays madness, and looter-shooter to another level. I highly recommend this game, because even when bored of the base game, go over to the huge variety of DLC borderlands 2 has to offer.
Once again I highly recommend this game, and I've been playing since it came out, and even when I got tired of this constant gameplay, I had always made my way back to this game, whether its on steam, xbox, i come back to it. And with having played over 400+ hours on both xbox, and pc, I highly recommend this game."
10496,This game has a lot of variety in it and also the the game is very fun to play no matter what vault hunter you use
10497,"Pretty Much what you'd expect if you played Borderlands. Which isn't bad, honestly the story for this game is better than Borderlands. I found the story for the first one to be ... lackluster and a poor excuse to piece together a looter-shooter. This game however took the loose threads from the first one and brought them together into an actual narrative. I also like how the playable characters from the first game come back and have their stories fleshed out a bit.

Overall, worth the time ... but definitely find a way to get some golden keys from the internet because the default drops and store bought items are no-where near enough to get through the game without grinding. The keys allow you to upgrade when you need to."
10498,STRONG LIKE... LOVE. I struggle to think of something I dislike about this game.
10499,Hands down one of the best games out there.
10500,"Great game but one question, how the fuck does Mauve have over 200 hours in this game but  hasn't even beat the game, yet I have 30 hours and I've beaten the game"
10501,good game
10502,"first few hours is quite boring for me. The map is also empty, does not have allies that can company you to battle atleast as far as i play the game. but after getting good stuff, the game becomes fun, you can travel fastly because you got skill points, it's chaotic, with lots of enemies, things going around. Tried multiplayer for a while, it was more chaotic with stronger enemy, more damage output and input, friendly skills, boosts.

For new players, i suggest making a shift account and redeem codes to get golden keys to make your game easier.

edit: latest review
i know now why i does not play this game anymore. its too boring, you just walk there and shoot stuff. that basicly it."

10564,Claptrap goes to Sugma and meets Joe where he sadly passed away from Ligma.
10565,"You want to have fun? Alone or with your friends? Then my friend you’re looking at the right game! 

I bought it some years ago after my God told me to, so that I could play with his holiness. And I have to admit playing with his divinity was one of the most fun I had in my life.

All you need to know is, if you want to have fun alone or with your friends or some kind of God/Goddess then is Borderlands 2 the right choice for you.

And remember the Highlands are the worst.

10592,dude its BL2. It rules
10593,"I'm going to start this review by saying this is *COMPLETELY* biased hahaha.

Borderlands 2 is incredible. From the story being very coherent, to the music being impeccable, and Handsome Jack being one of the best villains of all-time video game history, the mesh of everything this game has to offer is just one of my favorite things. Coming from Xbox 360 -> PS4 -> PC, I have over 2000 hours on this game easily, and none of it gets boring. There's something for everyone here, from dialogue/funny moments, to endgame grinds. 1000000/10 Gearbox. You did us right."
10594,?????
10595,great game
10596,very fun to play

10604,This game bussin
10605,good
10606,Tis Great and well worth money
10607,good game I would recommend this to any one first starting out in the borderlands serious.
10608,"its unreal

10609,Great game so well done
10610,Its easier then waiting around to die.
10611,you can kill midgets 10/10
10612,good game
10613,handsome jack drank all my mountain dew and called me a bitch
10614,"yeah, its good"
10615,"Borderlands 2 is one of the 4 games in a series of looter-shooters.

if you like looting, and you like shooting, the entire series is worth a try.

10/10 truly amazing"
10616,Have hundreds of hours on PS4 love this game
10617,Bruh...it's a looter shooter. it will always be fun. think of it as a fps diablo 3 <3
10618,"Loved the story and the characters. Very satisfying shooter looter, with fair distribution (for money and ammo) in coop play. The screaming (when you get hurt or when you kill enemies) is a little irksome when the game volume is high, yet still comical. The side quests are hilarious. Highly recommend."
10619,One of the best
10620,This game is so fucking sexy. I'd make out with krieg if he was real
10621,best game. if you like the feeling of this game then dont play Boarderlands 3
10622,Even though this game is quite an old one the story line is really good and has loads of different adventures
10623,"I remember seeing this game on the shelves in Gamestop when it first came out, and assumed it was another one of those Shadow the Edgehog type military shooters a la COD so I ignored it and promptly forgot it existed. Fast forward almost ten years and my girlfriend recommends it to me, STRONGLY. Let's just say my assumption back in 2012 was Dead Fucking Wrong. As someone who joined the party late, so to speak, I say this game is nothing but humor and charm from the get-go. The start of the game is a little slow, but once you start getting deep into the story and lore, it's a hell of a time."
10624,.
10625,Really fun game if you are looking for a looter/shooter you are at the right place i would recomend becus ive hade alot of fun you can play upp to 4player in the same game and the diffrent characters have a fun feel to them and they are all really good and they can all be fun to play and they can all do everything that you need to complete the game there is tho alot of Grinding if you want a legendary gun or a class mod or maybe a grenade you have alot of playtime in this game alone but i would not reccomend without the DLCs soo handsome collection is what you would want 9/10 for me atleast the game is good in my opinion.
10626,Catch a RIIIIIIIIDE!! <3
10627,
10628,good
10629,This game's story is amazing and the characters are bad-asses and customizable to fit your play-style.
10630,sussy baka
10631,"Hands down, the best shooter looter on the market, and my personal favorite game of all time. The legendary weapons are cooler than in any other shooter looter I've seen, the writing is easily the best in the series, and all of the characters feel unique and have the potential to create very fun and powerful builds. On top of that, the DLC campaigns are really good, with some of them like the Dragon Keep DLC being arguably just as good, if not better, than the base campaign. The game has its flaws though, mainly with balance at endgame; enemies on UVHM, especially raid bosses, can feel very bullet spongey and can take forever to kill without the right build, making much of the game's weapons and perks feel useless. However, this isn't really an issue until you're close to max level, and even then, the pros of this game definitely outweigh the cons. Also, mods like Borderlands 2 Reborn and Borderlands 2.5 can help rebalance the game, so the previously mentioned balance issues at end game are not an issue if you play with the right mod. Would highly recommend to anyone, 10/10."
10632,this some good shit
10633,wish they didn't get the pencil on my monitor but all right i guess
10634,"It's better than Borderlands 1 and 3. Enjoyable shooter with okay mechanics for the time it was made. Slower paced than more modern shooters and can get repetitive, but still loads of fun."
10635,"i really enjoy the borderland series but borderlands 2 is just crazy. i do recommend that if you buy this game you buy some or all the downloadble content that you can to increase your activities in the game because when you play this game for sometime you start to notice that the grinding gets boring, if you farm terra all day its boring right? so i think you guys should  really buy dlc's and get friends to play with you. i played this game since it was released and bought the game again in 2020 and i have noticed the game is dying and now 2021 the game is not dying anymore it is dead. i cant find any online players that want to play and if they want to play they're from diffrent regions and bad ping ofc."
10636,Hey buddy its me ROLand
10637,It's borderlands.
10638,"still the same game we all know and love, no better way out there to loot and shoot. Will keep you invested for eternities and I replay the whole series on occasion
"
10639,"Same thing over and over again, story isn't very interesting, no one is likable."
10640,Best Looter Shooter.
10641,is one of the best game i have ever played
10642,I have played this game since it's release and it has never disapointed same goes for Borderlands 1. I have played trough it many times with many friends and family.

10648,These games are stupid as hell but gotdam if they aren't a blast and a half
10649,The shoot and loot game that will have you farming for hours and you will love every moment of it

10662,"The First Borderlands was a test Run, a Proof of concept. Borderlands 2 is the perfection of that proof of concept. Masterful. Borderlands 3 took the gameplay to the stratosphere, but fumbled the story so hard you need to play it with voice lines off. So this is what we have. A unicorn, a unicorn of a game, a Unicorn made of Diamonds."
10663,good game get it
10664,"Simplemente Borderlands 2
Es un juego que desde el primer momento te hace sentir en un lugar diferente, personajes y ambientes fuera de lo comun.
Uno de los mejores juegos shoot&loot que hay.

la historia muy buena."

10668,"Great game even in 2021!
Worth buying the handsome collection on sale.
If you enjoy all of that i would recommend you to buy the Lillith DLC but probably mostly to be able to make a lvl 30 new character and save the whole second replay of normal difficulty if you actually want to mess around in the other two difficulties.
If not just get the Handsome collection.
I enjoyed both purchases, not sure if i will buy the Borderlands 3 game still."
10669,Great game!
10670,fun
10671,.
10672,"new to the series, I'm loving it!"
10673,"I love this game.
This cartoon graphic style drew me in.
The UI was difficult but I got used to it and spent a lot of time there."
10674,"Borderlands 2, my all time favorite game. would highly recommend"
10675,"Kind of a slog, it really felt like a chore at times. I've previously only played BL1 back when it came out before this, and I didn't play much past maybe level 20 or so in BL2. The character abilities are fun, but it just feels like they made huge maps to trudge across with little in the way of fast travel to cut down on time, like they literally doubled everything in BL1 with no afterthought. The maps are giant compared to BL1, but in the worst way. I heard newer entries in the series fix this, but the majority of missions in this game from what I played just felt like a chore walking between objectives. The writing is unfunny and terrible, but it honestly becomes noise when you get bombarded with your 15th or so poop joke in a funny accent so you tend to just ignore it. The music is decent when its there, but outside of story missions theres nothing to listen to as you walk to your next objective. It almost seems deliberately designed to be a mindless grindy game that you do alongside doing something else. Its the kind of game I look at in my steam library and say ""eh im not in a mood to play anything i guess ill play this"" and only end up with a headache 3 or so hours later. This is 100% the example you give someone when you say ""anything is fun with friends"", because while there IS co-op, the encounters never seem deep enough outside of endgame-tier raid bosses like crawermax 2 or something. Its the video game equivalent to eating potato chips on your friend's couch in his apartment while you're both zonked watching TV."
10676,abababababababababab
10677,"just as silly as it is gory and raunchy. even better with friends, bonus points if none of you know what you're doing!"
10678,"Super buggy, especially with online play, and macOS! Please fix this masterpiece. It's incredibly annoying: one day it works fine, the other day is does not. I'm getting tired of this hit-and-miss, buggy game. 

Fantastic game. A masterpiece that can be played for years, which I did on PS4 and plan to do now on computer."
10679,"its an older game, runs great on lower spec computers, replay value is really high."
10680,So fun
10681,A very good game that is best played with friends. Balance your classes between you to cover all the things you need. Hours of fun with great gameplay and fun npcs.

10697,this game will kick your ass but you will keep coming back just because of how fun it is to kill midgets
10698,"the grind gets real. Honestly had the best outcome any game could have, and am soon choosing to buy BL3 just to see with now some DLC if the game proves worthy of being after this."
10699,EXPLOSION!!???!
10700,This is simply one of the greatest shooter/rpg hybrids ever made.  A must buy for any fan of these genres.
10701,"
this will be written in a semi formal document with intentional mistakes 

Borderlamds is an good game with a compailing storie line and hours of game play. I have gone from a retarded child to raid bossing for fun. With a painful amoun of time I have play most of the characters through at least normal. They are all fun exempting maya that fucking bitch. She suck ass, but other characters like salvador are fun and have balanced mechanics ;) In my humble opinion Gaige is the most fun character with anarchy being her biggest downside/upside it makes a nice duality to her character, but she only has anarchy as a late game build."

10740,good
10741,"When you think, ""Loot-Shooter"" what comes to mind? Well, only this game, of course! Out of all of the Borderlands games, I would have to say this is the best one. Borderlands 2 defined how Gearbox wanted the Borderlands series to be. But, I can't forget, Randy Pitchford can suck my balls"
10742,Moxxie is hot.
10743,:3
10744, one of the g.p.o.a.t. (greatest pog of all time)
10745,a true gem of its time and still holds up today. amazing gunplay with stupid fun characters to play and a story that will surprise you.
10746,Awesome!
10747,"Pros:
> Fantastic characters and dialogue, especially on the main villain Daddy Jack- I mean, Handsome Jack
> Good performance:pretty graphics ratio
> Fun guns and loot
> Just, like, good vibes

Cons:
> Outdated manoeuvring mechanics - can't dodge, slide, mantle, etc like you can in Borderlands 3
> Colours feel more washed-out and grey (can be fixed with ReShade)

This is my favourite Borderlands game, at least vibe-wise. The Vault Hunters are interesting without being overly-complicated to play, and even though they aren't very personable in-game they do have enjoyable concepts and backstories. Handsome Jack is just...such a good Big Bad. The humour is on-point almost all the time, and the gunplay still holds up although it's hard to come back from Borderlands 3 where they've introduced mantling and sliding, as well as other quality of life improvements that aren't in Borderlands 2 (for example, you automatically pick up money and ammo in BL3. in BL2, you have to hold down the Loot button to collect all the applicable money and ammo you can take), however it's still a fun game to play.

Also, Tiny Tina's DLC in itself is reason enough to come back to this game."
10748,Amazing sequel to BL1 and better than BL:TPS. Handsome Jack is hands down the best villain this series has ever seen. 10/10
10749,Why do I not have the last DLC that had already come out when the bundle purchased claimed to have everything? I do love this game im just pissed that i was lied to about what was actually included in the bundle purchased.
10750,"This is a rare gem amongst games and a classic to behold. Please try it out if you're interested. The gameplay is fast-paced, there is tons of loot, lots of enemies, fun multiplayer and content."

It's price is perfect and the gameplay can make you like... zone out? you just forget about life and get into the game like if you were actually shooting those shitheads lol."

10787,game very good yes
10788,"such a good game to play in coop with friends. An arcade game with funny scenes when you listen all the cinematics and audios. I can't say some negative points on that game for real ! 4K is now available, so the game is more appreciable !"
10789,...
10790,A classic looter/shooter worth at least a couple play-throughs

10794,"Ahhhh... Borderlands 2. Despite this game being out for almost 10 years at this point, it took me equally as long to finish it. Do not believe the hours I have logged on steam; I have many more on both my PS3 and my PS4.

As someone who prefers single-player experiences, I have always had a tough time finding games that I can play with my friends that aren't your typical military shooter or a shovel-ware party game. However, when I was growing up, this was one of those games that I would be able to put on, and play with any friend and have loads of fun. For some reason though, even if it was the same friend that would come over to play the game, we always felt like we had to make a new save so that we could start on a level playing field. As such, I have restarted and played through the opening more times than I can count. Doing this made me turned off to the game, and I assumed that there was little variety in the side quests, thought the main story was incredibly dull, and that the loot was boring and uninteresting.

I could not have been more wrong.

After playing borderlands 3 for the first time and absolutely loving it (aside from the cringe inducing story), I decided it would be fitting to go back and see if I misunderstood what this game was trying to go for. After getting past those opening missions, I was met with a well written story, hilarious side quests, a gorgeous and varied art style that makes each area feel distinct and unique that still holds up all this time later, and a satisfying amount of loot that always gave me a new toy to play with. Anthony Burch's writing is really the star of the show here, as each NPC you encounter is well written with a wacky personality that makes characters like Tiny Tina and Handsome Jack so memorable.

I cannot recommend this game enough. While some aspects of the gun play might not have aged as well, with the impact and weight of the guns feeling floaty, it still isn't significant enough to take away from the absolute joy that it is to play this game.

P.S. If you're playing it for the first time, don't choose zero. Don't make the same mistake I did."
10795,"it good i like shoot people
"
10796,"love it. still as great as when it came out, great replay value."
10797,Only took 9 years and 750 hours to finally finish everything! Well worth it and still a great game to play!
10798,Great Story

10801,decent
10802,Greatest FPS i've played
10803,Best Fucking Game 10/10
10804,"I've played this game from Xbox 360 to PS4 and now playing it a little on Laptop (Not PC) and after tweaking my settings a little, im now playing with little to no lag. It's an enjoyable game for me due to nostalgia, but you get the playthrough value over and over. Honestly anyone who hasn't played this game yet must be living under a rock!"
10805,Guns go pew
10806,"Allow me to introduce myself -- I am a CL4P-TP steward robot, but my friends call me Claptrap! Or they would, if any of them were still alive. Or had existed in the first place!"
10807,noice.
10808,"Borderlands got his own kind of style, its a big world where you can randomly do quests. Or just killing. I really like the characters, cause they all have a story and a lot of humor with it. Actually, the entire game includes humor. And that is why i would recommend Borderlands. 9/10!"
10809,"Nice game to play with friends
"
10810,"very nicce
"
10811,.
10812,"The best game, best rpg, best fps, best adventure, best mmo, best tabletop, best flight simulator, best pen and paper, and if you don't think so ok well maybe."
10813,gud game
10814,HAHAHAAAAAAAAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA GREAT LAUGHS!!!!!!!!! :P
10815,"My favorite game of the series, bought it years ago and still playing with friends"
10816,one of my all time favorite games but i wish you could port characters across platforms. what's the point of console cloud save if all your OP 10 characters are essentially lost when you switch to PC? was a bit torn up to lose all those hours of gameplay. but I guess I'll do it again
10817,Deathtrap is my friend
10818,"Funny if you play with friend, otherwise boring as f ..."
10819,"I could be another gamer that tells you that this game is a classic, but instead only a few words are needed. I'M STARVING!!! I'M GONNA EAT YOUR BABIES!!"
10820,"Haha, B0re is crunchy"
10821,
10822,its good
10823,epic
10824,"One of my favorite games of all time, it runs pretty smoothly on PC, coming from console. Great gameplay, short load times, overall great time."
10825,"Graphics? Great for their time, but the artistic style is timeless.
Plot? Dialogue? Great. RIP Bigbird.
Gameplay? The only thing that edges it out is BL3, maybe the pre-sequel too.
11/10. Cannot over-recommend."
10826,"Does not get any better than Borderlands 2. For real. Just play it - w/ friends or alone, but play it."
10827,It's ok.
10828,"I used to play this everyday on my Xbox 360. BL2 is a great game that is hard to put down, especially when with friends. This game does everything that the first Borderlands did, but better (while also adding tons more!)"
10829,bl2
10830,fun

10840,b0re
10841,One of my Favorite Game series Seriously worth every penny
10842,"Timeless classic. Graphics holds up really well due to the art style. Movement and shooting mechanics do feel just the slightest bit dated but nothing too bad. Presentation, humor, questing, character building and farming loot are all still just as good as they were when the game released nearly a decade ago."
10843,fun game
10844,LOVE BL2 AND BL3

10861,amazing game definitely worth buying all the DLC and the other Borderlands games as well
10862,"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon against self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't, ah fie, 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead, nay not so much, not two, So excellent a king, that was, to this Hyperion to a satyr, so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the wings of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth, Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him, As if the increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet within a month - Let me think not on't; frailty, thy name is woman - A little month, or ere these shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears, why she, even she - O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourned longer - married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gall'd eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

10864,GOOD SHIT
10865,"Just recently started my TVHM playthrough and there's so much endgame content in the handsome collection that I'm probably going to hit 80 hours of playtime just on one character. There's so much going on and the combat is super addictive

10873,It's murder time
10874,Never gets old and is always fun.
10875,good game.
10876,GOOD GAME BAD GRAPHICS
10877,"UNPLAYABLE!  Every time without fail the game crashes when trying to load a save, and its such hard crash that you are forced to restart your computer. Why hasn't this been fixed yet? this is one of my favorite games and ever since 3's release, this shit started happening."
10878,"I played this game back on Xbox 360 and migrated here, but I've always really loved this game and would absolutely recommend it."
10879,"Never had much time to play, but it seems fun.....this Roland guy better not die by the end, that would suck, wouldn't it?"
10880,YES
10881,yes
10882,"Crashes/ freezes like crazy, not only that but if you don't have a second monitor with task manager opened then there is no way to get it off your screen without restarting. This problem happens even on borderlands 3 but much more rare. I love this game but this version is an abomination."
10883,Likes= everything

10906,I really enjoyed the game. It was fun to play around with friends. The story is great and its way much better than the borderland 3 story.
10907,"
Its a very fun game"
10908,stop reading negative reviews and play the game
10909,It can be really hard if you play incorrectly. Make sure you keep up with your weapon and your own levels to keep up. otherwise it is very funny and well written. I enjoy it now that I've figured out the balancing.
10910,"If it wasnt because it has coop multiplayer this would be pretty generic for my taste. Honestly it is a very good game, I have more than 20 hours on it but the magic happens with coop for me."
10911,"I have never been a huge fan of FPS titles with the exceptions of the Halo franchise and the Borderlands franchise.  With this game, I never felt bored.  I was always on the search for that next better gun!  The fact that you can clear a whole map and move on, then comeback later and do it all again makes all of the Borderlands titles eternally replayable!  I have loved this title since the day it was released, and still love it just as much today!"
10912,spoob
10913,This is a new purchase on Steam but playing the game now makes me proud that I pre-ordered BL2 from 2K games many moons ago
10914,Tons of content (even without DLC) and lots of replayability solo or with friends. Fun loot system and satisfying for grinders.
10915,Its an amazing story game i recomend this to everyone its very fun to grind!

10929,I like being confused
10930,this game is amazing it has millions of guns hundreds of items and great combat its a fantastic game and certainly worth every penny in the first 5:00 minutes alone
10931,"I played this game for 300+ hours on Xbox 360. Back when I was a kid and had infinite free time. Fun game to play with friends and during it's hay day. Def making this one of the games that I'd make my kid to play.

Edit: Here you go Linux gamers, I made a guide for us ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2617457575 )"

10937,"A little bit of a bullet sponge game, in my opinion. But then again I kept dying.

Looks great. Love the NPCs, random guns and environments. A for effort. Love the game"
10938,bideo gane
10939,I neglected playing this game for a long time and I regret it. It is simply awesome. The only complain is that the game costs too much for it's age but even so i would say that it's worthy it.
10940,Amazing game. Favourite game ever. BL3 can't stand up to this masterpiece.

10960,"Coming off the success from the first Borderlands, the second addition to the series is a slam dunk full of content that ranges from hilarious, sad, and downright fulfilling moments. This is a game worth playing with your friends to share those moments with, or play alone if you're hooked onto the story. Either way it's a game worth recommending."
10961,"love this game, it´s fun as f"

10965,yayayayayayayayayayayaya
10966,its simple game play nuts acting best of all millions of weapons
10967,"Simply and without further ado - a game about a masterpiece.
 Characters and skills, as for me, have been tried out competently.  Even the same plot characters have their own story.
 Take it, you won't regret it!
 But by the way, it's a pity for handsome Jack, he's not the same as him, they are being exhibited ...

 9/10"
10968,"By far the greatest game in the series. The depth of the overall game, the synergies between all the abilities and perks, the story. They all make for a really great game. The variety of loot there is fitting to each playstyle and the farming for gear make for 100 of hours of fun, if youre into grinding that is.

 There is also a huge palette of enemies to fight off with your arsenal, incredibly strong raid bosses which some of REALLY require either a 4 man party on max level or you using glitches/being a godlike gamer (not to screw off anybody, they make for a great challenge and i exaggerated a little. they are strong and you might need multiple tries at them but you´ll get there sometime)

Overall its a really fun game, the best looter shooter out there."
10969,yes
10970,too hard 10/10
10971,What is there to not like....? It's Borderlands 2! I have played it on multiple systems and beat it countless times. It never gets old!
10972,people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like
10973,"I have four copies of this game including this one.  Trust me it's a good game.  (Xbox 360, PS vita, PC and PS3).  Totalling over 500 hours among all four,"

10981,"Best Borderlands, and currently the best looter shooter, as Destiny 1 is limited to consoles, and Destiny 2's gone to shit. Handsome Jack is one of the best villains to date, issa good game."
10982,good game for it age

first off how does this amazing ball with super powers get caught die come back to life and reanimate the dead? like bro we get it you need some type of way to make super soldier 2.0 spartanman but like give us the lore let the ""guardians"" at least be clone slaves like star wars or super soldier child like halo

second off the enemies why make hobo elites and ""vex"" aka guilty spark or taken aka the flood real original what making a second concept for enemies was to hard smh bungie !!!

Finally and most important !!! why they kill the funny robot it makes me sick seeing the chicken now have to be up for adoption like no one is going to go adopt this ugly mother clucker please bring him back so i dont have to look at that chicken any more !!!"

If you like a game that can keep you coming bck for more 4 years later,BYE THIS GAME! I swear this is the number one BEST game of all time ever,ever,NO TO MENTION Its charm factor! Theres a wity dark joke around every corner and around every dead bandit carcass.A big plus for me was the main villain,HANDSOME JACK! If I went in to detail about how much I love about him,the steam text box would brake,So all in all I highly suggest geting it some time."
11049,I could never get behind it like I did with BL1. I mean first off they kill blood wing ffs. The weapon system felt odd and just not as fluid as BL1.

11060,"This game is one of a kind, I grew up with this series and it has been the most fun game to play casually or competitively. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games with story and game play alike"
11061,"Played this game across 2 console generations and then on PC, the best looter shooter ever made"
11062, what does based mean?
11063,"One of my favourite games, highly recommended. Possibly better than the 3rd installment of the serie."
11064,just buy it
11065,.
11066,Just a poorly designed piece of boring slow cover shooter. With meaningless loot mechanics and a lot of unfunny jokes
11067,The game that defined looter-shooter genre.

11069,By far the best game of the series- I've played all except the first one multiple times and haven't enjoyed any of the others as much as this one! Truely a wonderful game with amazing characters and story! Definitely a game for people who enjoy explorer fps games :].
11070,"Pretty Epic

11071,"[b]Borderlands 2[/b]

Classic shooting, tons of action, and very distinctive character design with some attitude and craziness for sure (Tiny Tina fan :P ).

Also, a very enjoyable experience in Co-op.

11085,My all time favorite FPS. I replay this thing often. Still haven't completed all the missions. Highly recommended.
11086,The game overall is good the story line is is amazing the loot pull is very large to pick from but RNG is not very friendly to some people. Now the only bad part of the game is the graphics it was good for it release and age but they can do a 4k remastering like they did Borderlands 1.
11087,good fps

11099,My most favorite of all the borderlands games
11100,very good love cock
11101,"Borderlands 2, this game has a deep place in my heart, is probably my favorite FPS and RPG game combined in one of the best game i ever played.

I buyed the GOTY edition a couple of years and just played like 2 hours, never catch me at first, a couple of months i decided to try it again, and instantly became addicted to it. Borderlands has a deep, amazing, original but also a stupid, ridiculous and maniacnihilistsociopath history.

The game itself is balanced, but some patchs fixes some weapons, the level ranking is well made, the enemies and bosses are also balanced and the exp gained is rewarding depending on your run. The game consists in 3 difficulties each more harder than the other, the last one Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, is the representation of the purgatory, lot of enemies with a toon of health and they kill you 5 times before you even touch the ground. But aside from that is very challenging and a good experience gameplay. The main history is not that great but is entertaining, specially for the main villain and the best character of all time.

Handsome jack is biggest point in the borderlands series. Is the most well written character and the most amazing villain or hero if you want to call it like that. Constantly remind you that you are scum but him is the best, awesome, etc being in the galaxy. Love every second of Jack talking and making his jokes around the main gameplay.

The game itself is amazing, the legendaries are unique, with a toon of references, borderlands 2 is for me a unique experience and you gonna have a lot of fun and hours playing it."

11164,"Long thought out story. Different type of shooter. Random weapon stats add some variability to the game.
Can get a bit tedious backtracking to complete side missions and constantly looting pointless loot.
Not a game for those hoping to make the most of their time."

11167,I wanna kill this annoying budget Wall-e clone
11168,late to review. But I've played pre-sequel and 3. and this by far is the better game.
11169,"Story is fine and sometimes funny. What I didn't like much is the shoot part (Everything is sponge, character builds are meh. What does it matter if I do more damage if everything is scaling. I didn't even once feel powerful when leveling up. It was just the same.) and loot (I would expect that weapons will drop left and right when you have XXX billions weapons in game but no, it feels scarse and if something drop it is usually trash).
Quests are repetitive in most part and what I didn't like at all that you are traveling from same point A to B and back too many times.

It's somewhat ""fun"" in COOP. I would never play this in single player."

11174,"This game is awesome and for good reason, the replayability is endless, ive played this game at least 15 times through and its fun every single time. It may sound like absolute torture but its really not when you try playing as all the characters, they are all unique in every single way and I recommend getting the DLC for a better experience with this game. Dont squander a good chance to give this a go with some pals because it is tremendously good and hilarious to play around in. So what are you doing give the damn game a motherfucking try"
11175,Great game. Provides with a nice challenge! I started playing on ps4 and love how fast the loading times are on pc. :)

one of my all time favorite games. i have thousands of hours on console & now playing pc with mods , its like a brand new experience all over again & its beautiful every single time. no matter how you play. farm everything in sight , or jus pick up whatever you find & go. this game really has something for everybody. its great single player , but even more amazing with an awesome group of friends. (i would imagine, only one of my friends actually play lol) TLDR: this game fuckin rocks you should buy it. 

PS. WHOS HYPED FOR WONDERLANDDDSSSS"

+ crap-sack world that doesn't take itself too seriously
+ value for money (hundreds of hrs of content)
+ addictive
+ easily runs on max settings with no duress on your PC

- visual style is lame and unremarkable
- dialogue and story sometimes grate on the nerves
- surprising lack of meaningful customisation

11193,"I've been living on Pandora since Borderlands 1. I explain: the company I founded was responsible for the translations/localizations for everything Borderlands throught Borderlands 1 and 2 and Tales from Borderlands. 

That said: it is my go-to game when my anxiety and depression act out hard. Since I have a severe case of ADHD as well (and why not, right?) Borderlands 2 helps me cope with the straight thoughts, and helps me focus. 
There is something about starting the game that makes me feel like going back home. This version, the 4K texture add more colors to the game. 
And that is great, at least for me.

I really advise everyone to get this version, it's still way better than BL3 for me."
11194,fun game but for some reason it keeps freezing when i load into my character and even when i make a new character so i am re-downloading it to hopefully fix it. however besides that so far iv enjoyed playing this game.
11195,"yes

11198,its great
11199,amazing under apritiatide game for 2012 its amazing stil holds up in 2021 the gameplay and mechanick are not on par as borderlands 3 but it has a way  better story that its sequel it can be stupid funny and the next can be serius and real people in this land being murderd and is hard making a living and the  and the handsome collection is under 20 dollars and give you  all dlc and the pre-quel game wich is worh it so 9.9/10 game becaus i belive no game is perfect but compare to other fps action rpg its devenitley the cream of the crop  so i do recomed buying this game or the handsome collection
11200,"I think this game has aged pretty well, Although I think I remembered it better in nostalgia than I found it playing it again all these years later, There's plenty of content and the looting and combat is fun, Especially with friends but if you are playing alone this game can become very tedious. The writing really shines in this one, Especially next to current games who are afraid to take risks and push the boat out. The humour is good and they aren't afraid to balance that with deep or dark moments in the story that can hit you in the feels. It does suffer from some dated elements, the improvements that we were spoiled by in the third instalment were missed, Like the fast travelling or independent loot systems. I would recommend this to people wanting to do nostalgia runs with their friends, or first timers who have never played this classic. But if you are thinking of revisiting it alone, Let it stay in the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia. 7.5/10"

11219,"funny story, meaningful character development behind all of the funny jokes, The jokes, Loottopia, Locations, one of the best season passes money can buy."
11220,"Popularly rated the best out of the Borderlands series and it does not disappoint.
The guns feel and play amazing, and work well with the abilities your characters can get.
This game is especially fun in Online Co-Op mode with some friends.
The ""Borderlands humour"" can get tiring at times but if this is your first Borderlands game you'll find it funny.
The only criticism I'd give it is the inclusion of SHIFT and the Keys system. The publisher is clearly trying to get people onto their SHIFT platform by giving away free OP weapons if you sign up to their platform and it really sucks to have to sign up for an extra service just to feel powerful, but that's a minor nitpick."

11248,"Target age for the humour has doubled compared to the first game (from 7 to 14), game design decisions and QoL improvements massively improve the play experience.

Stellar antagonist, interesting gunplay, fun characters, meaningful intra-class talents and playstyles, DLC is hit-or-miss, but when it hits (Tina/Moxxi) it HITS.

B1 was in an uncanny valley between RPG and FPS. 
B2 could use a heavier RPG influence, but overall, is perfectly fine.

BEWARE: Devs are not always kind to solo players or respectful to mechanics like Gaige's Anarchy (ex: spawning a boss in your face)."
11249,"Ever wanted to beat the shit out of some psychos with an buzz-saw on a stick?

Yeah me too. This game is for you."
11250,"Easily one of the best games ever made. The gameplay is great (although the grinding can become tedious after a few hundred hours), the gun diversity is awesome and unlike anything else, the characters are all very likeable (specially the villain) and the story is pretty neat. If you play it with friends, you can easily dump many many hours every single day and not get bored. An absolutely must have"

11255,"A very late review for an older title, but as I download it again, I have to say that  BL2 is the best Borderlands experience. BL1, the Pre-Sequel, BL3, and even the Telltale take on it in ""Tales from the Borderlands"" are all worth your time (and gives some amusing context to the events of BL3). But BL2 is the king if you like the looter/shooter genre."

11259,Its cool.

11261,"A classic. Game still holds up very well, mostly because of good writing and carefully crafted gameplay loop. It's kinda funny to play it after B3 with many quality of life features missing, nevertheless it's still fun. Story never gets old, there are at least 4 classes to play, tons of side missions, hundreds of weapons and with all DLC there is enough content to play for 200+ hours.

Must have to pick as part of Handsome Collection that includes all DLC, it goes on sale quite often."
11262,"Very fun





















Would recommend

11264,"I cannot recommend this game highly enough, it was actually the very first game I ever pre-ordered back in my XBOX-360 days. Between the six playable characters, three playthroughs with increasing difficulty, Over Power levels, Badass Ranks, the plethora of side-quests, DLC content and mods available online, you will never truly become bored of this game. Make sure you have some friends to play this game with, because it only enhances the chaos that is Borderlands 2. Speaking of enhancing, make sure you grab the UCP or BL2 Reborn mod, both of which aim to fix the handful of issues with the base game (BL2 Reborn is a modpack, and already includes the UCP). Another mod that I cannot recommend highly enough is the Enemy Multiplier mod, because why wouldn't you want to fight up to 4x the amount of enemies in the base game?
The only downside to the game is that is can get very grindy, and some skills do not quite shine when you get to your UVHM or OP levels. Both of these problems are fixed by the previously mentioned mods."
11265,BRO DEAD ASS THE BEST GAME EVER NGL BEST BEEN PLAYING SINCE LIKE I WAS 9 BRO ITS TOO GOOD TOO MISS
11266,"Probably one of the best FPS of all time. You can replay Borderlands 2 over and over again  with different experiences. Borderlands 1 and 2 are better than Borderlands 3, so invest in Borderlands 2 and its DLC.
Borderlands 2 is easy to learn and fun to play."
11267,"Good times, even with claptrap!"
11268,"Borderlands 2 is an amazingly fun, fast paced shooter that will blast its way deep into your heart with it's lovable cast of wacky and diverse characters to it's cell shaded art style, It's a game that's equal parts charming and bloody. The main selling point to the Borderlands series is the loot system which brings millions of variations of guns, grenades and shields to keep things interesting, bring massive damage however you want. I highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a good fast paced RPG shooter!"
11269,I loved this game when it came out 9 years ago and I still love it. A timeless nostalgic game that will always stand the test of time.
11270,Good game.
11271,"Play with friends.
My go-to game to shoot the shit while shooting shit."
11272,Not bad. Fun with friends.
11273,"Borderlands 2, is well, Borderlands 2. It really is peak Borderlands, with a perfect mix of fun gunplay, witty writing, and engaging story telling. This is peak Borderlands and 2K will probably never replicate it (judging by how Borderlands 3 came out, I really believe in this idea). Such a fun game, such amazing DLC, everything is great. Just buy it when on sale and make sure it isn't the base edition."
11274,Amazing game can't stop playing this over and over again . The siren is my all time favourite character although they are all good . Storyline is just brilliant . Claptrap is funny although wish I could kill him at times .😂. No bad things I can say about this game . Best looter shooter game ever !!!!!!!!! 👍💖
11275,"ive played this game ever since it first came out. this is one of the very few games i havent really gotten bored of after a couple hundred hours. after dumping thousands of hours into this game over my time playing it over the xbox 360, ps3, ps4 and now finally the pc, i can still say that i still thoroughly enjoy playing this game. i have gotten many people to play this game and enjoy this game along with me. borderlands 1 was my childhood and borderlands 2 didnt live to dissapoint. if you havent played this game before and are looking at the reveiws, please heed my advice and give this game a try."

11332,"Across multiple platforms  I have hundreds of hours in all the borderlands franchise and this game was my introduction to the series. 

A perfect blend of fast paced first person shooter action alongside a truly funny and enjoyable story with what  I would consider one of the most memorable villains of all time. The grind for gear can be a little obnoxious but ultimately that is the point of a looter shooter and I cannot begrudge the game this at all.

9/10"
11333,"Buy the big one

10/10"
11334,"10/10 gameplay and story.  word of advice, if you are playing for the first time do NOT use Gaige.  she's a glass cannon.  she can deal insane amounts of damage, but is easily knocked down.  Krieg is a solid choice, because he's an absolute tank at higher levels.  beware the loaders."
11335,"The BEST Borderlands in my opinion ! The story was great and the DLC's were amazing , i had fun playing all the jobs and trying new builds , and the Tiny Tina DLC ? Is one of the best DLC's i have ever seen , the amount of playtime you get , the humor in it and insane intensity you get is worth all the money ! If you need something to do ... and want some fun i can would Recommend this game anytime !"
11336,Awesome game
11337,Best game ever
11338,"gets boring after a while but when it doesnt, its really fun"
11339,Same thing over and over agin
11340,i liked every thing
11341,"If you are buying this, PLEASE buy the Handsome Jack Collection. It is far cheaper and includes all the DLC. 

This game is iconic. Legendary, even. That is not for a lack of reasons, either.
Potentially one of the greatest co-op shooters of all time, and the founding father of the looter shooter genre. This game is a blast, and has aged pretty well. Grab some friends or go it solo, and you have hundreds of hours of fun content ahead of you, with multiple playthroughs supported. 

For those more savvy, I highly recommend looking into the UCP, or Universal Community Patch for this game. it brings a fresh experience and heaps of much needed Quality of Life improvements to the game."
11342,Still one of the best games I've ever played.  Endless amounts of fun!  Can't get enough!
11343,"It appears as though this game is specifically designed for co-op. 
It is outright hostile to solo player... jumping from:
insane-over-the-top difficult-kill-you-in-two-shots bosses... or there-is-literally-no-possible-way-to-win-this-at-your-level (3 levels above bosses) on missions marked as ""Trivial"".... 
to:
this-is-so-easy-it-just-is-not-fun... with about a 20 minute window of really, REALLY good, fun gameplay in between these to overwhelmingly frustrating times. 

If you're going to be playing co-op, this is a great game. 
Or; 
If you don't mind grinding for several hours to get the levels you need to just beat a single boss (You'll need to be at least 5 levels above), then this is a great game. 

I play solo, and in the end the hilarity and enjoyment of the characters and missions was utterly obliterated by the horrendously bad balancing of the game. 
It got to a point where no part of the game was fun, because I knew that just around the corner was another hours-long grind just to get past some idiotically OP boss.

Very much regret the purchase.
This could have been so much better."
11344,THIS IS A FUN GAME WITH A GOOD STORY I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
11345,"amazing graphics amazing everything def reccomend for anyone
"
11346,100% BEST GAME EVER
11347,Fun game :)
11348,"Amazing game, Amazing Franchise top 3 game franchises for the rest of my life."
11349,"Pretty good. Net code is trash
"
11350,"Loved this game as a kid, got it on pc to play with friends.  Online play just doesn't work, if you try to go online it just puts you in a frozen ""trying to connect"" loop. The fact that this version of the game has the multiplayer and co-op tag honestly feels like false advertising. I can't recommend this game in single player, most of the fun is playing with friends.  Hopefully they fix it but I doubt it.  Feels like they just don't want people to play it anymore."
11351,This is a great story game with nice graphics. I enjoy the main missions as well as the side ones.
11352,Game
11353,"If it gets too warm and you don't want to spend money on an A/C, just play this game in multiplayer! It freezes all the time."

11368,"fgbcvdnx fgbcvdn gtfhbnvc ghytfjuv nufgtvyhj yygujikh
"
11369,"I played a few hours of the original Borderlands game when it came out, decided I hated it and ignored everything about this game since. So it was only when I saw this on sale with a ton of DLC included and I was looking for something different that I finally decided to give this franchise another go. 

I am glad I did as so far this game has turned out to be one of the more enjoyable games I have played. It doesn't take itself seriously and is full of good humour and interesting (silly) characters with an okay story to follow along with too. Levels are well designed and as someone who can admittedly be a bit... dumb, at least when it comes to understanding what a game wants from me, I found this easy to understand and was never confused about where I was headed to or what my objective was. 

The gun play is also a lot of fun, well mostly anyway. Some characters do get a bit monotonous to deal with but I spent a lot of my time using the various shotguns or sniper rifles and both can be really satisfying in the right situations. 

I have yet to finish this game but I am pretty sure I will do so or at least get close to it before I get bored, so for what you can pick it up for these days it is definitely worth a buy as you are sure to get a good few hours entertainment out of it."
11370,great story and tons of replay value

11395,"I have 128 hours on steam, hundreds more on Xbox, it's a fun game with friends, but the grind is where you'll lose them, they're either in or they're out, no inbeetween and with the mountains of content they've added at the end of it's life cycle there is suddenly an even larger gap to grind for, stay at level 80, I think it's the perfect place to stop where strategies aren't too stupid to do without monster amounts of grind. 

Don't get this if you aren't into a grind, Jack carries the story and that is 1/1000th of the 'actual game' of this game. It's about grinding for 100 hours to do the same grind .5% faster so you can do a boss 1.5% faster. I'm shaky on a reccomendation to the average person but there's genuinely a ton of content here and they've made doing certain grinds better, but not great, there's still problems with quest rewards not being obtainable more than once, which is an issue when they're some of the best items in the entire game, and more issues with scaling. Seemingly the developers knowing full well the direction of their game forgot to account for it. 

I really don't mean to sound negative but like with all grind games when you've spent 1000 hours placing your head against a sharpening stone and seeing how much it's reduced in size you're going to be a little pissed that you're bleeding."
11396,LOOOOOOOOT
11397,"Handsome Jack? More like Handsome Daddy. 

Cool story, cool graphics, cool gameplay and really cool characters.

Totally recomended!"

11401,Just play it lol
11402,"This has been a very fun game to play, loved the graphics, gameplay and story. Enough DLC content to keep you occupied and involved for hours. The co-op aspect makes the game even more enjoyable. The Loot RnG is not that great though and can be a pain in some scenarios but with the availability of the community and tools for it, one can get past that and enjoy."
11403,Good game.
11404,Great looter shooter. I recommend playing with friends. Worth the money!
11405,too much grind
11406,just buy it already
11407,A lot of relaxing fun. I am 74 and only play single player.
11408,good

11411,One of the greatest games and DLC offerings ever created.
11412,Still holds up after all these years
11413,"game fun, game funi"
11414,"Some cons:
- Guns and skills are good but aren't very exciting. Maya is just all right by the end of the game while Lilith was Death reincarnated.
- Some bad map designs. It can get confusing as f*** where you're supposed to go. And there's too much walking/backtracking sim between shooting games.
- Some quest objectives are unclear. And I particularly hate that f***ing quest where you have to listen to grandma yapping on and on and on.
- Some monster-type enemies can be tedious to fight.

All in all, it's bigger but not always better than Borderlands 1. At least it's cheap on sale."
11415,very fun
11416,"This game looks great and all, but. Being realistic.

This is as grindy or even more grindy than destiny 2 multiplayer.
The weapons feel like if all of them had ""erectile dysfunction"" in a way.
How can a shooter be fun if weapons feel like doodoo ? IDK, I guess people like the game for the characters and not so much the shooty shooty part."
11417,"fun game, lots of different ways to play it and more fun with friends. Story is probably best out of any in the borderlands series and gameplay is interesting."
11418,Amazing!
11419,Good Game and Challanging
11420,Super fun
11421,really fun

11436,"Well, for me this game is a one of a kind. Enjoyed the whole thing (3rd part felt a bit weak, but still)."
11437,good game to play with friends
11438,"Borderlands 2 stands apart as perhaps the greatest looter-shooter of all time. The game has a wild personality, one of greatest video game villains of all time, killer co-op multiplayer, and very generous and rewarding loot drops. 

From a story standpoint, the game is surprisingly epic and compelling, bringing back the playable characters from the original Borderlands as NPCs, and cool ones at that. The wacky, satirical tone is broken up by some dark moments that help ground the game, and push you to want to destroy the villain even more. 

Virtually every element of gameplay has been improved upon since the first game. Combat is tighter, the enemies are smarter, the first hour of the game is much faster paced (though still drags a bit), and the leveling up system is much deeper. NPCs have specific quest dialogue instead of a couple generic lines with a text box explaining the quest. Most of the character abilities are better and easier to use than in the original.

The amount of content in the game is staggering. Besides the main game (which is lengthy and interesting in its own right) you have a variety of paid DLCs and seasonal Free-LCs. Most of which are great and challenging, even for end game players. After you're done with the game, you can play it on True Vault Hunter mode for and extra challenge and better gear. Think of Diablo 3's replay system, but good.

Some systems in the game have not aged well, and playing Borderlands 3, then returning to 2 have demonstrated this. First, the gunplay is a bit archaic. It doesn't feel as good as once it did. The entertaining guns make up for this, but bear in mind that the mechanisms may seem cumbersome if you're not used to it. Second, the classes are really not equal. The Commando, Siren, and Mechromancer have great powers. The Assassin, Gunzerker, and Psycho are much harder to use. 

If you're a fan of games like Destiny or Division but wish the story was more accessible and the loot drops were better, this game would be a great fit. If you prefer somber, serious games or get frustrated over a lack of modern, tight controls, this could be a struggle to play for the first few hours."
11439,"haven't gone too far through the game but so far it's really good, worth it to buy! :3"

11480,"10/10

Always been one of my favourites. Absolute classic. 
Unique art style, humour and design of the borderlands series is simply just awesome. 
Borderlands 2 I would argue is the best in the series, even being outdated compared to newer titles. 
Story still holds up, hilarious, brutal and excellent. 
Combat is a load of fun, characters are great. Hell of a good way to kill some time, great endgame content and raid bosses. Character progression depth is extensive and very unique per character, presenting multiple unique play styles with various advantages and weaknesses. Endless loot, guns etc, huge variation in stats and attachments allows for good farming at end game. 
Have returned across platforms over and over as it is simply just an excellent game. 
Would highly recommend to all."

Having the context of the first, knowing how that played out, makes this game all the more satisfying. I've only started on one set of the DLC so far, but that's really well done as far as i've seen too.
There's a lot of interesting backstory that comes up as well, for the main four characters. I'd love to know of Gaige and Krieg as well, admittedly--as they dont have any known backstory, it'd  give more reason to delve into their own reasons for being vault hunters.
Either way, the game plays really well despite being a bit older. It's a lot fresher than the first. I managed to play through this alone, but I'd suggest getting some friends to help out. That'll make things interesting."
11504,"Played many times on various systems, great game even better as co-op."
11505,I played this just for the cartoon style game. Just an overall fun shooter-looter with a unique charm. Pretty dark sense of humor. Love it
11506,yes
11507,"No other loot-based shooter has been able to top this game, I'd easily go back and play this before even looking at 3 again."
11508,Yes
11509,it's borderlands
11510,"Face Mc Shooty go brrrrr
"
11511,"I haven't play BL3. I consider that BL1 is better than BL2, nonetheless BL2 is a great game. You can have lots of fun by developing all the characters. BL2 is a must play shooter game."
11512,
11513,19 hours into the game 19th level on 1st character... If you are looking for something to suck you in balls deep - that is it.
11514,Gud game
11515,"Loot, Loot, Loot Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot

also there is a quest just to shoot a guy in the face"
11516,Pretty dark sense of humor. Love it.
11517,yup
11518,its a decant game id say ive beat it like 3 times
11519,There seems to be a known issue where this game stops saving your progress on PC. I have tried several online recommendations as well as 2Ks recommendation of playing with the local/cloud save settings. Really annoying there doesn't seem to be an actual solution for this. I wouldn't waste your time or money.
11520,"Work's perfectly on a M1 Macbook Air (16 GB)! Highly Recommend. 

10/10."
11521,There is a gun that screams at you.
11522,Best game ever hands down
11523,fun
11524,"Fun With Friends

Not a huge fan of Borderlands, but if you're looking to relax with some friends and go on ridiculous adventures.
Its Perfect.

Edit: Lots of kills can sometimes be boring"
11525,"A great FPS game to play with friends, the ability to save edit an online multiplayer game just adds that delicious factor of not having to grind if you don't want to."
11526,"fun looter shooter 11/10 
xd buy it play it if you already dont."
11527,2021 and still a good game. recommend for everyone
11528,"Re-playable. Plenty of content. If the player can get past the ART STYLE (Unreal ENGINE Graphics), which I happen to love, then the game is absolutely awesome."
11529,will play this till i die
11530,Game just like fortnite!
11531,"Just see the ""ALL REVIEWS"" section."
11532,love it when your friends forget your playthrough half way into it
11533,best looter shooter game ever played!
11534,It's an Action Adventure Shooter RPG
11535,GOOD GAME
11536,Played these games over and over through the years.
11537,amazing
11538,Fun game. Now that's epic
11539,shoot gun
11540,In the words of this game: shitty.
11541,epic.
11542,"good
"
11543,"scumbags decided to rip content out of prior dlc, slap it onto the new dlc, and then have the audacity to demand I buy the new dlc to get back the feature I already fucking paid for
nice one greedbox, go fuck yourselves"
11544,everything :)
11545,"Great game with amazing story and characters. Pretty good and fun combat, although a bit outdated.

Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina is btw, also some of my most loved video game characters."
11546,a very fun and immersive game that you can play with your friends!
11547,its not bad
11548,its borderlands need i say more
11549,it good game
11550,I've really enjoyed playing this game over the years. I'd like to see a another version .
11551,"I love this game, but have been experiencing crashes and fatal errors, but can't get any satisfaction from Steam or Gearbox.  Disappointed."
11552,
11553,good game
11554,"Fun. Shoot shoot, kill kill. Fun fun fun. Have you played it yet? Did I mention that it's fun? And you kill things by shooting them for the most part, unless you run them over in a vehicle? If you don't think that killing things by shooting them is fun, this is not the game for you so don't play it. But then you probably aren't even looking at these reviews.

I could say some more blah blah blah I love the graphics, the storyline, continuity and lack thereof from Borderlands 1, the fact that there are additional games to play when I finally finish this one, etc. But other people have written that kind of stuff. There is a lot of depth, a lot of challenge, it looks great, and it's great fun. If you want a Really Serious Game, well keep going, I guess. If you want to have fun with some good content, go for it, I say."
11555,Very much fun and funny and epic
11556,WOOOOHOOOOOO THIS IS AN EPIC!!!!! YEEEEEEEE OH MY OGOOOD!!!!!!!!!!
11557,Roblox porn is worse
11558,gud gam
11559,amazing
11560,yes
11561,warning this game is too immature for anyone under 30. Made by retards might be contagious .
11562,"This game is gem. Please dont have any doubt to purchase this gem. Bought in end 2019 and  still currently playing. This year i bought all dlcs. Worth every cents. Community is still active and very pleasent and helpful. Fun, action packed, funny, a bit gory and explosioooooooooon! fun to play with friends. my first fps played fully with controller. Love this 10 year old game. The graphic style is timeless."
11563,yes i like
11564,"fun. hate the level scaling and the fact that you literally do less damage to higher level enemies, not they have more health, the damage you deal is less than what your gun/skills should output. other than that its good."
11565,grind fun
11566,i was afk playing this and have no missions completed
11567,its awesome just play it
11568,very fun

11578,VERY GUD GAme
11579,"A nostalgic timepiece that ultimately prodded my love for FPS games from a early point on in my childhood. Have, and will play over and over again for sure."
11580,groot game

11585,"its cool
"
11586,very fun with friends
11587,Vruh.
11588,yes
11589,"Good game
"
11590,"The game is fun. No doubt about it. And the game has aged super well. However, I still won't reccomend this for 2 reasons.
1. Borderlands 3 is a huge upgrade. Like you could buy both if you want to, but if it's one it's going to be B3
2. The formula has been revisited again and yet again in several modern titles. You could choose this for some comedy-packed action but I really think the previous option to be better.

Solid play though! The game still doesn't feel old and is great investment any day!"
11591,"This part has got under my skin the most. Borderlands combines the best of FPS with the best of RPG which provides a very significant adventure with hours of gameplay, complemented by sarcastic humor. Even if you have already passed through the area, you can return to explore it again or gain experience, this gives it much more replayability."
11592,"quality game, the borderlands series are both funny and immersive with quality combat and looting"
11593,a really fun game
11594,Ooooo
11595,this stay fun ! :D
11596,boring dialogues and shooting is also boring
11597,Pog
11598,epic
11599,i like it

11609,I liked the guns
11610,very gud
11611,"Funny robot says ""sphincter"""
11612,It is a good game
11613,"This game is as good as a looter-shooter can get, humour is funny, guns are cool, Jakobs is a thing, really good characters (except from claptrap), one of the best villains in game history, all dlc is good, Tiny Tina, has a strong story but most importantly...Mr. Tourgue! 9.8/10"
11614,Is gud
11615,"One of my all-time favorites.
Absolutely amazing game and gameplay.
I especially like the character Krieg from the DLC who has a very unique gameplay.
Basically you try to set yourself on fire at the beginning of a fight because he has certain skills that give boni while you are burning.
And the story is waaaay better than in BL3."
11616,NOICE
11617,no
11618,Better Story than 3.
11619,best game
11620,Great Game! Probably best in the series. 8/10.
11621,.
11622,more
11623,Play until you get to the Minecraft easter egg and then you can stop. This product holds no further value to you after that.
11624,Good
11625,"(yes my playtime is low on this account but I've played this game completely on multiple consoles) I really really really do cherish this game, its one of my favorite games of all times, and if you're playin' co-op its even better when you can fuck around with someone while you're doing missions!"
11626,Great game
11627,"Amazing gameplay, great story, and lots of fun characters to play as and just as many if not more ways to play each character"
11628,mkmkmm      m m mk
11629,this game is very fun lots of stuff to do lots of weapons cool skins for the characters
11630,Borderlands 3 = burn it. Borderlands 3 dlcs = fair. Borderlands 2 + 1 (inc. dlcs) = Best games in the series. Fun games
11631,"I definitely recommend this game to anyone. It has great humor, great story-line, tons of guns/action/graphics are decent. Overall great game 9.5/10"
11632,good
11633,Very fun 10/10 timeless classic.
11634,duh
11635,great game
11636,fun
11637,"I like it having gotten up to level 18, online is pretty good however drop outs with connection are not the best.
Be sure to search online for shift codes and sign up to the server as you will get tons of free skeleton keys, not the best weapons I find but keep you at a level that requires less grinding for XP, I enjoy it most when completing missions, but I do grind when i have less time to play, it varied game play styles make it an easy game to return to, also the writing and characters in this game are really great, the level of detail applied to story and characters and environments is truly epic."
11638,Great Game! Love the shooting & the Mad Max style that the game has. 10/10
11639,"Ehh, it's okay."
11640,Great
11641,Greatest game of all time
11642,"Its Borderlands 2, what else is there to say? Better then 3, least I can farm for a weapon in 2 and not have it become useless in a week cause of some stupid anointment or weapon nerf"
11643,Fantastic game all around
11644,mum's milk
11645,I have played all 5 Borderlands and I think 2 is the best out of all of them. Borderlands 3 was released on the 13th of September 2019 and that was only 2 years ago but Borderlands 2 was released 18th of September 2012 and back then the graphics were not as good but I'm more of the story line first person and I through it was amazing and it fit so well with the first one which was released on the 20th of October 2009. I really would love other people to play it and it would make me happy and the other people who made it. And if your not really feeling the vibe there is a Borderlands movie coming out in 2022
11646,still one of the best games of the decade
11647,"The best Borderlands game. 'Nough said. 9/10

For completionists, it's not worth the time sink unless you like the game."
11648,very fun
11649,"THE BEST LOOTER SHOOTER HANDS DOWN. Combat is awesome, RPG elements give you freedom, story is awesome and Handsome Jack more handsome than always. This game is still worth playing after Borderlands 3."
11650,excellent game
11651,"it's borderlands 2. it's fun. if you haven't heard of it by now, keep walking!"
11652,Great story 10/10
11653,Good game
11654,bad game
11655,Looter Shooter worth checking out always fun to make dumb builds in every character.
11656,good game
11657,"If you can make Jack mad, you've already won the game."
11658,"[h1] [b] very COOL game [/b] [/h1]
nice game base physics and jokes 
i bought the collection so i had all of dlc
dlc doesnt actuallly effect at the whole game expect some story dlcs

11664,guns
11665,very good game i have fun with my friends
11666,humor got me hooked
11667,"I'm terrible at shooters but decided to buy this game anyway. While I initially felt overwhelmed by the fast paced combat and was frustrated by continually dying, I found it very immersive and became thoroughly obsessed with leveling my character and acquiring new skills and gear. I honestly never thought I'd enjoy the genre due to my inexperience and inaptitude with regard to combat heavy games, but am finding myself compelled to play it every single day to the exclusion of all other games in my library."
11668,fresh
11669,"If anyone want tó play The game ín coop,add me (I am quite beginner)"
11670,The Best Game.
11671,"One of my favourite story games out there
The characters are so lovable and memorable 
Handsome jack is one of the best video game villains hands down.
The gun play is so fun along with all the different ways you can farm the items its just really splendid

10/10 no questions asked"
11672,"pick up cool gun shoot guy, very good!"
11673,"Good game, logistics can be a bit to figure out the lore and logic behind the game, but once you understand that, like everything else its easy to play. I've enjoyed the game, its even better with friends (upto 4 cross-plat multiplayer). Recommended."
11674,BADASSSSSS
11675,"Don’t let my hours deceive you, this is the second time I’ve bought this game. The first was on XBox 360.
Borderlands 2 is a magical world with an annoying robot (with a god complex) and 100s of unique guns. The story is actually quite good and the boss fights are awesome too. Excluding the Fight for Sanctuary, all of the DLC content was fun. It introduced new weapons, shields, BOOM, and a Handome Sorceror. What more could you want?
The main game was amazing as well, with plenty of great side quests and an easy to follow story. The game has charm, a charm I believe BL3 lacks in comparison.
That’s all folks. Buy the Handsome Collection when it rolls around and I guarantee you will get you money’s worth."
11676,I don't know whether to praise the game for being incredible or bash it for being the reason looter shooters are so prolific
11677,Guns.
11678,is good
11679,.
11680,"Really fun game, specially with friends"
11681,"Good game, great story and lots of fun."
11682,"Very good!

Had to stop playing quite a few times to catch my breath because I was dying of laughter"
11683,good game lol
11684,"If I Could Also Include The Time I Invested Into This Game I Got From Playing On Console, Then Total Play Time Would Be Much, Much Higher. The Only Thing I Can Say Though Is, Yes, Please Play This Game. Play The Other Games As Well. I Recommend Also, Playing With Friends. It's A Lot Of Fun."

11693,"very good

11694,Yes
11695,excellent game a little difficult at first though.
11696,"This is easily my comfort game, its so relaxing to just grind and farm for better loot"

11705,"great game replayable and really good dlc
"
11706,Good game
11707,"[Edit for clarification: I still recommend this game as all Borderlands games are worth a try if you are into shooter looter genre but still thumbed down the game due to poor performance in customer service on the part of GearBox.]

I returned to BL2 after about 2 years not playing any video games or following any video games news. Suddenly I can no longer access OP difficulties unless I pay some more to buy the last DLC. In case no one remembers, OP difficulties (up to OP8) has been unlocked via the purchase of several previous DLCs. 

So now, after buying their products, GearBox suddenly say that said products are no longer available UNLESS you pay some more money. That is just conduct of business in pure bad faith."
11708,shoot gun good
11709,the action is a bit harder with akeyboard but xbox controller works great. Its got a good challenge in it but can be taken over if you push. Its great at times killing a boss with just a few shells left
11710,Masterpiece
11711,"Turns out ""The Vault"" is the friends we made along the way. Gay."
11712,"Borderlands 2 is a continuation of the start of one of my favorite Series'. Loved all the new gameplay, characters and of course all the glorious dopamine releasing loots! 9/10 recommend! Oh, get you co-op group to play this with for more fun times."
11713,Yup
11714,"The first and best Borderlands game I have played. Endless hours of fun, especially with modding."
11715,da
11716,I played Border Lands 1 as a kid and loved it but i mostly played it with friends and didnt get as much out of the storyline. However the storyline and quality of characters in borderlands 2 is superior to 1 and as ive heard the third one to but i havent played that. This is just the chaos i needed in my life.
11717,real good game but keeps stoping
11718,"I've played Borderlands 2 alone for about a year or so and eventually lost interest due to repetitive gameplay. I do, however, recommend Borderlands 2 if you have friends to play with. Well, that and you haven't replayed it about four times now."
11719,neat
11720,"Great game play, great story, great humor.  I've played it over ten times with various characters.  Different game each time."
11721,Its like its 2012 again!  Love the humour and references!  Great soundtrack!  Having a jolly good time with this game!

11733,"Game ini memiliki banyak sekali aspek yang dapat membuat kita rela menghabiskan waktu lama memainkannya. Aku cukup senang dengan konsep tembak-tembakan, pemilihan gear, skill tree, dan mission yang disajikan melalui game ini."
11734,"does nothing but waste your time. run to the diamond on your map, shoot some bullet sponges, stare at the floor comparing stats, repeat this 5-30 minute cycle for the duration of your play session. this experience is not improved by co-op. could be better if it weren't all filler. you have to play for tens of hours before your build actually starts to take shape. gun variety is horrid in the early game, you will find 90% handguns."

11754,.
11755,My favorite game of all time.
11756,very nice
11757,Is good.
11758,"Never played a better game in my life. Love the easter eggs, the gameplay, the multiple ways you can hack the game or just play it by the book. 

I've spend days (~500 hours) trying to reach the max level, getting all points, all challenges, experimenting different scenarios and so on. I don't do it for all games, as I consider myself as an hardcode gamer with lots of expectations.

You don't have to love that game to that point, but I bet it's gonna age well, and I'll probably play it again some day, little older, little wiser."
11759,"This game is a decade old and somehow still the best of its kind. I always thought that this game was overhyped in the past but after trying it out, I'm hooked immediately. The art style is ageless and gorgeous, the combat is slick and fun. The DLCs are also packed with contents and totally worth their price.
Aside from some frustrating questionable level designs this game is a straight 10/10."
11760,i enjoy the whole game no reason not to it good buy right now
11761,Good game. Lots of content to those who can't get enough.
11762,"I'm new to Borderlands and tried this thanks to the sale. Glad I did! This is one of the most funnest FPS I've ever played. Tons of weapons, loot and non stop shoot outs. Everything about this game is a blast. From the weapons, art style, sound FX and music is great. The icing on the cake are the enemy personalities; they make the battle twice as fun!  Looking forward to Borderlands 3! Awesome game and non stop fun!"
11763,"Wow, I can't believe I never left a review of BL2.

So, what's there to say?  It was a blast.  The story is pretty decent.  The gameplay is solid.  The RPG-ish mechanics of the entire game itself, bravo.  The challenge isn't too bad either, because enemy units have nearly perfect accuracy at all times, lol.  There are tons of weapons, armors.  There are ways to make yourself so ridiculously powerful that you can kill raid bosses solo, if you understand the mechanics.

The only thing I've never been a fan of in BL2 is basically the requirement of slag in early UVHM.  It makes it very monotonous to constantly use a slag weapon to debuff and switch to something more damaging.  Of course, you can progress to the point where you don't have to, but initially, it's annoying.

All in all, I would definitely recommend BL2, even if you haven't played any other Borderlands."

11768,"Great game for FPS players, rewarding gameplay, relatively easy but with some good boss fights thrown in. Only big criticism is the need to fight over areas already cleared by the player. This does become frustrating as it is done for many missions."

11770,"I missed out on Borderlands 2 when it first came out; I was a teenager at the time and my view of games was that they had to be hyper-realistic and super gritty to be worth playing.
I wish I could go back and beat myself for missing this gem. 
*This review is written from the perspective of someone who played solo*

The game is incredibly fun to play and offers enough build diversity between its 7 characters that they each have multiple ways to play them--for instance, you can play the Siren as the group healer with a focus on buffs, or with a focus on completely *decimating* enemies  with elemental damage, or with a focus on Critical Hits and controlling the flow of the battle, or just pick whatever you like from each tree for a custom build--and that's just one character; I've been playing for 200+ hours and haven't touched the others. 

Yes, I said 200+ hours. 
The wealth of content in this game is ridiculous. 
There are hundreds of side-quests and objectives to do, as well as bosses that can be farmed for the best loot--meaning that you'll have your hands full just deciding where to start. 
As noted above, while this game can be beaten causally, it is a loot game at the end of the day, not unlike 'Diablo', meaning that you'll have the option to farm bosses for better loot over and over. If that gameplay loop doesn't appeal to you, you may not enjoy this as much as I am.   

Now for some negatives :
People say the story's good, and I'd like to dispute that--the story itself is just kind of....there. 
The characters--especially the antagonist, Handsome Jack--are what really carry the story along; they're all so colorful and fun and mostly a joy to be around, even if most of them devolve into quest givers about halfway through the story.

The gun-play hasn't exactly aged well at all, and mostly feels lacking in impact and any real force, but wasn't too much of a bother to me personally, since I love older FPS games which also tend to have that problem.

The humor is very much a product of its time and can be a bit grating since ""its time"" was the era of reference humor and LOL XD-type material.
Having grown up with that though, I actually enjoyed quite a few of the references and it kind of reminded me of a simpler time.

Personally, I'm a big fan of this game and heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a good time."

11804,"More boring than the first game. I kept hearing people hype up Handsome Jack as this big bad villain for years before I played the game, then when you finally get to his boss battle he doesn't even get a proper cutscene. Not sure what people see in this series, but more power to them."
11805,"Well worth the money including for the doc's  I have 255 hours logged in this game and can tell where every weapon is every shield drops to how to stack your characters.  

People in the past complained of there now charging for a free dlc  but that was a promotion if you caught it in time.

Commanderlilth was worth the money.  You get some crazy new weapons and bosses to fight.  

Not to mention the rainbow weapons.  

So don't take there advice an not buy it do take my in consideration as I happen to stream a lot of games not always on steam but games are worth it."

11815,"Ah, Borderlands 2. I've played through the game countless times, originally on the 360 and then many times more. It's a good game--nay, a great game--to play by yourself; great writing, interactive gameplay, and arguably gaming's best antagonist all make for an extremely compelling experience...yet where it shines the most is when you're playing it with a friend (or 3!), having fun, looking at loot, shooting guys, meleeing guys, oh god kreig went in and died, good thing I have Maya's revive phaselock, oh now Zer0's dead too, well Krieg has the instant revive but downed himself again, but at least I have phaselock again...oh look that's a 10k rocket launcher, looking forward to having that on my fourth weapon slot for the next three hours. 

Hundreds of hours of content, great missions, great experience, and borderlands and the quintessential looter-shooter at its finest. 3's gunplay is probably objectively better, but the raw experience of playing 2--the writing, the level design, the pacing--all make for a more enjoyable experience. It's got some odd timings for DLC, and if you do ALL the sidequests you'll be painfully overleveled and the game is a cakewalk, but if you just chug along the main story (and do some side quests on the way that tickle your fancy), it'll be an engaging experience all the way through the end. And then you can do it again! And again. ...And again, but don't bother with that time."

11822,Used to be able to hit level 80 and do overpower levels. Now level 80 is in a DLC and I can't go past level 72. I also can't do overpower levels despite having the ultimate vault hunter DLC. I have tried to complete digistruct peak on my level 72 zer0 and it tells me I have to be level 80 to gain any overpower levels... Don't play until they give commander lilith dlc for free forever.

11827,"My friend got me into this game for the story and lore. I have never seen a story more connected and thought out across 1, 2, Pre-Sequel and Tales. Shooting is definitely dated, but it actually gets better as you play. The Borderlands story is a modern day Don Quixote"
11828,AAA

11835,"Very reluctant yes, its still a fun game, and the story is still fantastic, but gameplay wise its kinda aged compared to BL3."
11836,"This game is a classic shooter. Gunplay can feel outdated by modern shooter standards, but it still runs great and feels fun to play. I cant speak much for the story because my brain turns off when any character opens their mouth. I would only recommend this if you get the Game of the Year edition with more mission DLCs because the main story ends pretty abruptly. Definitely worth a play for the uninitiated to the series."
11837,"I think i'm the only person who thinks this game is just fucking boring
the combat is just outdated and stale."
11838,"Fantastic game since the last time I played on the xbox 360 like 7 years ago.. Even completing he camapaign before, I never got bored cuz this game is just that amazing. Definitely play this if you're a fan of open-world, fps, and wanting to feel like a badass!"

11879,The best Borderlands! I played this on the PS4 for ages before I got it for PC.
11880,"THIS GAME is awesome. Bought it on sale to play with a friend. The jokes in this game are hilarious, and this game has one of the funniest villains of all time."
11881,Roman juřena kouří penisy
11882,"One of the best games of all time. A must play if you like shooters. The gameplay is some of the best there is, the story is great and the characters will make you not want to stop playing. While I don't like the main villain as much as others do, he is still great and very charming. 

The art style makes the game a timeless classic and is gorgeous in some places. The gameplay will want you coming back for more even when you've finished the story and done most things in the game. This game can also act as a stand alone experience if you don't seem to enjoy the Borderlands universe that much. However if you want more story related content I'd recommend Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel as it builds on a lot of things from Borderlands 2. All of the other games in the series are also great, just never at the height of Borderlands 2.

Add to that that you can get this game with all dlcs (except one) and Borderlands: The Pre-sequel for only 15€ at sales. It is a steal for such an amazing experience."
11883,"Frankly this game is amazing. I played this when it first came out on XBox and loved it, from the insane story to the imaginative graphics and gameplay. The mechanics are easily understood and walk a fine line between deep CRPG and lightweight shooters. My only complaint is there's a more inventory management than I'd like. I recently picked this up again to play as my down-time shooter on macOs."
11884,"Very fun to play, and end game challanging which is fine because its not needed to complete story missions. Kind of sad BL3 turned out worse than the previous part so I'll give this game a benefit of being the best Borderlands game of the series."
11885,very pogpogpgopgopgogpogpogpgo
11886,"what more is there to say, it's a well made game. Graphics fit well with the kind of game vibe they create, the game caters to people who just want a shooter game and to those that wish to play in a story line. The game is open world and the story line gives some funny moments but also causing you to care more about the characters as you progress. The reliability of the game is brilliant since after finishing the game you can still level up your character, then even go into the OP levels in which you must pass a trial in order to level up... really really hard trials so you most likely have to go exploring borderlands world looking for bosses to defeat in the hopes that they will drop some piece of legendary equipment that will make passing the trial easier. The DLC that comes with the game is just as good and worth every penny.

This is a master piece of gaming and I have no problem giving it a score of 96/100."
11887,yes
11888,ONE OF THE BEST FRANCHISES!!!! i love this game
11889,this game still fun to play after many years even now.  more online players is better if not is fine too

11900,"Played it years ago and thought it was fun but holy hell if the writing doesn't age that really fast. Aside from ""look at me im so wacky and crazy xDDDDDDD"" dialogue, the general gameplay with the guns and the RPG skill building is still as fun as it was 10 years ago.

And Jack did nothing wrong."
11901,One of the best games. I'm still playing it after all these years <3
11902,pretty good
11903,"2012 game still better than most FPS's released in the past year? Sounds like a deal. Get this game if you like shooting developmentally challenged adults that pop out of chests.

11904,f
11905,Why would you give Randy Pitchford any of your money?
11906,"It's amazing that after all these years and after many games, that not only is this still the best Borderlands of the franchise, but also one of Gearbox's best game that they've ever had a hand in producing. I probably have like 500 hundred hours across all platforms from just this game alone, and yet I can still come back do more and find myself still having a blast just like the first time I played it. 

The gunplay and skills and weapons all work in their own way, weapons skills and attributes can contribute to a character with a particular skill. Like Zero's Bore ability, allowing him to shoot through enemies and increases damage as it comes out paired with the right gun can one tap any boss. Some skills become more useless the higher the difficulty, but it's so much fun to try and mix and match them and seeing what works and what doesn't. But what really gets me to come back is trying to find the legendary, pearlescent, and seraph, and iridescent weapons and gear. It triggers something inside my brain that after hours and hours of grinding I finally get the thing I was looking for. 

The story is something that I really think still holds up to this day. It has humor and drama and it balances them pretty well, that I never felt as if it ever leaned too heavily into the drama and preventing it from becoming silly or becoming too silly to ever take it seriously. I love that it's paced well too, nothing feels like it goes too fast, it feels like all the events happen at a very steady pace and I can appreciate that. Lastly, the characters are a treat, from Lilith to Moxxi to Scooter to Torgue to Handsome Freakin Jack, everyone stands out in this game, and for how seldom your character talks its funny how more agency they have in this game than compared to the later games. The first time I completed this game, all I could think about is more, more stories, more characters, more adventures, more everything, I was so hooked on this game. 

I alluded to before that I think this is the peak of Borderlands but also Gearbox themselves and I do mean that. Because after having played or seen some of the games they've produced, with some exceptions of course, this one I think can stand the test of time. It saddens me to think that this is where the franchise peaked and that anything else will just be relegated to ""okay"" or ""it's alright"" or ""meh"". I recommend this game, either full price or on sale as theirs enough for anyone to sink their teeth into."
11907,:)
11908,Just a masterpiece
11909,"Fun game but they fucking updated the game and now it freezes and crashes constantly. I played with 2 friends and I started to experience this after we were done with around 50% of the game and as we got closer to the end, my friends also begun having the same issues. It CAN temporarily fix it if you bring up the task manager, but it's most likely to crash outright anyway. And we've tried everything we can find on the web, nothing works. Plenty of forums that just say ""Yup, same here. There's no known fix.""

I don't understand why you'd take functioning game and ""update it"" and fucking breaking it absolute pieces in the process.
How god damn incompetent do you have to be in order to pull that stunt off? Same with the first game, bunch of new issues ever since they ""remastered"" it. Like wow, HD textures and constant online lag because for some reason the voice chat makes the game lag.

11924,"I got the entire Borderlands Handsome Collection at -97% off during the Summer Grand Prix in 2019 for ₹295... i.e. I got the base game for just ₹15. What a deal!

I'd asked my Saints Row co-op buddy to let me know if he'd be interested in playing Borderlands 2 with me cause I noticed we both shared that game in our library. After 3 months, in October 2020, he pinged me and said he'd be downloading it. That fine day, I picked Gaige and he picked Maya just based on their appearances and without really knowing what each of their powers was. In the first few days of the game, we always made time for the game and played it until one of us had to leave for classes/work. But after a few sessions, the long waiting game started...

This is a type of multiplayer game that requires a really long commitment with the person you're playing with. One person is the host, hence he has the save file for everything both players do except for their level and challenges. Luckily for me, I asserted my dominance with my better wifi and let myself be the host every time so I wouldn't have to deal with losing my progress in case my co-op partner takes a permanent hiatus for whatsoever reason. So an issue came up when my buddy wanted to play a different character (Zer0 the Assassin) cause he didn't really like Maya's gameplay very much, so he started his own solo save file and played through the missions again (cause he couldn't continue the progress from Maya's save file). The fact that story and challenge progress is saved separately for every playable character is really tedious for such a long game. I suppose it was designed in this way so that people who want more out of the game still have things to do, but all this just feels like forced game-length increasing techniques to me. If I want the game to last longer, I would've just played the new content that was constantly being added to the game with the same character instead of restarting my progress from scratch or using a NewGame+ mode. This isn't a live-service game where matches are short, so you could try out each character plenty of times, if you want to play a different character in this game, you'd have to go through every story mission from the start unless you load into someone's else's save file (but even that wouldn't suffice due to the crippling level cap).

The level system feels so redundant. Players with a lower level barely do any damage, enemies would one-shot them, they can't use stronger guns cause all guns have a level requirement. So basically, it's unsurvivable if a low-level player joins a game hosted by a higher-level player. Whereas high-level players joining low-level players would outmatch them no matter what the skill of either player is. It makes it inconvenient for people of different play-times in the game to play missions together, whereas most live-service games, even though they have ranks, at least the output from the player would be due to his/her skill rather than just because they have an unfair advantage in terms of stats. The game is only balanced for people who played the game throughout its course together and isn't too friendly towards mixing friends in between your campaign.

So as I was saying: [i]The waiting game...[/i] On and off, it took all the way from October 2020 until June 2021 to finally finish the game together. I was adamant about [i]only[/i] playing with him and not switching to solo even for a moment, so the longer the time my friend was offline, the more I craved to shoot stuff with Gaige. For the first few months, I knew nothing about the Anarchy system, so I always found myself weak in comparison to my buddy cause he kept switching to stronger weapons as he leveled up. After I re-invested in my skill tree, I found out about Gaige's main strength: ANARCHY! Deathtrap was cool and all, but the only interaction I have with him is 'Hitting F to summon Deathtrap'. Anarchy was way more than that. I used to use sniper rifles before, but after investing in Anarchy™, I found out that Accuracy is overrated anyway™. [u]Jakobs' shotguns with 400 anarchy stacks:[/u] Just shoot anywhere/on the floor/in any direction, and enemies are bound to die somewhere. It's stupid fun and probably the best thing I like about this game.

As for the story, it was feasible, mostly teen-adult humor, with some of my favorite characters being Moxxi, Tiny Tina, Gaige, Lilith, Claptrap, etc. It is by no means a [i]'serious story'[/i] and doesn't pretend like it is, like Dying Light or something. The voice acting is professional but feels charmingly amateur, and I love every Gaige voice line that talks about Anarchy, Stacks, the reload button, and Deathtrap.

The menu UI is really irritating. It's straight-up built for controllers, and navigating it with a mouse can be quite irritating since it only lets you use your keyboard for dropping/inspecting items. Everything else has to be navigated by pressing small icons and arrows that sometimes glitch out and doesn't let you scroll down enough, and you have to keep backing out of it to even do a simple task as swapping a gun from your inventory to your loadout. Normally you have enough time to deal with that on solo, cause the game pauses when you open the menu, but on co-op, you're gonna slowly get tilted (infuriated) the more times it occurs.

So again, as I was saying: [i]The waiting game...[/i] the more I craved to play Borderlands 2, the more I pinged him on Steam asking him if he was free that week, but most of the time, to my dismay, he wasn't. So the days he finally was free, I made use of it as much as I could by playing in one stretch so as to not lose any anarchy stacks when leaving the game. Usually, all he had time for was to do one or two missions, a couple of side missions, and then he'd leave for another 2-3 weeks. But finally, on June 2021, when I finally caught him online, I invited a higher level friend whom I met while playing Dying Light, and just focused on all remaining Main Missions up until the final main mission all in one day. When all was said and done, [i]it was more fun to play main missions back-to-back rather than linger onto the game for too long by doing every side mission offered.[/i] And between the time of starting Borderlands 2 and finishing it, I had played through [b]22 different games[/b] in total.

[u]Post Credits-[/u] [i]Where are They Now?[/i]:
My Saints Row co-op buddy uninstalled the game cause he only owned the base game and probably didn't want to be pestered by me to play it anymore for achievements.
My Dying Light buddy's brother played Gunzerker with me for the rest of the base game side missions, and later I convinced him to get the DLC bundle so we could play the expansions together.
My non-gaming laptop endured through getting a thermal paste change in between, but still ran at 720p60fps.

So now that I've said all I've had to say about Borderlands 2, let's talk about the rest of the Handsome Collection's contents. I didn't know for quite a while that Gaige was actually a paid DLC, and wasn't included in the game, so like it, there were more than 50 individual DLCs for this game... most of them just skins though, but the Handsome Collection included Borderlands Pre-Sequel (which will have its own review, so it won't be mentioned any further). So what else is there to review? [u]The major expansions!, of course (in order from best to worst):[/u]
[olist]
    [*]Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep
    [*]Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty
    [*]Head Hunters
    [*]Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage
    [*]Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt
[/olist]
Tiny Tina's Bunkers and Badasses was definitely the best DLC, and hearing more of Ashley Burch is always a pleasure. Overall, the entire setup of it being a D&D game was insanely hilarious, especially when playing with a friend who hadn't played it before either.
Head Hunters were short and sweet, so me like!

11925,"Amazing Humor, tons of hours of grinding for pearlescents, and amazing mechanics!"
11926,"good looter shooter game, bosses a bit too hard"

11930,SHOOT ME IN THE FACE
11931,"Though the DLC strategy is frankly obnoxious, this game is great and a great deal provided you pick it up on sale. While it shows it's age these days, I would say it still is a great experience, especially the first time around."
11932,"h
"
11933,"It's a fun game overall, RPG stuff, Shooting stuff, cheesy humor.
Adorably fun to play with your buddies. It's alright to playing solo, it might feel a little bit more tiring though.

Soundtrack is a little bit lackluster in my opinion."
11934,gg
11935,gud game
11936,I have amassed thousands of hours on this game between PS3 and PS4. This game and everything about it is fantastic. Borderlands 2 is filled with hundreds hours of content with a great story and a variety of weapons. I am happy I picked this up and can't wait to play this game for many more hours. 11/10
11937,🥇🥇🥇🥇
11938,Great game!
11939,Moin
11940,baaa boooo baaaa
11941,"I may not have played this game for very long on PC but i do have over a thousand hours on console (XBOX) but i can tell you now that this is one of my most favourite games that i have ever played, the looting is incredible for example when you have to farm certain legendary weapons and gear by killing bosses multiple times and all it takes is a save quit and reload to reset the boss. It has one of the best antagonists in video game history as he is hilarious and serious, he talks to you throughout the story and even has certain side missions related to him. I hope this review is any help to anyone for considering buying this game, if is you should and take my word for it and i hope you enjoy this game."

11949,Yes
11950,"Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games of all times. You don't need to play Borderlands 1 to understand it and I prefer this one to Borderlands 3, the story is what sells it. I have 4 copies of this game."
11951,Its a GOAT
11952,"The game is free flowing, lot's of things to do and has an overall post apocalyptic vibe. Love you all <3"
11953,I became a living bomb. It was cool.
11954,"Power scale is like Dragon Ball Super: You start at 6-7 dmg, in the end you deals millions.
I prefer Borderlands 1 in that aspect, the rest is good."
11955,"its a fun time 
"
11956,Awesome game
11957,"Just an overall fun shooter-looter with a unique charm. It was Borderlands 1, and 2 that essentially got me back into FPS games; the last FPS I remember playing seriously was Perfect Dark on N64. For an older game it's still fun to screw around in."

11970,"Something is off with this one.  It's boring and repetitive.  The fact that the bosses respawn after their defeat makes the story seem pointless, of which the story is already pointless.  I feel no connection to it.  They also messed up the tab menu.  It's so awful to look at and use.  It also seems a whole lot easier to blow yourself up with friendly grenades.

I'm done playing this without having finished it."
11971,yea its pretty good i will not lie
11972,"You can throw guns to reload and they explode, what more do you want?"
11973,yeah
11974,best looter shooter game I have ever played
11975,"Samey gameplay and more focus on loot than actual worldbuilding and story result in an overall lackluster experience. Even with friends, there are better games out there to enjoy."
11976,Buy it!
11977,Heyo
11978,Never ending comedy and adventurous gameplay
11979,"Incredible experience. Hilarious, addicting, and just overall a great game. Probably my favorite of all time. Some of the legendary weapons and basically all of the Pearlescent weapons are a bit underwhelming compared to some unique Blue weapons, but honestly it makes up for it in the complete majesty of this game. Incredible job."
11980,Don't play multiplayer with someone who knows how to speedrun the game.
11981,"I have bought this game three or four times and i would gladly buy it again. 
The Handsome Collection is your way to go. Two games with all the DLC and some neat skins for only 18 euro (When it's on sale.) Bit sad that the Lilith DLC isn't free anymore and that the Handsome collection doesn't include it.
The game itself is a marvel on PC compared to PS3 and imo also Xbox One.
Though i'd say it's good full price... The game becomes so stupidly cheap on sale (again, with all the DLC n' a spin-off) that i'd recommend you wait for a sale!

Now as for the gameplay... It's great, engagin', all those words. I never really experienced any issues whatsoever throughout my playthroughs. Besides the occasional bug on PS3 but those are far and less between on newer editions of the game. Even if you do get one, it's never game-breakin'.

The story in BL2 is the best Borderlands story you're gonna get. TPS is also pretty good in that regard, though.
If you want a fine balance between good story and gameplay then this is the one.
It's also rather comedic... Sure, it's not any marvel but the humour here is still fun.
I recommend that if you play this with a friend (which is equally fun in it's own right) that you try your best to pay attention to the story as it's a bit harder with a buddy on your side, sadly."
11982,"Fantastic gameplay, amazing story, lots of guns! Probably the best representative of its genre and it does not get old!!!"
11983,very good game
11984,"it good, got like 3000 hrs on console"
11985,"This is not a bad game. If you like dumb jokes or want a decent shooter for you and your friends, this game will probably be a good choice.
However, personally I prefer the first game of the series (especially the remaster, which I got for free since I owned Borderlands 1 already). 

Borderlands 2 has a far greater variety in its guns and I think Handsome Jack is a pretty fun villain. The voiceacting is good and I like how they brought back most of the characters from 1, yet as a whole I just don't enjoy how it all comes together.
The gunplay feels somehow not as good as it did in Borderlands 1. I don't know if it is down to the fact, that dismemberment has been removed or maybe it comes from a change in the hipfire accuracy, I just don't like it that much. I do like the new animations wounded enemies have though.
The map sizes have been increased, whilst I prefer the smaller size they had in 1, I also like the new environments.
I hate the eridium trading in this game. I liked that you had to purchase ammo upgrades from the vending machines, using all that money that you constantly collect. I liked that you increased your inventory size rescuing Claptraps. I do not like having to collect a randomly spawning currency that can only be used to buy capacity upgrades. The money feels completely useless in this game since the vending machines rarely have anything worth buying and I only ever lose cash from dying which is no big deal at all. If you could at least buy ammo upgrades with cash and only use the eridium for inventory or minor character upgrades this wouldn't be so bad, but having 2 currencies with one being completely useless is just not a good feature.
Claptrap is even more annoying than he was in 1.

Overall like I said, not a bad game, I just prefer the first game by a lot."
11986,fun
11987,Game nice.
11988,"This game is the extreme definition of ""Clusterfuck of Fun"". Colourful explosions, Great lines and that many guns? Say fucking less!

Update: Still fucking awesome"
11989,its alright i guess
11990,"I like the story telling and the mechanics of the game. the weapons and the choices in weapons are great, also having the option to have multiple weapons."
11991,"I refunded this game for like 8 bucks so i could buy the handsome collection for 5 bucks. 10/10 quality store steam, would choose you again instead of fucking epic games store. Randy you're a crazy boy.

*edit after 150ish hrs of play: it's good, great replayability, memorable chars, smooth gameplay, yadda yadda yadda"
11992,"Game does not save beyond Liars Berg. Gearbox says it involves the save files being stored incorrectly, but I could never get it to work. Its a shame because this is an incredibly fun game, but if you cant save anything, its virtually useless other than multiplayer. GB needs to fix this issue ASAP."
11993,Update makes it so I cannot play with friends.
11994,very epic fun game
11995,"Very epic, and very fun game to play with friends. The DLC classes that they added are also a hell of a lot of fun. Truly feels like a rewarding game and when you feel like you are complete and done playing the game. You're not."
11996,very epic classic
11997,i like handsome jack
11998,good
11999,the broke crossplay between windows and linux so I can't play with my friends anymore.

12012,Borderlands 2 is one of the best games to ever come out on steam. A must-play for people enjoying vast planets and hundreds of hours of gameplay.
12013,"[b]Holy Waffle Megatron! Is this game addictive or what?[/b]
Even after completing the main story line, there are so many things you can do. The side quests in themselves tell a fantastic tale, each wackier than the other. The DLC's OMG! Don't get me started on the DLC's cause they are massive and so much fun to play through for days. There are so many weird, crazy, outlandish moments in this game that'll make you go nuts and wanting more. Each character has a unique personality and over-the-top skill set that makes you want to play the whole game over again.  To say it's just an [i]""Awesome game""[/i] is an understatement. BL2 is cleverly designed, with one of the best villains, gameplay, and action. Everyone is looking forward to the movie but I'll say nothing is going to do justice to what you will experience in the game. You might feel a bit unsure or intimidated at first on entering this melodramatic universe of madness but as you progress you will realize it's all perfectly balanced and your thoughts had deceived you from experiencing this unicorn of a game sooner. There is so much passion, humour, and creativity packed into this monumental game that no matter what your skill level is at FPS, you are going to be a badass. BL2 is jam, jelly, peanut butter-packed epicness. You're going to die a lot, and you're to win a lot. BL2 is not a game you want to use cheat codes on cause you'll sooner than later realize that the joy of BL2 resides in the journey it takes you on. If you're having a bad day and feel like blowing something up, hop on BL2, and BOOM! You are teleported into a lawless alien futuristic fantasy land where you can blow everything and yourself up if you want. So, if you are looking to buy a game that is not too stressful but top-of-line awesome and stays fresh for a very long time then Borderland 2 is worth your time and money. I definitely recommend buying with the full DLC bundle right off cause if you don't you will wish for you it soon."
12014,"Rich, funny and emotional story, amazing combat gameplay, large amount of challenges, lots of different playstyles for each of 4 main Vault Hunters, hundreds of combinations for snipers, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols... Borderlands 2 is my favorite looter shooter!"
12015,"One of the best game I've played throughout my childhood. Great storyline, great gameplay as well and design that captures the whole look and feel of the game. It leaves me so much nostalgia and hope it'll show even in years to come, maybe even inspire future games to have this an inspiration."
12016,f
12017,Best game ever
12018,"this game is really good, one of the best i've ever played. i'm glad i got it on my pc after moving off of my old xbox 360, its almost nostalgic playing through it again, and i highly reccomend it if you're looking for a game to mindlessly shoot in or listen to a pretty good story. 

game good

I also love humor in it. Sometimes dark, sometimes stupid, but in a good way :D Campaign itself is pretty interesting as well, having some unexpected plot twists and TONS of charismatic characters. Game has some bugs tho, but what's ironic is that they make it even funnier xD"
12026,"Borderlands is a very fun game, even by itself, but I think it truly shines whenever you load it up with your boys."
12027,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
12028,"great
"
12029,"Ever since the release of this game way back in 2012 I have always enjoyed playing the game as a kid and multiplayer made it so much more fun. You will get laughs, a quirky handsome villain and even a hot goddess Lilith. There's a reason why this game is game of the year and that's because it was fun to play :D"
12030,Smooth fps experience with interesting and humorous storyline!
12031,"it's okay, wouldn't play more than a few minutes though."
12032,Borderlands 2 is the type of game that you sit down to play for 20 minutes and stop 2 hours later. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Halo franchise.
12033,please visit claptrap on his birthday he needs buddies!

12056,"The Borderlands Franchise is simply known for its Humour and Loot-and-Shoot Gameplay and Borderlands 2 does it just like 1 but better! The gameplay is kept simple in a shooter style with new guns from every enemy. The drops and gun variety give this game what makes it fun, especially if you play together with friends. Definitely worth checking out if youre into loot shooters!"
12057,Borderlands 2 is is a blast to play. So much fun to be had even playing solo. Loads of cool guns to try out. Funny enemies and npcs. I like the art style of the borderlands series and there's so much impressive landscapes to see. Definitely get the handsome collection on sale that comes with all the dlcs.
12058,cool
12059,"I've played on Xbox 360 and PS4, I just recently bought the PC copy. An AMAZING game, easily my favorite FPS."
12060,fun shooter
12061,"It's a classic, whether you're playing with nostalgia from a PS3/360 or simply looking for a fun and cheap looter shooter, this is one of the go to's. Some mechanics are a bit dated but this is the game that started the fandom for most, and for very good reason. The grinding for legendary loot is simple and effective, with many guides online to help you on the way (R.I.P Yoteslaya, one of the best to do it) and the gunfights are fun with varied enemies and elements applying to various different enemies in different effectiveness. The humour is a bit stupid, but that very much works in its favour and adds likeability to various characters, its probably for the better too because immersion in this art style would be a very difficult task. Speaking of art, the cartoonish aesthetic works surprisingly well.
Overall, 9/10 (in its time, 10/10) only thing id ask more of it is to have less dated mechanics, but can't really complain about that considering the games age"
12062,"very good co-op game....i luv it >:3 storyline is engaging, side missions are nice, many different guns, and diverse mods+abilities."

12070,I really loved playing this game!
12071,I will always keep coming back to this game. I've played through the campaign MANY times and can't avoid diving into the DLC and completely every mission. It's endless fun - 9/10

Con: Not found."
12100,"The original looter shooter and a main villain who is the best villain out of all the games I've played. On the PS4 I've got 7 days of play time on Krieg, and another 2 on Salvador, would most definitely recommend. Though I personally would buy the Handsome Collection during a sale, got mine at 92% off. Though prepare for a steep learning curve at Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode."
12101,its okay I guess
12102,its gud
12103,A must play! One of the greats! This game will go down in history as one of the best of its kind/time.
12104,10 years later still good lol
12105,Like loot and shooting? You will like this.
12106,well im really enjoying playing this games
12107,"Best game in the series IMO. Borderlands 2 was all substance and very little fat. I never felt the need to grind out for weapons I wanted as the next big gun drop was sufficiently interesting and powerful to keep me going. The skill builds were also interesting and I found myself finding a playstyle I enjoyed very quickly. Additionally, this game has one of the best DLC packages in Tiny Tina's heartbreaking DnD session."
12108,"good, fun shoot"
12109,This game is the most fun and amazing game i have ever played and highly recommend
12110,"If you haven't played this game yet, I seriously don't know what you're doing with your life. It's a very fun FPS both by yourself and with friends, with a bunch of customization options for your character and different ways to play the game. The game is hilarious too. The icing on the cake is how hooked you can get playing it, always finding new guns and relics to change how you play, as well as rewarding level ups that define your playstyle. It's almost always on sale, so give it a go!"
12111,"There are few games that stay fun for years after release borderlands 2 is one of those games.
With diverse characters, skills, lots of weapons  you’ll find yourself playing the story over and over. Finding other ways to beat the opponent easier and quicker."
12112,good
12113,Great Game. That is all.
12114,I like the grenade jumping

12126,"Boringlands 2: Even More Boring.

Shoot bullet sponge enemies, more bullet sponge enemies spawn, get hurt, hide behind cover until shields regen, shoot bullet sponge enemies... repeat all steps until enemies stop spawning. Loot a ton of guns, waste time checking if each gun is slightly better than one you currently have, level up and then start getting guns that are better than what you have anyway. Repeat for 8 billion hours..... or at least it seemed like that many.

A game so mind numbingly non-challenging and repetitive that I would intentionally run into the middle of enemy spawn areas just so something would actually happen. If the only real challenge your game provides comes from the player intentionally being stupid, then you've made a poor game.

I can't comment much on the story, characters or dialogue as when you play it multiplayer, you miss out on about 75+% of everything going on. That said, it certainly can't make up for the horrible gameplay.

I only made it around 6 hours or so in with a friend before I simply couldn't take it anymore. This is the type of mindless game where I can actually feel my brain cells committing suicide while playing it. No surprise then that it's so popular among the masses."
12127,"is okay, best game in series tho"
12128,"Played this a while back when it first released on the 360, and I thought that I loved it then. Let me tell you, coming back to it now on PC and with all of the DLC makes me appreciate this game even more. Fast-paced, engaging, and all-around fun shooter to pick up and play without needing much reference to the first game in the series (although thats another masterpiece for another review). Ok ill tuck it in my waistband now and stopping creaming over this game this is a must play."

12148,amazing game
12149,"I've played Borderlands 2 over many, many platforms. As someone who doesn't like a lot of FPS', I can say without hesitation that this is 100% one of my all-time favorite games of any genre. The humor is brilliant, the combat is exciting, the story is deep and very funny, the art and music are impeccable, the voice acting is unmatched, and the GUNS!! So many guns with so many functions, players like me who leave no stone unturned ALWAYS have something good or new to find around every corner.

This game has been around for almost a decade. Do yourself the favor because once you start, you'll wonder what took you so long. So grab your four-barreled shotgun that fires rockets and find that Vault!!"
12150,Cracked Game
12151,"What's not to love?! Shoot, Loot, and repeat. Story is awesome, a villain you LOVE to hate and dialogue that that cracks me up every time."
12152,Best bad guy in any game.
12153,"It's like Borderlands 3, except everything that ain't gameplay is better than in Borderlands 3. maybe not graphics, but who cares ?

Oh also it doesn't take up like 120gb of space with a 100gb download. And because it's so old, you can actually get the DLCs for a reasonable price (the amount of content locked behind them is horseshit though!), and you don't need a monstrously good computer to run it.

It is definitely more enjoyable in co-op but it works fine in singleplayer though some missions and locations feel clunkier than if they were played in co-op."
12154,"Love this game. The game might be old, but some things never age."
12155,this is a grate game
12156,it good game
12157,"Really fun game that I enjoyed on a casual standpoint. Game still looks pretty great with the art style and there's tons of weapons to choose from and the skill tree builds are very fun to make. Dialogue is also pretty funny at times and got a few chuckles out of me. There's so many missions and sidequests to tackle, and some are very worthwhile, so there's never a dull moment or getting stuck on what to do next. Gunplay is very good, and satisfying. 
I'd say the game does suffer from a lot of balance quirks and bugs, I've had several crashes, and frame drops in certain areas, and some bosses are flat out terrible to fight. There's more difficulty options to choose from, going from true and ultimate vaulthunter, all the way to OP levels from 1 to 10. I played up to ultimate vault hunter, and I recommend you stop there if you aren't looking for too much of a challenge, I've heard from my friends that OP levels get insanely unbalanced, and making builds and the weapons you can use get a lot more limited there, and the majority can be very hard and boring to grind for, since drop rates for very rare guns are very low.
If you like the game enough, I'd also recommend checking out some of the DLC expansions. Dragon Keep and Campaign of Carnage are ones that are a must get. The others I didn't hate or love too much. 

In short, grab a couple buddies, get some of that DLC and play at least up to Ultimate vault hunter for the best experience. While it is rough in certain areas, all in all I very much enjoyed my time with this game, especially with friends."
12158,it's fun

12160,it litty
12161,"I had harder times to finish the main story than the first Borderlands game, but the game was worth the effort. Also, I loooove the B&B DLC. Tiny Tina is one on my favorite character in the franchise and having her as a DM for the game was very well done."

That's all. Why would you play any other vault hunter? Oh you want to be a sneaky ninja, a turret commanding soldier, a phsyco, a 1 of 7 siren or a school girl? Oh right... Then I guess you could do that. The base game is enjoyable in it self, but on steam sales the whole game is cheaper then the base regularly. You may want to wait for that. But don't miss your friends out. The co-op part could be hard if you are the last to pick up the loot nobody shares with you."

12213,"I played the first Borderlands when it first came out years ago and it was okay. I don't recall ever completing it but it was alright. I have different opinions about the borderlands games these days, however. As we age, our tastes tend to change. 

I don't know. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want to play a game single player where you grind, grind, grind over the same repetitive nonsense for 60+ hours. I get it, these looter shooter kind of games are popular and well liked but they're just not for me. They also require a massive time investment, which I just don't have these days. I liked the comedic style and some specific characters but they just weren't enough for me to continue playing. I just don't understand. To me, doing fetch quests in this game is the equivalent of walking down to my local post office. I don't really want to do it but I do it anyway and I can't really say I'm ever having fun doing it. I could literally do anything else more productive and still feel less bored. 

All these kind of games implement the same structure to quests/missions - go find x, go find y, repair x, repair y, fetch x, fetch y. All of this would be somewhat okay if the rewards were worth the constant trouble but they almost never are. Most loot you find is useless.

 In theory, these games sound like fun but when you see the reality of how they work, you realise these games are often not fun at all or fun for a very short period of time before they start to annoy you. I'm not saying all of Borderlands 2 is bad because it generally does some things well but as I've aged, I've just come to accept that I'll probably never like this genre of game again because they're so much trouble for very little reward and they start to feel like chores after a few hours because it's just SO MUCH of the same, just reformatted a little. 

I don't know, this whole levelling up and spending skill points thing just doesn't do it for me anymore because I know in my mind that it's all really meaningless. I'd play a linear shooter over Borderlands any day of the week if it's got an interesting plot. At least this game has some interesting characters, though. The gunplay is good enough and the game runs very well, so I'll give it that.

I think Borderlands games are very much like Marmite, you either love them or hate them.

If you enjoy just shooting things 24/7 and like grindy games with some witty comedic writing, then Borderlands is for you."
12214,cool fun game yes
12215,"This game got humor, it got action, it got co-op from the first mission to the end and it got some really cool characters.
The only thing I would put a finger on is the grafic it looks like a cartoon movie, but it just a matte of getting use to.
Overall i would recommend this a really great game, if you play it single player or wanna go co-op with up to 4 friends.

""All around the Sta-actus plant, the stalker chased the bandit, the stalker thought 'twas all in fun - POP! Goes the bandit!"""
12216,"Great game to play with your buddies!
"
12217,Side quest simulator
12218,"it's super addicting. the only thing i don't like about this game is that there's no skip button for cutscenes. so replaying the game in a harder difficulty is more annoying. other than that, it's extremely fun to play with friends."
12219,"shit good fam
"
12220,"As someone who's at this point played all of the Borderlands games (Borderlands, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3, and Tales from the borderlands), I can highly recommend that anyone looking to get into a fun shooter with mild rpg aspects, play this game. The story's are fun, the gameplay loop is fun, the multiplayer is..... ok i haven't played multi player since like 2015, But I remember it as fun."
12221,Good times.
12222,nice game

12254,"A stress relieving game that you can grind, become overpower and still play online with your friends, if you have someone. The game still encourages the player to have more than one character and replay everything by  accumulating badass rank. The badass rank isn't relevant to the gameplay, but can slightly enhance your char. Overall, it's a shooter with a long life of gameplay."

12258,Played this game for the story and boss fights. Not a fan of the loot grind shoot kind of system. Others will find this very fun and interesting tho. Chest Keys also make the game better since we can get good stuff without grinding the boss.

12285,"love it
"
12286,"Game runs poorly for some reason. To be specific, I get FPS drops out of nowhere. I am using a GTX 1660 Super and games like Monster Hunter World runs smoothly on certain settings with 50-60 fps without dropping.

Meanwhile this sorta old game which is supposedly low spec for some reasons runs at 60 fps but drops to 20-30 sometimes even to 1 fps out of nowhere every 15 seconds or so. This game seems fun but if I had to do some magic or research to be able to play a game smoothly when normal adjustment of display settings doesn't work then I'd rather not play at all. I am sorry :/ but I can't recommend this."

[h1]Worlds turned into garbage were filled by trash guns.[/h1]

Reading my Borderlands 1 review, the complaints I had then still apply.

[list]
[*]Hate Floaty jump, but I jumped nearly all game long.
[*]Minor control annoyances. Pressing map but should open AND close. Not just open.
[*]Tons of guns, none stood out.
[*]Shooting isn't precise, it's stat based. Your aiming matters but stats still play a big part in accuracy.
[*]Character Spec’s seemed unnecessary
[*]Changes to Siren seem weaker; which that class was already lacking from the first.
[*]Returning characters was a really nice touch.
[*]Another case of being ready for the game to be over around 75-80% done.
[*]Quests can feel samey and grindy.
[*]There were some really nice hidden gems
[*]Playing Borderlands 1 isn't required, but will make you enjoy the story more.
[*]Art style ages better than gameplay
[*]The art style makes these games timeless. They can run on nearly anything.
[*]Cell shading is very reminiscent of the first game.
[*]Effects are fun.
[*]They also added skins for the characters and vehicles.
[*]Encountered 1 bug and some co-op disconnections.
[/list]
	

I enjoyed it more by myself, for a while. Main quest by yourself, side quest with friends would be ideal. If you can’t find the right tempo I think the best option is to start and end the game by yourself. Then play with your friends through the middle of the game. That way you can get a little feel for the story but do all the grinding and shooting with friends.

If you enjoyed the first one you'll enjoy this one 100%. Some other reasons to play this game are you have friends to play with or you enjoy a lootfest.

12325,"10 out of 10 would replay again, and again, and again, and again."
12326,honestly this game made me fall back in love with games. I hadnt played a game with a story in so long that playing this with my friends reminded me what I loved about them in the first place. No other game like this entire franchise. The story is the best part in my opinion. Cant wait to play more <33

12368,"Just when I thought they couldn't improve on Borderlands, I was slapped in the face with this beautiful monstrosity. 

First. Graphics.
I remember when the very first trailer dropped at E3 2009 I do believe, and the game looked good for the time. However, when they changed it to cell shading graphics and I honestly hated it. I have never really liked that look. But then I bought the game on release day, and holy crap I loved it. After the success you knew there was going to be a sequel, and holy hot butternuts did we ever get one. 

Borderlands 2 looks amazing. Somehow they improved on the quality and made the game look even better. 

Second. Storyline. 
You start the game off with a wonderful cutscene with a brief explanation of the class of characters you have to choose from. There are perks to each one of the characters so it's all up to personal preference. There isn't a ""wrong"" class to choose from.  Each class has a unique set of skills, skills they have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make them a nightmare to all the baddies of Pandora. 

After you decide which class you want, it's time to start the game. With the always wonderful Cl4p-tp (Claptrap) giving a very entertaining little cutscene and explanation on why you are there. Seems that some evil corporation wants all the Vault Hunters dead. And he attempted to kill you. Time for the long process of revenge!  It doesn't take long for the shooting to begin, and you'll meet some very interesting characters along the way. 

Throughout the game you'll find yourself snickering and laughing at the complete mayhem that you'll come across during your long journey. All of it is amazing.

Third. Voice acting.
The voice acting in this game is absolutely top of the line, grade A amazing! From Scooter, to Ellie, Moxxie, Claptrap, and the always entertaining Tiny Tina! 

Overall.
This game is so close to perfect that it's hard to find one better. The graphics, story, and characters will keep you interested for a long time to come, especially with the quality dlcs that you can get.  If you never have honored yourself with this game, now is the time. Play it, you won't regret it.

12377,"I mean u know its good its a classic, play in coop tho, every time I play this its with my sibling and we have a great f*cking time. 

another note cuz i have BL3 on the epic launcher :( so i cant review it here.
no clue how come so many people absolutely dump on the writing for BL3 considering this game, like, I replayed this in 2021, at 22 years old, having played borderlands 2 for the first time almost 10 years ago, and guys its not that much funnier, you are just a f*cking adult and dont laugh at troll face memes anymore. Like its the same humor, just more of the good ideas were spent back when BL2 was being made, its like 1/30 of these dumb quips hit but theyre both fun games and I thoroughly recommend the whole series, especially in coop, but from the amount of reviews on that game saying the exact same sh*t basically I have to imagine some youtuber mustve said something about BL3 being a woke microtransaction nightmare or something else that gets the 14 y/o gamer outrage fetish going. dont be discouraged from either of these games is my point."
12378,"This is easily one of the best games of all time. So unique, so funny, so stylish; there is nothing like Borderlands 2. The gameplay has to be easily the best part of the experience- so refreshing, so addicting, so replayable UGH! It's so good! The story? As good as the gameplay. Handsome Jack will go down for me as one of the BEST videogame villians to DATE! If you haven't played this title just yet, it's for sure a must."
12379,Its all down hill from here.
12380,"9/10

I honestly don't even need to write a review for this game, because it should be universally known as one of the greatest co-op fps story-driven games. Seemingly endless content, mixed with fun/interesting characters, and over 17 MILLION unique weapons all in just one game makes this one of my all time favourite games.

In conclusion... Buy this game, it's worth it."
12381,"Grew up on this game and others, but I can always come back to it."
12382,"Great game to play with friends

12383,got more hours than this on the ps3 and 4 but yes i would recomend playing this game if you like action guns comic style graphic or just like killing things

12395,pretty good
12396,"Good looter shooter like the first game, but don't play it in multiplayer. The only one that will have fun is the one that rushes in first to kill the enemies. I can't even enjoy the game in soloplay anymore after experiencing being left behind to such an extent. If you want to enjoy the story, play solo."

12404,good
12405,"Why did I return to playing Borderlands 2 (and after that the pre-sequel with community patch) when Borderlands 3 exists? Because Borderlands 2 is an infinitely better game that is highly replayable. It has balance in it's unbalance. Borderlands 3, besides having a very insignificant story, is way too easy and because it is way too easy it gets boring. It literally showers you in vastly overpowered legendary weapons, the only difficulty in that game is coping with the stress of choice. If you know which enemies to farm for specific legendaries, you can get dozens of copies within an hour no problem. And since they keep scaling in level with you, you can always go back to get new copies that are on your level. Borderlands 3 literally streamlines itself into pointlessness. Sure there are some really challenging arenas in the game but that does not salvage the main campaign or the DLCs.

And also... it just really lacks humor. The previous three games were borderline insane, Borderlands 3 is tame in comparison.

Borderlands 2 on the other hand hit that sweet spot. Yes there are quite a few legendaries in the game and some are really overpowered, but the game makes you work for them; sometimes really hard. Getting a legendary is ALWAYS a happy event, a surge of adrenaline. Especially if it happens to be a perfect version of that legendary you wanted for your birthday. Setting up your character such that your power starts to snowball is a rewarding exercise. It requires some item farming for sure, but farming in this game is never boring. I'll happily murder the Bunker or the Warrior a couple dozen times, it's like a lottery with a reasonable chance to win and you get to shoot a lot of things as you play.

And also: It sports the best story DLC ever put in an FPS game (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - no wonder they're creating a stand alone game out of that one). 

I hope you can make Wonderlands and Borderlands 4 more like Borderlands 2, Gearbox. Bring back the balanced unbalance. Don't try to perfect your game into boredom, let it be unhinged.

10/10, best single player/coop FPS ever made."

12465,Fuck yes I would recommend.
12466,"A friend gifted me this game for the co-op (thank you very much!). I can't give a full review of the game because I didn't experience most of the content. I just totally lost interest.

The dialogue wasn't funny to me. It was annoying. In your face pestilent narration. It's a combination of XD randumm! and characters that taunt you with no weight or feeling of threat. ""I have a horse made of diamonds because I'm rich"" or ""I shot one baby and that baby was being a jerk"" are paraphrased spoken lines from the game. That's not funny, but it's also not emotionally impactful. I think the story suffers from too much ""tell"" and not enough ""show"".

Every enemy I encountered was a bullet sponge. Weapons and skills just didn't feel punchy enough. Because it's too complex to just enjoy picking up weapons and killing stuff. The skill choices and weapons and elements and resistances all matter. But there's too many of them (weapons) and not enough of them (skills) to feel like my build is differentiated meaningfully. It's also too simple (point and shoot at stuff) to enjoy the added complexity.

Ultimately, the experience came across to me as shallow."

I fell in love with the first Borderlands and I'm hooked."
12487,pretty cool
12488,"[b]Garbage; [/b]
Cons:
Nowhere near enough ammo to kill anything, always run out even with the crates. The only way to get more is to die. 
The vehicle controls are trash. 
The graphics ""style"" is awful and hurts to look at. 
The ingame menus don't have easy to find buttons. 
Multiplayer is dead, only 2 people joined in 3 hours. One was a chingchong and one was a little kid who would not stop sending me friend invites. 
The game will crash about 75% of the time if you tab out.
The game crashed twice before i could change the res to 1920x1080, default is like 600x800.
As far as the story, all the people you have to work with are annoying as fuck, I wish I could join the jack guy, he sounds cool.
The music sounds like youtube royalty free garbage some fuckboy vlog channel would use.

pros:
Scooter


Maybe ok to buy if you are a console peasant or stuck with a 2006 PC. The only real reason to play is if you have ""special"" friends  who play it."
12489,yup
12490,"Great Game!  I've enjoyed all of the Borderlands games, and this one is no different.  It also runs on Linux, which is a big plus for me and I have no doubt will bring me many more hours of enjoyment."
12491,I can shoot black people
12492,"This game is something i go back to every year, and still has that vibe where everything I comeback to it there is something i have yet to figure out. Great game and have always been ever since!"
12493,"There is nothing like it (apart from other Borderlands games obvs) its fast paced has a good sense of humour & a unique style.

Shooting is relatively enjoyable & the looting is great, there's a fantastic variety of guns but no so much with the enemies.

The story is ok but you might miss some of it as you blast your way through the tsunami of enemies.

The graphics are a little dated now but don't look awful apart from the low poly count.

The sound could be better but it works well enough.

Before you buy:
17.75 million guns, no ammo...
Don't get me wrong there is ammo, eps if you use a basic machine gun or shotgun but if you want to use a smg, sniper or rocket launcher you will keep running out of ammo.

There are 3 ways to get ammo, from bodies, from containers & from vending machines. In all of my time playing I have found rocket launcher ammo in containers all of three times. Smg & sniper ammo is more commonplace but most of the ammo you find is shotgun & machine gun ammo (because that's what most of the human enemies use).

The thing is with this is, it would not be hard & there is no reason to not put ammo vendors at every other checkpoint but even in massive levels there will only be three or so vendors. 

If you walk (for 15-30 mins real time) back to an ammo vendor after clearing an area (due to the lack of fast travel points) when you travel back all the enemies will have re-spawned anyway.

Its an old game & you will know when you play it! 
Its super clunky & you will get stuck & have to jump your way out of it even whilst trying to mantle a curb.

Bad guns.
Some of the guns are just bad having negative effects like making you unable to walk etc."

12532,Good game!
12533,"Uncomplicated yet somehow still unintuitive, repetitive, and ultimately boring--even with friends.

Plus, hi-res textures don't load in fast enough, if they ever load at all, even from SSD.

Edit: I don't like having to interrupt the action/exploration every minute and a half to determine which newer better guns I'm supposed to be using. I don't like being constantly forced to drop older guns due to a full inventory, because I don't feel like backtracking to sell them, as would be optimal. I didn't like how a mission-critical audiolog pickup popup took just long enough that we had already left the area before a new waypoint appeared--twice."

12548,"kill enemy, loot, don't find a legendary that you wanted , save and quit. Never ending cycle"
12549,super fun game to play with friends. its a little glitchy but still fun!
12550,It's fun to just run around and shoot stuff.  I like open world games like this and Just Cause 3 and GTA 5.
12551,make sure gore is on

12554,"Nice humor, nice gameplay, nice story. :D"
12555,So fun to co-op with friends!
12556,"Not a good game, have heard way too many good things about this game, but did not live up to expectations at all!

During my playthrough, I experienced a glitch at the flying boat that does not let me progress further into the story!

Bad game!"

12562,genuinely forgot this game was made in 2012. very cool game
12563,"+ the comedy

12565,epic
12566,As interesting as watching paint dry

12568,This game has always been a pleasure. wish i could play with my buds on pc while im away on my switch.

HEAD GUARD
Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)
After him!
GUARDS
He's getting away! Get him! This way!
Turn!
Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally.
Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared
for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He
quickly hides behind Shrek."
12570,"best game ever, legendary"
12571,best game
12572,very good game if you like shooters with story and abilites that differ from character to character
12573,"I don't have anything bad to say... just a really good game. tons of guns, a long story lines with plenty of side quest to keep you glued to the screen for hours. nothing feeling tedious. and let me say. this game has a lot of guns and yeah.... a lot of guns. extremely unique and questionable guns...."
12574,super fun even in 2021  amazing game with awesome story
12575,It's pretty good
12576,yes
12577,pretty good game for 2012 but still prefer the 2011 lego millennium falcon with 1000+ pieces. ate that set in under two days
12578,"Pretty fun game that is kept interesting by the weapons. But like the first game, 99% of the weapons you find are junk, yet finding that one OP gun is always fun. Quests are pretty standard, enemies are more varied, but the map is 10 times the size of BL1, so there is always plenty to explore."
12579,wow
12580,krieg is in it
12581,good
12582,"Great to play with friends, witty and brilliant story. Great selection of character traits and guns. This game pretty much lets you decide how you want to play it. Got it on offer and have to say its £5 well spent. I judge a game on how good it is by seeing if I would play it again. I see myself playing this game several times over. Wasn't actually that into the first one but the developers have put a lot of effort into this one and it tells. Of course this review is far overdue, but its 2021 and I would see myself playing this over a lot of games that have been released recently. You don't ""need"" a brilliant spec computer but it helps having a general new laptop/pc. I played it for a while on my 2017 Surface laptop and it held up pretty well. Frame rate was a bit dashy when loading new map areas but FPS was generally fine which I found quite surprising due to its vast detail. Anyways, great game. If you've got a friend (or 2/3) get them to play with you as it makes it all the funner."

12594,Epic Game XDDDD
12595,"Borderlands 2 was my starting point in the borderlands franchise. It is an incredible game with crude humor, gore, violence, and of course- Moxxi. From the DLC of Bunkers and Badasses, to playing as Gaige, I've enjoyed the game greatly over the years. Borderlands 3 may have better movement and graphics, but the story of Borderlands 2 is where I started and it holds a special place. I definitely recommend this game to anyone wanting to play a loot n' shoot."
12596,Fun to play with friends and chill. Very satisfying to blow off enemies heads with a sniper!
12597,"You may have to play this on Console. the game will run at 120fps for me easily in any zone, right up until combat initiates, in which the game will begin to run at around 15 - 20 frames per second. No solution has worked, and I believe it is an issue that stems from PhysX not being optimized for a lot of graphics cards, mine included.

Using an RX580."
12598,"good game its fun 
"
12599,"Brilliant shoot & loot game with over 17 million guns to choose from, loads of DLC's and wacky off beat characters making the story line and gameplay extremely intruiging.

12647,"This is perhaps the greatest story-driven looter shooter of all time. the procedurally generated weapon variations, character specialization, movement and physX, plus multiplayer, cel shading and top-tier voice acting.  i wish i was good enough to be a paid shill; this game is that good.  don't even get me started on the dlc. that would take a while, and i would rather be playing.  besides, for me to say anything is spoilerrific in and of itself.  you should just play it if you haven't already."

But the only issue I have with this is that every time I meet Lilith in the Iceberg, It would not prompt me to revive her after I have to jump off the platform in order for it to work. After that, it shows the prompt, then she just sits there and do nothing, not letting me progress the story/game. I know that I am very late but I hope that someone can help with this situation."
12659,yes
12660,"negative reviews remind me of those niche i cry about everything subreddits. This game is dank and way more fun on pc vs the old console days. 120+ fps on a mid range pc, super quick fast traveling, and 0 crashes."

12741,"I'm so fond of the story, characters, and the theme of Borderlands 2. I mean I'd be a fan if it were just these factors defining a video game; but, playing through a same invariable gameplay with unchanging challenges for more than 25 hours got erosive and ultimately I couldn't help stop playing the game at like 95% of it's story missions. (now, like Mando, I hate droids and I also hate fighting them)
I don't really wanna give this game a thumbs down, but I think I have to. I didn't entirely enjoy the game, and I didn't joyfully finish playing it, so I'm not gonna recommend it to anyone.

P.S. : Yet I love Borderlands. I'm looking forward to watching the upcoming movie and I someday might play the Telltale game."

12753,"What an awesome game. It took my like 4 attemps, I think I had refunded it twice before it grew on me. Don't play it if you have garbage computer. You will ruin the experience.

There is just one UBER downside in my opinion. This fucking model of driving dude. Whoever came up with that should be impaled and forced to drive this shit with a log up their ass for eternity. And yes I have changed it to ""traditional"" but it didn't change how the mouse works. What a tilting piece of shit, especially when you need to drive in those timed missions.

Other than that everything is insanely good.

And yes - I SIDED WITH THE IRISH, FUCK THE REDNECKS"

Furthermore, I experienced so many bugs in Borderlands 2. Have to save & quit many times. But it's a fun game to play with your friends. Gameplay was better than the first one in terms of mechanic and weapons. Weapons were super cool tho. Just bought the DLC for Borderlands 2 but haven't tried them yet.

I like the game, rich story, satisfying weapons and overall great combat."
12797,The art is amazing even in 2021 and the game is so much fun and very rewarding.
12798,"its a really good game for $5.  

i hate the leveling and inventory management. most would agree.

*levels up, spends 5-10 minutes in menu just choosing perks, and trying to figure out if that level 12 gun shooting 100 dmg is better than the level 6 gun shooting 120dmg. walks towards objective, oops, another firefight and another 10 minute menu.... its cumbersome, more than it needs to be. in fact, all borderlands games are like that, and it only slightly improves in bl3. i like the games but that is the worst thing about them, next to the stupid leveling system. 

like another has mentioned, there really isnt any skill wall or tactics involved, you can be a phenomenal shooter and the best gun for your level but the minute you go against someone a few levels higher (even just a regular psycho) your guns are ineffective.  its literally just this equation:    Farm lower levels till you are at higher level, go do objective with that level, rinse repeat.

also, the whole ""lets make 50 different types of damage and assign one of each or even none to each weapon you pick up"" which by the way every 15 ft you step you will need to open your menu and manage your inventory.

look past all the dumb stuff and its still a good 5 dollar game. i keep saying 5 bc it regularly goes on sale for that. grab it on sale. enjoy the cringe"
12799,yes/10
12800,GOAT!!!!!!!!!
12801,its epic
12802,"This game is an incredibly fun and chaotic adventure with lovable characters and even more lovable villains. Even just idle talk between the enemy bandits can be really entertaining. The range in classes you can play makes it so there's a little something for just about anyone from sniping at crazy long distances to literally killing everyone by hitting them with the butt of your gun. The environments continue to change as you progress through the games, your abilities become more enjoyable to use as you see your character grow, and Handsome Jack always has a great story to tell you about how much you suck in some hilarious way as you do your best to stop his plans. There are references to so many different games from Dark Souls to Minecraft hidden throughout the world, and I would recommend this game to anyone, and I would especially recommend this to any groups of 4 or less looking for a game to play with their group. It has really great replay value with multiple classes and random drops from enemies, and the ""badass tokens"" always give you fun challenges to look for to make your character stronger, even if it's only a tiny bit at a time, it adds up. Borderlands is a must play for everyone in my opinion"

It is not a skilled fps, it uses levels and if you enemy has higher level then you are not going to beat the enemy. Very bad logic of enemyes, because they just run and shoot, no tatcitcs. Overall very bad FPS game. Do not waste your money on this game!!!"

12860,I love this game. It is super fun and easy to get into. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it!
12861,"This game has a lot going for it, and I can see its appeal. For me, the shooting was fun but sluggish, with the usual mentioned problem of bullet-sponging. That was the highlight. The quests felt like I was being fed looter-shooter applesauce, and I didn't like that so much.

I'm an exploration-oriented player, and very little of that was ever compelling to me in this game.

I also like NPCs and RPG stuff, but the cartoonish style here was annoying, off-putting, and generally trying too hard. It was like Fallout's cousin who smokes meth except he only pretends to smoke meth.

I'm not an anti-violence gamer by any means, but the casualness of it in the NPC characters and stories seemed a little tone-deaf, as in, why should I care what happens in this world if they don't?

Finally, the guns-guns-guns loot system was tedious, especially considering the made-for-console inventory system which made it difficult to compare stats. At the same time, I love Torchlight 2, which makes the process a lot easier."
12862,"i wish i could stop dying, its getting to the point where i cant find enough money to keep reviving myself lol but other than that its a pretty cool game."
12863,"Loot system, cum cavern"
12864,"I have been playing this game since it came out and I can say without a doubt it is my favorite game of all time. You can beat the game through 3 playthroughs and then an additional 8 with the op levels, infinite weapons generator and an amazing story line. If you can get into it you will be hooked for life."
12865,Very fun. I do ask of you 1 simple question. Where would this game be if the first game didn't exist?

12893,This game is grind type of game which is something that I enjoy so if your into that then this is the game for you. It also has a really good story.
12894,
12895,"Look, we all just need to admit that the story of Borderlands 2 is two good stories stapled together by two teams that clearly were not talking to each other.

The main story is a serious story about colonialism, war, and the unintended consequences of our actions.

The side stories are goofy violent romps.

These do not even slightly mix and actively punish you for trying to enjoy either. 

For example, a later sidequest makes explicit reference to the NewU system that brings you back to life when you die...despite the fact that the ENTIRE MAIN STORY doesn't work if you're thinking about that detail.

In retrospect, Gearbox's administration being an absolute disaster is something we REALLY should have seen coming.

As for the gameplay...it's ok. Gearbox tried some crap with ""golden keys"", but they're easy enough to bypass. Gun play feels good, guns feel interesting and different. Bandit guns are almost completely worthless, but that can be overlooked. However, it is SO easy to not have necessary equipment to get through the game. It's one thing for randomized loot, it's quite another for merchants to be basically useless. 

Expect to be taunted during that stupid beacon defense section...and for them to acknowledge that thing again! HAVING CHARACTERS ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING MAKES IT PART OF THE STORY! LEARN HOW TO WRITE FFS!

I feel a bit strange not recommending, but given Pitchford's abusiveness, the disaster of a story, and the fact that EVERYONE keeps worshiping this thing, I feel obligated to even the score a little.

Consider once Gearbox cleans house."

12910,"Borderlands 2 possibly the best way you can spend 5 bucks on steam, and buying Borderland 2 for yourself and 3 friends is probably the best way you can spend 20 bucks on steam.

I'm just going to warn anyone reading this of one thing: Don't go past level 50. Borderlands 2 was clearly built from the ground-up to accommodate a level cap of 50. When you go past level 50 and into Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, the game's core strengths begin to break down and everything becomes monotonous & unbalanced. I would recommend getting all 6 vault hunters to level 50 before you take any of them to level 51."

12920,br
12921,i would highly recommend this game it's rlly fun
12922,So much to do with different characters and loot to try. Lots of replayability and very fun in multiplayer co-op with friends. It's worth it just to hear Handsome Jack voice his lines.
12923,"I really haven't touched this game in quite a while, probably about 8 years or so. I bought it during the Summer Sale and started playing it frequently again, seeing if anything changed, what I did and what I didn't remember, if people are still active, and if it still has the same touch as before. 

 I can confirm that this game has aged incredibly well. It is a very detailed, fun open-world game that is challenging and also charismatic and charming. There is a lot to do when it comes to side quests, and there are lots to offer directly from the main quest. I won't forget to mention all the DLC in this game as well, which frequently goes on sale. You can have a lot of fun without the DLC as well, just from the standard game. 

 It's $20, easy to run, and it's fun. I wouldn't not recommend this game, it doesn't hurt to get and play once in awhile.

12952,Best tea party ever.
12953,love the series just that simple. if you dont then ill cri big tears
12954,"After playing Bl3 I can say for sure that Bl2 is far superior, not exactly from a mechanics perspective. Being able to slide, more free flow movement and the gun play in Bl3 are far better but in context of story, characters and world Bl2 takes the cake by miles. 

Keeping it simple. Bl2 is able to deliver a fitting story with exceptional characters to boot. It built on everything Bl1 did right and fixed everything wrong namely villans bosses and weapons to an extent. Across console and pc I've easily put 200hrs into Bl2 and to this day enjoy hoping on and trying something new which is Bl2's biggest strength, Replayability. 

I'm not great at reviews so I'll end it there and sum it up with Bl2 will forever be a timeless classic that will easily hold It's own against any other installment. All I ask is if Gearbox decides to remaster Bl2 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST REMASTER THE CURRENT GAME, DO NOT FEEL THE NEED TO REBUILD THE STORY, CHARACTERS OR ANYTHING PLEASE.

The gunplay and interfaces feel good and there are essentially an infinite amount of different guns and ways to play. If you're looking for a game to play casually, Borderlands is for you, if you're looking for a game to grind for hundreds of hours on to get the best items, Borderlands is also for you. Fair warning though, Handsome Jack is such a good antagonist that you will always be aware of how other games' stories don't come close to this one. I originally played this game before Borderlands 1 and this game's story stands on its own perfectly (even if you do not have the overall context or recognize returning characters), do not feel pressured to play these games in any particular order."

13013,claptrap sus😳
13014,"Borderlands 2 is the best looter shooter made so far, combine that with an amazing cast of characters and one of the best DLCs ever made, BL2 is still seated on its throne.

I've played well over 1000 hours of BL2, between the 360 version and here on steam. Only reason i even bought it here, aside from a great price for everything they ever made for the game, was the BL2 Reborn mod that fixes and changes ALOT of the shortcomings BL2 has. If you are a long time fan of BL2, and want more or are just tired of SLAG being so horrible of a design choice, i HIGHLY recommend Reborn. If you're looking for a single playthrough, or just not interested in the end game, BL2 is still an amazing game, the end game is just for the build elitists that want to build the perfect min-max possible.

Borderlands 2 is still considered the best for a reason. Even after 2 main games being released after this, its still being played like its brand new. Hours of free DLC, 100's of builds to follow, and rather large community still looking for a 4th to help kill Haderax, BL2 is still alive and kicking. On sale with every DLC, $10, THATS a damn good deal.

13024,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
[b] Old game that comes off as tasteless and with forced humor being prioritized above everything else. [/b] 
 
 
 
Sluggish movement, boring action and combat that just turns into meaningless numbers after a while. Even tho this is a first person shooter with a heavy emphasis on guns, the gun play is pretty bad and the whole 17 million guns thing is just bait. The guns in this game are rarely interesting or worth the try, most of the time not very different from each other.
If you boil it down to actual different guns and cut the nonsense like different levels and parts with minor stat differences you probably wouldn't even get past a 100 unique guns. The story in this game is mainly comedic themed and mostly nothing else but isn't actually funny which translates to a cheap, bland and predictable story with forgettable characters and events. And the way they just keep stretching it for sequels is just scummy at this point. Oh the big shiny vault with the cool ""treasure"" inside it was a lie and not a cool ""treasure"", well there is this even bigger shinier vault with this even cooler ""treasure"" inside... wow.
There are some ""cry now"" moments that you really wouldn't care enough to even remember. From a game standpoint nothing interesting happens anywhere in the game to the point that it feels like a joke and it basically is. Everything in this game is either a chore or a needlessly inconveniencing mechanic to the point that as soon as we (My friend and I) got somewhere in the game he told me I should install some community made mods to either fix or make some task easier. I literally can't see a single reason why you would want to play this because even the friend I was playing with only played so he could keep farming a single boss over and over to get a pointless gun that evaporates normal enemies but is useless after like 15 minutes when you have leveled up which not only feels exhausting but does not feel rewarding at all since how overpowered it is at first, basically mindless busywork. Also the pacing is just going freestyle at this point, with lots of downtime and rather disappointing action. The soundtrack was so generic and meh that I can't remember a single track, I don't even know if it had any. Overall maybe give it a go with a friend if you want since it's cheap but it wasn't fun for me. And again you can like things so if you like it, idc go play it but that doesn't change the fact that this game in two words is just a forgettable mess. It only got to where it is because its goofy and wacky characters that are so lmao out loud epic funny relatable got memed. ""Somebody open me up and put out the fire in my belly... Put it out with knives and bullets and strangling, or I will eat your nephews..."" 2013 humor I guess is why people still defend it now. also they put ads in the game and messed up everyone's mods I guess"

13060,I love this game! You can replay it a million times with each characters and its just as fun. Playing with friends is better.
13061,"Please play this game, if you have not played this game you are late to the party. Quirky characters wonderful art and a story that holds up to this day, I cannot recommend it enough. As long as Gun-play, Action, Combat, and Hilarity match your general idea of a good game this one will surely top the leader board. Thank you."
13062,cool game
13063,Amazing game play it asap
13064,favorite game
13065,uyes
13066,Boos Stamp Of Approval
13067,"While is does have a good story and Handsome Jack is an amazing villain, the rest of borderlands 2 is downright bad.

Balancing is way off since in the other difficulties you can get melted in to shots from a tediore pistol, unless you only use certain builds and items. why in a game with this much stuff am I being restricted to a set of playstyles, aren't games supposed to be fun? I love challenges in my games but this is just insanity

along with that, bosses are just utter BS, even in normal mode they melt you in 2-3 hits, and many bosses are just beefed up versions of regular enemies. along with that, you can kill every boss in the game and you'll be lucky to get just ONE legendary 

speaking of legendary gear, they may as well be non existent, like i said, I killed every boss and only got one legendary and its a fucking GUB. while call it a looter shooter if there's no loot. also pearlescents, you can just throw those away since 90% of the pearlescents are garbage, with the only good ones being the butcher, the avenger and the bekah, and aren't these supposed to be rarer than the legendaries? oh and seraph's are slightly better but they still suck, 80% of all the guns in borderlands 2 are shit. 

speaking of loot, the generation is garbage. one time i killed the warrior while playing as gaige, and I got TWO handsome jack masks, one purple and the other being orange rarity. what's the difference?! they're the same face customization just one is rarer than the other. the legendary one isn't even a different color like gold or maybe diamond studded. it's a regular fucking jack mask.

pre-sequel and 3 are better worth your time"
13068,"10/10, so replayable that I've bought it on 4 different consoles ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
13069,"fun
"
13070,Great adventure shooter! Random elements make it a lot more enjoyable and replayable!
13071,It's personally one of my favorite games of all time. I never get bored of this game.
13072,this is really good lol pls play this game
13073,"its a really fun game, there can be some annoying glitches or random crashes"
13074,:>
13075,<3
13076,Alot of fun!  With friends especially.
13077,This game is so addicting that I killed Mick Zaford 1350 times in one sitting
13078,"(I then realize I need to review more games)

Borderlands 2 is still to this day, an absolute gem of a videogame, with it's Bang-Bang Shooty-Looty fun experience, the game always throwing a new toy for you to play with and it's a blast with friends. 
This game has brought me through some tough times in my life and I always return to it to have a pleasant murder-spree against one of the best villains in gaming, Handsome Jack."
13079,Definitely one of favorite games out there!
13080,DPHA FARM
13081,Its got a couple of cool guns
13082,vely good
13083,SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!

13085,"GET READY TO FACE THE MOST ICONIC VILLAIN IN THE GAME HISTORY!

Borderlands 2 is a mix of RPG and FPS with great story and fun times all around. The base game contains four classes, each one with unique skills and suggested play-style (which the player is not forced to follow, but will help making most used of the characters' skills).

It's a perfect game to play with friends or alone. The game excels at gun diversity. You'll find guns of every kind of shooting pattern and unique abilities. As a RPG, bosses and certain monster drops unique loots, which usually makes you want to farm it until it drops the equipment you want. But overall, the game is not grindy.

There are a plethora of fun side quest that lighten the feeling of doing side quest, for those that are only used to doing main quests. They are totally worth doing. The main villain (Handsome Jack) is probably the most remarkable villain in game history. They created such a great characters of him and it's one of the best reasons to play this game.

Borderlands 2 is definitely a game everyone should've played by now, since it offers a unique experience of humor and shooting."
13086,insane experience w friends
13087,"This game is not like a regular first person shooter. it is very run and gun, and it is very fun to play, both playing solo or playing with friends, it is very fun either way. It has some language, and blood, and themes in it, but it is not really a REAL mature rated like witcher series, it is more in the middle between teen and mature. But all in all, I love this game, very fun, and also a good story line as well. (Also, just a recommendation, don't just get borderlands 2 game of the year, just buy the handsome collection, it gives you more skin customization than if you just bought the game of the year, even if you don't want to play the other borderlands game that is included in the handsome collection, just get the handsome collection, its worth getting during the steam summer sale."
13088,face pie !!!!!!!!!!!!!
13089,Awesome game....
13090,I've been playing this game since it came out and it is by far my all time favorite game.
13091,Yes
13092,"Fun to shoot and kill everyone in your path. Easy to follow and ignore the story. Play with friends for extra fun and rage. Jump on top of everything and be in the way of your friends. 

A must play tbh."
13093,yes
13094,"Not much to say. If you liked the first one, this one brings even more to the table."
13095,"Once a upon a time i had a friend that is so close to me. We used to be best buddies, we used to play this game a lot. Now we dont speak each other, idk who's fault is that. It ain't matter anymore. Everytime i see this game on my library it reminds me old good days with em.... I just feel like to share it."
13096,"Solid graphics, nice story, enemies, etc. Although the difficulty can get high at times, the game is really well done and its not impossible, although on the harder side. Very engaging, and very rich game all around."
13097,"I would be playing BL1 right now if it were available on Linux. Borderlands 2 has many ""quality of life"" improvements over it's predecessor. Unfortunately it lost something the first game had: exciting gameplay. 

BL2 is all mellowed out, it doesn't have the crazy good weapon drops you got in the first. Not to mention they REMOVED weapon skill lvling. 

All in all BL2 is good. The End"
13098,....
13099,
13100,its borderlands 'nuff said! 5/5 *****
13101,s
13102,yes
13103,"I really don't know what to say since I don't have anything negative to say.
The game has good sound and level design the character are also very entertaining .
And I must say the game has aged very well.
Would recommend getting the Handsome collection for Pre-sequel but if thats too much I would recommend getting it in a sale or one of those websites like Instant gaming / mmoga / g2a where you can get it for cheaper since its been out for a bit now."
13104,"I got paid 2,800 dollars to shoot a guy in the face."
13105,play with friends

13117,I've beaten this game two times so far and I honestly never get tired of it. I enjoyed playing this single player and with friends as well.
13118,Kind of a shame that this is still the best borderlands...
13119,very very very fun but get handsome jack collection it can go for like $5 good deal

13125,yes 100% recommend very fun very cool campaign. loved shooting Jack In The Face With A Revolver.
13126,"i played the whole franchise on PS3/PS4 when they first came out, and lord were they fun, the whole granchise takes the normally boring grind-y RPG game and puts a load of comical humor in it, from CL4P-TP (Claptrap) and his whitty jokes, to the names of some items, like theres a shotgun named ""Scalible Facetime"", its a OP ass shotgun from Hyperion, but its all that plus the comic book feel, the whole experience, from introducing for instance: ""Zer0... as a number"" just cant help but make you laugh"
13127,"GAME

13128,"gun go pew
face go PLBHLBLHT
level go up
money go cha-ching"
13129,It's ight. haven't played much tho.
13130,FUCKING CUNT
13131,just nah.
13132,"Huge single player content, fun multiplayer

But...

Personally, I had loads of issues with launching and crashing and lost save files.

As for the game itself, it was (is) a lot of fun. Crazy weapons, even crazier characters, lots to explore and loot, immersive atmosphere, and so on. Only the technical issues, to which I could not find a permanent solution, made me stop playing it."
13133,fun guns go brr
13134,Its a game play it
13135,boob
13136,Farming for infinity is the last layer of hell and zer0 unkempt bore on bnk3r is the sin that got me there

Great game overall"
13138,𝙃𝙤𝙩 𝙂𝙖𝙢𝙚
13139,Everything
13140,quite a fun game for single and multiplayer.
13141,A great follow up to my favorite game of all time
13142,like being inside a blender but somehow also boring
13143,"3 Step plan; Drink water, Befriend Shade, Watch your back."
13144,Worst game i have ever bought the game is like a offbrand version of some jordans this game is actually bad dont buy it dont even waste your money on this buns game.
13145,great game and loads of fun and a real treat to anyone who is into the loot and shoot type of game. Many types of characters and weapons so have a go
13146,"fun game i have 400+ hours on xbox aswell 
"
13147,This game has the worst humor of anything ever published by man
13148,It's Borderlands 2.
13149,cock
13150,"lil bro : oh they copy fortnite character
me : plays doom slayers theme and pick up the shotgun

Dad : oh this character from your brother game what was it fortnite ?
 me : ah shit here we go again"
13151,"Easily the best looter shooter of all time, Maybe top 5 games of all time"
13152,the whole borderlands series is a classic for me and never gets old
13153,"Borderlands 2 is a fantastic shooter looter that lives up to the hype created for it. (With all DLC) 6 playable characters, numerous different customisation options for heads and skins of characters or vehicles and 80 levels to gain (giving only 75 skill points, with one being spent on the action skill itself meaning its 74 points to spend on 3 separate skill trees) plus an over-level mechanic that allows players to reach ""Overpowered"" 1-10. 

It features a balanced and fair combat system that gets progressively harder the more challenging the player chooses the gameplay to be, with enemies being stronger and regenerating health.

The witty humour and good story in this game are perfectly established to the player all-while they enjoy blowing up, shooting or just decimating enemies to loot them afterwards.

An amazing take on the shooter title with a noticeable artstyle that separates it from the realistic.

To sum it up: 10/10, one of my favourite games."
13154,Like among us with less tasks. Garbage ass art style doesnt even look realistic. Would reccomend. 9/10
13155,Great game
13156,"The best looter shooter of all time 
"
13157,yes
13158,"From a series of outstanding looter-shooters, this one stands out. If borderlands 1 started the shooter looter genre, borderlands 2 perfected it. The only issue I found is that the movement can be a bit clunky if you're used to modern shooters. Other than that great game that I think everyone should play."
13159,"Note: This review changes to ""Not Recommended"" if the dialog volume slider is above 0."
13160,"Amazing game, Handsome Jack is one of the best video game villains out there. This game is a fun one to play and one of the few games I have replayed. Worth the time to play."
13161,fun game :)
13162,ja
13163,great game
13164,.
13165,nice game
13166,My favourite Borderlands game.
13167,Gear box: plenty of enemies with the worst level design you can imagine.
13168,Gives me extremely bad headaches but in a good way
13169,yes I own some land in the border.
13170,moxxi is the best part of the game
13171,"Lol,Fun!"
13172,feel bad for claptrap... hahaha! poor fellow
13173,"I mean it's fun and the humor is immature
What more could you want"
13174,Randy Pitchford cannot women
13175,"It's Borderlands, what more needs to be said?"
13176,"7/10 would beat my d1ck to moxxie again
"
13177,"This is really cool, apart from Borderlands 1 it has more optimization and graphics and a lot more guns!  The story of this Borderlands is cool along with the character classes, my favorite is the assassin.  I would recommend playing it, it's worth it!"
13178,"excellent game that I've played for many years, a must have if you are a fan of the looter shooter genre"
13179,"Probably one of the best games of its era
"
13180,good game
13181,"It's Borderlands 2, you know the best one."
13182,"It's fun. It's 1st person Diablo with guns and vehicles? It's fun. There's raunch, there's offensive behaviour. It's fun. It's like Mad Max on planet Katana? It has obscure references. It's fun."
13183,lol you shoot and like pick up weapons

13186,"Solid followup to borderlands 1, all the good things from it with more plots and play styles."
13187,"Eurgh... That's a big nope, for me.
I guess there's nothing really wrong with the game. Mechanics, AI, graphics etc... it's all just fine.
I only found the game Boring AF to play...

Maybe the online multi-player experience is fun, I wouldn't know, I don't do that...
But in actual standalone gameplay, I give it a 2 at most."
13188,Nice game recommended by LABREAKER.
13189,i love this game it the best
13190,"Base game is great, the DLCs are some of the most fun I've ever had.
Specifically Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragonkeep"

13208,good game.
13209,Good game. I wish future borderlands has PvP though.
13210,good game.
13211,"Fun, wacky game. Though the game is a bit too easy, I played it solo, duo and with four and all times it felt too easy, for example I one-shot handsome jack (the big bad guy of the game). Though the gun-play and world is fun enough to say go for it."
13212,great
13213,This is the best game Gearbox have ever made and properly will ever make
13214,like fortnite because there is guns but sadly no skull trooper ;V :V because of this i rate it a 7/10. the cars make up for it because fortnite.
13215,IS BUSSIN PAPI CHURRO
13216,It's pretty aight
13217,"I have 774 hours into this Game , I absolutely love it and 100% Recommend it to the next person . It's a fun Multiplayer or solo if you prefer , Better in every aspect . Friends join more loot type and solo it can be challenging, once again it suits everyone wants has a little bit of everything for everyone action , shooting or just needing something to play . I say hop in with your friends of 4 and get to kill some Bandits and earn rewards and skins for each class ."

thanks randy"
13229,actual best game ever bro
13230,"Whether you play solo or with friends, you will  have fun big time.  The only negative I have found is that the game is bad optimized and a bug here and there."
13231,yeah
13232,Explosions
13233,good game
13234,+
13235,good game. graphics are pretty good and overall the gameplay experience is immersive.
13236,"As a true fan of the Borderlands series, this one shined brightly when it came out, almost overshadowing the original Borderlands. Borderlands 1 started it all unleashing a crew of 4 vault hunters across Pandora's wasteland with limitless weapon arsenal and skill point trees. Borderlands 2 hit, broadened the game in every way especially the story line. This includes the first Shift Key chests, Badass tokens to passive level, a much larger mission log, and more! The DLC is well worth it in this package if you can scoop all at once on sale. As for many co-op games, I highly recommend getting it in with some friends as it can make for an even more entertaining experience."
13237,CAME BACK AND THE GAME IS STILL GREAT
13238,Gun play is amazing and the story and DLC is super good and immersive would recommend
13239,Absolute masterpiece in all kinds of aspects. if you haven't played this game yet you are missing out on the greatest villains ever. 10/10
13240,claptrap my beloved
13241,Lots of good retarded fun with friends. Get the Bunkers and Badasses DLC.
13242,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH

13246,"yes
"
13247,8/10
13248,"Let's be honest, you can't beat the OG. Borderlands and Borderlands 2 are still worth buying in 2021 because they are just that good! From the gunplay, to the unique looter shooter style brought by the franchise, everything about this game still stands up to it's predecessor."
13249,"This series is simply put, one of the best game series to hit the market."
13250,this game is full of great content and has very good planned missions

13267,Just do it!
13268,already finished it on xbox and still one of my favorites
13269,"The best of the Borderlands games (if you get all the DLC). I have over 1k hours on this on Xbox. Bought it for PC mainly to see the better graphics and to support the devs. This is the pinnacle of looter shooter. The comedy is great, the story is great.... got nothing to complain about really. It even nailed the PERFECT villian."
13270,"inconsistent server issues. Lag, extremely poor in co-op sessions. can't recommend to anyone. Horrendous game."
13271,pretty damn fun wiht reinds
13272,Awesome
13273,good
13274,"A few years ago my uncle introduced me to this game, it was his favorite game, at first i didn't see the appeal but then the more i played it i understood why he liked it so much, and now years later it is one of my top 3."
13275,"it was a fun game, loike a lot."
13276,"Great game, hilarious characters, lots of fun. Get it. Enjoy it."
13277,great game
13278,"easy to grasp and a great story with heaps of dlc to add on to the story elements
"
13279,pretty gud. still hate that u have to do side missions in order to progress the main story due to difficulty.
13280,gud game
13281,"My three friends and I had a miserable time playing this game for the few hours we played it. Despite having high powered PC, the performance was not great and the networking left a lot to be desired. The second mission softlocked us, and the game was generally not fun to play. Borderlands 3 dramatically improves on these issues. Play that game if you like this type of game."
13282,"they should have spelt Borderlands like Borederlands game is only fun with some friends and it still gets Boring also i dont know what it is with every character and rambling on the comms and being very cringy had to turn my audio off for the game because EVERY single npc character talks for waaaay to damn long and as often as they can and about absolutely nothing  do people actual enjoy the dialog? 

would only recommend on sale and if you got a couple buddies to spare, gun play is fun but all the sights suck and the characters you can play as (except the dlc) are practically the same from the first one only difference is Boulder or Brock or Brick whatever the punching dudes name was from the first game they replaced him with a guy with dual guns LMAO"
13283,guud
13284,good game
13285,best game all around brings back memories
13286,One of the best games of all time.

13288,The best borderlands game by far
13289,"A great game with plenty to keep you playing after beating the game's main story content, even without *any* of the DLCs."
13290,"Great and fun combination of RPG game and shooter game.
It has a cool comedy like story with very good voice acting. 

You'll have to like cartoonish style graphics thats for sure."
13291,what're you reading reviews for? ask any of your friends if this game is good. at least one of them has played and loved this game.

13330,"Borderlands 2 is one of my top 15 all time greatest games. I have owned this across multiple platforms and have spent many many hours of fun on this one. Shooting and leveling up, interesting weapons, intriguing quests, and highly amusing characters all come together in this masterpiece. Yes the game shifts a little towards being a hero in this as opposed to borderlands however there are still plenty of questionable activities your character can partake in for money and xp. Borderlans 2 is a superior game indeed."
13331,yes
13332,"Oyun çokta kötü değil, fakat oyunda level sistemi var. Görevlerde siz düşmana 30-40 vururken düşman size 150-200 vuruyor. Habire ölüp durdum oyunda kanser etti resmen. Level sistemi oyunun ağzına etmiş. Arkadaşla oynamak şart bu oyunu tek başınıza oynayacaksanız sakın almayın derim."
13333,"Borderlands 2 holds a very special place in my heart. It was one of my very first purchases on Steam, it has been consistently in the top ten most played games in my library, and it is a game I have a severe love-hate relationship with. 

To start with, Borderlands 2 is chock-full of content. I've extracted three hundred plus hours out of it across seven or eight playthroughs, and I'm sure that new players will have similarly rich experiences with the game. While I will note that the quest and level design is by far the worst part of the experience, the game never felt repetitive or lackluster. You will fight hoardes of varied enemy types and units across multiple environments that all feel relatively unique as far as visual design goes. There are dozens of side quests to complete, and most successfully avoid the blander approach to quest design that more recent games from developers like Ubisoft or Bethesda have consistently displayed. The game's cell shaded graphics are dated, but make up for their lack of crispness with a stylistic approach to design. The liquid effects are also rather dated, but have surprisingly decent physics effects for their era. 

There are some things I feel that Borderlands 2 does fumble the ball with however. While the game is advertised as having near limitless loot drops via proceedural generation, the majority of what you will find is absolute shit. Even blue or purple rarity gear is not exempt from this, and the vast majority of the weapons you will find are barely distiguishable from whatever you were using before. For example, a level 24 blue-rarity Dahl SMG will be almost exactly the same gun as a visually different level 24 blue-rarity Maliwan SMG. The only difference is in the manufacturer passives, and at least four of those (Bandit, Dahl, Maliwan, and Vladof) are pretty shit ways to distinguish guns. 

Vladof fires faster? Well, no, because that Hyperion green-rarity gun that just dropped from a random animal has a higher fire rate and deals more damage per shot. These guns are the same level and rarity, yet the Vladof gun is not, in fact, a faster firing weapon despite that being their thing. 

That Maliwan SMG you've been using for about five minutes has a better elemental proc chance, right? Well, no, because this Bandit SMG that you just picked up off the floor has a elemental proc chance much higher, and so does this random Dahl pistol of a lower level and rarity. 

The problem is primarily with the proceedural generation. While it's all well and good to have a impressively large number of potential weapons to choose from, it's completely meaningless if all of the guns are functionally identical, right down to haptic elements like sound and effects. It just all blurs together. The only stuff that's actually worth anything is the Legendary and Unique drops, and most of the unique guns are just regular weapons with a different skin. The red text doesn't mean anything, and is mostly used to reference other properties in other mediums. That's not even going into this rather nasty bug with the generation system that can result in a weapon with zero magazine capacity, which makes the gun absolutely useless as it has no ability to actually fire anything. Fortunately, this is infrequent. 

Moving off weapons, another big issue is the level and quest design/writing. Levels are very nice to look at, but a lot of them are slightly too large for what they offer. Notable offenders include the second level of the game, the Bloodshot Dam, and the Hyperion Wildlife Exploitation Preserve; all of which involve a lot of running through unreasonably large levels, which bogs down the pacing of the level, and can be a slog if you're even a single level beneath the area average. Further annoyances come from the scarcity of checkpoints. If you die right before the next respawn station, expect a lot of running through areas devoid of enemies to reach the point where you last were. Also, if you quit the game for whatever reason, you are sent back to the level entry, and all enemies respawn and reset. This is annoying. 

Writing is...well...mixed? There's some really great writing, but mixed in is a lot of rather...cringy...stuff. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for being polite to women, but do we really have to be beat around the head with the message? At length? In the most ham-fisted way imaginable? The problem is that I'm not here to discuss politics and social conundrums. I'm here to stitch bandits and robots with ludicrous amounts of bullets, blow shit up, and hit things with my fist. This shit just takes me out of the zone, and it's not really necessary overall. There are better forums than a looter shooter to soapbox. 

Overall, I give the thumbs up to Borderlands 2. It is a game I have had a lot of good times with, and I hope that you (if you happen to be a newcomer to this game) will have a lot of fun as well. I just feel that giving Anthony Burch a pen and putting him in charge of writing for this game was a bad idea; along with procedural generation, Checkpoint starvation, and Claptrap. 7.5/10"

13343,"I am a big fan of the the first game, and the second one didnt disappoint. Although I find the story of the first one a bit better, the second one is a consistent improvement pon everything (even the bug, which are still present, but are much less relevant when compared to the ones found in the first of the series)."
13344,"i have a borderlands tatttoo i love this game
"
13345,"I remember playing this with a friend, stealing his loot because I found it funny, realising I can't use it because my friend was level 80 or some shit, and then feeling absolutely horrible because he didn't like that.

Now I cant really play this game that much because I've beaten the game and theres not much to really do aside from get levels. Still good though."

Well its solid

Its a co-op shooter, that isn't busted jank and isn't a direct copy of Left For Dead!!!
What more can you ask for?

Well I guess you could ask for a bit, maybe driving controls that don't suck dirt. Or better balance especially on NG+ cycles. 

Honestly though, if you wanna play something with friends Borderlands is definitely a great series, hundreds of hours easy."

13402,"Buggy as hell game with a very lackluster end game. Without DLC the 2nd playthrough is entirely pointless as you're just mindlessly running through the story albeit very slightly harder. Another problem is the lack of balance. There are plenty of ""Legendaries"" that are flat out pointless, being outperformed by weapons 3 tiers below it. The only saving grace for this game are the community patches that fix a lot of the bugs and balance some of the weapons and characters. Without this, there would be no reason to play the game past the first playthrough."
13403,I like everything about this game. The storyline the weapons and gadgets and characters.
13404,fun game
13405,yes
13406,Borderlands 2 has an amazing story. great multi and single player vibes. I own it on many platforms. just do it
13407,Basicly comic kind a art styled open world first person shooter rpg. Also got some funny puns.
13408,"I'm a big fan of First Person Shooter games and played a lot of older Counter-Strike games, old Call of Duty games decades ago. Borderlands franchise was not one of them in particular. 

When I first heard of Borderlands was from Watchmojo channel on Youtube and said it was one of the best FPS games of it's generations and it included in their own Top 10 FPS games of all time.  I even played with one of my friends who also happens to be a fan of Borderlands and I get to try it out on their Xbox One X and played Co-op with them. I get to try the game with them.  At the first time trying it, I thought this would be just the middle of the iceberg and not just the full meat of the experience. I was wrong. Playing Borderlands solo was exactly the same experience as in Co-op except of course you're alone. Same in Borderlands 2

When I bought this game on Steam, the same time my PC broke down and can't use it for a while and haven't open it since a year later. That's where I was able to snag a used copy of Borderlands GOTY instead of the Borderlands 2 GOTY for the PlayStation 3 in the online marketplace,  
But I'll sum it up why I didn't like this game (My Opinion):

PROs:
*Cel Shading graphics gives it own unique aesthetic of the game.
*Memorable Landmark Locations
*Tons and variety of weapons to choose from based on your role of your character.
* Unique Characters with different abilities gives you sole reason to replay the game in a new save to experience it differently.
*Unique Boss fights with their own respective minions to gives you strategy on how to face them.
*Obtaining Quests and Side Quests gives you the opportunity to explore every parts of the Wasteland.
*CL4PTR4P 
*Cloud Save Feature

CONs:
*OVERLY Repetitive and Bland Shooting gallery. 
*The shooting mechanic is atrocious. Feels flatter than the boobs of my crush in high school. Don't bother even playing it on Xbox controller as if you are on high sensitivity, aiming with Sniper was garbage and I was forced to use the movement stick to aim precisely. It was better on Xbox One to aim but not on old gen console versions. 
*One-liner generic NPCs makes the location with people in it and interaction with the world boring as fck. Also unique NPCs also fcking sucks. Except for some.
*It's an RPG game. Either be less of a person and die quickly because enemies have 2 levels higher than you or be overpowered as hell, almost requiring no skills and tension build-ups because enemies shoots you with a BB Gun. (I have nothing against RPG games, especially good RPG games. In fact, one of my favorite RPG games was Fallout New Vegas and TES 5: Skyrim and my instant favorite Deus Ex GOTY)
*Story? What story? You wouldn't mind the story anyway if you came for the game mechanics and the tedious grind for the role of your character.
*Level locked Guns, Grenade type, Shields, and other enhancements. Which adds another layer of micromanagement to your inventory. Say goodbye to your favorite unique weapon in the next 7 levels because they will shoot like a peashooter when it didn't the meet the level requirements of that certain gun you're using for some specific enemies you're facing. In short, it's BULLETSPONGE.
*DRIVING a Vehicle is trash. You move where you aim.

I rather play RAGE and the most boring Fallout game which is FALLOUT 3 than this bland crap.
I even got a free copy of The Handsome Collection on EPIC Game Store. I still want a refund.
"
13409,its gud
13410,it's fun!
13411,Great game!
13412,"[b] Too Good to miss [/b]

There is so much here in this game with all of its extra content to keep you involved with great storytelling, quests and scenery that surprised me the most. In the beginning of the game I looked up to the sky and was just like, [i] ""that's just beautiful."" [/i] 
Definitely grab this as a bundle with 'B1', 'B2', and 'B-Pre-sequel' which includes all Dlc's for a ludicrous price when on sale.
Also great gun-play, similar to Borderlands 1 but a bit better. And a lot of characters that I've still yet to play as and some neat skills to go along with them."

13418,"One of the first steam games I bought and holds a lot of memories. This game was pretty unique when it came out and still is today, basically creating the looter shooter genre (sorry BL1) and bringing in a whole new experience.

The longer you play the crazier the gameplay gets. Theres a shitload of guns (I think theres supposed to be tens of millions if I'm not mistaken) that all fall into a few gun types. However you don't just pick up whatever has the most damage for each category, but also take into account reloading, accuracy, fire rate and more to pick a weapon that will actually work. It makes the game require some actual thought and strategization instead of the latter (more on this in BL3). The actual looting and shooting part of the game is still pretty unbeaten by games that have tried the same thing since and it really cements BL2 as a great game, and the replayability proves that. Lastly, the comicbook artstyle of the whole game really gives it a fresh feel, and the environments visited, both base game and DLCs, were pretty diverse too and gave each area in the game a very good sense of uniqueness.

The story is pretty notorious due to simply having Handsome Jack being as iconic of a villain as he is. He's complex, tragic, funny, evil, and despite how insane he seems he even has a point at the end of the day. Throughout the story he's always ahead of the protagonists at every turn, always in some unexpected way, and even when he gets beaten he still pulls out another trump card, or he gets serious and really shows his human side. On top of this he is always speaking to you and taunting you, from the moment the game starts to his death at the end. The voice acting is also very well done.

The actual story is a great expansion on BL1 and gives life to characters that previously talked very little, some of which never even spoke at all. The BL1 protagonists became core characters in BL2 and had vibrant personalities to go along with them. The new characters introduced brought a lot to the story as well and became part of the game's identity. The games humor is part of its charm, and for the most part I like it, but sometimes it can come off as a little cringy.

The combat AI is great and provides a good challenge, but the regular AI when it has to move for some animation or talk as part of a quest look laughably bad. Even if this game was made 5 years earlier it would still look bad for this. But even despite its flaws, or its short time to complete, I still enjoy this game a ton and it holds some good memories for me.

PS: If you don't want to ruin the world-building made by the Borderlands franchise, DO NOT PLAY BORDERLANDS 3.

8/10"
13419,"I'm not a big fan of shooters. But man, the story, the sass, it's just all so SATISFYING. I love this game so much, but be warned it is very addicting and you can sink many hours into it. I've mostly only played single player but I imagine it'd be very fun in co-op as well."

13441,hh
13442,"borderlands 2 was for a period in my top 3 games ever when i was much younger, the game is my childhood and i love i grew up with it.
gun plays a pretty solid,
the cut scenes havent aged too well,
the game is imo unreasonable difficult towards the final few missions and some parts of the game havent been thought out too well, id come across many walls not exactly soft locking but common pains in the ass they are 
the music is tight the controlls feel nice the atmosphere is great the graphics have a distinct style and tho aged still look nice sometimes.
this game leans towards the comedy and outlandish side of things instead of deep story and even if most of the time i find the comedy stale it isnt the annoying kind because the characters arent built on only comedy but have a lot of charm roland brick and handsome jack are really lovable characters. 
this game isnt as good as i remember in some aspects but now mature i can see light in its other aspects i didnt notice when younger 7.9/10 great game"
13443,still recommended in 2021
13444,yes
13445,i only did the snowy part. never got past it. 5 hours on the snowy part. i always started it then never finished. 10/10 would reccomend
13446,"A true classic, and best of the franchise."
13447,One of my favorite gun-blazing games
13448,Wont open
13449,"The sheer amount of content in this game in ONE playthrough is pretty staggering. Given that there are six unique Vault Hunters, and that the game ramps things up considerably on subsequent playthroughs, you are looking at a game that probably provides more bang for your buck than anything that has ever been released, and I mean that in all sincerity. If you find yourself enjoying this series, all 4 of them will suck all the free-time out of your life, but Borderlands 2 is especially content rich. There is endless enjoyment here."

13492,"I have played it for a smidge of time, pretty fun and challenging. Super great to be able to do so much stuff and the art style is amazing. Never would spend more then 100 hours on it tho"
13493,pretty cool game :thumbs_up:
13494,its good
13495,yes.
13496,Chad game
13497,"great game, very fun. all the pop culture references are hilarious
"
13498,Cage the blood Monkey!!!
13499,"Good game, handsome jack is so fuckable. Gameplay is good. Voice acting is good. Good."
13500,"It's my first loot and shoot kind of game and it's tons of fun, probably not something I can play without co-op. But the myriad of bugs I've encounter makes it hard for me to recommend it to anyone. Coming across any issues in game and then looking it up online to see hundreds of people encountering the same thing is part of the experience lol

I've played this game twice now and twice I've encountered the same issue of the game losing hours of progress and loading me into a previous part of the game and losing my loot. First time was because I was playing the game offline, and the second time... Honestly? Not a clue. It's an issue with Steam Cloud and while people are saying that you can choose to download or upload which save file you want, seems like it's not even an option anymore since the game doesn't ask that when you boot up the game. Maybe some new update has changed it.

So get the game, but make sure you turn Steam Cloud off in game properties I guess."
13501,"""they're coming out of the wall sphincters"""
13502,If you're penis size is over 9 Inches then you're the only people who can handle this game. If you're penis is any smaller than the size that was given prior then you are not permitted to play this game.
13503,Open Game -> Close Game -> Repeat
13504,loads of fun.
13505,"Honestly, the drop rate on loot in this game is so stupidly low that it's not fun.  They treat this as if its some MMORPG where epic loot gets sold online for hundreds of real life dollars.  HEY IDIOTS, this is a PVE single player game with optional coop, not an MMO.  Loot is important.  LET US ENJOY THINGS.

Honestly, just go play Borderlands 3.  The loot drops there are MUCH MUCH higher.  It's way more fun even if the game itself doesnt have as good a story or antagonist. Who cares? Killing things and getting gud lootz is more important than story in a game like this anyways.

BTW, I tried a 3rd party mod that raises loot drop rate and I spend 4 hours trying to download and install it and I couldn't get it to work.   Seriously, just go play part 3.  Don't waste time on this one."
13506,"its borderlands, if you lived under a rock, you still probably know that this game is a looter shooter that goes for a humorous, cel shaded look to it. you can play like 6 classes,and multiplayer with 3 more people if you want to hate your friends for grabbing that good gun that fell while you were killing the big bad. the game goes on sale for next to nothing on occasion, and if you buy it at that point, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck, and can even get one of the best dlc out there with tiny tinas assault on dragonkeep"
13507,"its was fun
"
13508,"The best Borderlands game so far in my opinion. The story is awesome, Handsome Jack makes such a great antagonist. I also especially recommend playing the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC, if you like fantasy and Dungeons and Dragons. That being said, I'm looking forward to Tiny Tina's Wonderlands!"
13509,Amazing Game!!!
13510,: )
13511,The best FPS  looting game available.
13512,ye poggers game very very good
13513,its not bad but the optimization is so incredibly fucked it always crashes on launch so i cant play it anymore LOL
13514,"Leagues better than the first one, this story had tons of character development, and loads of cool weapons. Handsome Jack may be the best villain you love to hate. The best FPS? yes."
13515,still a good game unlike bl3
13516,Is gud
13517,nice to get back into shooters
13518,yea
13519,"a surprisingly dry game. clunky gunplay, looter shooter grind schlock and boring side missions. some of the set pieces are cool, and the environments and the art design (albeit when its textures arent molesting my eyes with cruddy loading) does alleviate some concerns, but at the end of the day, this is dreadfully dull. also the humor fucking sucks. making a character ironically annoying doesnt change the fact that they are annoying."
13520,fuikc
13521,fun comical fps with so many guns and loot
13522,you deserved so much better in bl3 maya
13523,"looter shooter done right. The story is easy to enjoy without playing the first game and is the highlight of the series. The game also has an insane amount of replayability, hell ive been playing this game on and off for years and i still enjoy myself. definantley worth picking up."
13524,cum?
13525,was worth the 4 times I bought it
13526,funny cartoon man go boom
13527,The Action
13528,Just some average South African documentary.
13529,dives into the duplicitousness of interpersonal relationships
13530,"Yes
"
13531,Just Like Fortnite
13532,"Thé looter shooter. This took the series to it's highest peak in my opinion. The FPS gameplay is solid, although can feel a bit quirky so long after it's initial release. That doesn't change my opinion that this is a very addictive game that will have you hooked on it the moment you start. What's also pretty cool is that this is fun with friends, but also fun by yourself. 

Pretty much all of the legendary characters from the characters make their debut here such as Tiny Tina and Handsome Jack. And the story isn't groundbreaking, but you do want to know where these characters end up. 

One other thing I need to mention is the high quality of the DLCs, especially Assault on Dragon's Keep, which was so popular they made an entire spin-off game around it. 

Great stuff!"
13533,garbo
13534,hehe funny game
13535,"Still the best Borderlands game and one of my favorite games of all time. The writing in this game is both hilarious and deeper than you would expect, while the gameplay and variety of guns make it a blast every time in. Each character is extremely unique and has their own strengths, including the DLC characters which are an amazing addition. Get it and tell your friends to get it too"
13536,"It's aight
my lesbian male friend just got me the game
I bought it
He bought it for me

Gud game"
13537,Excellent co-op campaign with friends
13538,cool af
13539,It's a good time-killer
13540,"would play more if i ddint have to delete often for storage
"
13541,If you haven't done a bit of research and found that Borderlands 2  is a blast you only have yourself to blame.  It's like not being sorry for spoiling Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.  You'll enjoy it.  Just buckle up and enjoy the ride.
13542,This game has a lot of cool numbers
13543,a mixture between comedy and combat.
13544,"-Would recommend the Handsome collection(a lot more content):
   -Borderlands 2 base game
   -All Borderlands 2 DLC
   -Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel base game
   -All Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel DLC
-Great game with one or two guns (so many nice and unique guns)
-Decent story 
-A great and unique visual style"

There is plenty of content to enjoy with the various DLC and even base game. And playing it on PC for a short time made someone like me realize how great using a mouse and keyboard over a controller is. 

I'm happy to come back to this to try something new with it on here over console and I get to play with more friends for a change."

13637,"I was told to give this game a play by a friend, so my first playthrough was multiplayer. I honestly think that it's the only way you could play the game, and even then it was a pretty rough time for me. 

The comedy hasn't aged super well, using a lot of what are now ancient memes and references to internet culture in a way where I'm not certain the devs really used the internet for anything but selling the game. Otherwise, it's pretty tryhard wacky/psychotic. You can tell when someone is going to be the edgy kind of annoying by if they have a Psycho as a profile pic, and I won't lie when I say that harmed my experience going in. Grinding in an FPS is not something I ever asked for. The arena mode is alright, but don't try to blitz it out, give it some time between runs so you don't end up sick of a location or set of enemies, and with the dialogue they spew, it's pretty easy to get sick of. The gunplay is fine, and sometimes mechanics introduced with specific branches of your upgrade tree or gimmicks with a weapon can make for interesting gameplay. If you're playing with a friend, and they tell you to get a phoenix shield, you will never have a challenging fight again, save for secret bosses. Up to you if that's a deal breaker, for me it doesn't matter as much as long as everyone is having fun.

I was told I would be interested in the story, but I really wasn't. Handsome Jack is certainly a complex character, I just was never pulled in by him. I understand what they were trying to do with most of the cast, being lovable and psychotic at the same time by having them be funny, though that requires you find them funny first. If you're like me and you don't, be prepared to be surrounded by bland badass archetypes and the edgy kids from your Jr. High trying to impress you. Otherwise, it's a comedy sci-fi. Even when the game threw twists at me, it felt a lot more like I was going through the motions rather than exploring a world, and though I tried, it was never something I could shake off.

Ultimately, I can't recommend this game, but not because I don't think people should play it. If you find the jokes Borderlands 2 makes in any promotional art or memes your friends give you funny, you'll probably find the rest funny. But be warned, humour is the glue that keeps this game together. If you instead found it tryhardy, or exhausting, or just out of touch, your entire playthrough is going to be painted that way, and nobody wants to be the buzzkill that tells their friends they really don't like a game they're in love with. If you're here for gameplay, story and humor be damned, it's ok, but you'll get more creative ideas and better PVP from other games."
13638,fun game grat one lines and fun kills
13639,"Pretty solid game, picked it up with dlc for $9."
13640,"I have a strong feeling people won't find this review, but if someone does, BUY THE GAME.

Borderlands 2 is massive. It's one of the longest and biggest games you can find in the market, and personally, my favorite looter shooter ever. There is an insane amount of enemies, guns, and variety that no encounter will ever be the same. It literally makes you greedy. You always want to find that next piece of equipment. 

But the reason I love Borderlands 2 so much is that it never takes itself seriously. It's more comedic and over the top than something like Fallout: New Vegas. The characters taunt you, they laugh at you, they crack jokes. It never tries going for emotional moments and long exposition dumps. 

This is why this game is SO fun to play with friends. You'll never feel like you get bored. The map is huge, but it's not empty like other games. It's big, but it's not so big you'll spend hours looking for where to go. Every part of the game feels so iconic. 

I just absolutely love this game. I've been trying to look for a Steam game like this for the past six months. Something that's simple, funny, and addicting, and Borderlands 2 is exactly the game I hoped for. 

Buy this game before the sale runs out. It's literally $5, which feels like a steal to me."
13641,"Ive played this game for years, and I loved it"
13642,My favourite game --  a must play.

13653,one of the best games in the borderlands series the campaign is fun and enjoyable and you can have a ton of fun playing the game with mates.
13654,"When you’ve managed to create an unexpectedly great first entry for a franchise, it begs the question: What the hell do you do with the sequel? In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.
The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun."
13655,yes
13656,Very enjoyable and can get lost in time with this one.
13657,t
13658,"hey you yes you, kind stranger that i wont ever meet on the internet i just wanted to say

i hope you all are doing good and feel loved and should always know that if nobody loves you i will as nobody should feel alone!"

13667,"Great Game, Must Play if you haven't yet !"
13668,"Still amazing, great game too play with friends, pretty challenging at higher difficulties, a lot of nostalgia, and many nights played"
13669,Best played with Friends.
13670,Almost every gun in this game feels fantastic. One of the only games I've played where balance does not get in the way of fun. Guns are overpowered and it's awesome
13671,hard to tell but it is nearly perfect even at 2021...
13672,In my opinion Borderlands 2 is the best game in the series. If you have the opportunity to play the game together with friends...do it! Highly recommended. Great game!
13673,Mindless fun although running/walking /dodging can be annoying and should be fixed
13674,"Still one of my favorite games to this day! Tiny Tina rules!

9/10 bitch wasnt fat enugh"
13685,"incredible game. As someone who has played the whole series on and off since 2011, this was probably the most immersive and incredible gaming experience I've ever had. The scale of the world you are placed in is immense. Each and every story line has amazingly funny and endearing characters. The first and second playthroughs are way too easy because of the leveling problems, but UVM and OP levels make up for that by being insanely hard and challenging. The loot is awesome, and god damn, it cannot be understated just how much content is in this game. Recently, I was playing back through borderlands 3 with a friend, and I was trying to remember what happened in that game. I ended up misremembering whole areas of borderlands 2 as parts of borderlands 3 because of how varied, detailed, and rich the game is. Borderlands 2 is the whole package. Funny, compelling, awesome gunplay, crazy detailed leveling and skill trees, challenging bossing, awesome loot, and DOPE DLC! EVEN THE CHEAP ONES! They are short, sweet, and incredibly enjoyable. 250+ hours of content on just one character AT THE START OF UVHM! THE START! Wow. What a game."
13686,its borderlands 2 you would be crazy not to play craps fun better if ya has friends if ya dont well watch videos as you murder dozens of people

13702,exquisito
13703,Robots in the wasteland. Could not love it more.

13709,"its a good game
"
13710,YES
13711,"Originally I engaged in this wild adventure on the gaming console released November 15, 2013 known as the PS4. This game can keep me entertained for hours and hours on end. It's been a while since I played this game and replaying it really put a tear on my face. I love the story, gunplay, and how it isn't a very demanding game."
13712,The combat was really fun and kept me on my toes. The quirky humor was also very entertaining.
13713,"Guns. More guns. Even more guns. Guns to blow enemies up. Guns to blow yourself up. Guns from vending machines. Claptrap. Guns that go boom. Guns that go pew pew pew. Guns with friends. Guns with the family. Guns guns guns.

This game is the best in the series and is seriously cheap to buy in a bundle when on sale. If you haven't played it yet, then you aren't living your life.

Rating: 9.5/10
Recommend Price: Full price, but you can almost always find this game at first sale prices in a bundle."
13714,"good
"
13715,I've played this game for more the 46 hours I've actually been playing for almost 9 years now and still haven't run out of things to do its by far one of my favorite games and would endorse it to anyone looking for a really good game.

Death trap is my best friend"
13717,gg
13718,"I've played this game for years it is one of the most addictive and fun to play games i have ever played. the unique fps has a bunch of mechanics that go beyond any expectations. the game itself is super funny and interesting making  sure to never run out of things to to. the game lets you do whatever you want basically, don't want to to the story right now go ahead and explore the world they have given you. the game is littered with side quest that are hilarious. and thats just talking about the base game not including The many fun dlc's in the game!"
13719,yes!
13720,Super recommend! Much fun! Lots of boom boom!
13721,this game is good if you like men or women or anything else
13722,Pretty good game
13723,Claptrap still doesn't know what having a bellybutton feels like. This brings me indescribable amounts of joy.
13724,"Unbelievably fun. Grab 3 other people and you can spend 200 hours on this easily and not even play 1/3rd of it. I just wish 3 would have been an improvement on this. Instead they went backwards. Play this, but stop here. Don't go to BL3."
13725,gave me a boner
13726,very good game
13727,"If you don't automatically love this game, you are a bad person..."

13738,"I came back to Borderlands 2 after a few years of not playing it. Found out that the level cap was raised and there are now two new OP levels and a new DLC.

Let me be clear. I have bought most of the DLC. I don't mind paying for DLC. I understand that extra content is optional. I don't even mind balance changes. (The mod scene can help remedy any balance issues as seen with the unofficial community patch)

But here is where I draw the line. Making previously owned and playable content unavailable until you buy a new DLC is gross and should honestly be a crime.

I was at OP 8 on one of my builds with Salvador. Before I quit I was testing different builds and getting ready to farm for certain items for my other characters. I am now unable to play the various other parts of Digistruct Peak that I previously had access to. I am not going to sit here and act like this is okay. I have OP8 Weapons and all the enemies are now level 72. How fun is that supposed to be? How come I can't AT LEAST play OP 8 like I used to!? Why would you take, no, STEAL content that players ALREADY HAD ACCESS TO!? This is unacceptable. I will be damned if I pay for the last DLC. I have seen a lot of BS pulled by this industry but I never thought you people would actually screw over your long time loyal fanbase by stealing content from them that they had previous access to in order to push a 15 dollar DLC that you refuse to put on sale currently. I hope you guys rot for this decision. Catch me sailing the seas for the final DLC because I am not falling for this Bullshit."
13739,Awesome!
13740,"Good game if you like loot systems. It's also great to play offline if you don't have the best internet, but multiplayer is also very fun."
13741,Dommy mommy Ellie ;)
13742,a really good play if you haven't played already
13743,"honestly, i love it."

13751,"gud
"
13752,NOT recommended! I've spent too much time on this game and lost my job and my wife!
13753,"I keep hearing many people this is the best game from the franchise, but i can't really say whether this is the best or not but one thing for sure, it's fun and more chaotic compared to borderland 1 , And one thing that i like is that every map is much more crowded compared to borderland 1, so you wouldn't feel lonely or bored due to the lack of crowd whenever you finished certain mission, totally recommended for anyone who want to experience the franchise"
13754,This game is better than sex 100% recommend.
13755,"such a good game would recomend
"
13756,Very Fun
13757,"I feel like I might be playing a different game than everyone else lol. There is a lot about this game to enjoy: The vast amount of loot, different upgrades and characters, even the world itself. What's a turn off is the grind and the bullet sponges. I'm not against bullet sponges in games, I enjoy The Division franchise. However it feels like this game takes it to an extreme. Maybe I'm missing something? Either way it's enough to make me not want to continue playing."
13758,"the game speaks for its self
"
13759,Best loot and shoot game I've played in a while.
13760,"Great game. Im looking forward to BL3. Im sure it will be great and not a massive disappointment.

Edit: They added an update that added a horribly ugly add on the menu for Tina Tina Wonderlands, Now my game has started crashing."
13761,fun
13762,this game is called borderlands because the game's main goal is getting through the border between mexico and america

13772,"Great campaign, definetly recommend it for people who want a good single player. can be hard sometimes though."
13773,"[h1]Did you know over 97% of all creatures on Pandora aren’t exploding right now? THAT’S BULLSH*T! BUY TORGUE![/h1] 
Tens of millions of guns.
Dozens of skill-points.

13774,joa
13775,All I need to say is that this game is amazing.
13776,"The more rare weapons you find, the more you're gonna want. Very addictive. Good, stupid, FPS fun. I highly recommend!"
13777,its about on par with borderlands 1. i think the chars you play as on borderlands 2 is slightly more fun gameplay than the ones on borderlands 1. besides that its pretty similar except for the storyline and the guns
13778,yes

13788,Good game men
13789,"The rain beats down upon my window. The wind howls and thunder booms,......and yet....today is a perfect day. Today is the day I finally received my copy of Cory in the House and the outside world can go suck it. I fired up my DS palms sweating with anticipation, I knew this was going to be good but I wasn't ready for this. A triple threat of masterful storytelling, bleeding edge visuals and state of the art audio. The game reeks of quality and sky high production values the likes of which will likely never been seen again on a portable system. To go into anymore detail would be to spoil the experience (you won't see ANY of these story twists coming!). This game should be experienced fresh. My only real gripe is lack of online multiplayer but with a package like this who can seriously complain? So come on, isn't it time you got Corey in YOUR house?

I loved the first game and this one surpassed it, IMO is the peak of the whole series. After many years and probably a dozen playthroughs I would still gladly go back and try something different, and I’d still discover something new that I hadn’t before. 14/10"
13805,dis game sick
13806,raw
13807,"Perchance you have someone to play this game with, it's not a bad time. It's absolutely dreadful when played solo, though.
Consider my score to be a close split between 👍 and 👎.

While BL2 features a [i]helluva lot more[/i] of content in general over the original Borderlands, it's a significantly less well-rounded game.
My main gripes with it are the comparatively looser pacing and the same ol' issue with the DLC content being underleveled, unless you're starting it on a second playthrough.
However, considering the price it's often going for, I say the value is quite good for the mileage you can get out of this game if it's your cup of tea.
Friendly reminder: it was also given away with all the DLCs for free on EGS a while back."

13821,"Excellent game, and runs on my OS preference!"
13822,Worth playing once or a few times with friends.
13823,"the game can be rather difficult at times, at least if you play by yourself.  at the beginning of the game, after i got the shotgun the game gives you, there are no weapons except for pistols that only end up making things harder for you if you don't know what your doing, like if you get one that deals explosive damage not knowing the bullets are very very slow and inaccurate with a very small explosion.  this makes the game seem kinda bad, but once you get used to how the guns work more and get an actual weapon like a rifle, it becomes a lot more fun."

13847,"This game saved my life.

I am 35.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

13859,Borderlands 2 is a thrilling masterpiece that hooks and reels you in. Borderlands 2 has an engaging and well thought out story but may seem repetitive on continues play throughs
13860,its what destiny tried to copy
13861,all for moxxi
13862,Is good
13863,The game is a hell of a lot of fun and missions and story telling is fun and engaging
13864,Borderlands 2 is vary fun to play especially with mods giving you more fun content and less time to get Board of the game so get it now and get your friends and play now
13865,"This game is a mental illness, I recommend it."
13866,i'll eat your babies
13867,It's good but definitely not as good as Payday 2 or Warframe
13868,"Favourite game from my childhood, so excuse my bias. This game is amazing. You get to collect, inspect, customise, change, adapt, specialise the way in which you play the game throughout its entirety, the only exception being the late game where you are limited to a small hand of strategies. Although, there is still some variety, even there. So much freedom. Story based, but very open with lots of side missions. Interesting main and side characters. Funny writing, albeit depending on your taste. I just fail to put into words what this game means to me. It's so fantastic. The fact that you are constantly given an opportunity to try something new, to pick up a different weapon, try out a different element, completely respec your skill tree because you found a cool new legendary weapon from the last boss you fought. An amazing improvement on Borderlnads 1 and all its DLC and a great game all around. Endless hours of exploration and reexploration. 9.5/10."
13869,My favorite FPS by far! Fast-paced action with character customization and a ridiculous number of weapons to choose from.
13870,It good
13871,"One of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Unfunny forced humor for fairies and the characters are really boring and uninspired. Some are bland, some are clear rips of other game characters. Just absolute shite. Worst Borderlands game in the franchise, completely different feel than the first one. The first one is a proper experience. Developers tried too hard to cater to unfunny soylents."
13872,kinda cringe
13873,"the best game in the whole world, for years to be held high. if you leave a bad review you might just be legally blind and not know it"
13874,yes
13875,dat shit pog
13876,really fun :)
13877,"I had a really fun time with this game as 200+ hours probably shows, I came back to it on pc after playing for years on console. I had a great time for a couple weeks straight of playing this game, I have since then gotten a boyfriend and no longer get the same enjoyment out of this game. It was fun while it lasted and I hope you all can keep up the fun without me. So long gamers.

13880,"This is a fucking great game, WHY? Ill tell you why, women do you like women, do you want to be with women? Then play this game and not some other gay ass game like CS:GO or Fortnite. Like what the fuck is wrong with you? Borderlands 2 is probably one of the greatest games to ever be released. How do I know? Just trust me."
13881,holy fuck its a good game
13882,best game
13883,"just amazing, definitely the best bl (even better than bl3) i would definitely recommend the dlcs as they add so much more guns and content"

man the next spider man movie was really good i never expected spider man to die in it"
13887,"Very fun and addicting game, If i have to recommend an ""Add-on"" It would be ""Tiny Tina's Assault On Dragon Keep"""
13888,c
13889,"Probably the best game in the franchise, so much fun with friends or even solo. Gunplay is good, skills are interesting, and the characters very well written. Would heavily recommend."
13890,If you have anything better then a 1060 goodluck getting your vram over 3gb
13891,you can easily play alone but I recommend the co-op mode. It's freakin' hard but fun at the same time!
13892,"With all due respect, it sucks"
13893,Si
13894,awesome game
13895,you dont need too be good to get there
13896,"Like, yes uuh yes"
13897,"The game server never connects me to my friend's room successfully, whenever I want to play with my friend the in-game message shows “connection failed”, and my friend and I both are in the same steam region, so wtf is this? Does it mean that the game developers want us to buy Borderlands 3 forcibly? If so then it's absolutely a sh*itty deal. I am so disappointed about this since the reason why I bought this game was just because I wanted to play it with my friend.

Also about the product(the game) itself, everywhere shows that the developers might have brain cancers or something. 
First of all, I have to wait for about 2-3 mins or even longer on the loading screen every time I launch the game, the screen is like totally stucked or freezed. Secondly, the mouse sensitivity can only be adjusted 5 units up or down at a time instead of 1 unit precisely, what do you mean by this? At least I have never seen any other game that has such a silly mouse setting. Thirdly, I am mandatoried to watch all the stupid in-game cutscene especially after I have teleported and I hate it.

All the problems can be fixed but actually they have not been fixed at all, so instead of all the faulty cases, I strongly feel it’s an attitude issue from the developers."
13898,Krieg alone makes the game perfect.
13899,it's ok
13900,yes is great if you buy the handsome colletion

13902,"a lot of hours 4000+ on console 10/10 gmae
"
13903,
13904,"After almost 10 years of this game being out, it continues to be one I return to and binge. When I first got it, I honestly preferred the first Borderlands game, but after a while, Borderlands 2 really grew on me. It starts out a bit slow, but once you have a good build, it's a ton of fun. Borderlands 2 is the best loot shooter."
13905,Lootn' and Shootn'
13906,very fun
13907,I wear things I find in toilets...
13908,I had to shoot a guy in the face. I've never been the same since.
13909,"Ah yes. I sense things want me dead. But wait. They're all dead...

Yes, welcome to borderlands. Murder everything you see. Oh look, a new gun. OOH and it's more powerful. Kill more things with it. Do this over and over until you beat the game, and then repeat this over and over again.

Seriously though, this game is a classic FPS Looter/shooter favourite of mine and I highly recommend it."
13910,"I bought this game because The Handsome Collection discount was huge, like over 90%. As a decent fan of shooter games, it was an easy call to picked my interest. I know the game will be packed with gun loots, stories, memorable characters, and humor. So, it made me more interested in playing more.

Darn right, the gunplay has creativity in it. You can use a gun that explodes on a throw or the one that shoots an explosive bullet. Also, elemental weapons that can shoot electric, acid, and many other types of ammo. Not to mention, it is rewarding with the rarity tier.

The writing of the line is filled with just enough humor, whether it is witty or exaggerated. The story itself appears to be sensible to the Borderlands world. Not to mention a side quest that I often found to be basic, just shooty shooty bang bang, but good in telling the quest narrative, which I found sometimes funny.

At the end of the story campaign, I noticed my Steam achievements can be completed 100%, with a note that some needs to be done co-op too. So, I tried to achieve that. At this point, I encountered a problem: the online co-op is broken after the 2.0.0 update. According to what I read and remembered, it was caused by the crossplay for multi-platforms and caused the creation of an online session loop on the main menu. So, if you buy this, I highly recommend turning off the crossplay at the beginning of the game. So, I manually rollback the game to the earlier version of 1.8.5. I believe it was after Commander Lilith update. This means no co-op anymore unless you have a friend that can rollback too, which I have. With that, I continue completing the Steam achievements.

Another problem that I encounter is The Handsome Collection doesn't include the last DLC, where the rest of the achievements lies. So, I need to buy that, which I did at a good discount at that time. It was a stroke of luck getting that discount.

The rest is a relatively 250+ hours grind from defeating the raid bosses, collecting rare weapons, finishing certain quests, doing hidden activities, and laugh at some character jokes. Finally, I got all of the achievements. It was the most rewarding Steam achievements hunt that I have so far.

So, TL;DR, I would recommend this game because of the humor and gameplay, but mainly because it is possible to achieve 100% Steam achievements in this game. 

P.S.: You might notice that I played it for 383 hours at the time I wrote this. Not 250. Because some of it is idle due to accidentally sleeping when the game opened. That happened multiple times."

13912,"A very good experience, it doesn't get boring quickly, i also very recommend the DLC's pretty much all of them are amazing,  THIS IS CERTIFIED BY MIKE WAZOWSKI."
13913,this shit bussin
13914,This is a 100% must buy ive played this game in the past on Xbox and coming back to it since it was on sale. the story is great and the grind is even better i love the loot system it works super well its an amazing and a must cop
13915,i get sleepy sometimes in the start of the game
13916,The new updates caught me off guard because when I first played this on Xbox there wasn't this much fun.
13917,It's fun
13918,its ok
13919,.
13920,"It's just an all time classic, if you haven't played this game, you really should. Pretty dang alright."
13921,"Guns
"
13922,One of my favorite games.  Lots of action.
13923,"Stylish, extremely humorous game that combines first-person shooter elements with action RPG elements.

Presentation (5/5) for 2012: The game engine renders 3d objects to have a 2-d cartoon look that is characteristic of the whole series. The visuals and animations have so much character, it feels like you are inside a comic book. There are so many memorable designs ranging from monsters, humans, technology, objects, flora, fauna. The sound design also fits in well with the style of Borderlands. Check out the trailers to see the unique look of the game.

Story/Dialogue (5/5): full of memorable characters and villains, packed with witty, quirky, and juvenile jokes, and extremely LGBTQ friendly content. For a game oriented towards combat and looting, the often hilarious narrative enhance an already good game into a highly entertaining whole.

Gameplay (4/5): Gameplay is generally very good with fast-paced combat where you utilize a combination of innate powers and hand-held weaponry. Enemies, mini-bosses, and true bosses resemble Diablo or other action RPGs. Shopping, looting items resemble Diablo. Check points, fast travel, experience, skills resemble Diablo. Basically, this is Diablo with guns. From the wacky presentation, you might wonder if the gameplay goes off the rails as part of its design and the answer is yes. Balance is generally out the window, characters and enemies progress to withstand and deal exponentially absurd damage, you find loot all over the place, with oversaturation potentially diluting the reward system. The game is a tad too long for its own good (especially with DLC) but doesn't lose its momentum too often. One other criticism is the lack of difficulty levels to accomodate players of all skill levels or people who just want to see the story."
13924,"solid game
"
13925,Good Game
13926,"So many things about this game are just annoying as hell.  Maybe if I was 14 it would seem great, but I'm not."

13934,~
13935,"Comedy and gun, very good."
13936,"Fun! I never got to finish it, it bores me a bit and the looting its not for me ""oh, nice weap, oh... this one its bett... oh, this one its much... oh another... oh... ok, stop.

But music and characters are epic, and fun in coop."
13937,great game
13938,Yes good.

13959,shooty shooty bang bang
13960,"The game is very fast paced, and for the most part keeps you focused. Some missions are pretty boring but I think the good heavily outshines the bad. The game has arguably the best video game villain ever created and the DLC content is all very solid and fun."
13961,its badass
13962,"Borderlands Borderlands.. how much I enjoy playing this series as it is thrilling to see what next great and different weapon you may get and how strong you can get.

Borderlands 2 in particular, is my first game I played of this series and I do not regret this choice as it has tons of content into it and it feels like its never-ending. Many many many hours were wasted onto this game and it's still a favourite of mine even though Borderlands 3 exists, that's a whole different level of gameplay compared to Borderlands 2 but anyways!

Love this game and if you're a person that loves FPS and Loot, give this a shot please!
Have a great adventure Vault Hunter!"
13963,the alnd by the border
13964,"Game is amazing up until Tiny Tina is introduced. Game then really fucking sucks up until you complete her missions and never have to interact with her again, at which point the game becomes amazing again.

One of my favourite games, better than its predecessor and its successors by a long margin in almost all aspects. Fuck Tina."

13974,"It's Borderlands 2 bro. We all remember sitting in front of our Xbox 360s, Turtle Beach headsets at the ready, trying to organise a group. I definitely recommend this in the place of the lacklustre modern Borderlands games."

13977,good. this game is very yes
13978,"when you understand the machanics the game becomes adorable. jokes, dialogs and monologs are very funny. main story is well writen. side quests make you want to do them because all of them are interesting. graphics are cartoonlike so they dont bother you even the game is 8 yrs old. if youa re looking for a cheap and game and you have lots of time i recomend you borderlands 2."

13987,"Ohhhh Borderlands 2, it has such a special place in my heart, it was one of the first proper gaming experiences I had when I was younger, and since then I have purchased it and played it so many times I have had it on every console since Xbox 360 days and now I even have it on the desktop I built up a few years ago I have so many hours on all the platforms and so many max Characters and an ever so slight addiction to it xD I'm sure you can tell, I truly love this game and would definitely recommend whole heartily you and a group of close friends will have a blast!!!

I have a list of games that I have made that I would wipe my memory for and replay if I could and this game is at the top of my list it is actually the whole reason I created that list xD. 

100000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 would recommend for you and your friends"

13993,gud gam
13994,"Don't let my low hour count distract you, I use to play on console. I probably have over 2000 hours on console, I just got this on steam recently. This has been my favourite game since i discovered it in 2014 or 2015 until the third game came out. This game has endless amounts of stuff to do, but it doesn't force it on you. You can do whatever you want. The humour of the game (mainly Mr. Torgue) still holds up today, even after hundreds of play throughs The tuxido shirt joke at the beggining of the Son of Crawmorax headhunter still makes me laugh sometimes.

14004,"While I haven't finished this game on PC, I have hundreds of hours in the game and have finished it multiple times over on console. Handsome Jack is one of my favorite video game villains ever. Admittedly this game is better with friends, but it's still very good playing solo."

Now I like this game, story is good, gameplay is ok, characters are really good. So I would say get this"

Fun decreases as you ramp up the difficulty and the grinding becomes a chore instead.
DLCs are fun but some of them are kinda short.
"
14063,i like shooty shooty bang bangs so it's pretty good
14064,"Fantastic game. Only complaint anyone has really had was ""art"" related, and I chock that up to bad taste. Art is a fantastic change from what you're use to being beat over the head with."
14065,It's awesome. Looter shooter etc etc good game good stuff
14066,"very nice
"
14067,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good"
14068,it's hard to argue with perfection.
14069,"It's got Torgue in it, what else can i say?"
14070,"Yes an awesome gaming experience feels like a badass, but please fix 'creating online season' loop its very annoying"
14071,"Borderlands 2 is a game that you can play for hours collecting loot and farming bosses for specific equipment, I can't tell you how much you need to play this game at least once in your life and enjoy the storyline of Gearboxes masterpiece.

8/10 would play again."
14072,"haven't played very much, only got it a few days ago. It's pretty fun tho :)"
14073,Great game. Love everything about it.
14074,its neat
14075,"Its fun, even more so with friends.

If you haven't seen how wacko fun it is by now, you're missing out.

Take it from someone with 930+ hrs spent in it. Well worth the different character builds, rebuilds, equipment , and a story main quest with one of the best villains in a vide0 game EVER!!"
14076,I played this game all the time as a kid and got it on pc and i would ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone that likes looter shooter type of games.
14077,Good game.
14078,sdasdasdas
14079,I first played this game on my PS3 many years ago and fell in love with this franchise. Once i saw that it was on sell on steam it was a no brainer to try it on STEAM. The game is action packed and fun to play by yourself or with up to 4 friends. My favorite part of this game is the dialogue and  interaction with the wacky and crazy characters on the world of Pandora. I played this campaign solo with gaige and let me tell you it is a grind to pass the game. Its fun but can be frustrating getting one shot because you did not get good loot or you are under leveled so the grind is real in this game. Other the that short gripe the whole game is  so much fun that i recommend it to anyone who likes good shooters and lots of loot to give it a try. I am going to go ahead and finish the dlc and start playing borderlands 3 for the first time next. good luck Vault Hunters you are going to need it.
14080,BY FAR THE BEST BORDERLANDS GAME
14081,nice
14082,"If you're a loot goblin and don't mind shooting retarded AI, play this game."
14083,for what i have heard it is a good game i have bin playing this game for 69 (nice) minutes and what i see is that this is a good game :)
14084,Its Fun
14085,Some slick fellas show up and murder anything that breaths because they are hooked on the little known drug that is small number get bigger. The big loser of the story is ugly or something. 10/10
14086,"Lancemen -- attention! I have only one question to ask of you all. One question. Just a few years ago, we were enemies. But that time has passed. As glad as I am to see you all in Sanctuary, I know you wouldn’t have come if you had any other option. I know how bad things are out there. I know how Jack’s army has swept across this planet like a sandstorm, ripping apart everything in its way. When I joined the Crimson Lance years ago, they told me I’d be fighting to protect those who couldn’t protect themselves. But you all know as well as I do -- that was a lie. But this fight, against Hyperion? It isn’t. If we don’t band together -- if we can’t protect this city from Jack’s army -- then we’re done for. I am Roland, and I only have one question to ask: ARE YOU WITH ME?!"
14087,"If so many people still love this game despite being made by Gearbox, then that means it's probably good."
14088,totally not  draining my life force
14089,"One of the best games of all time, combined with PS3 XBOX ONE, PS4 and PC i have easily 2000 hours on this game and continue to play it to this day"
14090,really good would recommend
14091,"Borderlands 2 is all guns blazing and full of twists, actions and claptrap being a continuous pain in the ass! Whether you play this alone or with your mates then I am certain this game will provide you hours of entertainment if you love shooting the living hell out of people!

The main story is fantastic and the DLC only continues that groovy train of goodness so if you are in the mood to go across Pandora and shoot people left, right and centre then I would recommend picking this game up. It's an absolute steal of a title if its on sale."
14092,BOIRDER
14093,"Opportunity: the perfect city of the future.
“A new, safer Pandora. It was a great idea until Vault Hunters teabagged it into nothingness.”"
14094,"Even if you were slightly bored by the borderline absence of a coherent plot in the original, BL2 is worth a play.

What's great or greatly improved about it versus the original? The story (presented in cutscenes instead of just making you read mission blurbs in a journal) actually has an eminently hateable central villain now. There's finally a sense of something going on besides a disconnected jumble of barely-connected quests. Even if it isn't classic literature level storytelling, there's something to get absorbed in this go around. Combat is tight, frenetic and satisfying fun.

And the humor factor has been turned up to 11! If you laugh at movies like ""Deadpool"" this game's sense of humor is for you. Jokes and deliberately silly or amusing banter between characters flow freely, and DLC's featuring Mr. Torgue in particular are hilarious.

What's not so great? A handful of levels are way too large and convoluted to navigate even after you've played them, and the game is overlong (especially when DLCs are included) for all the more gameplay variety there is... which is to say, almost none. The game has a distinctly MMORPG ethos; grind and spam combat to slowly level up and get interesting abilities and perks. Only here, the acronym doesn't stand for ""Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game""--it is more like ""Mildly Multiplayer Online with Rocket Propelled Grenades."" Even if repetitive, though, at least combat is visceral and active instead of boring, clicky fare that feels like watching things trade punches on autopilot...

Can be played alone for the fun of collecting that occasional awe-inspiring uberweapon you can't wait to unleash on the psychos and the lulz of the (admittedly purile) jokes and gags... but as with the original?
it`s bestt game :)"

14096,"Even if you were slightly bored by the borderline absence of a coherent plot in the original, BL2 is worth a play.

What's great or greatly improved about it versus the original?  The story (presented in cutscenes instead of just making you read mission blurbs in a journal) actually has an eminently hateable central villain now.

14103,very addictive gameplay
14104,one of my faves
14105,A fun filled game to explore with ur buds
14106,"80% of the writing is cringy (people say Borderlands 3 is the cringy one, but they're all cringy - we just grew up). The shooting is adequate (though, good for a game from 2012). The story is average. It's a lazy console port - you can tell by the driving and menus. Every quest in this game is a fetch quest. It takes a while to actually get fun (4-6 hours). Enemies are bullet sponges. [i]Most[/i] of the skills you pick in the game are % increase, and not that interesting; there are a few skills that actually change how skills work, but it'll be a while before you see them. Enemies respawn [b]really[/b] fast. Side quests will make you re-do whole huge areas again. I could keep going.

I have all these problems with Borderlands 2, but I am still recommending it. Why? This is an FPS aRPG - a first-person Diablo II. It took me a while to understand that. Now that I do, this is a great ""turn your brain off after a long day of work"" game. Not only that, but you can get the main game and the DLC for dirt cheap these days. Recommended for some mindless solo vegging, or some good co-op times."

14112,"picked this up to do co-op with friends, and enjoyed it so much i've started a second game playing solo"
14113,"This game is a classic. This game NEEDS a remaster that has the QoL features that Borderlands 3 has.
this game is not perfect but damn is it in my opinion better then borderlands 3.
Not saying Borderlands 3 is bad cause it's not, although the story is a dumpster fire"
14114,i fking love it
14115,This game is by far one of my favorites. The fact that the humor mixes well with the insanity is most enjoyable. If you don't have a copy of this game I suggest you get one.

14137,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."
14138,"Borderlands 2 has redefined the genre of looter shooter in a modern shell shaded graphics . The devs really took the criticisms of borderlands 1 seriously and worked really hard to address those in the sequel and they surprisingly managed to nail it . The story and characters of of Borderlands 2 are so witty and charismatic  they are going to keep the players invested in the game for a very long time . And among all these positive features , BL2 even manage to create one of the best antagonist in recent history known as the handsome jack . My God !!! How can some one be conniving , sadistic , charismatic and witty at the same time . Even tough , the the encounter with Handsome Jack is way to far between , the creative dialog writing of the dialogues delivered through the echo device successfully manages to portray the personality of every character esp Handosme Jack . 

The game comprises of various different locations assorted with western themed railtracks , mines , snow covered arctic region , lush forest , tech hub ,  steel factories . Even the base game has so much riveting content and locations , developers are generous enough to offer much more variation and additional content and storyline through he dlc esp Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragons keep . Every dlc feels much better than the base game but Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragons Keeps takes the cake by it surrealistic story and fantasy themed setting . You must play it by yourself to experience this magical world . 

The exploration , the gunplay , the plot , the sidequests are more than enough to keep someone invested in the game for hours but if you want to amp up your fun factor 3x or 4x , I highly recommend you to play the game with at least one friend as there is nothing better going through this awesome journey with a loved one . 

BL2 is not just a another looter shooter , it's one of the best games ever made . 

10 / 10 

Highly recommended ."
14139,shoot gun
14140,"Great game, enjoyably detestable villain. So much fun."
14141,"If you like to shoot, loot, level up, and be a badass. Then this is the game for you. Graphics are nice, game can run on decent computers and laptops. Game play is repetitive, but still fun. Characters are neat and the ones you play as are fun as all hell. If my hours and review don't convince you, then how about knowing that I have 4 copies of this game? Yeah I know, TMI, but trust me when I say this game is good. Even better with co-op."
14142,"Borderlands 2 is in my opinion the best game in the series.
It got more loot, more explosions and more badasses
and that is pretty much all you need in a Borderlands game.
As Mr. Torgue once said
""IT'S TIME FOR A LOOOOOT-SPLOSION!"""

14148,"I played the original Borderlands and enjoyed every moment of its sequel, I've played this one pc, ps4, and console and it is a halarious game with plenty of killing to do, you can kill for a purpose or just go to an arena and kill a bunch psychos, robots, creatures to de-stress, has a great story line with one-liners you'll either hate or love."

You can't disband him.
You can't destroy him. 

You can mute all game dialog but then you miss every other characters dialog in the game. 

It's 2021 and whatever passed for charm in 2012 reveals itself to be hot, HOT garbage in the present day.

Oh yeah if you like silly jokes, yet a somewhat intresting story, cartoonish looks and loves to grind like alot to optimize your build to get that perfect roll on a weapon WITH A MATCHING GRIP!

Witty characters and many ways to customize your skillsets is a pleasant bonus. I will say that after the first 2-3 run-throughs, it does get very same same. Hell, most quests are kinda same same but honestly it's forgiveable."
14269,"Sup Sucka!

I have bought this game on Xbox 360 twice, Playstation once, Xbox one once and now Steam!
It's is by far my favorite Borderlands game.

The humor is spot on, the characters are amazing. The DLC's are worth the investment and time! 
I've been a huge fan of Borderlands for many years now and this one always has me coming back to play.
Better with friends but still a blast to play alone.

If you have not played this yet what are you waiting for?  DO IT! Do it now!"

14274,Z0ro is cool
14275,this game is pure fun.
14276,Perfect FPS Looter Shooter with friends or solo. Give it a try!
14277,"In spite of my overall recommended rating, there are some things that you should probably know about this game.
Firstly is the mechanism of the ""looter shooter"" part of the game. In order to actually farm for weapons and items, you have to re-enter a level from the main menu every single time; there is no boss respawn mechanic in levels, which makes this necessary part of the game sometimes incredibly frustrating. This is especially so when trying to get legendary loot.
There are mods (custom launchers) that fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to download a launcher - why isn't this part of the base game? It's a looter-shooter, how did they not expect people to need to farm the same boss or bosses over again? Thankfully for me, load times are amongst the shortest I've seen, but I know that will not be the case for everyone, which may make the experience even more gruelling. 

Another problem so far has been co-op play. The entirety of the way, I've been playing this with 3 other friends, which has made the experience considerably more difficult. How strange, given that this IS meant to be a co-op game. We frequently find ourselves underleveled for areas simply because playing in co-op splits the experience but doesn't adjust for 4 players. This sort of issue doesn't happen in singleplayer. Ironic.

My third and final gripe is the zer0 Sniper class, who I've been focusing on this entire time. I would briefly like to point out the stupidity of having a melee branch with no genuine melee weapons - asides from that, the Sniper class can feel quite redundant at times. Critical hitboxes are both small and in sometimes ridiculous places, or are totally not existent at all - and even when shot, do not crit properly. Many engagements are in close quarters, and when playing with 4 people, ""getting hurt"" animations can increase the difficulty in landing headshots.
I get this is going to be partially out of my own aim, but all the other factors can sometimes make Sniper Zer0 feel like a chore. 

As for the positives of this game...
+ The gunplay CAN feel amazing
+ There's an incredible addictiveness to getting good loot
+ Landing headshots CAN be satisfying
+ The game looks awesome even on the worst settings

So overall, I recommend it. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but I bought it only sale (only about $7) and I would say I'm satisfied with my purchase so far. I think fundamentally some of the game's design choices turned out to be poor, especially with so much DLC and the issues mentioned above; every game has it's flaws. 

In spite of those things, it is probably worth a try.

14278,"Used to play this game on PS3 during my high school and early college times (definitely around 10.000 hours).
Got addicted as fuck, replayed the entire game through multiple times on all characters except the mechromancer (idk why).

Gameplay is great, bit repetitive sometimes (but much of that is to blame on myself). 
Unmatched gun-diversity (except by BL3).
Sick artwork, awesomely stupid jokes and the perfect villain

I come back to this total gem sometimes and geek the fuck out and get obsessed for like 2 weeks all over again

10/10 would recommend if keeping your sanity is not your main purpose in life."

14316,"Its alright, if you like RPG FPS type games you will like this. The only thing I don't understand is, why did they put Digistruct peak OP behind a pay wall. Pre fight for sanctuary DLC you could play Digistruct peak and once you reach level 72 you could OP. But now you can't do that anymore unless you buy the Fight for sanctuary DLC and level up to 80. Why? I know this is true because I am level 72 and I completed the Digistruct peak DLC and every run I get the same message, ""Good job now try it at level 80 so you can OP"". WHAT WHY? Not even worth playing Digistruct peak at all unless you have all the DLC that lets you level up to 80. They can't be this greedy can they? I'm only recommending the game because there is enough content there to keep you busy, other than that it makes no sense to put OP levels behind a pay wall when prior to that DLC you were able to do it."

14324,"The borderlands franchise is one of the first games I played with my husband as we searched for great co-op games we could play, and it did not disappoint. If you are looking for a solid game that can be played with as few as two people or in a larger group, or even alone, then Borderlands 2 is a hard game to beat in that regard.

This game is also a great game for those who might be introducing someone to gaming because it isn't over the top. Whether you are a veteran gamer or a beginner this game is fun and is a great pass of the time. And if you are a couple, looking for a game to play together, this is the perfect one. The loot drop system is great and abundant, and the fun is spread evenly among players. There is a lot of customization options for your characters, and a great story-line that is funny, exciting, and dramatic. I cannot recommend this game enough to people. If you finish, I recommend the next in the series as well as Tiny Tina's Wonderland for those who are fans of a little D&D!"
14325,"Borderlands 2 is a very good sequel to the original masterpiece, but if you only look at the main missions. The optional missions are pretty boring and not fun at all. However I was originally going to give this game a positive recommended review, but since the developers made a very strange move by making the last DLC from free to pay all of a sudden I cannot support this game with a positive review. I don't understand why did they have to put a price tag on the DLC, very bad move."
14326,Great game!
14327,"highest level character got corrupted and deleted for some reason.  Currently looking around online and says go to properties, then, verify inegrity.  It didn't work.  I poured so many hours into that character.  Super bummed about that."

14342,"This is one of those games you can come back to when you're bored with everything else. A timeless classic. Has its issues, but most of them serve to make the game more enjoyable. And it's 10X better with friends."
14343,Endlessly Playable with DLCs
14344,"Waiting for steam summer sale to buy that last DLC for this game, so I decided to take a break from borderland 2 to play LRFF and a few other games. While waiting I decided to finish my review for this game first.

Some of the best games in my library I didn’t play yet because I am still missing DLC like Dishonored or Stellaris as I always want to try to get the full experience of a game before I move onto other backlogs in my libraries. Borderlands 2 has been burning a hole on my playlist for a long time because of missing DLCs. A lot friend told me to play with them for many years but without getting the DLC it just feels weird for me. 

Being released for a long time this game is still in very good Quality. Great map design, Story, funny dialogue with awesome voice acting and the little madness in everybody. The interface and gameplay itself are still high standard in today’s game world. Difficulty is a bit higher then needed as game is expected to be play with a bunch of friends. I recommend explore each map and do missions that’s at least 2 level below yours and keep it that way so you don’t have to die too much. 

Lucky for us there is skeleton chest that you can open with golden key you can find by searching internet. Upgrade your guns using that every 4-5 levels or so using it so you don’t have to depend on quest reward and loot drops. Currently there are about 230 keys still available to grab before they expire and they do release more from time to time.

I was unlucky enough that play through the entire game + 3 major DLC not a single legendary dropped for me but normal people does have better luck than I do. Ouch, I am going to go cry in a corner now and let’s finish this review quickly.

9.5/10 would be my final score for this game as a whole and once I have the last DLC I will play through the game again in new game+ and the other 3 major DLC that I haven’t touched yet. Recommend for anyone and everyone, if you haven’t play this get all expansion on a sale and play now, you need to know the entire Borderlands story as the whole series is going very strong and new games and new expansions are being made constantly. Adding Borderland 3 + all DLCs into my Wishlist right now. 
"
14345,Great game to comeback right now in 2021. Great single player and multiplayer.
14346,"fun 
:]"
14347,"Although I dont have very many hours on steam, I want to say this is the best game I've ever played. Though it has flaws, Voracidous health bug, endlessly farming for legendaries, repetitive story, annoying quests, unbalanced weapons, when picking a character you have to stick with a certain play style, and if you dont like it halfway through, you would have to restart. the insane amount of builds and guns though, is amazing. so many unique guns that even i've been playing since 2013 and still dont know all of them. DLC is great, Captain Scarlett and whatever the summer DLC is called are annoying, but the other DLC is great, with great weapons and all. The ability to restart at higher levels and difficulties is unique and cool, it gets challenging at UVHM though, (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode) and if you're just and average player running around and not paying attention to your build or items, UVHM isnt really for you. It gets very difficult once you reach UVHM especially if your gear is underleveled. Base game has a lot of content but the DLC has some great weapons and a nice experience. If you are thinking about buying this game, buy The Handsome Collection or Game of the Year edition for the DLC. my experience with the game is now getting repetitive. Having to farm legendaries that are never dropping, being underlvl, getting bored. Mods for this game get boring after about a few days. This game is fun if you play coop. This game isn't really right for an average person or casual player, or at least in my opinion. It still feels good killing bosses and lvling up, but the content is the same everytime, and this is a fatal flaw this game has, no matter how much content they add, it will eventually dry out and become boring, even if the content was infinite. Absolutely amazing game, my favorite game of all time, will always have a special place in my heart. I HIGHLY suggest trying this game even if you dont like shooters or looter shooters. I could go on and on about this game. Just try it for yourself i had an amazing personal experience with this game. Thank you Gearbox for creating this masterpiece."

14362,389 hours. 'Nuff said.
14363,"Every MINUTE i have put into this game has been worth it. BL2 is a worthy sequel of the (then) new idea that was Borderlands. The soundtrack is on point, the visuals are sharp and the writing is superb.

Its interesting to note that the story line, the tasks in this game that the player takes on are so in-depth and interesting, so absorbing that a game like this, designed to be enjoyed with multiple people playing, can be enjoyed solo is a testament to how good it is. The DLC is worth every cent, not feeling like tacked on garbage or an afterthought.

The writing is witty, the characters are enjoyable and the story line is worthy of Shakespeare.

Buy it and join me in-game."

14378,"game sucks, don't play"
14379,Incredile Game. A Great Mix of Fast Paced FPS with RPG. Great game.
14380,"Unpopular opinion here: Borderlands 2 is the worst of the games. I'm sorry, don't kill me! I just really don't like it.

First game, I love the atmosphere: You're like a wild west in space gunslinger bringing justice to little towns out in nowhere. There's almost no dialogue, which gives it just the right feel of lonely isolation. I've played through it maybe eight times by now, DLC's and all. *french kiss sound*

The pre-sequel, I love the.... lack of atmosphere? literally?: I'm just a big sci-fi nerd, and I just found the mechanics of low-g body slams and oxygen conservation to be just about the coolest thing ever. Plus FRIKIN' LAZERS MAN! What's not to love?! And it's a shorter game so it doesn't outstay its welcome.

But this game? UGHHGHGHGHGHG. It's LOOOOOONG. It's GRIIIINDY! There are NPCs COOOONSTANTLY talking into your ears, telling the LAAAAAAMEST of jokes. And this is the game who's main twists basically broke the first game, which I loved so much. I loved Angel in the first game, and everything involving Angel in this game? HATE HATE HATE! I'm sorry, I do! I think I've only actually finished the story line once because every other time I've tried to play it, I get to the initial Angel related stuff and am just like, ""NOPE! You just ruined it! I hate you!""

Anyway, that's my opinion. It's not the popular one, but it's mine. You'll probably like it just fine, especially if you wanna grind for a hundred hours listening to late 00's style jokes til your ears start oozing.

(oh, btw, haven't played B3. So can't comment yet or rank it.)"
14381,lots of guns. 10/10
14382,"Borderlands 2 with all DLC for less than £10 .... the games is very entertaining and very funny 
Trust me you cant go wrong with BL2"
14383,yes very much yes
14384,gub game
14385,Just get the fucking game
14386,yes the game i like
14387,"I originally started playing this game about two years ago, I made it to sanctuary and was about level 14 before I gave up on it. Then, earlier this week I decided to pick it back up and I'm so happy I did. This game is worth the playthrough, it's full of interesting characters, a multitude of different weapon types and play styles and a way to get that loot grind itch in a fun and fulfilling way. I think anyone who has this game just sitting in their library and those who want to buy it should definitely give it a shot."
14388,"I enjoy Borderlands 2 much more than the original game.

The story is better, the abilities of the different classes are more interesting, and I have been slowly working my way through all the DLC. 300+ hours, and I've barely scratched the surface!

It's terrific to play with friends, or on your own. Being able to play as different classes also opens up different game play.

The humour is fairly juvenile, but every now and then you will come across a story that has some really memorable characters.

Admittedly, there are many, MANY fetch quests. Given that the terrain does change, as do the enemies in each different section of the game, things don't ever really get dull.

If you enjoy FPS looter shooters, this is definitely the game for you."
14389,"I miss Borderlands 2 every time I play Borderlands 3. Sure, the story gets a little old after several times playing through, but damn is that story so good. Handsome Jack is like the best antagonist ever, I could seriously write an entire essay about his psychology. I love the playable characters and the skill trees, and the multitude of guns just makes it even more fun. If you like 1st person shooters and want a challenge, Borderlands 2 is for you."
14390,yeh good game or sumptin i duno
14391,So much fun  o  _o
14392,"Borderlands 2 was by far one of the best games I have played yet and I have played a ton of games, It has a great storyline and dont get me started on the DLC's they were awesome remember this isnt a game which is easy you have to grind and get your way to the top and fight difficult bosses"
14393,Good Game
14394,gud
14395,"Fun for a first time playthrough so long as you have friends to play with and have purchased the DLC. However, it is horribly paced and very grindy. If you're not very passionate about this game/series and don't have a group/community to play with, skip it and play something more modern."

PROS
-------
- Intressting weapons
- Intressting weapon/shield designs
- Awesome Level Up system
- Nice ambient lighting

-------
CONS
-------
- Game is over the top difficult. And I really mean, over the top difficult. Even with preparations, and proper leveling, you will still get demolished for no reason at all.
- Not all level skills are very helpful.
- Black border around objects, which is supposed to make the game look like a cartoon, is hard on the eyes. Especially on low-end computers.
- Extremly crude, cruel, and heartless comments/behaviour throughout the game, in an attempt to make humor out of it. I, personally, find it highly distasteful.
- Once you fight for your life (about to lose your life), the enemies either hide behind spots where you can't shoot them, or they hide behind enemies with HP too big to take down with your weapons in such a short time.
- You'll often struggle with controlling your own character. The controls feel very sluggish and unpolished.
- You can neither hide, nor outrun most of enemies. And it's a bit bad, since all enemies have perfect aim. You just end up dying instead. Especially when they start to swarm you.

Overall: 6 / 10
--------------------
As a gamer, difficulty is important aspect of a well designed game; a progressive difficulty to help player learn to play the game, and give proper challenge. I don't mind challenging games, but I do mind over the top hard games. The difference is that hard games, unlike challenging games, give unproportional benefits to the enemy in the game, wether they be strength, durability, behaviour of AI, and fiddling with game mechanics... hard games abuse the latter, on purpose, to infuriate the gamer. This is one of those games. Sadly. Because it has a great system, great weapon design and variety. It's just a bad game and bad controls. 

Intressting game mechanics don't make up for a good game. Controls frequently fail you, and your leveling  won't help you that much. You are required to loot gear in heavy grinding, in order to have any chance at all with the game progress. Unless you want to grind your own teeth to dust and lose hair in frustration. The game is probably more enjoyable in multiplayer where you as a team can take advantage of each others team bonuses, but overall... in the end... experience is the same. Not to mention the fact the devs made this game insanely hard on purpose, and were bragging about it. Why do that, I'll never know. A good game should give you a good time. Lost potential if you ask me."

14433,"This game is a broken mess. I used to love this game, played on every other platform just fine. But buying it on Steam was my biggest mistake. The launcher refuses to launch, and claims it is unable to find the config files and will now close. then closes. I used a community guide to launch the game without the use of the launcher, changed my in game resolution to match that of my monitor, and now it is a background process, that can never be opened. Yes the game and its experiences are amazing, but i wouldnt recommend buying it from Steam, purely because of all of these problems that come with it."

14459,great for multiplayer. the more player the better the loot.
14460,"This is a masterclass in the looter shooter genre, I have played this game sense it came out and highly suggest you play it if you have not. If you do plan to pick this up and purchase the dlc I would say to avoid the OP levels as they add difficulty but in a sometimes boring manner."
14461,yes
14462,"This game is truly a masterpiece, it can be a bit of a grind but constantly leveling up, going through skill trees, and always getting new loot is super addicting. The 6 characters (with DLC) equate to 18 different playthroughs with Normal/TVH/& UVH. You can also spec into different builds for each character. The replay value is insane, and this is definitely in my top 5 games of all time. However, definitely get ALL the DLC, don't only get the GOTY, I'd recommend the Handsome Collection."
14463,i like land with borders
14464,Still an awesome game.
14465,One of the best games I've played in my life. Highly recommend!
14466,im borderlind autistic
14467,dukino is best character.
14468,"i like how its well detailed and the game is very challenging. i also like how we have subtitles in the game so we can see what people are sayin, we don't have to just guess what they said. i would recommend this game to others because its fun AF and you can get awesome skins. there's also tons of glitches you can do. there's a bunch of hidden places we don't know about which is cool. i just love the game."

14473,"played through this game like 5 times, i would kill myself if i did that in 2021. this shit cringe"
14474,i hate mukbang
14475,Good times had by all
14476,"Borderlands is such an addicting game whether I am playing Solo or with a friend. You always find something to do here. It has a massive open world that you can freely explore, take down enemy settlements, the quests are really fun, especially the engaging side quests given to you by an array of well written characters. It is no secret the arsenal of weapons this game has and the variations you get for each of them. This makes exploration, quests and the other elements worth it : you get to have more fire power to pew pew around!
Like Doom, for me Borderlands also feels like a way to let your stress out and play this game on your leisure time without hassle. 

Its....Its FUN!"
14477,the best looter shooter out there
14478,best game out for windows and mac players
14479,good game
14480,"This is the game that I've had more friends want to play with me than any other, and it's the shooter I keep coming back to when I just wanna.. shoot. It's great fun, you really can't go wrong with BL2. The only bad thing is it's an IP of Gearbox, but you take the good with the bad. If that's a deal-breaker for you I can totally understand. but if not, I highly recommend BL2!"
14481,After all these years I still play.
14482,"What more to say about this game besides that it's, by far, the best game in the whole serie ?"
14483,This game is really fun when playing with someone... makes the fun aspect even more better!
14484,the greatest game ever made. endless enjoyment. i play it with my dad and its the BEST
14485,A Classic. One of the best series out there.
14486,"Very fun, one of the best games gameplay and writing wise ive seen.
"
14487,"it's good
"
14488,very nice
14489,It's literally the best borderlands game
14490,"wake the fuck up vault hunter, we have Jack to stop"
14491,"Tl;dr Play with friends, game is short so it's designed to be replayed multiple times, prepare to farm, end-game content is where the fun is at, getting to end-game content will be a slog if you don't get certain DLCs for loot farms, the writing generally sucks and aged poorly, Jack is the only good character.

Good game, but don't pay too much for this if you don't have at least one friend to play with. The gameplay loop on solo is nothing to write home about and I can't recommend it at full price. The entire package was designed to be very replayable, which helps with the game's intention of having you get to max level, which is where most of the fun lies and is only possible if you do multiple successive playthroughs. If you're interested in doing endgame stuff like the OP levels then you're probably going to need to farm certain DLCs for loot, I couldn't imagine getting to OP10 without getting items from the Christmas themed DLC, otherwise I'd have put around dozens of more hours on just farming to get to the same point. Speaking of farming, you'll be doing a LOT of it! At least a quarter of all of my playtime was spent doing exactly that!

As far as the story goes, it's serviceable plot wise, but I hate most of the characters because they come across as either boring or annoying, the only likeable character was Jack, the game's villain. A lot of dialogue sounds like it was written by an avid redditor who was giggling the entire time he was making it. The writing is also full of early 2010s pop-culture references, that basically means that large parts of the writing aged like milk. The music was ok but mostly forgettable."
14492,Still playing this game after all these years. Still fun.
14493,"One of the best Looter-Shooters out there. You've probably heard of this game, and you probably already know you should get it, so stop reading this review and buy the game already."

14525,"Side quests pretty boring except for a few. Like 1/10 of the side quests are nice.
Main quests story are considered good, but not spectacular."
14526,honestly the only problem i have with the game is that ultimate vault hunter mode is EXTREMELY HARD. like dark souls level hard. but other than that i absolutely love the funny characters and the physics are funny and just an enjoyable single player FPS.

14535,You run and gun the entire time all while collecting loot. Lots of content to farm for the perfect items so really you only get bored if you choose not to farm for weapons. It does get a little stale going through the same content trying to get to max level.
14536,Really fun to just roam around and level up or mess around. Suggest to play with friends but still fun if you like playing by yourself.

14552,Even a 10 year old would find this humor more annoying than funny.
14553,good
14554,"Definitely my favorite borderlands game and is easily worth 10 dollars for the game and dlc. Tiny Tina's assault on dragon keep is the best dlc of any game since Black ops 2 Mob of the Dead. Also, there are 6 different characters with unique skill trees with multiple builds, this game never gets old and is fun across many playthroughs."
14555,"Game is too easy no matter what difficulty you pick. This is mainly because enemies don't respawn even after the player dies (they take a whopping 25 minutes to respawn), and there is no penalty for player death other than losing money (any money isn't that important, since the best gear comes from enemy drops not purchase).

This effectively means that you have 25 minutes and infinite player deaths to defeat all the enemies in an area and move on to the next - so you can basically mindlessly button mash your way through 90% of the game without having to worry about anything (the only exceptions are a few bosses and ""arena"" challenges which account for less than 5% of the game).

Also (on the lower difficulties at least), some of the characters (Axton in particular) are comically overpowered - if you use Axton's turret upgraded with slag rounds and rockets, it will basically play the game for you - wiping out rooms of enemies and entire bosses (including the final boss) all by itself. Harder difficulties ultimately make little difference when you can just die/respawn over and over without penalty, but it's also worth noting that you can't even unlock harder difficulties without finishing the entire game multiple times (e.x. you'll have to play through the entire game twice just to unlock the hardest difficulty).

The game is also quite long (not even counting DLC) which would be fine if the gameplay was more substantial - you'll probably invest a minimum of 20 hours just rushing through the main stories, and maybe 20+ more if you try to finish all of the side quests.

So ultimately, despite the good points of this game - I don't recommend playing it unless you use mods to increase enemy respawn time, and unlock the hardest difficulty from the get-go. (And as of right now, there are unintended glitches from increasing enemy respawn time - such as it increasing the respawn time of bosses in addition to regular enemies, and no way to fix this).

5/10"

14561,"Despite it not being the newest of games out there, it truly never skips a beat. 
The graphics are interesting, it seems to me it's something in between cartoon-ish outlines and 3D. 
Funny indeed, especially when you see that the characters in the game can crack up a joke when they're about to shoot some right in their face/after being shot in the face.
I'm not crazy about the storyline/plot, but man, do I enjoy the fights and doing missions here and there and now and then."
14562,"Was experiencing some visual bugs, but I quickly managed to fix them by messing around in the settings. So yeah, unfortunately I can't have max graphic settings, but even with some of the buggy settings decreased, game still looks great!

Looks are definitely a 8/10 for me.

Next I'll be focusing on the gameplay."

The looter shooter that got me into the Borderlands universe. Among the witty one-liners, unique humor, intriguing story, and deep characters is some rather addictive gameplay. You can shoot bad guys. You can shoot your friends. You can shoot a gun that shoots guns that shoot your friends. Or bad guys. Sometimes the bad guys shoot each other. Sometimes the good guys shoot each other. The most handsome guy in the game is a bad guy. The most annoying character in the game is a good guy. There's a gun that screams. Like, vocal screaming. There are dudes that just scream in general. You can have all this just cause you feel like it.

Arguably the best entry to the Borderlands universe.

===[ $ Price Index: ]===
☑ Worth even MORE than full price
☐ Completely worth full price
☐ Wait for a sale
☐ Be prepared to refund this title
☐ No Man's Sky (Do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry)

I frequently see this game on sale for like $5. Every time I see it on sale for that cheap, I literally look for people on my friends list to buy the game for (disclaimer: go away). That's how enjoyable the game is.

===[ ۞ Playtime/Replayability: ]===
☑ Highly replayable (> 250 hours)
☐ Long (100 ~ 250 hours)
☐ Average (50 ~ 100 hours)
☐ Short (10 ~ 50 hours)
☐ Minuscule (0 ~ 10 hours)

Do not mistake my Steam time for how replayable this game is. I have probably clocked hundreds, if not thousands of hours on just Borderlands 2 alone on the Xbox 360 for how fun it is to play with friends.

===[ ☀ Story: ] ===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ None

In this age of kind of crappy storytelling, Gearbox can still deliver games with very engaging stories without sacrificing gameplay quality. That seems to be a rare commodity nowadays. You'll meet some recurring characters from the original Borderlands as well as brand new characters. To me, there isn't a single character where I'd rather not see them in the game. Each character is very well written, and they blend together to form one of the most interesting stories in modern entertainment. The only reason the story doesn't earn a Masterpiece rating from me is because it is a bit cliche. Good guys defeat bad guy and save the world. The path that the good guys take to defeat the bad guy is what's very engaging.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe
☐ Ask M. Night Shyamalan to make a movie of it

For a 2012 game, it still looks fantastic. Some of the animations definitely look outdated, but most of the time, you're paying attention to the plot more than anything so there's a good chance you'll miss the weird-ish animations.

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Do not put your ears through this terror

The music is pretty good. There are little jingles and tunes here and there that you'll likely remember for a long time. The overall sound design is great quality, but doesn't exactly stand out against other games like NieR:Automata.

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Quantum Computing may not be enough

For some reason, my RTX 2080 Super is ""running out of video memory"" once or twice per session. That definitely has me raising an eyebrow, but the game runs flawlessly otherwise.

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

Generally the game runs as you would expect, but you'll also run into moments where you're like ""wtf just happened?"". If anything, these ""wtf"" moments add comedic value to the game which already has loads of comedic value.

☐ Toddlers (> 1)
☐ Children (> 4)

☐ Better make this your day job
☐ Sweaty neckbeards galore
☑ Requires some effort
☐ Minuscule effort
☐ Just look at the screen and you win

===[ ✦ Miscellaneous: ]===
Gearbox maintains their own small social network that's tied to the Borderlands games, so you will have to make a SHiFT account to play any Borderlands game. You won't have to download any clients or anything; Gearbox did a pretty good job integrating the SHiFT service into their games.

14608,"So... Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2. This game was recommended highly to me by a close friend of mine who shall be named and called out. Andrew. I know you're reading this, and I hope you're happy with what you've done.

Borderlands 2 is the obvious sequel to Borderlands, a mishmash of first-person shooters, RPG elements, and total aggravation, all of which were steeped in a stagnant pond in an attempt to create an enjoyable game. And by gods, did the developers miss the mark entirely. I can legitimately say with nary a shadow of a hint of a glimmer of a ghost of doubt that I very much hated this experience. And that's a bit of a shame, really, as this game had good promise. The struggle really comes with execution.

Let's begin with the story. As a player who is primarily driven by an engaging narrative, this game quickly ran aground for me. The basic plot of this game is that you're on some backwoods planet called Pandora looking for something called ""the Vault"". This is of course going on while just about every man on the planet (and their identical siblings) all attempt to wipe the dust off the ground with your corpse. That's really it. Mind you, it takes forever to get nowhere with this story, but that is really all there is to the tale. It's as hollow as any other shooter out there. You as the player take the most roundabout route possible for little payoff.

Now, what makes this even worse is that the game is sectioned off into chapters that are progressed through by ""Story Missions"". The trouble with this is that there are also what are referred to as ""Optional Missions"" which aren't actually optional. What I mean to say is that in order to be at a level to where you might actually be able to get through the story missions, you either need to grind through the same areas repeatedly or pick up the optional missions that also force you to grind through the same areas repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad if you could pick up the optional missions for areas that you are naturally going to end up in for the story, but usually you can't even access those until after you've already been through for the story mission in the first place. Ultimately this just leads to further breakdown of the story as you attempt to remember why you're doing whatever it is that you're doing for no reason. Like baiting more people to murder with pizza. Yes, that's actually a mission. As this same issue exists in its predecessor, you'd think the developers would have put in the forethought not drive the players insane from the repetitive nonsense that could easily be remedied by either forgoing the side quests or at the very least allowing the player to go through the main narrative instead of continuously consider my willingness to bathe with a toaster.

Now, the next blunder that should be mentioned should be the loot system, or more accurately the stat spread. One thing I discovered early on was that the stats of weapons and items are completely arbitrary. At no point does it really matter what the rarity and stats of items are supposed to represent. I for one, spent the majority of the game with the same stock of weapons because switching them out for ones with level requirements closer to my actual level didn't really change how effective shooting the thousands of carbon-copied lunatics in the head was.

If I had to posit a defining characteristic of this game it would have to be the combat, which in a sense is also problematic. While the overall combat mechanics are satisfying (shoot first because you've got nothing better to do), where it really falls short is that the most effective tactic for finishing the game remains consistently the same: shoot some people, duck for cover, reload, shoot some more until there are no red dots on the mini-map, rinse, lather, repeat. There's no nuance to anything. This game doesn't add anything new to the formula. It's Call of Duty with slightly better music and an annoying art-style.

So basically my takeaway from this whole experience is that the same fundamental problem I have with most shooters isn't fixed by adding a small handful of RPG elements to a game. Since the fan-bases of shooters are willing to sop up any manner of poorly constructed refuse that a developer is willing to spit out, there won't be a game that actually breaks this down. At the end of the day, Andrew, this game is just a slightly more colorful version of any other shooter out there, and if you're fine with that, good for you. Just remember that this game is like a Twinkie: cheaply constructed and entirely empty calories."
14609,It's alright
14610,this is the only looter shooter  series that i can play theres just something about its level design the world of pandora as frighting as it may be is one of my favorite fictional planets in all of media and handsome jack might just be my favorite villan of all time easily as ell written as the elusive man in my opinon the gunplay while not as refined as 3 is great as well as having a better parts system in my opinion overall this game is a gem and what made the borderlands series as big as it is today and is easily in my top ten games of all time 9.5/10
14611,too good

14644,Axton's relationship with his turret is both adorable and worrying.
14645,"so, Would i recommend bl2? Yes, but, there's a single big problem currently which is why im giving it a thumbs down. 

The Final DLC: The Fight for Sanctuary DLC now costs money, on release it was free, but its now the most expensive piece of DLC, that wouldn't be a problem if it didn't increase the level cap by two, which, normally would be fine except it also increased the OP level cap as well, and, due to how OP levels work, you can not reach any OP level without owning the Fight for Sanctuary DLC. Which means two of the other DLCs, the vault hunter upgrades, the second of which was what added OP levels. That means that two other pieces of content you bought now no longer work unless you pay 15 more dollars at the time of writing. You are locked out of content you bought already with this DLC, and, to make sure my point is clear, the Vault Hunter Upgrades were the only DLCs to add level ups, the second of which is what added op levels. Most people consider the handsome jack collection base game now, which, is fair, however, that still means fight for sanctuary is a 15$ add-on you have to pay in addition to the collection. People are saying that its your fault for not grabbing it while its free, which is still a bad argument to make because it discourages people from buying the game, especially when they seemingly never put the last DLC on sale. Commander Lilith is also one of the shortest DLCs, and really doesn't connect BL2 to BL3. The only thing it explains is why sanctuary is gone in 3. It also cannonizes the telltale games series (I say canonize because i remember reading it sold poorly, so more so just kinda made some deaths in it canon, mainly scooter.) which is its on can of worms that i will not get into.

Gearbox needs to make Fight for Sanctuary free forever or put it in the handsome jack collection. BL2 is a game i love dearly, and I'd honestly buy it for the switch just because its a great game to me and i'd love being able to play it on there, but im extremely turned away from the ideal knowing it will cost me at least 25 bucks for it and to have the shortest DLC to access content i already bought with the handsome jack collection."
14646,"Absolutely titanic amount of content and side quests between the main game and the incredibly funny and engaging DLC. The humor is on point, the environments are cool as hell, the characters are all crazy and interesting. Handsome Jack is my favorite villain in any video game ever. The colossal amount of weapons and shields and grenades combined with skill trees makes the gameplay very fun and engaging as well. It's Borderlands. Highly recommended."
14647,"quite epic
"
14648,"A lot of super annoying sidequests, but innovative gun system that creates infinite permutations via recombining various parts, some parts themed by fictional OEMs have similar capabilities (e.g. all Brand X guns are disposable so instead of reloading the empty gun it throws it forward with light splash damage, Brand Y has explosive bullets, etc etc)

The story is far-out but well done, but the characters (even the henchmen) have a lot of personality and are very fleshed out, and have some comical organic interactions. Also CL4P-TP's cheerful mental juxtaposition from reality never ceases to entertain me. And the grenade functionality is a lot of fun as well."
14649,is coo
14650,"Shooter game, exploration, hours of game and nice moments. Borderlands. Test it.

I can play very well

14652,This is a must have if you like looting and shooting!
14653,GG
14654,amazing game 10/10
14655,Just buy the game seriously. Whatever it costs you're getting some much Value out of it
14656,haha buzz axe go brrrrr
14657,"Best features: solo/co-op campaign & randomly generated loot. I feel there's a lot of replay value. Different characters/classes, different loot, NG+. It's exciting to see what kind of weapon you might find next (even after playing a long time). The optional side missions can be kinda boring, but the story missions are decent and keep you going. The difficulty is just right, not too challenging, but not a walk in a park either.

If don't mind some fantasy, I also strongly recommend the DLC ""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep"" for some extra story missions (in separate story)."
14658,Borderlands 2 is GOAT hands down love every minute of it
14659,Straight forward FPS with the creativity turned way up. Mad Max-ish world with a sly and aloof feel. Always wanted to binge this game and now I'm glad I am.
14660,"Its so fun and awesome
"
14661,Hahaha gun go bang
14662,"i wasn't going to purchase this game but i did and.................... the game and characters are so much fun! npcs, even. so it's a thumbs UP. will be trying the bl3 as well."

14667,"Ok first, let me just say that I haven't played this game since about 2019. But OH BOY do I love it. I spent hours upon hours (about 125), and don't regret a single one. This game brought me countless fun, memories, challenges, and even frustrations. I wish that my computer could still run this, but with my plans for an upgrade soon I should be able to play again. 11/10, buy immediately. (Also a side note, I bought the handsome collection, so I got some DLCs and another Borderlands game too which I didn't like as much.)"

14728,"This game has a special place in my soul. I remember coming out of Borderlands 1 wanting more, and upon my first time playing Borderlands 2 back when it was released, I loved it even more than I did the first one. I have since spent way too many hours of my life being hopelessly in love with this game, playing on the Xbox & now on PC (the addition of mods has completely reignited my addiction to this game). The amazing characters, vault hunters, gunplay & guns themselves absolutely entranced me. But above all, this game has undoubtedly one of my favourite stories ever. I can't express in my mere smooth-brained words how unequivocally perfect the story is in this game. Handsome Jack is one of the best characters ever created, in both a literal & figurative sense. No other character in history has ever made me feel more conflicted as Handsome Jack. On top of an arguably perfect game, the community has also brought me endless joy. Watching Youtubers like Ki11er Six, JoltzDude139, YOTESLAYA (RIP) & many more evoked countless laughs from me & still does today. I love every Borderlands game, but pound for pound, this is my absolute favourite, without a doubt. I urge anyone who hasn't experienced this masterpiece to do so without a second thought. One of my favourite games EVER."
14729,One of all time favs. :)

14754,"[h1]Best FPS game I've ever played![/h1]

The story is fun & enjoyable. Love the characters & personalities, the jokes, and stunning scenery of post-apocalyptic & steampunk combined. There are a lot of interesting quests like: you massacre every enemies or find treasures. The main characters are just awesome! They have different skills (don't forget the costumes!) so you can choose whatever character's skill do you like. I really like the weapons design, it's like every weapon is one of a kind.

Although the game was good, it has flaws. I [b]REALLY HATE[/b] the timed quest. I want to enjoy the game not speedrunning it. And the reward.. well.. not worth it.. I can't play co-op too, maybe because of the internet connection...

This game is awesome. Though old, but it still fun to play solo or with friends and has replay value. Buy the DLC too, it's worth it!

14772,"This game may have came out all the way back on the 18th September 2012 but that doesn't mean that nearly 9 years later that this game isn't still a all time favourite of mine and it should be a favourite of yours as well, this game may seem very basic to a new player, with the normal looter shooter mechanics but once you have played it for a while you start to under stand the mechanics of the game and slowly over time you'll start to know what to do early game, mid game and late game for farming gear, killing bosses and even speeding running parts of the game or even the whole game if you have played it enough. Once you feel burnt out of the game and you feel like you've played very bit of content this nearly 9 year old game has to offer, there are mods that you can play around with to make the experience totally different in many ways that make it unique every time you play."

14788,"I wish there was a star rating system to give this 3 stars. It has alot of game for going on sale for 5$ constantly. It's co-op and everyone has it, so you're not alone. But even with this games age, they choose to fix fun exploits instead of irritating bugs, even releasing a new dlc, but not fixing inherent gameplay problems. The hardest difficulty is quite difficult, but the don't add a way to stop yourself from leveling, essentially forcing every character to play at that level or be abandoned, and honestly, UVHM isnt for everyone and its sad they make the game so honestly broken at the end. You get this max level legendary shield and some crazy badass guns, planning to spend 1000 ammo into some boss' head, and they 2 shot you, and the small enemies run away so you cant second wind, then the boss gets all of its health back, rinse and repeat. To play on the hardest difficulty, you get forced into a meta."

14790,"Borderlands 2 is my favorite game in the Borderlands series. Playing this originally when it came out on console to re-visiting the game with my close friends on Steam I can say through multiple classes, playthroughs, humor, and multiple other things, Borderlands 2 is the best in the series.

One thing that I put into my Borderlands 3 review is that the series really changed after this entry (or potentially The Pre-Sequel depending on how you look at it) and so many bad decisions were made. Borderlands 2 was definitely the peak of the series and I truly hope Gearbox can come back to what made 2 so special with gameplay, UI, humor, and more."

It even kicks you out of solo sometimes saying you have lost internet connection - while all other processes on my machine show that my connection is stable.

They broke their game - maybe on purpose, to push the community to buy BL3..??

14814,"Amazing, just finished this game

Krieg does the job, killing with the buzzsaw skill while jumping is the coolest way possible to kill Jack 

Well yeah, I can actually complete this game in less than 10 hours, and the few reasons that would extend the playtime is
-Side missions 
-Deaths
-Grinding 
-Inventory Sorting

But spending 30+ hours just for side mission and trying new guns are always worth it.
You would die a lot, I'd really mean A LOT and you will learn whatever you could do to get back up on your feet.
I didn't really grind, but all I did was just cleaning the map.
Sort your inventory, keep the ones that you think it's worth keeping, sell the trashes

Overall this is might be the worthiest $9 I've ever spent 

Thank you gearbox, very cool 👍

EDIT: This is not a game to play at high levels.  It's a grind to take down thew health bar of a boss.  Not much fun.  I bought BL3, but I don't want to play it now because I think it will turn out the same.  I wish I never played this."

14840,"It's on the older side these days, and has its annoying younger sibling to deal with. And that cash-grab of a DLC- what was it called? Commande-zzzzz. 
The  base game and its DLCs (minus commande-zzzz) is some quality work, however, Massive step-up over its predecessor and its pre-sequel. 
It gets even better with friends."
14841,"The Borderlands franchise is my favorite of all time. Most of my playtime in this game took place on the Xbox, but I still have plenty of characters at level 72+ on PC. The gameplay loop is flawless and most of the DLC is amazing. I would strongly recommend getting the Handsome Collection if you can do so."

Just kidding, I totally recommend this game. 
I generally don't buy games, but this is totally worth getting (especially if it goes on sale)!

Basically you pick a character class and run around and shoot bad guys and weird creatures.

Reinstalled this game to try and replay one of my favorite old games, instead I was locked behind a paywall for a game I've already purchased.

My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
14865,Fuck this game. Crashed every time I launched it
14866,One of the best game ever.
14867,hella fun game with friends
14868,"The graphics are obnoxious and uninspired. Everything being outlined black gives you a headache. The gameplay is cancer. The story is irritating to follow. There is no gradual introduction to anything. Once you start playing, the entire game and its over complicated mechanics and try-hard graphics are shoved down your throat. The application itself is unstable as hell. You get it for the first time and for some glorious reason the chosen default resolution for this game is 800x600. Changing it basically broke my monitor. Pressing alt+tab literally breaks the game. Worthless, boring, frustrating, overwhelming, obnoxious. Do not buy."

14899,"24 hours on PC and over 1000 on different consoles throughout the years Borderlands 2 is a game I will NEVER stop recommending. Looking to spend a couple hours with some friends just casually playing a game? Borderlands 2! Want a game you can spend hundreds of hours on one character changing loot and skills until you finally find perfection? Borderlands 2! This game will have you laughing, angry, and emotional (But mostly laughing) The last 10/10 Borderlands game in the franchise today i'd say is still worth 60$ let alone the low price point it's at now.

14930,"So, the game is very fun in terms of play and humor, also a big aspect of this game is that you can play coop up to 4 people so you can really have fun. There are many references to other games such as minecraft or doom. The texts that have been added to the game can also make a person smile. I really respect that they made a fun and playable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes to have fun"

14976,yes
14977,"Nuts. Never expected to spent 45 hours (and counting) on a PC game (though that's the average for most gamers). Nearly 95% into the game (with Handsome Jack being the final boss), I can say that Borderlands 2 is worth every penny. Especially during sales, RM9:50? GET IT PLEASE. 

What this game does not state in its tags however is how incredibly open world B2 is. I'm very intrigued at how expansive this game is along with the side missions that unlocked a new piece of each region/world B2 has to offer to the players. Best part? There's a teleporter that enables you to teleport to most main locations and a vehicle ramp so you don't have spend years to walk your ass across the pacific to get from china to costa rica. Plot-wise, I can't say much since I haven't played the first game but for B2 alone, taking down a supposedly heroic villain is an interesting take. Props to the developer with their phenomenal work in the inventory offered/looted. From type to design, there is so much detail and variety in not just the guns but also the rest of the inventory (relics, shields, grenades). I certainly can't imagine the amount of time and effort spent in developing to this level of sophistication.

Edit: Now that I've completed the game, I can fully attest that B2 is amazing."

WACK. I have a life outside of Borderlands 2. Anyways, fun while it lasted but I'm not going to replay that part, or any part thereafter. When I start a game, if it doesn't have me hooked within 5 hours, it probably won't ever have me hooked. Borderland 2 won't even give me the chance, I'll have to spend another hour or whatever fighting back to the captain flynt part. Bummer, I wanted to get into this one.

once you play you really can't stop. I'm so fascinated with every single detail in this game. The art, the characters, the game play..  everything is in its perfect shape and place, despite being an 'old' game, it truly is a master piece and i can tell why people do have 10k+ hours in it. I've played some missions over and over again with different people, alone or some friends ( since i don't have many) and each experience was far away different from the first one just because those whom u play with are different. i got it yesterday and i was like okay lemme just see what I've got. ended up playing 10 hours straight.."

15074,"Borderlands 2 is the only good game in the series, and I will die on this hill. I'll also die for Krieg.

Unlike the first Borderlands, this one actually has great weapons, fun DLC campaigns, interesting classes, interactive thematic talents that aren't just boring percentage stat boosts, and just looks and feels better in every way. Outstanding example of a sequel done right. So purists of the first entry are just being stubborn because they didn't give later games a chance. Ignore them.

The Presequel and Borderlands 3 are not very good. Seriously, if you want to play some of this franchise with friends, just get this one, optimally when the huge bundles of DLC content go on sale. I don't recommend picking up any DLC unless you get it on a sale. It's really good stuff, the price points just aren't where they should be without a discount.

Borderlands 2 also contains the only jokes in the franchise that have managed to make me laugh. Bit of a yikes for the series having a comedic tone the whole way through."

15141,"Looked up Borderlands 2, because I wanted to play an old game that I used to like. Bought it with base dlc for $40... and the whole handsome collection didnt show up for $10... So now I have to spend a bunch of money on dlcs's that they failed to mention I could have gotten all for $10. Thats ridiculous in my opinion, and I shouldnt have to spend all of this money on the game since I couldve gotten it for $10. I just want the dlc's man..."

15169,"Playing the game again was Nostalgic and runs pretty well on my PC.
Not much else to add since im not really good at reviews."
15170,"This game has been one that I have dreaded playing for a long time... While I had heard that the game was amazing and a true masterpiece of the FPS RPG Genre I must admit that the artstyle was something that left a sour taste in my mouth as the visuals were particularly not my favourite. However I lost a bet with a friend years ago and he told me that as compensation I had to buy this game and one day do a runthrough with him to truly see what a masterpiece this game was, so I purchased it but still hadn't played it for some time. Then my roommate saw that I owned it and asked if he could use my Steam to play it on my PC every so often, even bought all the DLC shortly afterwards (minus the Commander Lilith DLC that leads into Borderlands 3 which i still have yet to obtain) just so he could play it not far from me while I was chilling on my Playstation or Xbox... And the jokes about this game, all over my facebook and all over my youtube for years even to the point that friends of mine made references to this game in D&D games that I was the Dungeon Master for... It seemed I could not escape my fate from this game, and so finally... as of about 8 days ago... I bit the bullet, got three of my mates, one who hadn't played before either and two that had, and we finally did a runthrough...

Now of my 104 hours that the review says I will admit that about 60 of them are actually mine, and the artstyle still annoys the hell out of me to this day BUT the rest of the game? Well it more than makes up for the artstyle's aggravation as this game is fun, hilarious and just left me with too many moments of joy, laughter and WTF episodes and my only regret is that in all honesty I should have played this sooner... I should have been shooting skag's in the mouth just as I left Highschool, I should have been beating down Psycho Midgets well before I moved towns and I sure as hell should have been cracking Handsome Jack's smug skull in WELL BEFORE I started university... But alas my stubbornness and that deplorable artstyle truly got in the way of this otherwise gem in the rough.

So thank you friend of mine for making that bet with me and forcing me to give it an honest go, for the hilarious moments were truly great, thank you players of my games for making references from well written lines and characters from this fantastic game, thank you best friends for joining me on this great crusade through Pandora and helping me to see the fun, thank you 2K for getting this game to all the boys and girls who really wanna smash Psycho's in the wasteland and thank you Gearbox and their staff members for taking the time to make this game as amazing and enjoyable as it is (minus the artists, i'm sorry but I cannot give you any praise as I can never personally forgive the style personally).

Now if you'll excuse me... I'm probably going to sink another 100 hours into this game at the very least and even play all the other sequels, prequels and predecessors with my friends to make up for lost time.

10/10 writing
10/10 humour
9/10 music composition

15171,poggies
15172,game good play this yep
15173,played BL2 on the xbox 360 and i'm returning to it on PC years later. the fact that tiny tina's lazy eye isn't patched still is what makes this game great. 47/10 i am an EXTREMELY satisfied customer
15174,"So when I first tried to play this game 3 years ago, I got bored long before Sanctuary and quit. I played it again in 2021, because I genuinely did not understand the hype or the user score, but it makes sense now..

The game has a lot of outstanding aspects to it, from the writing to the music-score, and the gameplay really is one of those things where the more time you put into it, the more enjoyment you get out of it.

What I didn't like is playing this game solo is the balancing. Sometimes I was too over-leveled for a main mission because I did one or two extra side missions. Other times, especially during the end game, I kept getting one-shotted, and had to do 4 side missions to level up once. I also do feel as if this game is a little bit too much of a time-sink. Even though it is fun, it doesn't really have a purpose outside of grinding, even though I do think the stories portrayed in this - including the memes - were amazing.
"
15175,Still better than anything that came after it in this series. Stands as a game still worth $60 which luckily you can grab the game + dlc for half that. so do it!
15176,very good
15177,v fun
15178,"this game is one of the best games you can pay i love it more now after 8 yrs 
Its are fast and full on game LOVE IT"
15179,It's pog.
15180,"+ Great story
+ Tons of weapons/items that divided into 9 ranks of rarity. At first you'll just see a normal gun that just shoots normal bullets because you can't get legendary gun (orange) or higher rarity gun yet. Once you can obtain legendary or higher rarity gun, you'll start to see more unique weapon with unique stats/abilities/effects...
+ 6 Character classes to choose, with their own unique skills and abilities that make this game have high replayability value.
+ Great game to play with friends
+ Lot of side quest and challenges

- Minor bugs
- Bad driving mechanic

15181,One of the best games of all time that i played sense it first released and counting past BL3
15182,Play this instead of borderlands 3

Thank you for helping me with insomnia problem."
15190,"This is one of my favorite games of ALL time.  Good game mechanics, replayability and just overall fun, I highly recommend this game."
15191,"A real fun open-world looter shooter that is the best of three. A vast open world that feels alive with things happening al the time. Fun side quests, and the best part is the gameplay, really satisfying gunplay and over a milion gun variants. This game is and always will be a classic in videogame history and it’s really worth trying out. Dident really care that much about the story, but it has funny and lovable characters and the gameplay and gunplay really steals the show. As said before, it’s worth a try!"
15192,It gave me brain damage that made me see things around the house based on their rarity. 10/10 would play it again

15211,"An absolute classic, get it if you don't have it, but on heavy sale as these people already got paid enough for it. Revolves around a central misunderstanding of mental health issues but has great art style, colourful characters and guns with personality"
15212,"Timeless masterpiece.  Been playing games for nearly 40 years and Borderlands 2 is easily in my top 5 all time favorite.  The story, music, and characters are vividly amazing.  The DLC's are very well done.  When I play Borderlands 2 I am there in Pandora and completely immersed.  I'll never forget the first time I played it and being completely overwhelmed and learning everything while I tried to survive in the frozen wastes and the story just took me along and the music kept my blood pumping.  I went into this game completely blind knowing nothing about it and I had not played the first Borderlands.  I believe those who don't even like first person shooters or gun games in general will enjoy this experience."

15238,fun stuff
15239,"Played co-op with my boyfriend, very satisfying shooter and an interesting story"
15240,"Maya

Pros:

Best healing abilities in the game. Sweet Release and Elated are unmatched when it comes to providing health, and Life Tap makes you completely immortal.

Best co-op partner in the game. Res is the best co-op skill, and PL's CC is key to keeping mobs managed. Her healing abilities are also very respectable even during raids.

Definitely one of the most powerful mobbers in the game, coming in behind only Zer0 and Sal.

Cons:

Very PL dependent. Almost all of her good skills are only active if you can PL something, and that can fall off during boss fights or if you can't PL something in general.

Poor damage dealer in raids. Beehawking is nearly mandatory for her to provide damage. Granted, she's probably the only character that can use it as a legitimate strategy with the Cat COM, but still.

Slightly weak damage capabilities. Maya is a little more reliant that the other characters on good equipment, since she doesn't have as many skills that increase her damage. The few skills she does have are extremely powerful, however.

Role: CC/support. You can definitely play a more aggressive role if you build her right.

Zer0

Pros:

Extremely powerful damage. Zer0 ranks only behind Sal when it comes to overall damage output, and both of his strongest builds are capable of some downright obscene kills.

Arguably the second tankiest character in the game if you play melee. Zer0 basically can't die as long as you're in melee range of an enemy.

Zer0's gear requirements are very light. Due to the nature of Critical Ascension, some very basic snipers will be enough to tear through mobs given enough stacks. The two most important weapons in the melee build are very easy quests, and everything else can be obtained in vending machines if you're really desperate.

Cons:

Highest skill ceiling in the game. He is not an easy character to play, and an even harder one to master. Be prepared to read up and practice a lot if you want to achieve some of the things he's capable of.

Adding on to the previous point, Zer0 requires that you can aim well. Sniping obviously demands excellent precision, and melee requires some very precise maneuvers and actions to be potent.

Fairly weak when it comes to actually surviving if you're not playing the melee style. You'll either need to take cover a lot, have a way of recovering health, or dodge very well.

Role: Main damage dealer or supporting other players with damage and Kunai.

Axton

Pros:

Simplest character by far. His skills don't do anything fancy--they just read ""increase damage"" or ""shield good"". His action skill is obviously uncomplicated and straightforward, and his playstyle is very reminiscent of your standard FPS hero: your only job is to click on enemies repeatedly until they die.

Extremely powerful explosive damage. Axton is capable of killing some raid bosses faster than Sal if you utilize his explosive damage to the fullest, and when you take into account the fact that Torgue weapons benefit from both gun and grenade damage, he becomes an absolute powerhouse.

Excellent shield abilities. If it weren't for the fact that Gaige has a skill that reads ""your shields never go down ever"", Axton would be the best character when it comes to managing your shields. This makes him the second best character when it comes to using the Bee.

Cons:

Even with his plethora of gun damage abilities, Axton's damage can be lacking compared to what some of the other characters can put out. This naturally lends him to have the second strictest gear requirements and excellent DM (though not as much as Zer0) to be able to match the other Vault Hunters in some of their more impressive feats.

In exchange for his simple but efficient playstyle, Axton sacrifices diversity. There aren't as many ways to build him, and his playstyle might become boring at the higher levels. Being a jack of all trades means that he is also a master of none.

Role: Axton can play a lot of roles, but I like playing him as a support/general damage dealer.

Gaige

Pros:

Anarchy is one of the most powerful skills in the game. I don't like it, but I will not let that change the fact that Anarchy is simply absurd and can allow Gaige to keep up and even surpass some of the damage from the other characters.

Best shield abilities in the game. Axton used to take this spot for me, but after playing with Gaige, I've come to the realization that Blood-Soaked Shields is downright absurd. Your shield will basically never be down.

Lightest gear requirements. Anarchy, and to a lesser extent slag, can bring even mediore guns to the damage-dealing capabilities of some legendaries. Her best gear is all received as quest rewards or are very easily farmable.

Cons:

Probably even more boring than Axton. You'll spend half of your time shooting at the ground, and there's not a lot of crazy aiming involved.

Anarchy is a fickle skill. If you're using it to boost your weak guns, dying will mean that you are now stuck with a character that has no other good damage boosts. Survival becomes hyper-important.

Deathtrap has a host of bugs and issues, and is slightly unreliable as a combat partner. Granted, you don't need him to still be able to absolutely destroy mobs, but it's something to consider.

Role: I'm still inexperienced with Gaige, so I can't pinpoint a role for her yet. I'd just use her as a general nuker--spam the battlefield with homing ricochet bullets and let Deathtrap or your teammates play clean up.

Krieg

Pros:

I was wrong about Gaige: I think Krieg has the lightest gear requirements, as there are plenty of videos of him going through UVHM without any gear whatsoever.

Arguably the most powerful skill tree abilities in the game. Release the Beast is even stronger than MMF in some cases, Bloodsplosion alone can clear entire rooms with a single kill, and Raving Retribution is almost never bad even though it's only fire element.

Cons:

His playstyle is the most unique in Borderlands, and can definitely take some time to get used to. It's not difficult like Zer0's is, just strange and might be a little counterintuitive at first.

I haven't played Krieg a lot either.

Role: Definitely a main damage dealer. I really can't wait to take Krieg into the higher levels to make use of his insane survival and damaging skill tree.

Sal

Pros:

Everything. Sal is broken.

Cons:

If you don't like your video games to be an exercise in pressing your forward movement key and holding down your two mouse buttons, then Sal is not the character for you. Sal is broken.

Side notes:

Sal is broken.

Role: Team carry/god-tier damage dealer/kill everything, what are teammates. Sal is broken.

tl;dr Sal is broken."
15241,"Memorable story and characters, complex weapon drop/looting mechanic unlike any other game. Everyone should have this in their library."
15242,I miss Handsome Jack.
15243,gud game
15244,good game
15245,"Probably the best Borderlands title money can buy (if you include the Unassuming Docks DLC). Only a couple of flaws hold this one back, such as high rarity weapons sometimes not being very useful (counterintuitive) and a lot of poor quality DLC, with Unassuming Docks being exempted.

If you can grab it on sale with all the DLC in a bundle, you will have a lot of content to play through for a great price point."
15246,i throw gun it blows up = cool
15247,"i played this game back in 2012 when it came out, played it again in 2015, 2017,2019, 2021. I find this to be the best borderlands game ever. Its true that borderlands 3 features a ton of new updates but the world of Pandora in Borderlands 2 is closer to my heart. The character of Krieg is one of the main reasons as to why I've come back tot his game time and time again."
15248,"Very fun game to play. When first starting playing, it reminded me of Mad Max meets Western. Love the sound effects,the music, and the graphics of the game"
15249,Amazing game 10/10
15250,"For sure the lengthiest 100% I have on Steam, but not the hardest. There is a lot of fun to be had with this game until you get to the very end and are required to grind for upwards of 50 hours for experience and weapons in order to kill 2 or 3 bosses that are required for achievements. I got very tired of playing the game near the end and I'm very glad I found a glitch with one of my weapons that made it do massive damage or else my total playtime would be at least 150 hours. Very fun game to either play with friends or play through casually but I would not recommend getting it and planning on getting all achievements because it requires a massive amount of time in order to get it, as well as purchasing another dlc outside of the handsome collection because it doesn't come with a dlc with achievements locked behind it."
15251,just a great game to chill and play
15252,its pretty epic
15253,The best looter shooter I've ever experienced. What more do I need to say.
15254,"A classic, I've loved this game since its original release and it's still amazing now. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the humour and story is great and it's just so satisfying to play, alone or multiplayer. I'm so glad I got to play this game again."

15259,"It's 2021 and I haven't written a review for B2 yet.  That's a bit of a mind crime.  

There's little more that may be said about this team co-op looter/shooter masterpiece other than, buy it, play the **** out of it, and experience the last truly great game in the Borderlands franchise. 

(PSA/warning for dog lovers: turn off your volume and subtitles during Brick's side mission to kill the Sheriff of Lynchwood.)"
15260,"on paper i should hate this game but it is unfortunately one of the best fps games ever made, almost everything in this fucking game is bugged but like in a good way and it simply would not be good if it was coded well"

15275,Still holds up super well! Tons of fun. Still the best looter/shooter? Maybe!
15276,"Well, I barely played any Borderlands in my life until now. The game is nearing 9 years old and its still as fun as ever. All the DLC's that Gearbox has released has made the game more playable and there is so much to do. Currently my friend and I are grinding to level 80 OP 10's, me on Gaige and he is on Siren. I've fully completed the story once but its a grind to get higher level now."

15285,funny but I got no friends to play with :((((((( Also some animations are weird but that's okay

15301,We all know this is a masterpiece.
15302,mj
15303,game boring after couple hours
15304,"Fun FPS, well written and with a lot of gems.
At the start it’s a bit overwhelming the amount of weapons but then you realize most of them suck and you stick to the good ones. Despite having a comparison system, it’s a pain in the ass actually deciding which ones are better.
The AI it’s pretty terrible, at least imo. Sometimes it’s super hard other times super easy. I know it has to do with the play style and the level system vs missions, but nevertheless bummer.
I think I got almost all the DLCs and I have to say, the game is huge... Most of the time in a good way but sometimes it’s just enough. I know you don’t need to do every single mission but when you realize many just seem to be stalling, it’s a shame.
Having the possibility of driving around its great, but having played Mad Max, for example, this is kind of a joke.
On the same note, I also wish I could have the ability to switch to 3rd person.
This is the first time playing Borderlands and overall I think it’s definitely a buy but it has potential to be much better."
15305,"B0red BNK3R so hard my game crashed and burst my eardrum

10/10 would recommend"

15316,Good game immersive and very enjoyable
15317,"Very feel good shooter game, for the best type of causes. Amazing to play with friends, and just strangers, albeit a little dead sometimes, but I love the game regardless. The story is rich, and it has twists and turns, and a great amount of just humor to pass around and enjoy the game even more."
15318,very fast paced and fun to play with friends
15319,this game is fun and realy hard to beat it
15320,Very Good
15321,I absolutely love the borderlands series.
15322,The sequence to the firt Borberlangs game
15323,grinding is fun bro. that is all.
15324,esta chido
15325,you could play 800 hours on one save and you still might not have all the achievements
15326,Great game
15327,"Okay, I just want to start by saying that I absolutely HATE shooter games, but this game is one of my favorites.

I first played this game when I was borrowing from a Steam friend, and I loved it! This game has an amazing story line and great characters. I love Scooter and Ellie! They are SO funny! And Claptrap is pretty funny too. (Make sure to do his side quest called: ""Claptrap's Birthday"".)

The game has many different varieties of characters, but two of then are DLC characters, and I personally feel that the Mechromancer is the best character, who is a DLC. Below I say which character is best for different things.

***BASE GAME***

Axton (The Commando)
 - Special Ability: He summons a turret which stands where you put it and shoots your enemies. You can later upgrade his turret to do other more amazing things.
 - He focuses on pet building because of his turret.

Maya (The Siren)
 - Special Ability: She creates a bubble that lifts people into the air and they cannot move. (I think it lasts for 10 seconds.) You can also upgrade this.
 - She focuses on using fire as her main element and she can be built as a healer if you want.

Zer0 (The Assassin)
DISCLAIMER: I have not played Zer0 yet and don't know anything about him other than the fact that he uses Snipers and Melee attacks.

Salvador (The Gunzerker)
 - Special Ability: He can shoot the first two equipped guns he has at the same time. 
 - He focuses on shooting guns because he is the Gunzerker


***DLC***

MECHROMANCER PACK

Gaige (The Mechromancer)
 - Special Ability: She summons a robot named Deathtrap to fight. It is similar to Axton's turret, but Deathtrap moves around to enemies.
 - Being my favorite character, I know a good amount about what Gaige specializes in. She focuses on using shock damage as her element and pet building


PSYCHO PACK

Krieg (The Psycho)
DISCLAIMER: Because I do not own this DLC and I never had the intent of playing Krieg, I know almost nothing about him other than the fact that he mainly focuses on being set on fire and nearly dead. Although, I do recommend ALWAYS having a fire gun of some kind with you if you play Krieg.

Also, after mentioning a few of the elements of the game, I though that I might as well list all of them

Fire: This is the element recommended for the RED life bars.
Electricity or Shock: Used for BLUE life bars.
Corrosive: Used on GOLD life bars and any machine.
Slag: I don't really know exactly what is weak to Slag, but it is one of my favorite elements.
Explosive: Used on pretty much anything. (If you are fighting robots and do not have Corrosive guns, use Explosive.)

So, whether you like shooter games or not, get this game. I promise you'll like it."
15328,good game
15329,"It's not too bad, I guess. 10/10"
15330,luv this gayme

15341,GOOD SOLID FPS
15342,"I couldn't recommend this game more as if you love run and gun FPS games with an amazing story with well placed humor thrown in, then you will LOVE this game. Absolute master piece!<3"
15343,yes
15344,great game bought on 3 systems
15345,cool game would recommend
15346,"Game Good, still don't like the way Gearbox handled BL3, but BL2 is still a classic at this point. If you've never played it, you're missing out."

15353,is good
15354,i am willing to play it and enjoy it even at 20 fps
15355,"I like to rate games with a succinct but comprehensive format, averaging 5 key areas scored out of 5:
1 = bad
2 = mediocre
3 = good
4 = great
5 = perfect

Audio 4/5
Voice acting is great, characters are hilarious. Good music and effects.

Visual 4/5
Fantastic effects and art style. Love the cell shading. Really cool character and world designs.

Gameplay 4/5
Insane fun playing multiplayer with friends. I don't think it would have the same level of fun playing solo. Controls are tight, you can play around with different character builds.

Story 3/5
TBH I wasn't paying too close attention because I was chatting with my buddies most of the time, but there is something entertaining there. I haven't played much of the first game and don't think I'm missing anything.

Value 4/5
We have about 24 hours in this run, having a blast playing the DLC. Purchased the sequel.

Total 3.8/5
Perfect if you want a fun casual multiplayer game to hang out with your bros!"

Now lets talk about the cars they felt like shit in 1 they feel shit here and they continue to feel bad in 3 aswell im not sure why they just cant make normal car physics and controls but other then that i cant complain much!"
15390,really good game
15391,its pretty good
15392,"After playing to the first Borderlands at least a year apart, I decided to try Borderlands 2 with a friend. But the disappointment is great. Nothing has changed. The scenery is as empty as ever, the story is uninteresting and the gameplay is ultra repetitive. If you've already played the previous games of the franchise, don't bother."

15408,"iconic characters, voice lines, and weapons. endless replay-ability, great story, phenomenal DLC and a loveable welcoming community who love mods (if your into that) honestly one of the greatest games i've played that hold a spot in my heart. the time ive played is not accurate to the multiple accounts and consoles ive played this on. I'd reccomend."
15409,"This game is the KING of looter shooters and should be the golden standard for the genre. It has plenty of loot thrown at you with legendaries having fun and unique perks, 6 playable characters/classes (4 without dlc) all with 3 skill trees each, a decent story with one of the most beloved video game villains of the franchise and dare I say in gaming altogether, raid bosses to farm for unique loot in the endgame (although I'd call most of them glorified bullet sponges before I call them a raid boss), and pretty funny humor, albeit a little dated at times, throughout in the main story and sidequests.

TL;DR The game has a lot of charm with good loot constantly thrown at you, good systems in place, good gunplay for it's time, and a whole hell of a lot of replayability whether it's your first playthrough or your hundredth."
15410,LOVE THIS GAME. Played it on PS3 PS4 and now PC.
15411,"it is fun 
"
15412,I Love This Game
15413,"There are basically millions of reviews on this game already.

All I'm going to add onto that myriad of views is this.... Over the last 7 years having gotten round to finishing a complete play through of the game while really being serious about it with the advent of Commander Lilith and The Fight for Sanctuary; and the previous Tiny Tina DLC, BL2 surprised me with a nice narrative towards the very end. It's been awesome.

Indeed ""3 or Bust!"" now."
15414,"I still think this is the best borderlands game of them all. While I haven't played 1, I've played the rest, and this is the best one I keep thinking about years later."

15438,"A short summary of the game on a Macbook Air 2020 w/ M1

I originally played Borderlands 2 back in the PS3 Era. I bought it on sale on steam a few years ago for a couple of dollars, and like many of my games, it had really just sat there unplayed. I recently purchased a Macbook Air M1, and had read this game played wonderfully on this system. I downloaded the game and set off on a new but rather familiar adventure. The game runs flawlessly on the M1 Macbook Air. I can clock in around 4 hours of solid gameplay w/ graphics settings set to high and computer brightness up (maybe needlessly) before I even need to think about plugging in a charger. What i find incredible about this, is I am able to get around 60 FPS most of the time on a tiny, portable Macbook Air.

I nearly bought a Switch, but after seeing and playing some of the games that are running at 60+ on the new Macbook, I no longer see the need for one. The resolution this thing is playing on is damn near the native 2k+... without the need to have it plugged in to a wall. The battery also seems to last longer than the switch does on the original borderlands GOTY re-release.

Anyway, sorry for chasing that rabbit. If you have an M1 Macbook Air - Pro, you HAVE to experience Borderlands on the go. 

Looking forward to more M1 Optimized titles from 2k. They seem to be KILLING it as of late, I hope they are able to get Borderlands 1 to run with it, and Borderlands 3 seems to also be a huge title that works with the new M1 Architecture. I just hate they don't have 3 on Steam."
15439,One of my favorite games of all time if not my favorite

15446,YES IF U LIKE RNG 10-10 IF U NOW LIKE RNG/FARMING8-10
15447,"There is a reason that this game is the go to when people think of looter shooters or co-op shooters. The game has a combat loop that is constantly kept interesting by the new abilities and weapons you constantly unlock. Each area of the game has a different aesthetic and the different enemy types you find in each area ensures that all of these areas will feel unique. 
The feeling of getting an amazing new gun that complements your playstyle and going through different areas with your friends just creates an amazing experience, especially when the soundtrack kicks in. 

Overall, if you and a group of friends like shooter games and the RPG do quests and get better loot loop set in a crude yet funny story, then you will love this game."

15450,pretty fire ass game not gonna lie
15451,game play was fun with friends and by your self over all great and long game to play.
15452,A pyscho screamed semen and then killed me. 10/10
15453,"daddy likes
"
15454,Love this game. I will play it on and off for the rest of my life.
15455,hampter
15456,my dad and me played this game in 2012 so yes i give it that
15457,"It's more Borderlands, so if you liked the first you'll like this one. More guns, a much better story, more horrible and stupid humour (in a good way of course), a lot more variety in environments, and even more guns. The DLC is great too. I'd highly recommend getting it all (the Handsome Jack Collection is the way to go), as it gives you more time with this game and some really good loot. There are some negatives since vehicle controls are still pretty bad and you'll occasionally get stuck on/in something, but you'll barely notice the few bad things because the game is just so good overall."
15458,"i also have all three Borderlands series on my Xbox and I love this game. It has issues just like any other game but I love the characters, they are very engaging. you can immerse yourself into your character and become a part of the Borderlands family."
15459,"This is one of my fav games of all time. Out of all the games ive ever played, this one has the most replay ability. Ive almost put 1000 hours into the game and ive cherished every single one."
15460,"Great game. A massive improvement to the original game (although the 1st Borderlands was a great start anyway) whilst keeping the roots in place. Nice plot, cool characters and their perks and a lot of places to visit and get various missions from. I am also satisfied with the fact the most missions aren't repetitive. Sure, some of the objectives can be similar but the outcomes are not identical."
15461,
15462,I originally played this game on my PS4 and it is still as memorable and as good it was on my PS4
15463,"Boringlands 2 is the most boring video game ever. I tried getting into it so many times, the gameplay loop is repetitive af. It's a dread with zero variety and bland characters. The story is not strong either. On the plus side, there are a couple good jokes among all the garbage.

Fallout 3 feels way more dynamic than this one and that says a lot (especially considering the fact that F3's strong side isn't the gameplay),"
15464,nice
15465,is gud
15466,good
15467,gun go brrrrrrrr
15468,Very fun
15469,funny gun go brrrrr
15470,Another great borderlands game!
15471,good game
15472,Nice
15473,good shooter
15474,"Cool references and unique art style. 10/10 would simp for Moxi. 
Definitely recommended."
15475,this game is great if this game on sale just buy it !!!!
15476,hella good game
15477,yes
15478,My friends recommended me this game for a while. I bought it and wished i had listened to them earlier.
15479,pimentaco
15480,seru
15481,borderlands is the best game especially the third one
15482,Mad max
15483,yes
15484,"One of the best coop, looter, shooter game i've played since release, and it still holds up until now (2021).

Also way better main story than BL3... hate Ava"
15485,great game been playing the series for a long time now this one is still my fav though
15486,"Really fun, dlc makes it a lot more worthwhile. Main story is really good, but I don't like replaying games so the dlc makes it worth my time."
15487,this is the game to play if you are not good at FPS but want to *feel* like you are good at FPS
15488,just plain mindless fun
15489,It is game. Game is good.
15490,One of the top 3 greatest games of all time
15491,i like the part where you shoot a guy
15492,"Characters are fun to play & master. Doesn't have the Atmosphere BL1 had, but Pandara is still fun to explore."
15493,"Best game I have ever played. Gameplay, loot, story. I loved it."
15494,"Best franchise ever. Honestly not even does it have action packed adventure, its lore for the game is pretty deep. Each character has a different value of things on Pandora, and the more I played the more I was intrigued. This is a good purchase if you're looking for fun."
15495,AAAAAAAHHHHHHH KASSIM AAAAAHHHHHH AAAAHHHHHHH KASSIM
15496,"Just played for the first time and my god was i sleeping on this game. If you have never played borderlands games before I highly suggest you do so. 1st game is good imo and am still playing it, but this game just takes it to the next level. More colorful, great villian, GREAT writing/dialogue, smoother experience than 1. 10/10 would recommend"
15497,"A very badly archived game. The final two patches break crossplay between linux, mac, and PC.

As for the game itself, it replicates the feeling of being in a casino without having to lose money, which is nice. The difficulty is entirely unbalanced and dependent on how lucky your gun generations are, which is not.

Don't bother playing it alone."
15498,5/7
15499,"so far i have been playing for 19 hours with my brother i would say i am very very pleased this game is amazing from the story to the graphics this game is really spectacular i would very much recommend this to you but i got it on a sale so you should maybe wait for that if u are short on money yeah over all its a great game
"
15500,e
15501,shoot shoot flashy color make happy
15502,"I played this game for a little bit, it seems good from what i have played, it looks fun, ill edit my review when i have played it a bit more"
15503,"[h1]Tʜᴇ sʜᴏᴏᴛɪɴɢ ᴍᴇᴄʜᴀɴɪᴄs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴏᴏʀ, ʙᴜᴛ ɪɴ ɢᴇɴᴇʀᴀʟ ɪᴛ ɪs ᴘᴏssɪʙʟᴇ ᴛᴏ ᴘʟᴀʏ. Iᴛ's ᴍᴏʀᴇ ꜰᴜɴ ᴛᴏ ᴘʟᴀʏ ɪɴ ᴄᴏ-ᴏᴘ."
15504,i whould recommend this game because if you like online games where you can explore and play with friends. but if you want you can go by yourself destroy tons of bosses and such such more.
15505,poggo

15510,"too addictive
"
15511,yo is the dude on the cover from fortnite? 0_0
15512,"Just finished the main story, Campaign of Carnage, and Assault on Dragon Keep. Yes, this is still a great game despite its age. Probably one of the best looter shooters compared to its more modern/recent competitions. I'll be continuing on the other dlc's after this."
15513,fun and funni.
15514,"The action is fun and the characters are funny; great lines that seem to keep it ""Real""."
15515,fun game
15516,very enjoyable game!

15523,okay

15525,Best looter shooter ever made.

15531,Great game if have someone to play it with.
15532,hands down a classic
15533,classic looter-shooter. great stuff.
15534,Tinytina
15535,"Fantastic place. Glad I made the stop in. Had multiple dishes on the table, pho, pad Thai, hibachi chicken steak and shrimp. Everything was on point. The sushi was prepared and delivered properly as well. Not a single complaint about this place. Thank you Gordon for the awesome food and Madison for the great service."
15536,"Such a MESS. Never go here please.

First off, it started with us putting ourselves on the waitlist. They called us and we ran right back. Noah promised “whatever it takes” he would hold the table for us while we were finishing up drinks at another place.

5 minutes later - guess what? We come back and Noah says his manager didn’t let him hold the table for us so they gave it away.

Hungry and angry we left.

It happened so that no other places were open so we decided to WAIT AGAIN.

We come back, get a table, order and wait for 40 MINUTES for food to come.

Waiter brought edamame rolls for some of us but not for all. So some people are eating, others are not. Water wasn’t served until we asked for the 5th time.

Food: ok but cold

Overal experience: terrible.

Businesses like this were supposed to be extinct after the corona."
15537,holy shit is this game really good fun solo and with the boys
15538,well written masterpiece
15539,Fun game
15540,"fun

15547,Shoot me in the face
15548,its sick!!!!!!
15549,"Very good game, I loved playing Gaige, and the story was FUCKING GREAT. This game is definitely worth buying."
15550,This game is amazing. Buy it if you like any shooter game.
15551,Wtf did they do? I can't even play the game without an internet connection anymore. :/
15552,Fun.
15553,"Extraordinary experience since I started my first playthrough with Zer0 in 2019, not only ostentatious loots, but also exciting story. The only problem, as well as my greatest appeal for Gearbox to fix is the crashing. I have the most constant rate of screen frozen issue while playing with Gaige every time while I farm Bunker and the Warrior. Still strong recommendation though. Best of the borderlands franchise."
15554,"O jogoaj eh bom mas andhjc jack morre, nao gostei"
15555,"It's okay. The different gun brands having more distinct properties than just stat distribution was a nice touch, but apart from that I still prefer the original.
I remember being excited for the release of this game after it being rumoured for a while. Even pre-installed it the night before release and everything. My buddy and I played it for like a week straight and then... I completely forgot about it. Doesn't have the same space western charm of the first game, and the dialogue is notoriously grating to listen to; Claptrap should be deleted from the game and Mr. Torgue's ham-fisted monologue on feminism was pretty embarrassing to listen to, regardless of the positivity of his message. 
Handsome Jack taunting you throughout the game was pretty funny though, I liked him. 7.5/10"
15556,Very fun and exciting game
15557,lilith 😳😳😳
15558,just play the game
15559,What makes this game even better than it already is: Handsome Jack's humiliating Skills.
15560,"It's extremely fun with diverse arsenals and interesting characters. The humor is EXTREMELY dated, however."
15561,Borderblands 4 is 2.
15562,Really fun to play with a friend or two. Gets kinda old if you play it by yourself. Wish class progression happened a bit more quickly and let you branch out more.
15563,Simply Perfect
15564,One of my favorite games of all time. Handsome Jack just makes you want to shoot him more and more every time he opens his mouth....so satisfying
15565,"As expected as it is for a studio to make decent and notable upgrades when creating a sequel, I don't think anyone thought that the Borderlands franchise would be elevated to such heights within just one instalment. Yet here we are, with a genre re-defining title no less, that almost makes the first game look like a tech demo.

Of course there's the usual sequel treatment of having more areas to explore, more enemies to kill with more weapon types, but beyond that there's now an actual, well-written story that solidifies the entire fictional universe and makes you care about the slightest details as they could have major role to play down the line. With a realized world like that, the already amazingly defined characters feel like they fit into the environment surrounding them and can likewise have proper emotional stakes, which is further helped by the fact that a major part of the NPC roster are the previously playable characters from the first installment. In addition, the prominent, fan favorite antagonist could get a review just on him alone, so suffice to say you'll love to hate him and it's no surprise why he stuck around for so long even in future titles.

Speaking of things deserving their own reviews, the DLCs are way above the industry standard. Combined, they offer more original content than the main game and it's arguably where the game reaches its peak. Don't miss out on those.

As far as negatives go, the only thing worth mentioning is the need to replay the main campaign several times in order to reach the endgame, which can get understandbly tiring. Having things dynamically scale to your level only by the third playthrough feels like bit of a mistake, though given how large of a playerbase the game managed to attract, it seems most people got quickly over it.

9.2/10"
15566,best borderlands
15567,Great fun especially with other players.
15568,"It is one of the best games i ever played, everything is hilarious, the story is awesome, and the weapons are the most comical element :)) good graphics, and allot of content. I gladly recommend  this game for every type of player :D"
15569,This game is beyond its time
15570,nice
15571,"Let's start what is good in the game:
- Story
- Characters
- Graphics and visual design (especially the physx effects) 
- Gunplay

What is bad?
There is a ""out of memory"" error every ~2 hours. So the 32GB RAM and the 11GB VRAM are not enough. 

The overall experience. The game constantly raise the enemy level. You cannot make your life easier with boosting the character, because the ""lower lvl"" side and main missions become harder and harder (the game raises 1+ lvl for all the enemies). I just simply stopped playing, because I don't enjoy it.

You have to run through on every map all the time you get a new mission.

Although it could be fun, but I did not enjoy it enough."
15572,Shiny gun makes my heart beat faster
15573,srs? you've never played!? DO IT NAO!!!
15574,One of the few great games my crappy laptop can handle.
15575,"Borderlands 2 is like an explosion of serotonin which keeps you going for most of the game.

Great for completionists especially item wise.

Entertaining, detailed and a meme of a game overall."
15576,yeeeee
15577,im playing as a hopefully lesbian little man right now
15578,ALL LOVE BABYYYYY
15579,Why is lilith telling me to finish my side missions when she's supposed to be kidnapped by jack
15580,may have been a great game but if you cant get it to work consistently on windows 10 then...This was to play with my buddies and cant do shit so big thumbs down!
15581,Got bored pretty fast after 2 hours of slow gameplay.
15582,jack
15583,it's pretty good
15584,"It's Borderlands, what's not to like? 
""do you feel overburdened by money?"""
15585,awsom
15586,It's okay.
15587,"While I don't really enjoy the looter-shooter genre, this game is carried by its' witty writing and interesting gun designs."
15588,ofc its good
15589,very nice gameplay
15590,"The game is fun and there's a lot of stuff to do. If you're reading a review of Borderlands 2 in 2021, wondering whether or not to buy it, I don't know what I can write here that'll change your mind one way or the other."
15591,Pretty good.
15592,In my opinion this is without a doubt one of the best looter shooters out there great writing diverse characters all with niche builds that can satisfy almost everyone an abundance of loot diversity and one of the best antagonist in video game history so 100% recommended especially if you haven't already seen or played it or want a good game to play with friends
15593,Game gets very boring overtime.
15594,pure fun
15595,I have loved Borderlands 2 since I got it on the PS3. I still like it.
15596,"Holy molly guacamolli This is game is perfecto. The villain, plot, animation and the system with millions of weapon is really iconic. Really nice~. (9.3/10) not 10 cause the Multiplayer function is useless since not many player play this game anymore :("
15597,I personally love this game. Played through it so many times solo and with friends. Can't recommend it enough if you like looter shooters.
15598,"BL2 is one of those special games that is just so good that it's essential to play. The story (which I won't spoil)  is well written and paced and you may fall in love with all the characters, don't worry if you skipped the first game, you get brought up to speed pretty quick and I recommend it as a starting point for the series. Gameplay is fast and intense and there is a lot of weapon variety, and building character classes can become an addiction. There is literally 100+ hours of content across the base game and DLCs. (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is one of the best expansions to any game ever.) Do yourself a favor and play this with friends the way God intended.  ( I have played the game 1000+ hours on PS3/PS4, so this is definitely a fanboy recommendation. Go play it. Seriously.)"
15599,very pog
15600,"very fun and entertaining game
"
15601,"Bro, it's Borderlands 2, arguably one of the best shooters ever. Just play it."

15625,favorite game
15626,"Hands down the best Shooter RPG ever made, in every category.

Pros:
- Amazing Story line. You laugh, you ache, and you just fall in love with the franchise. Even the villains are lovable, believe me.  
- Brilliant characters. I mean it can't get any better, really! Moxxi, Tina Tina Ellie and Scooter. and of course Handsome Jack as one of the best villains of all time - cynical to death, and funny af. The voice actors are truly gifted and made the grinding very fun and bareable.  
- Gameplay. Whether it is solo, or team play. it is absolutely superb. very smooth, great fluent shade graphics, diverse open world like scenery that contain dozens of secret places and loot boxes which I could grind endlessly. The bosses and raid bosses are very cool, and original, some even present quite a challenge - even for a team.
- Grineability - As in any looter shooter. If you can't grind the game to oblivion, then it going to fail. The game uses smart pool tables per boss which makes grinding very fun. they also present new weapon tiers with the new DLCs which makes the looting fresher and keep you excited for new loot drops all the time.
- DLCs.  ahh the good old times when DLCs cost so little and brought so much to the table. I think that the first  4 DLCs of this game are equal to none. So innovative and hysterically funny (the ones afterwards were just a hole filling until the Pre-Sequel  was out, so they were meaningless, and equally cheap - like 3$ ea).
- Co-op. Multiplayer was awesome when the servers allowed it. That being said, the game always had the private LAN ability that with an easy Evolve client made your PC into a fast and reliable hosting server. Raid content was always there, some easy and some was hard. I can tell you that with my 1300hrs, my team and I never completed all the raid bosses at OP10 which was very hard and challenging from time perspective since we had to grind for OP10 weapons and armor all over again.
- Classes. What can I say. I think that they are all A+++. the base 4 are awesome, Krieg and Gaige are awesome. I love the skill trees and the supers, and everything felt very carefully tailored.
- Loot. I thin that the Legendary items in this game, really feel legendary. its not special, but its important. But the loot in general, and the fact that you have a lot of non-legendary options for end game builds, make it very very fun. The game's fun and humor also impacts the weapons that comes with clever and funny remarks from time to time.

Cons:
- You can't buy all the missing ammo in one click (yes, I'm that pathetic because this game is nearly perfect)
- OP tier was a very forced tier to make people keep enjoying the game they loved. you can perfectly enjoy the game a lot without even getting into OP.

Bottom line, if you haven't played it, then it is a must.
If you haven't played the first DLCs, I would highly recommend playing the first season pass DLCs as they're just an awesome extension to the base game."
15627,More guns than enemies 0w0
15628,"Love the artwork for this game. Good for co-op, too."
15629,najbol sam k crni nino noče več igrt z mano eee cigane ://
15630,"Really fun and goofy game, but whatever you do, play with friends ... it's fun to play alone but the amount of bullshit you can do with 2-3 friends is HUGE"
15631,Probably one of the most plain fun games I have ever played in my life. Ever since 2016 from the first time i played this game I've been enjoying it and with easily over 2000 hours combined on Xbox and PC I haven't regretted a second of it. (PS if you don't like grindy games this is definitely not for you)
15632,E
15633,nice
15634,"One of the hands down best games I personally have ever played, hundreds of hours of game play, almost every second of it is enjoyment, killing a big boss and getting a legendary is pure bliss, would recommend every time. All different character or builds is enjoyable, In my opinion also the best out of the series."
15635,gg
15636,its cool i guess but jake wont play it because he is a loser
15637,It's aight
15638,Fun game
15639,"best borderlands, even better than 3 and best DLCs"
15640,played this for years and now that i have it on pc there is 5 more years of content
15641,For some reason this game is still my favorite Borderlands games. Im pretty sure I've finished it 7 times already across all account and godammit it will always be my favorite
15642,"the best game ever for me, i think its better than borderland 3"
15643,fun
15644,Classic. Borderlands 3 doesn't compare to this god tier game.
15645,"It's the quintessential looter shooter! The gunplay is 100% sexy. Nothing gives you a rush like snorting a line of guns after killing a big boss. The comedy is still pretty good. It's a really fun co-op game as long as you agree to use different weapon types, otherwise you'll fight over the cool pistol the last boss dropped. It definitely feels like an upgrade from Borderlands 1. Well, there's a little charm it lost from the first game, yet the scale and the general gameplay is much improved. 9/10."
15646,"A lot to loot, a lot to shoot.
Big maps to explore and lots of funny comments/ moments.
Can be a bit hard if playing solo, but still doable and worth it for the fun alone.
Only downside is, that there is no way to mute Gaige’s screaming.
There is an option in the menu but it does not work for her."
15647,"I have this game on too many consoles to count..the gameplay isn't different on different consoles, I'm just obsessed with this game. Still worth playing again and again and again and again and again..."
15648,Nice.
15649,"Good
"
15650,Great
15651,nice game if you have real life friends to play with
15652,goed spel lekker iedereen neer schieten :D
15653,"Still one of the best games out there even after years.
Definitely the best one in the Borderlands series.
I think I've played it enough to recommend to anyone."
15654,"I mean, it is better then bl3, but not bl1.  dont even bring up the pre-sequel, that game actually got me dumped  by a fine honey.  bl2 is not balanced well....  the main thing i dislike with bl2, it gets a little to easy after youv'e done some high quality research on youtube and get about 20 hours in.    What i like about bl2,  really good main story.  like, you really wanna beat the main antagonist. I recommend starting with the hot blue chick, then as you get comfy with the game, you can try a harder character like the guy with messed up hands, *Zero.  if you are into grinding without getting any positive outcome in the, *real world, i recommend starting a character and trying a 100% run.  it will require a friend....  do to having to accomplish duel challenges.  So all the people out there with no friends, do no try this.  in the 30-70 hour range, was when i was really addicted to this game, im talking butt rash, clammy hands, lacking a proper shower for days.  you know the normal, *no life, stuff."
15655,absolutely love it....Superb Co-op
15656,"gug game

15657,absolutely love it <3 wish i found it on release

15659,Enjoying with friends!
15660,guns
15661,idk where to begin the story is top notch and with 6 different playable characters you'd be spending tens of hours playing this jewel of a game.cool DLCs lots of bad guys to shoot at lots of beautiful side quests that reveal even more of the story and so much more. make sure u get the handsome collection cuz its cheat and u great this game + borderlands the pre sequel
15662,great fun time
15663,a
15664,"You can shoot midgets!
"
15665,awesome game
15666,"Fun alone, more fun with friends. Fun when you don't know what you're doing, more fun when you do. Most people don't max out characters but I'd recommend them to try. If you're having trouble sticking to the game because it's too grindy I'd recommend checking out youtubers because just about everything has been done."

15674,"I despise claptrap

Good game though!"
15675,"Best Borderlands entry to date, do yourself a favor and play this game."
15676,Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
15677,"Quick:

5/5.  Borderlands 2 was my introduction to the Borderlands series.  To this day it is one of my favorite games.  There is more character in one DLC of Borderlands 2 than there is in most games.  I would describe this game as a whimsical romp through an apocalyptic wasteland, surrounded by friends.  The tone of this game is very lighthearted most of the time, yet is gory and violent.  The developers must have had a great time making this game.  It feels like a lot of love and care went into creating it.  

More:

The first thing that people notice is the cel-shaded art style.  It was the perfect choice for the type of game that it is.  Most of the character and world models are somewhat low-poly, but the cel-shading and the color palette make everything appear as if it were ripped from the pages of a comic book.  All of the characters have very interesting designs, and the world... as strange as it is... feels like place that has a real history, and that could exist in a strange parallel universe.

I love the audio in this game.  I don't really remember any songs that stand out, except for the background music in the main zone of the DLC 'Badass Crater of Badassitude'.  It's a slow western style song that I couldn't get out of my head for days.  Seriously, go YouTube it, now, and get lost in the melody.  Most impressive of all the audio are the NPC character voice lines.  They are some of the most hilarious that I have ever heard.  Enemies will say some funny, nonsensical, and straight up crazy things when you're fighting them, or when they are preparing to engage you.

The game-play is solid.  Usually, I'm not a fan of shooters that use an RPG-style damage model.  Normally, I sigh and roll my eyes when I see numbers pop up over enemies heads while shooting them with a gun.  In Borderlands 2, I don't mind at all.  That is a good thing, because you will be doing A LOT of shooting.  Combat is one of the best part of this game.  It is fast paced, fun, and forgiving.  Outside of the combat, you will be looting, doing fetch-quests, and grinding a lot.  

By far the best thing about Borderlands 2 are the characters.  There's someone for everyone in this game.  From the serious and fearless leader Roland, to the cynical and intellectual Hammerlock there is a personality you will love to interact with somewhere on Pandora.  I'm still amazed at how many memorable characters this game has.  There are times when you will be literally laughing out loud, and even a few moments where you may shed a tear.  I was much more attached to the characters of Borderlands 2 than I expected.

If you have not played through this game... then I suggest that you do.  Immediately buy it, and all the DLC, and just commit to a month of doing nothing but playing this from start to finish.  You will not regret it.  This game is one of the most fun experiences of its' generation.  Perhaps, maybe even a masterpiece.

15678,gUN gO BurRRrRrrr
15679,"Oh look it's that game that did the things what people liked.

Borderlands 2 is very much an experience still worth your time in the modern age, even if you've gone on to play Borderlands 3 or Pre-Sequel. The writing is very much stuck in it's era, and the voice acting matches that, but every Borderlands game other than the first one suffers from this blemish. Multiple classes offering unique ways to kill walking loot containers, and a focus on a Diablo-esc loot system with rarities and randomized stats."
15680,love this game. a classic.
15681,(-__-)
15682,noice
15683,...
15684,"the whole game is extremely fun the characters are super funny and enjoyable the DLC adds  a lot to continue playing the game and enjoy, its even better when you have a friend/s to play with lots of laughter to be had and stuff to do"
15685,Really love the story so far and the gameplay mechanics are unique and vast. I could experiment with a lot of builds and ideas for fun ones. The only thing i could think bad was that I didn't find out about this game sooner.
15686,"Hell yes. If you havent played the series....you need to. If you havent played this one.......get it now!!
=D Well rounded and Immersive game with great visuals and literally endless fun, the story is pretty cool too!
Bring friends for more of a challenge and even more crazy loot! =D"
15687,"Solid game with amazing coop but recently and out of nowhere, this game suddenly started freezing at random short intervals. Never had a problem with it before but now its just plain unplayable."
15688,"idk bout you all but i loved this game ever since i ""free trialed"" it almost 10 years ago when it was new.
Shooting is fun but the Jack dude is annoying. Sure it was satisfying to be finally off him personally with the build you optimize throughout the game but you can't mute him even on repeat plays. Yes you can skip cutscenes but not in game dialogues."
15689,"Gearbox needs to stop pushing transgender mental illness. 

Don't normalize mental illness."
15690,Yes.
15691,YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15692,"Cool adventure shooter game! There is meat, plot, open world, skill, and everything that is possible. There are several characters to choose from with different abilities, ults and perks. I played as Assassin Zero and completed the entire game with this character at level 30. Interesting story adventures. There are a lot of enemies, the more people play in the team, the more enemies, the more achievements and the faster leveling. There are many tasks that you can go through the storyline or for your own pleasure, pumping the level and perks on them. You can play alone, online, with friends. A huge variety of weapons with different enhancements, elemental damage and various rarities, here you can fight from fists to RPGs and cars with various explosives or whatever weapons you choose to kill. There are also grenades, shields, artifacts, modifications, skins. The graphics are beautiful, but almost everything is outlined in black on the outside, which makes this graphics unique from other games. Various beautiful locations that you want to take a picture and save. There is everything, volcanoes, lava, water, tundra, green meadows, deserts, caves, cities, bases, vaults, monster dens, sky, earth, underground, wherever possible. I recommend purchasing the DLC and playing the best Borderlands game I've played. You can relax in it, it will drag on for a few tens of hours at least."
15693,veri nice
15694,"Great story, voice acting, and gamepaly. A classic at this point, but still re-playable and fun to play with friends. You could tell the developers put a love into it."

15700,"leveling characters to grind for legendaries saved me after losing my best friend of 10 years. i love seeing that orange hue, keeps ya coming back to this lil alien world. the jokes are funny and i love doing grenade jumps to view the sunset at different angles and other stupid sht like crashing my car into pandoras people politely. its just beautiful. tvhm/ uvhm plus the different classes and thousands of weapons make it never get old. i meme the story at this point and sure i dont play daily but sometimes i do just play everyday cause i have a mac and only so many steam games work in the new os lmfao"
15701,Imo the best borderlands game out of the entire series. I've played each of the games on several consoles as well as Borderlands 3 on pc. Lemme say that nothing beats Borderlands 2 in my eyes.
15702,still one of the most fun games i've ever played 10 years later

15713,Good fun
15714,"I was captivated by it and I admit that it is a good game. It may not be my cup of tea, but I couldn't really enjoy it. In any case, it has great potential and is a lot of fun if you're looking for action and madness."
15715,ass
15716,very good game
15717,love the whole series
15718,e
15719,"This game is so much fun. I bought it when the Handsome Collection was on sale (about 10 CAD I think?). However, this is not to say buying it at a higher price would be less worth it. I am happy with the deal I got for it but my enjoyment of the game does not rest on that alone. I have been playing the other instalments to this franchise and I cannot see myself getting tired of it anytime soon. Highly recommend."
15720,good
15721,"St. Peter will call you schmuck if you haven't liberate Butt Stalion in this life. True story ! That's why people still playing this game 9 years after release, not because this is one of the best co-op shooters ever made."
15722,"Great game, top tier looter shooter.  Apparently shit publisher.  Kept getting the video memory error no matter what I changed/patched.  It's infrequent and seems random, but annoying as hell.  None of the community solutions have stuck.  I'm giving up.

Beware, you roll the dice buying this."
15723,"this game ruined my life. i bought it in february, as a joke. it’s not a joke anymore. i have spent over one thousand hours on this game. one thousand hours of my life watching an overgrown stalker cause problems for jobber player characters who have done nothing wrong. one thousand hours of my life trying to bloodsplode dragons. i had no idea what was going on the entire time. but somehow, for some reason, i played the whole game and i can’t stop thinking about it. if you want to play this godforsaken game for some reason, please for the love of god do NOT look anything up. overall experience with Borderlands 2 was 12/10 would recommend <3 Voracidous the Invincible <3"
15724,"For all of us borderlands fans, the game still rocks :D"
15725,cum worthy

15757,"Good Game, fun combat, satisfying progression system, addictive gameplay loop, fun NPC characters and the humor for the most part sticks the landing.

Thanks to the stylised comic book-esque visuals the game has aged very well graphically. Also the Co-op is a very welcome feature and I recommend anyone who play this game do at least one playthrough co-op with a friend."
15758,good game
15759,It's great

15766,shit's bussin
15767,"is Destiny 2 not scratching your itch for an epic loot shooter? Are you dead tired of microtransaction/pay to win bullshit that sucks your wallet dry? Then look no further! Guns, guns, and more guns galore! This game is the very definition of a loot shooter! With one of the most epic video game villains to boot. So, what are you waiting for?! TAKE YOUR MONEY AND PURCHASE THIS MASTER PIECE! SEE YOU IN THE BORDERLANDS MY FRIEND!"

15775,very good yes
15776,I don't even want to know how many hours I have on the 360 on this game alone
15777,"Best Borderlands game in the series.  Vast improvements over the original in every area, graphics, difficulty, weapon variety, storyline, environments, etc. etc.  Plus a lot of really good DLC that adds hours of additional playtime.   Also bonus characters a bazillion guns.  Seriously what other advice are you looking for?  My playtime is evidence of an awesome experience. 
"
15778,played this game for years on multiple platforms and still absolutely love it!
15779,"Tl;dr Game is good. Recommend only getting it if you're new to the series (and/or can play with others who are also new to the series). 

It's tough to write this review as I really enjoyed the game when I played it on Xbox a million years ago. I had tried to play again on Steam with friends not-too-long-ago and I didn't have as much fun - everything just felt too familiar and the prospect of going through the entire story *plus* alllll of the various side missions made me think that the time-sink wasn't worth it. If you've played the game before on another system, you can probably skip the Steam version in favor of something with more 'modern' gameplay mechanics and graphics. QUIT LIVING IN THE PAST YOU JABRONI! 

That being said, if you've never played a Borderlands title before or if you're making your way through them for the first time (and preferably playing with other folks who are new to the game), then I'd say that Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game and a great value (when purchased on sale). 

The stylized graphics still look good despite the older age of the game and the voice-acting is funny and well-acted. The Player characters are all unique and fun to play - each having their own skill-trees and specialties which make experimenting with all of them a joy. The story is a bit 'bonkers' and some context is lost if you haven't played Borderlands 1 but I felt that everything pieced together in a satisfying way by the time I reached the end of the game."
15780,EXPLOSIONS! *mouth guitar noises*
15781,great art style and humor
15782,one of the greatest games of all time. end of.

15805,The solid loot shooter gameplay just isn't worth the auditory torture chamber that this game is. I'd rather someone defecate straight into my ear canal than listen to another of claptraps jokes.

15811,Very fun game.
15812,Good game!
15813,Dont know what the issue is with this game in 2021 but it keeps crashing all the time

15816,Tiny Tina and Claptrap carry this game.
15817,imma just say it claptrap is annoying
15818,yes
15819,"Story is fun and engaging, the characters were cool. Except the side story quests, most of them are redundant just going back and forth and spending most of its content running around instead of actual content. Pretty bad level design. 

Occasionally, there are terrain bugs where the vehicles couldn't ran over a single piece of door(mostly in front of Hodunks House) and it's hella annoying.

Overall enjoyable game, I played it solo so it's kinda boring sometimes. I just gave up with all the side quests and just finish the story.

Also the jokes are redundant. Except Jack, he's cool."
15820,"Absolutely fantastic game, played for many years and still love it!"

15825,"Multiplayer is brocken, every time I play online with friends it crashes every 5 minutes or so, searched for the reason found nothing that helped under the claims that fixes this majorly known and wide spread issue ... and apparently it might have even something to do with Borderlands 3 purposly bricking B1 and B2

https://gamerant.com/borderlands-2-crashes-borderlands-3-ad-bug/

and no nothing fixed it, not driver updateing, repairing the game via steam, running in Admin/compatible mode of W7, WV, W XP tried all serverpacks, not turning the graphics down, boost my internet [giving your signal priorety] so if you have found a fix please comment, thanks in advance.
So yeah brocken beyond purpose since BL is focused on playing with friends wich it can not provide, even tho I can play solo just fine."

15830,"suffered through crash after crash after crash while playing multiplayer, even though my pc is grossly overpowered to run a NINE YEAR OLD GAME. Got to the last boss, and can't progress through it due to the game freezing, crashing my computer, and generally unplayable. Searching online came up with many people having the same issues after they issued an update in regards to borderlands 3 that applied to Borderlands, The Pre Sequel, And borderlands 2. tried about 15 different fixes from updating Phys-X, Capping FPS, and nothing helps. Gearbox effectively broke their game and there's no fix to improve it. 

The only fix to actually play the game?

Play single player."

15836,"A timeless classic that still holds up to this day. 

Being a looter shooter, it has a very big dynamic every new game, or even when playing in TVHM or UVHM where each enemy even at ""end game"" is still a challenging encounter

I've done multiple playthroughs, and each one is still fun with how skill trees work, paired with the randomness of loot."

15838,ok

15843,Superb Co-op
15844,"I love this game so much. The humor, unique art style, characters (both playable and non-playable), gameplay, and story are all fantastic. It's a great shooter and looter game with lots of DLC to make it even better. I had this game on my Xbox 360 a long time ago and recently me and my friends got it on pc and have been playing together. I'd give this game a 10/10. An old gem that stands up to the newer games. If you are looking at this game for the first time I would HIGHLY recommend this game. This game is a work of art. :)"
15845,nice game best of borderlands so far

15850,fun
15851,WHAT'S IN THE BOX?!
15852,"Compelling story, challenging replayability, uniquely eccentric aesthetic, and an all-out entertaining badass charm. Borderlands 2 is utterly iconic, and is a must-play game before you die and respawn. 

While the learning curves tend to be a bit steep for the average FPS/RPG gamer, it's enjoyable to the core to scale this mountain of a game all the way to the peak. This was my first Steam purchase, and I do not regret buying the GotY at full price. This game is worth every damn cent. 

Every player is as good as the tools he farms, and the time he puts into learning a skill tree. Pure unadulterated gaming, with reasonable balancing in progression and levelling, for the most part. A lot of people apparently prefer not to kill themselves attempting turning on Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, but that's exactly the challenge, innit? 

Also, holy SKAGSACK with the voice acting? Well bloody done, I must add.

500 hours in, and now I feel obligated to post my review."

15863,This is the only game where you have to focus on the main missions over the side missions because your items can become underwhelming after a bit of leveling up. xD

15871,il est trest adictif
15872,"I was looking through my reviews and discovered that I never reviewed BL2 which shocked me, it is a magnificent and fun game, not as good as BL3 but it is certainly a gem with a great story and rich characters, I did however get saddened by the plot at times due to the fates and lives of some of the characters, but hey that can be considered a good thing, it engages you. The weapon manufacturers can be irritating at times, for example you might love the skin on a weapon and it's stats but hate the manufacturer effect. (Hyperion weapons are pretty but their pathetic initial accuracy angers me and makes me dizzy waving across the screen)

I would suggest playing this before BL3 due to the storylines being connected and the fact that you will miss BL3 mechanics if you play this after."

15877,"I've read where some say after level 14, some say the game is too hard.  I say grow a pair.  I am not having any difficulties at level 25. You just have to be able to out-think your opponent.
The game has it's quirks, like getting you stuck and keys not functioning all the time, but generally, it's a lot of fun and a great time killer."
15878,Very good loot and shoot game
15879,Looter kantooter game!
15880,"Borderlands 2 is the quintessential Looter Shooter, the creme de la creme of Shooter RPGs, and the absolute crown jewel of Gearbox's developed products. 

This game has hours upon hours of quality content, with the base game and even a second playthrough being well balanced and heavily enjoyable. For those wanting a bigger challenge, subsequent playthroughs on Ultimate Vault Hunter mode will give it to you. Not only is the main story and abundance of sidequests a consistent bash, but even replaying these is fun due to Borderlands' iconic loot system and the presence of several choices to make. 

The base game never feels tedious, with enemy and gear variety spurring a great deal of different combat situations, even in the same area of a level. Even in the same ""species"" of enemies, you'll get different tiers and element types with different powers.

The story is leaps and bounds ahead of any of the other games in the series, and while the writing of optional content and flavor text often feels a bit cheesy and dated, that adds to the charm. Meme humor in the main story, however, is more or less entirely absent, so if that isn't your thing you never have to see it. The flow of said main story is phenomenal, and you will love and love to hate some of the cast of characters and enemies.

Visuals are also iconic of the series, and this game offers up a great deal of varied environments to blow things into meaty chunks in. Icy tundras, deserts, a metropolis, volcanoes, caves, every single location stands out from the others.

Overall this game is as legendary as its guns, and I cannot recommend it enough to any fan of shooters, RPGs, and everything in between."
15881,Crazy hamburger.
15882,we need and animation between the gaps
15883,"literally my all time favorite game! i have played countless hours on BL2 and will continue until the day that i die! i love the RPG aspect of it! at first i was like why would i want RPG aspects in my FPS, then i played it and instantly fell in love! the original and BL3 are great too, but 2 is one that i cannot put down! i have purchased the game 6 times! And worth every penny!"
15884,"Fun game! It has a large world to explore. I've run into some bugs which can be annoying but what can you do? 
I'd recommend this game and coop is great too."
15885,"Its the best looter shooter ever made. Its the golden standard,"
15886,This game is pretty neat
15887,"Huge fan of the Borderlands series. The graphics are so cool, characters are funny, storylines are funny and very interesting. Would definitely recommend!"
15888,"good, funny, better with friends, characters are good, and the graphic are great 10/10 would recommend but you should probably wait for it to go on sale"
15889,one of my favorite games of all time. really like the series
15890,"fun
"
15891,"This is the classic looter-shooter that got me in touch with my love for PC gaming. I don't know what really drew me to this game initially, but 165 hours and 4 playthroughs later, this game continues to be more entertaining than Anthem or Destiny, even after all this time. I feel that the drop rates are consistent with what you want in a good looter-shooter, the enemies are fun and engaging to fight by yourself or with a group of friends, and the action and gameplay are well-paced, allowing you plenty of breathing room to prepare for boss fights and challenging waves. I'm still playing now, and that's the sign of a game made right."
15892,"Fun, violent, looks awesome and is truly timeless"
15893,from what i heard its better then bl3
15894,"is game
"
15895,One of best games on steam

15899,very good game 10/10

15902,good if you like chasing the carrot
15903,Very nice
15904,A different but amazing take on an rpg series defiently worth buying the set
15905,"It's helarious, diversified and fun to play. It doesn't make a lot of new things, but it sure is a very solid loot shooter with an amazing story."
15906,"Epic game for epic gamers. But, co-op play can b laggy but it's an overall blast to play with friends."
15907,Better than BL3.
15908,I discovered this game a bit late but I absolutely love it
15909,Damn fine game!
15910,great game one of the best villains of all time
15911,no dlc sharing
15912,good gaem
15913,I love it. But like maybe you don’t
15914,"my friend will said it was good, its a mix of fortnite and borderlands 1"
15915,my frien d will said maybne and im like it so .... :)
15916,"It's got Dark Souls references in the final DLC.
10/10"
15917,"idk,seems to boring. but what do you expect from a looter shooter? it will get repetitive"
15918,"It's like Borderlands 1, but even better."
15919,Best shoot and loot there ever was
15920,Fantastic game series with tons of game play. 10/10 Would recommend anyone getting into shooters or looking for a new game to indulge yourself into to try out. DLC makes the game %100 better by the way :)
15921,"terra is not so invincible
some areas like the dust and oasis dlc has too much empty space where you need to walk, and in oasis its sometimes more cruel with the small amount of car stations around areas like wurmwater
tho its still nice, i would do a genuine review but those are my only major criticisms for now"
15922,"IS GOOD FUN
"
15923," The game is fun to play. Challenging. But I don't like the fowl language. It dose nothing for the game play at all. If you the creators had given an option out, The game would be totally awesome. I will let others know about the language if and when I recommend it."
15924,good
15925,"Borderlands 2: Wow, what a game. It takes me back to 8th grade, when I  was jamming and jiving to my favorite songs on Spotify's world famous ""Rap Caviar"" playlist. At this time, Nav had the biggest impact on me. As a brown man, I respected Nav for his incredible flowing flavor over the sick as hell beats. Around the same time, my parents got divorced. I lived primarily with my mom, who quickly found a new man to pleasure her. His name was the same as mine, and it felt weird but oddly good to hear her moan my name over and over again - I could hear them making love all the way from downstairs. I got a little off track, let's get back to the game. I remember sharing Shift Key codes with my old friend Ethan, even spending the night at his house just to finish the game on his console. I remember when I woke up really really early, I slipped out of his grasp and made breakfast for him. I brought it into the room and put it on the table, waking him up with kisses on the lips. I took my pants off, leaving him to be astounded by my perfectly defined 9 and a half inch boner. hahah but that's a story for another day, let's get back to the game. It was truly an experience, obsessively collecting all the legendary weapons in a frantic race to be first to do so in my friend group. I remember buying those DLCs for the first time, around the same time that I was very much into Black Ops 2. The two games are similar, as they both have 2 in their name and start with a B. My parents were still divorced at this point, but my dad had suffered a severe accident and died by the time the ""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep"" DLC came out, I was in full mourning mode. The only thing keeping me from pure and sad suicide was Nav, my all-time favorite rapper, and Borderlands 2, my all-time favorite game. In total, I've likely clocked in about 2250 hours on the game across consoles, and I still haven't done everything yet! In my lowest states, I would start new characters and try to run through the campaign as fast as I could. Since then, I downloaded the game on my computer, my mother began suffering early onset dementia, and I'm still using Borderlands to get over the saddest parts of my life. I love this game, it's probably my favorite game in my library of over 160 PC video games.

10/10"
15926,You shoot things. It's fun.
15927,"It's Borderlands 2, if you don't already know it's awesome, you're nuts."
15928,its nice
15929,"Really, really, enjoyed, stopped playing so I can pick up the VR version instead!"
15930,
15931,Terrible game. The gunplay is atrocious the humor was bad and childish when it came out and has aged like Milk since then the only character with good writing is the main villain. Weapons all feel the same outside of the few unique weapons with most of those feeling like crap to shoot as well. The walking speed is slow the game is repetitive Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is atrocious. The whole game is just poorly designed and bad no idea why people hold this up as some great classic game its a failure on every level of game design that is only barely playable with friends and even then there are far better alternatives in this day and age if you want a fun coop game stay away from this crap.
15932,KABOOM!
15933,Game of the year baby
15934,"Waiting until The Fight for sanctuary goes on sale to play again. 

No way I am paying as much as the game for a DLC. I thought it would be given to anyone who already had the game. Apparently, I needed to sign in and redeem it somewhere. Too late. Lame."
15935,Good Game
15936,Choppa go braap
15937,if you don't like border lands then start with this game if you don't like it at all then just don't play and if you like borderlands then this in my a pinyon  is the best game of the series.
15938,awesome
15939,"In a world of games-as-a-service, battlepasses, seasons, endless dailies and central server requirements, there is a lot of merit to a full game. A game that you can pick up at any time, use OP builds, edit saves, and apply mods. A game that doesn't need 2 years of patches to be decent. Hell, for BL3 they made a DLC with incomplete story boards and claimed those were deleted cutscenes from the original story, but it looks like they were made by different people.
 This game is getting close to its 10 year anniversary, and a lot of other looter shooters have hit the market since then. A few of them even have better moment-to-moment gameplay. But no game can rival Borderlands 2 in style, characters, variety between classes and customer friendliness.

R.I.P. Battleborn, a now unplayable single player game, victim of the Great Server Shutdown."
15940,"Good gameplay & visual, worth to buy in 2021.
+ fun play with friends"
15941,Handsome jack is one of the best villians ever made
15942,"This is a great game to play with friends. It is similar to Destiny 2, for anyone who has played that. My computer is horrible but it runs this game just fine."
15943,pog
15944,"i've played this game since it's release on console. if you haven't played this game, you had better play it or i'll beat your ass. 15/10, fuck borderlands 3"

15964,Absolutely ridiculous.  Have come back to it multiple times and always enjoy playing with friends.
15965,"dope game
"
15966,"A great sequel to Borderlands 1. This game has tons of loot, levels, and dlcs. My favorite of the Borderlands series! I've been playing this game for years, and still am excited to continue or start a new adventure."
15967,dfdvscsdczxcsc
15968,nice.
15969,good game
15970,One of THE BEST Games evah period!!!!
15971,"its like an mmo in terms of its grindiness but in fact it is indeed the most divine looter shooter in the world as it continues to keep you playing long after you finish the actual main story, although it can be rage inducing"
15972,best game ever fucking created
15973,good game
15974,good game
15975,"One of the best games of all time. Get the Unofficial Community Patch tho, so good."
15976,is ok
15977,Fun but i enjoy it more on console
15978,"Still the best entry in the series to this day, goofy story and comic relief on every level. Heck, we are there for the guns."
15979,"I mean... its fine
100/10. Best game?"
15980,You get guns. You shoot people with them. It makes looter shooters great again.
15981,"A brightly colored, obnoxious shooting gallery. I have no idea why this game is recommended to Fallout fans as they have very few similarities."
15982,hehe loot chest go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
15983,"Great humour, and fun stress reliever"
15984,I suck
15985,Borderlands at its best
15986,just super good
15987,its alright
15988,"Fun mechanics, fun dialogue, fun villains, fun characters, fun guns, endlessly entertaining game play, and damn good voice acting work totally worth the money plus its DLC is killer. I always find myself chuckling at the humor however brass and dark it is, when people meant it was a great game, they meant it! I never played a single game of this series but this one game has me wanting to play the others in its series even with all the bad mouthing some have got just because I want to see what my favorite characters are up to and more great game play with its dark yet hilariously violent humor.

Some of my favorite aspects include: being able to shoot fire bullets, being able to shoot EXPLODING SWORDS, being able to actually like the villain, being able to kill a Badassasaurus (yes that's a thing), and being able to collect all the funny guns.

If none of these find your interest then I will have to kindly stop talking to you, thanks for reading!"

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Borderlands 2 is a 2012 first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. Taking place five years following the events of Borderlands, the game is once again set on the planet of Pandora. The story follows a new group of Vault Hunters who must ally with the Crimson Raiders, a resistance group made up of civilian survivors and guerrilla fighters, to defeat the tyrannical Handsome Jack before he can unlock the power of a new Vault.

[b] Story - [/b] Borderlands 2 has one of the best stories ever in my opinion. I have a little over 1,000+ hours on Xbox One and I never got bored of the story. The main villain is named Handsome Jack and he is one of the most interesting and best written characters I have ever come across. You go through many cool areas in the world of Pandora. Many amazing side characters and returning characters from the previous game. The DLC’s are my favorite in the Borderlands franchise. With all of them being very unique and fun to play through. You have so many side quests in this game and they are really fun to play through as well.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] You play as 4 Vault Hunters (6 with DLC), with each one being Unique from each other. The gunplay is really fun in this game, and a huge step up from the original Borderlands game. The guns are really unique and function differently based on their weapon manufacturer. You have some of the coolest and most satisfying enemies to fight in this game as well. The psychos in this game are pretty funny too. Some of the humor has aged, but you still get a really good laugh at times, especially from the enemies. You can unlock cosmetic skins for your character, ranging from doing side quests, completing challenges, easter eggs, and also from bosses. The boss fights are really cool in this game, but some of the boss fights can be really challenging as well.

[b] Graphics - [/b] This game has aged really well for a 2012 game, and lets thank the art style for that. This game has a unique art style that looks great and has amazing lighting in it. You also have a Physix graphics setting that gives almost everything in the game awesome physics and interatable. It can eat your Frames though so do be warned. The Environments all look unique and really beautiful.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Beautiful art style
	[*] Amazing graphics for a 2012 game
	[*] Iconic enemies
	[*] Legendary Villain
	[*] Great writing
	[*] Unlimited amount of weapons
	[*] Tons of enemy variety
	[*] Lots of playstyles
	[*] One of the best stories
	[*] Lots of side quest
	[*] Great DLC’s
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Lot’s of DLC’s to get (Buy Handsome Collection)
	[*] Fight for Sanctuary is rarely on sale and is not good
	[*] Axton feel underpowered later in the game
	[*] Headhunter DLC’s are short (but fun)
[/list]
[b]  If you are wanting every DLC in the game, please get the Handsome Collection, and not the Game of the Year Edition, as you wont get all the cosmetics and headhunter DLC’s with the Game of the Year Edition. You do not get the Fight for Sanctuary DLC though. [/b]

15995,game gud
15996,fun
15997,yes
15998,"tourge, yes tourge"
15999,"BL2 is the big boy out of the Borderlands franchise, while it has slow and admittedly filler parts, it's still a very fun game, since the gameplay itself is fun. The big advantage this game has over BL3 is the story, and yeah sure it follows the regular villain-hero trope, it does it well. The villain-hero trope isn't bad here either, as the games first Sequel (Pre) expands on Handsome Jack's tale on how he was a tragedy.
This game holds a special place with me since it was basically my childhood, I remember the giddiness I felt going over to my cousin's and playing this with him and my uncle and everyone had fun, even though some of the jokes flew over my head. It's very nostalgic for me. 
Pros
-Good story
-Shit ton of guns
-Fleshed out characters with unique play styles even if some fall short of others
-Plenty of DLC that's cheap now that the game's just shy of 10 years old (I feel old)
-Just fun combat
-Only has 1 season pass (even though it's more expensive than the base game)
-Great with friends
Cons
-Horribly aged jokes (420blazeitlol appears in this game and should never have)
-May feel sluggish at times
-Lack of a balance within the characters, Commando will always get his ass handed to him comparing his turret to other skills
-Grindy at the later stages (RNG go brrr)
-Hella DLC that you really wouldn't want to buy piece by piece since it's just not worth it for cosmetics"

16051,"Game is too buggy to play on my system. WASD keys randomly pause and stop working until I press again. This is the only game that has this problem. Unfortunate, because I would otherwise play more."
16052,Couldn't get enough of it. I bought every DLC for it and probably spent way too much money. I think I was addicted at one point! lol

16055,A cartoon about weapons and creatures; tying them all together into a neat story about my shoe size always being out of stock
16056,"Overall a pretty fun game, but kind of overstays its welcome towards the end, as it gets a little repetitive.  Having said that, the combat is fun and there are loads of weapons to choose from.  I do also like that when you die you the enemies you previously killed do not respawn again.  Otherwise, it would be a bit frustrating.  Picked this game up on sale for super cheap, so well worth the 40+ hours I put into it."
16057,shoot bad guy
16058,"10/10 - A perfect game, and sequel.

I've enjoyed Borderlands 2 on just about every console/platform it's been available on since the original release. Having fully played it through multiple times with all its characters, both solo and co-op, I can easily say it's one of my favourite games and always manages to make me chuckle regardless of how many times I've experienced its jokes.

The base game features a brilliantly crafted narrative with characters you care about, insanely fun combat and, of course, tons of loot. The DLCs further add to this, making the whole package (easily available via The Handsome Collection) a serious value for money deal packed full with literal hours-upon-hours of content."
16059,"Amazing story and overall a great game.
"
16060,It's Borderlands 2. Get it.

[h1] CONS [/h1]
-Doesn't get updated anymore/no more DLC being made

[h1] CONClUSION [/h1]
The conclusion would be way too long I'm sorry but all the information there is more than enough for you to buy the game especially with DLC."
16080,"there's many things that i hated about this game, from stupid bugs & technical issues to getting lost in almost all maps because of the confusing map, yet i joined every single mission in this game even the side missions feel like a main mission bcuz of how well they were made."

16088,"I do not want to play this game because it doesn't have working autosaves most of the time and you can't manually save.
You will have to go a long way to reach your objective and even after that it's difficult to return to Sanctuary because of how complex some zones are. The time it takes you to do all of these  tasks is way too much. I tried my best to enjoy playing BL2 but the gunfights weren't enough to make me feel like the experience was worth it."

16131,"One of my all time favorite games. Hilarious writing, a good story, and fun gameplay. If they implemented the co-op scaling changes from Borderlands 3 then this would be a perfect game"
16132,Take a shot whenever you run out of ammo.
16133,It's good
16134,yes
16135,nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
16136,this game is so fun i really recomend it to enyone
16137,"In contrast to the original Borderlands on steam this one is much easier to play in 2021 since it can still manage lobbies well unlike the hot mess that is the original game's current system for PC.

Definitely get it on sale with all the DLC, that's the best way to play this game and in some cases even the cheapest depending on what sales steam has going on."
16138,pew pew shit I died
16139,"Story is amazing. Graphics are better than any ""realistic"" graphics. Humor is a little crude. But gameplay is amazing. Get this game!"

16141,awesome looter shooter
16142,"Best Borderlands ever! Love the gameplay, music and plot itself."
16143,TOP DOGG
16144,Best shooter ever! Suitable even for noobs :) Becomes even better while playing in co-op
16145,tis good
16146,Very fun
16147,<3
16148,"This game is full of hilarious dark humor (SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!), has LOTS of different weapons and loot to choose from, and the graphics are pretty unique, colorful and pleasant to look at. That cell-shading affect the game uses is really cool. I love the different designs of the weapons (ranging from simple and realistic to just outright wacky), and also the designs of the characters and (many different) bosses as well. There's different characters to pick from, each with their own unique action skill and skill trees. There's many ways to build and play whichever character you choose from. The game is overall amazing. Borderlands is an awesome franchise in general."
16149,"Even though the game is old it still is one of the best story mode games I have played.It has so many missions and side mission I can t keep track and I ve barely played the game.


Edit:I'm at the end of the game and it s been a great game!Fully recommend. :)"
16150,"I will be honest. This game is nowhere near as good as the community rating it has. I stopped once, i gave this game another chance and stopped again. I did completed first game with all DLC and completed a lot of main missions in BL2 + many DLC. I tried to avoid having another abandonware in my library but it's just too hard to continue playing this game. 
To make things clear you should also understand that Gearbox is a shitty company overall. There's so many things to mention for which people hate them, so i will just point at Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens Colonial Marines games. Gearbox games are boring time wasters. I swapped characters in this game, tried different weapons and skills and still couldn't enjoy it enough. Now a small list of pros and cons.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

- Art style. Comics cartoony type.
- Soft humor. Not that it's funny. It fits the game art style and makes it ""less serious"".

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- Classes are dull and boring. I think TPS was an improvement. 
- Class powers are boring and cheap. Magic bubble that sucks enemies? Turret? There could have been unique control scheme for each class, with different abilities. 
- PhysX wasn't optimized for AMD at all. It means that you can forget about blood and some effects or lag hard.
- You can't fast travel from many locations and so you have to walk a lot. Artificial increase of playtime. 
- Weapons are just few models with poor reskins and different stats. Quantity over quality type. 
- Majority of missions are boring. Go there, kill that guy, return, open reward screen, get your reward. 
- Loot share system is dumb. When i tried co-op long ago some guy just stole everything good and he haven't used proper class for those weapons.

If you like looter shooters (this is not Action-rpg or good single player game. Again, it is exactly a looter-shooter) that feels like MMO with offline/co-op mode, then buy this game. If you want a game where you can enjoy campaign, stick to your preferred weapon class and not be bothered with enemy levels, constant weapon swaps, different damage elements and boring missions, then avoid this game. Borderlands is a bit better than other Gearbox games, but it's still a Gearbox game. A man will not become a woman simply by desiring it. Just like Gearbox game won't become a good game just by changing name. 
I bought collection for cheap price and it's not a big loss.

16151,This game feels like home.
16152,Great storyline with several different characters to choose from. Side quests and all are great as well! Loved this game even after so many years.
16153,"graphics and gameplay is interesting.

What I don't like is the lagginess during online co-op"
16154,"Loads of content to play, awesome story, farming is a bit of a dick but that doesn't make it less fun. Highly recommended"
16155,"I haven't been able to really get into this game, but I actually enjoyed this a lot for the time that I did play this game, most likely will get back to it eventually"
16156,Sucked my life but i dont want it back
16157,good
16158,"jogo é muito bom, Historia interessante, Personagens legais. Vale muito a pena"
16159,AWESOME!!!!!!!
16160,This is literally my favorite game and getting it for my PC was like the 5th time I've purchased it.
16161,Fun shooter with a great style.
16162,A glorious Fucstercluck or murder and mayhem with the best villain I've ever seen.
16163,"This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time, and Handsome Jack is the best video game villain, end of discussion."
16164,lolzy
16165,"First Time i playing this game , and i have to say ....ITS AWESOME !!!!"
16166,its borerlands 2 if that's not reason enough i don't know what is
16167,it's pretty cool
16168,This is just a great game!
16169,"The buggy drives like shit

(Otherwise a good game ..)"
16170,Keeps me entertained
16171,"Handsome Jack isn't funny, not even for immature humor or absurdism. His jokes are just bad ""lol random"" irredeemable bs and they rarely land to any extent. He's also not sympathetic, including the sequels. Basically if you've somehow convinced yourself that you like Handsome Jack, you're a delusional idiot.
Also Tiny Tina isn't funny or cool, just annoying in the same overbearing manner.
Claptrap is actually pretty funny. He makes actual jokes and they actually land. Only annoying if you identify with your character, which would be sad.

The game itself is great with friends, much less fun alone, and not because everything is more fun with friends but because it feels balanced for MP. (Played [b]at least[/b] 30h before getting it on Steam.)"
16172,-
16173,its borderlands break shit and murder people.
16174,"Wow.

From the loot, to gunplay, and of course the funniest dialog/characters I've seen, this game is amazing. You have an array of characters, guns, skills and missions to choose from making this a very high replayable game. its funny dialog keeps the game interesting on repeating plays, and the simple graphics support the ""comic"" look and enables me to run it on my old laptop, which is a great plus.
highly recommended, and I can easily see myself coming back to this game even after dozens of hours of play
"
16175,it's the borderlands game that figured out what is style is.
16176,"Amazing game, super fun looter shooter RPG. Fun with friends as well in coop. Very comical as well. All Hail Clap Trap XD"
16177,"There isn't really much to say about the game, but I would definitely recommend getting the Handsome Jack collection when it's on sale as opposed to just the base game."
16178,"back in 2010 i got 72 op8 in uvhm and 100%'d it, but this was on the 360.  Now I re-playd it on steam and did a 90% achievement playthrough in tvhm mode. Didnt see the need to drop 100 more hours into uvhm mode for lvl 80 and op lvls that wont yield my any more achievos. Regardless of that, Borderlands is just such a fantastic series of games with amazing deep lore that everyone seems to just not notice because of the deep loot based madness lol"
16179,Its a game.
16180,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, I played 2500 hours on Xbox and now I'm on PC, never gets old"

16183,Best game in the Borderlands series! Great fan base too. Play it!
16184,Good game. Yes.
16185,its fun....nothing more 2 say. thanks O____O
16186,"fun gameplay + lots to do but claptrap needs to get a brain istg i wanna punch him every time i see him, it's not a want, it's a need"
16187,"The best RPG game I've played. Fun, funny, with great weapons, gameplay mechanics and a lot of choices for your playstyle. A lot of fun with friends, and therefore a lot of jealousy from my wife. Now I wear a mask of her face on mine ! 10/10 would recommend."
16188,"This game is really the best borderlands game , I wish it has borderlands 3 garphics and gameplay and it would be truly amazing more than it already is !"
16189,"Super duper fun and funny. High class production in every way. Best characters, voices and humor. It is fun and good for your mental health to play."
16190,hackr
16191,"50/50 as whether to recommend or not. I did really enjoy a lot of BL2: its a fun shooter, funny, crude, and I enjoyed the looting mechanics. It was also really nice to play a game where I didn't have to agonise about every tiny decision blocking a future quest or resulting in the death of a beloved character.

Overall I doubt I'll play BL2 again or get any of the other BL games, but I enjoyed it.

Some of the stuff I didn't enjoy:

- I don't want to have to play the same game 3 times to experience all the content.

- Despite there being sniper characters, skills and equipment you can't really snipe. Even with the settings at max, most enemies don't spawn until you're close and stealth isn't really a thing in BL2. I was disappointed not to be able to do what Mordecai does at one point: pick off unsuspecting enemies from extreme range. Ditto with melee, most melee weapons are just a bayonet, and there's no blocking or parrying or different levels of attack. It would have been nice to have the sniping and melee mechanics developed a bit more.

- Terrain was lazy. Lots of invisible barriers, objects that aren't solid, drops glitching through the floor etc.

- I got bored. There's a lot of content and the gameplay hasn't really got much depth. As previously mentioned, stealth isn't really a thing and the areas are generally linear so there isn't much scope for planning or tactics. I also spent a lot of time running back and forth across the same areas doing quests.

- I enjoyed the DLC I played (Scarlet, Torque, Tina, Hammerlock) but quit after finishing Hammerlock. The straw that broke the camel's back, and the thing that ultimately flipped me from 'recommend' to 'not recommend', was not being able to get back into the armoury after I'd left to sell some guns and free up some inventory space. There was no warning of this and no reason that I can see why this decision was made.


"
16192,It's great!
16193,addictive game
16194,yes
16195,sad
16196,you already know its good
16197,Super fun!
16198,In my opinion still the best Borderlands game (and the best looter shooter game out there).
16199,"There is so much to love about this game, I don't know where to begin. I think Borderlands 2 hooked me when I came across a mission that hilariously lampooned Top Gun. No video game has made me laugh as much! I also enjoy the gameplay mechanics. 

If I run out of ammo, there is very likely some of that ammo in a chest or on the ground next to a bandit I just wasted. I don't have to spend obscene amounts of money in Marcus's ammo vending machines to restock. Thank Jeebus!

There are plenty of ways to get your hands on rare, lifesaving weapons. You can farm weapons and shields, collect golden keys, generously tip Miss Moxxi, complete missions, or dump money into slot machines. When you get your shiny, new, b@da$$ toys you can travel all over a vast map filled with psychotic, bloodthirsty weirdos, pirates, and freakish animals who apparently do nothing more than kill bandits, eat their treasure and $h!t it all over the map. Fan-bloody-tastic!

I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this game and getting as many DLC packs as you can since this is definitely a game that has infinite replay possibilities."
16200,Thats a perfect game you whant shoot challnge mision this game for you
16201,Perfect to play with friends.
16202,popa
16203,Meh
16204,This is the most linear game since Super Mario Brothers on NES and the cringiest game since Borderlands.
16205,"gold
"
16206,Any Borderlands game remains an amazing game even by today's standards. BL2 is no different.
16207,"I mainly played this with friends. It's an alright game, I wouldn't play it if no one I knew played it.

Jakobs weapons felt pretty satisfying to use though."
16208,good game play good
16209,"Story, visuals, voiceover come together to raise the bar on addictive gameplay. 10/10 recommend!"
16210,A fun shooter and looter that sucks you in with funny wit and great gun action.
16211,"This is by far the best one in the series. I started with 2. I have played every single one of them and none come close to Borderlands 2. BL3 is by far graphically and mechanically better but there is no Borderlands out there that can beat the story of 2. If you want a fun, stupid, and slightly morally compromising looter shooter this is the game for you. Top 3 games ever made."
16212,"Short:
One of the best and one of the most annoying games I've ever played!
Long:
There are so many bad mechanics in this game. So many annoying stuff. 
The game freezes or crashes sometimes and if you have the HD pack installed it becomes a 1000 times worse.
DLCs are decent. Mostly! ""A Role Playing Game"" is the best.
But so annoying mate. SOOO ANNOYING!
PS: Either this game copied from souls series or vise versa."
16213,EXPLOSIONS!!
16214,the first like story mission is slow but then it really just picks up and its honestly endlessly good
16215,It's great enough that I am willing to play with dogshit resolution just  to make up for the follies of my craptop.
16216,"Don't even bother loading up BL3, stick to this classic. You'll also save a bit of cash. Much better story, enemies, bosses, progression, etc."
16217,p good
16218,is gud
16219,Easily one of the funnest 1st person shooter rpgs that you will ever play.
16220,Spectacular

16226,Good Game.
16227,yes
16228,gun go pew pew
16229,If you enjoy FPS and comic books with humor than this game is for you.
16230,this game was more fun tthen i thought it was
16231,borderlands 4
16232,"Hands down the worst gunplay I've ever seen in a FPS by an incredibly large margin. The mouse sensitivity setting is broken, 10 is the minimum value and it's extremely low, 15 is the second minimum value and it's rocket fast, everything above that is tiny increments of that broken fast sensitivity. glad I only paid $1 for this because at the currently listed price I'd feel scammed."
16233,It's pretty epic.
16234,"I've played this game too much. I had this on 360, PS3, PS4, and I just got it on PC. It's the best game you will ever play in my opinion. You can play through the story over and over again and never get bored. The amount of different play styles in this game is unreal. I highly suggest you get this game. It will quickly become your favorite game. Also, this is better than Borderlands 3 that shit is ass."
16235,very good game highly recommend this game

16245,Love this game! Graphics are awesome and you get to play CO-OP with your friends. It does take a while to get used the gameplay icons but overall the game is easy to learn. No lags so far and money is easy to find so that you can buy and sell items! Would recommend this game!
16246,Shoot. Loot. Cackle like a deranged toddler. Repeat.
16247,Gave me a gambling addiction
16248,boring lmao
16249,The best single player video game experience I have had. 10/10
16250,"Yep - it's still a compelling experience in 2021.
A few minor technical problems here & there, but to be expected.
Mainly, inexplicable frame dips in very specific locations, that appear to happen for most of us.
Nothing that breaks the game though and it runs at a reasonably steady locked 60 fps on most modern rigs.
Blah blah blah.
Enjoy."
16251,1
16252,the game is the best in the seires the story is so good you will play it for hours
16253,Meh
16254,Me and my friend played this for hours and hours and only stopped when my pc broke 10/10 game tho
16255,eee
16256,10/10
16257,the game just never finished since 2013 im start playing
16258,Fun game I had a great time playing with my friends
16259,JUST PLAY IT! ITS GOOD
16260,"
I like guns :)"
16261,Very good game
16262,"Absolutely yes I would recommend. The farming can get annoying but it's part of the game and I've grown used to it. If you don't have patients to farm and play til lvl 80 and over and over. I don't wanna speak/play with you. Leave. Also I don't like people who play just for a moment and leave. Theres so much to this game than just beating normal mode. I would go on and on but I'm too lazy. The games 9/10. Guns, story, everything."
16263,"I bought the Handsome Collection Bundle, which covers pretty much everything except for the Commander Lilith DLC (which after many many hours of gameplay, I learnt was necessary for the End Game content). It lives up to its reputation even after all these years. Even their customer service is still responsive to this game. It's just a shame that the End-Game content DLC was sold separately.

You'll also have to take note that this game includes the classic farming levelling up style of RPG-esque games so to get to End-Game (assuming you'll play long enough to reach that far), you may have to repeat the campaigns up to 3 times+++ without gibbed cheats."
16264,"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest games of all time. If you love killing hoards of enemies, finding rare and sometimes insanely powerful loot, leveling up to become borderline unkillable, and seeing really big numbers pop up on screen to give that extra dopamine boost, then this is definitely the game for you."
16265,Classic
16266,ok
16267,
16268,Crazy how this game came out 9 years ago and I have yet to find a looter shooter greater then it. 10/10

16270,its a very great game
16271,krieg
16272,"played this for hundreds upon hundreds of hours with my friends on other systems but would highly suggest Over Borderlands 1, as it takes everything that 1 had, and made it better. story's meh."
16273,In my top 20 games of all time
16274,"Very fun game either solo or with friends.

I suggest a solo play through of the story before playing with friends if it is your first time because it plays kind of like Diablo 2. By that I mean, the first play-through of the story is awesome and you can really get behind or go against the quirky characters but after that, the end game grind can be fun and entertaining."
16275,"mad ting
"
16276,It's a not a game for casual players because it's stressful as hell but it's a good game 10/10 would recommend.
16277,"one of the best games of all time (its like my 5th time buying it, got it on 360, Xb1, Ps3, Ps4 and now PC)"
16278,Great game Love it and all the borderlands.
16279,Great Fun!!
16280,"pretty good me and my friends still plaly it but i do wish the key drops would be more often

16284,So far I rally have only played the game on an adventure type mode and not really followed the story line that much.  The worlds are vast to explore. I am now re-installing after a long time away and will begin from scratch.  Fun and great graphics. Easy GUI.
16285,It is a very beautiful game with much freedom
16286,Too long and boring.

Whether you're a casual gamer, normal gamer or an expert gamer, in my opinion, you will have fun playing this game.

☼ Graphics ☼

☐ Alright
☑ Good
☑ Beautiful

My PC isn't great but I had no problems playing this game. I think even people with low end computers will be able to play this. Obviously you'd need to put everything on low graphics but I think the game looks great even on low graphics.

I have enjoyed the music a lot.

☠ Difficulty ☠
☐ Easy

☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Hard
☐ Unfair
Early in the game it's pretty easy, but like most games, it gets harder as you level higher which is a good thing. You don't want to just steam roll through a game as you'll soon get bored of it and never pick it up again.

§ Bugs §
☐ Bugs destroy the game
☐ Lots of bugs
☐ Few Bugs
☐ You can use them for speedrun
☑ Nothing encountered
I haven't seen any bugs in my 100+ hours of playing. I once got stuck between a chest and a fence but just save and quit and reload and I was fine. People use older versions of the game for speedruns as they can use glitches and whatnot but in the current version I have encountered nothing.

☯ Story ☯
☐ There is none
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☑ Fantastic
I love the storyline of Borderlands 2. Even the side quests. The humour makes it even more enjoyable.

⚔ Gameplay ⚔
☐ Frustrating
☐ Sleepy
☐ Boring
☑ Fun
☑ Challenging
You have a lot of fun with the storyline, side quests, bosses, .... One thing I don't enjoy is the running around on maps where there is no driving allowed. Or that you can't fast travel when you'd like, but other than that I'm still having a great time playing.

☑ Extremely Long (101+ hours)
You can ""speedrun"" it if you like and just stick to the main storyline but you'll miss out on so much more of the game. I've played over 100 hours and I still haven't finished everything yet. When you get bored with a character make a new one. There's 5 (if I remember correctly) classes to choose from. All of them are different.

$ Price / Quality $
☑ Full price
☐ Wait for Sale
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund it if you can
I bought the game on sale but would definitely pay full price. The amount of playtime you get out of the game is more than worth it in my opinion."

16290,good
16291,"I only have 54 hours on this, but believe me when i say this, but i have a lot more on the xbox (because i have a crappy laptop and i can only get like 15 fps) but borderlands 2 will always be a timeless classic, and with almost infinite replayability (through vanilla or community patches) there won't be a moment of your time when you would say ""what else is there to do?"" with 6 playable characters, and many different varieties you can use the skills combined with ""A BAZILLION"" different weapons, there's so many ways to play that suits to your style of playing e.g. wanna play sneakly or snipe everyone from afar? choose Zer0, want to guns blazin'? go Salvador, want to be more strategic? team up with Axton, Prefer to use elemental weaponry to burn, zap or melt thy enemies? Maya's your girl. so many ways to play, so many enemies to kill. So...what are you waiting for, Vault Hunter? get out there and kick Jack in his fake ass!"

Definitely one of the best games i have ever purchased on steam."

16342,"An absolute perfection of a game. This game is fun, addicting and funny and is really just perfect. The story also played out really well with its unique likeable characters. You also get to choose your class with the special abilities you get and customise your character. This game has tons of content and you should definitely try out the dlcs, which adds more storyline. This game will always have a spot in my heart, EVERYONE should definitely try out this game sometime."

16344,STEVE
16345,Do i really need to say something ? :)

I can't even say it's fun with friends, Hanging out with friends is fun generally, this game is just a means to do something as you talk to a friend."
16347,"""GG"" said my character after killing the enemy.
Fun, hilarious, shoot and loot game.
Huge map, tons of species,guns etc and the collection is cheap with dlcs what more can you for?"

16356,"Overall I believe that Borderlands 2 is a masterpiece. From the story to the gameplay everything about this game is great. 

Gameplay/ Mechanics: 
Now the gameplay is BL2 is nothing new, you shoot enemies, throw grenades, and melee things. But it's the way the game goes about the gameplay that I believe make it great. Like how each different part of a weapon will determine how the weapons will work and do different things, like how a matching grip will increase magazine  size, matching stock will increase fire rate, and how the prefix will determine how the gun functions. In Borderlands you'll never feel like power is out of your control, you can literally complete this game with the lowest rarity weapons and gear and still have tons of fun, unless you're playing at the highest difficulty with the post powerful enemies and bosses. 
Now Borderlands 2 is considered to be a ""looter shooter"" what that means is that each enemy and boss has a specific item or a change to drop an item when you kill it.

Story/ Characters:
This game will have one of the most compelling and interesting stories you will ever experience, it does this so well that when certain things happen you will want to go and get revenge for these characters. This game also have one of the most interesting and fleshedout villains of all time, Handsome Jack. When you first meet him he'll seem like a sarcastic, corrupt business man, but you'll learn that his life is filled with tragedy, abuse, sadness, and corruption. 
When you play through Borderlands 2 you'll meet all sorts of different characters that take you through the world and it never really feel boring. Each character has a backstory and reasons on why they do what they do. 

Sidequests/ Missions:
As you play through the game characters and areas will have optional missions called ""Sidequests or Sidemissions"" these missions will give you xp to further level your character and will sometimes give you rare loot. Side missions will also give you more backstory to things that are happening in the world. 

DLC:
There are 47 bonus content for Borderlands 2, this is counting all the main DLCs, the expantion packs and head hunter packs. These will include are characters, more missions, new rare gear, and most importantly more story.

Difficulty:
After you beat the main story you will unlock a new playthrough difficulty, True Vault Hunter mode (TVHM). This will reset the story and give you more difficult enemies and better gear. And after you beat the game on TVHM you unlock, Ultimate Vault Hunter mode (UVHM) this is the hardest difficulty in the game. You'll have to use a special element called Slag which debuffs the enemies makes them weaker, without slag you'll have a very, very hard time completing the game. 

OP Levels:
The OP Levels (overpowered Levels) are 10 extra levels that your character can unlock. The OP levels make it to where enemies will still level up while you stay level 80 (level cap) however your weapons can have OP levels to combat all the tough enemies in endgame. 
You unlock the OP levels by beating the difficult map, Digistruct Peak. 

Here are some YouTube videos that also explain why Borderlands 2 is a masterpiece.

16358,"This game is one of the most fun looter shooters i have played in a long while. It is has quickly made its way up the ranks of my top time favourite games, such as, the Doom franchise, the Forza Horizon franchise, the Titanfall franchise including Apex legends, Warframe and the star wars battlefront franchise. as i only have 69 hours in this game so far i cant quite give a solid opinion but still i will try and give it a go. Firstly it is a massive graphical improvement from the first game and has way more guns and also missions. The game has slicker UI and cooler vault hunters with way more DLCs. So overall i would highly recommend this game to everyone even if it is almost 10 years old. My overall rating is an 11/10 score because it is so fun"
16359,Good
16360,"FUCK EPIC, love this game tho
"
16361,"[h1] It's ok [/h1]

7 years of my life wasted on this game lmao. I owned it on Xbox 360, PSVita, Xbox One, and now PC, and after 7 years of semi-consistent play I can say with some level of authority: It's ok."
16362,Very fun to shoot things and pick up guns to shoot more things.
16363,"Not much lore, but good story throughout and basically a nonstop- firstpersonshooter where 97% of the game is based on you killing something."
16364,idk
16365,best game out there :)

16382,"What is a Mexican's favourite video game?
Borderlands."
16383,"great game but more glitches than I thought, though none of them are game breaking"
16384,"It's a pretty great game, especially if buying handsome collection on sale for $6.
I'd say Borderlands 2 and Doom (2016) are the most efficient things on steam to buy for $6.
Rating for Borderlands 2:
Gameplay: 6.5/10 (+1.5 with friends)
Plot: 7.5/10
Art Style: 8/10
As a Game in General: 7/10-7.75/10 (Depends on Friends)

16429,"On my steam profile it says I played for 3 hours only (as of the time i am making this review) It is a lie i have played for many many hours on xbox 360 and xbox one and I am here to recommend this game to you.
This game as a shooter game is fun to not just play once but so many times with your own challenges are buffs when you beat the game yourself. It has 6 different characters (I think) that are very different and are very compatible with eachother. On the xbox version you can play splitscreen and either steal the loot you want or battle for it.(TL;DR) Game has so much potential and replay value, play it!"
16430,"very fun, with a lot of guns to find and figure out what they do"
16431,"its fun
"
16432,Absolutely awesome game with great humor. One of the best coop multiplayer games i have ever played. But play in singleplayer for a slower pace to experience the story.
16433,GOOOD GAME
16434,LOVE THIS GAME
16435,pooptrain
16436,"Pinnacle of the series. Instead of bothering with 3, just play this one again. The environments and the gameplay still hold up, plus you won't lose braincells listening to the travesty of a plot in that one."
16437,very enjoyable spend of time :))))))
16438,This is still one of my faves looter shooters
16439,"Its so fun
"
16440,"It's a solid game, you walk through a wasteland, get attacked by a hoard of giant death bats, kill some innocent mentally ill people in a small village, and you get to sleep at night"
16441,.
16442,yes
16443,"I haven't played a whole lot (comparatively) of this on PC as I have on PS3 and Switch, but this game is probably hands down the most accessible APRG out there. Well, that and the extremely fun loot system is also a draw.

But honestly, the fact it seems to draw in people who don't even really like this style of game is quite cool. I personally get far too addicted to APRG's ala Diablo 3 but other people have been drawn in by the story and the characters and enjoyed the game purely on those grounds. It's a testament to what a good story can do for a game."
16444,Fine.
16445,very cool but hardddd
16446,best game on steam
16447,its shit and im bad at csgo and homosexual
16448,"The best Borderlands, no contest"
16449,"This game saved my life.

I am 29.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
16450,A must have. RPG Shooter game that you can definitely spend hours and hours and hours on. I am about to create 3rd character already and I am still having fun. Borderlands was definitely ahead of its time.
16451,"i finally beat it

16461,"First game from the Borderlands series I bought, I didn't have to disappoint. Countless hours of grinding even after completing the game - either you go back hunting for the missed details of game's lore, or go for DLCs / raid bosses.

Rushing through this game is absolutely pointless, and I'd say even makes your gameplay considerably harder - so you definitely should check out what else this game has to offer besides main story. You'll also learn more about the character you're playing, provided that you care about the lore at all (you really should, you're missing out otherwise!)."

16468,this game is damn too cool if u want to release some explosions or slicing creatures heads or head shot or destroying foking cars with armored shuriken cars and death race with ur car great story with great NPC. this game is really good try borderlands 1 and 3 too have fun
16469,pew pew BOOM
16470,"It's fine I guess? First person looters are pretty common now, but I guess the tone of the writing and aesthetic helps keep it distinct. It has the loop down, but if you don't want to give Randy ""Nobody Likes A Bigot"", ""Aliens: Colonial Marines was a 7, 7 and a half out of 10"", ""I left the Alien Hive level in Duke Nukem: Forever"" Pitchford money, please do not."
16471,"This game is a classic. If you like looter shooters then this game is for you, not to mention its very good and incredibly well acted cast and possibly one of the best video game villans to date and you have yourself a incredible game. However, i must add that the game itself is old so the weapons arent as ""real"" feeling compared to most other shooters today which is the only downside i have with the game. However, do not be fooled, even though the weapons feel like an older video game (as they should) they are incredibly addicting to get and to farm for better ones. Also has great bosses. The enemies do get a little stale, however its an older game. All in all the BEST borderlands game."
16472,i eat food so good mmm yes
16473,"If you haven't played this gem and you think weapons with different abilities enemies that level up through the adventure and a fun challenge not to mention a zany story, then pick this up today or when the next Steam sale is."
16474,BEST fps rpg of all the borderlands

The dialog goes from annoying to ear piercing, and to put salt on the wound, there's a lot of dialog."
16513,you like cookie clicker you like borderlands
16514,better than bl3 by a longshot
16515,"mmmmmm moxxi
"
16516,"I played Borderlands as a co op experience the entire time through and with that being said, it had a lot of interesting story missions, characters, and raid bosses for us to continue to want to play."
16517,"Yes, this is a violent game. Yes, there is no point to the game and the ending (no spoilers) comes before the game's end, weird I know, but it is one on the most addictive game out there because the player has a huge play ground and can do as little or as much as they want to complete the game without the guilt of 'not going it right'  because there is no 'doing it right'. As a heads-up get the season pack because some of the DLs are as good, if not better, as the original."
16518,cmon bruh for real
16519,Better Story and better Claptrap then the third
16520,Fucking hate this game i fucking hate it so much there is no naked option for the blue hair girl oh my fucking god so mad fucki ng god dman go GO GD OGD OOOGO DGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
16521,"Its a good game but the driving mechanics are trash, your car will jump on the tiniest bump and your car will spin out which makes racing sidequest a pain in the ass.

9/10"
16522,Pritty good. But like when Moxxi sex dlc?
16523,this game is sick and the last playtrought its really challenging and fun

16526,"remember, Jack is the hero and you are just a goddamn bandit."
16527,Good game. Very fun yes.
16528,The games Just a prime example of a super good game its one of the best ones i've ever played
16529,"was recommended to play this by a friend and man i don't regret a  single thing fantastic gameplay fun and grindy a thing ive been wanting in a game since i quit diablo 3 4 years ago. story is great weapons, skills and upgrade tree are easy to learn only thing i didn't like is the weapons dropping through the ground after dropping or swapping a weapon from loot crates. but that alone didn't effect my opinion of the game its lore and comedic and intriguing characters and is a definite recommend if you have friends to play with and is worth consideration of  purchasing DLC for it."
16530,noice
16531,POP! GOES THE BANDIT
16532,the  d e e r   f e c e s

16539,"PLAY WITH A FRIEND!

Seriously, you will have SO much more fun playing this co-op with someone over voice chat. The rando matchmade players are just...awful. Or cheaters. Awful cheaters."

16543,Just get the game stop reading the reviews.
16544,GAME
16545,Nice game
16546,goob gaem
16547,"Easily one of the best games I have ever played! can be a bit grindy if you want certain items but the variety in guns, fun abilities and characters along with the large maps really give BL2 a feel of excitment and joy that I've been able to sustain (Mostly play on console) for over 400 hours"
16548,This game is super fun with a great story so far and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a unique RPG FPS
16549,i would like to marry this game and i would consent to anything it wants
16550,ebic
16551,+++++++++++++++amazing
16552,"The high point in the series, Borderlands 2 is the best entry and successfully builds upon the first. The guns, characters, and writing are all great fun"
16553,"Having sank hundreds of hours into the first game this came as no surprise. Purchased on a sale weekend as part of the Handsome Jack collection (recommend this rather than buying separately). Arguably one of the best looter shooters I've played. the gameplay and story are a good mix and the options to skip through missions that have already been completed if you're in a rush building a new character are useful. There is so much content to this game but some of it can be a bit samey. For mindless running around shooting stuff and trying out the ""bazillion"" weapons it passes the time well. I also recommend trying it out with friends but we all know that one friend who we won't invite ""The loot ninja(Hoarder)"" the only quirk is the shared loot system but having decent friends helps if you need a trade. Don't expect to take this game seriously in terms of story as the story matches the cartoon graphics, that said it is not for the faint hearted and is a definitely at the bottom of the politically correct list. All round great game that I would definitely recommend."
16554,"Do you like crazy powerful guns? How about a lot of them? And ones with powerful quirks or powers? What about 6 badass characters to choose from each with 3 skill trees to build to the liking of your imagination? On top of that, a crazy as hell story?! Well, then this is the game for you! Now sit down, boy do I have a story for you!! HAHA!!"
16555,The game is great. It has big replay value and it never gets boring.
16556,if you like looting chests this game is for you. And i LOVE looting chests
16557,"The game keeps bugging and crashing and it wont work whenever i join my friend, keep in mind i have a 1660 ti and ryzen 5 1600. this shouldnt be happening but it is.

16583,"Game is fun, and can run on a potato pc."
16584,"Look, it's arguably the best Borderlands game so far.  The story is great, the voice acting is top notch, and the game play is (mostly) smooth.  Without a doubt the antagonist is one of the great, up there with GLaDOS.  I've played through this game at least twice on different systems and keep coming back for more."
16585,What more is there to say?
16586,
16587,"There are over 150,000,000 weapons in this game. what more could you want?"

16597,nice
16598,very nice game
16599,"I've never played borderlands 1 and 2 but i played borderlands 3. But this game specifically brings that Crazy FPS feeling, The characters are iconic, The setting is absolutely perfect for a game like this and it's got that crazy cartoonish feeling, and this game got one of the best enemies to kill and loot for. The game itself is perfect for a multiplayer format and fun to play with friends. I'll give this game a solid 10/10."

16610,ITS A GOOD GAME
16611,"Borderlands 2, possibly my favorite game of all time. I haven't yet beat the story for the first time but i'm already hooked. This game has countless hours of content with dlc that will have you wanting more. The story aspects and humor with interesting characters that are all different make this a good game."
16612,The psychos in this game have more personality than most antagonists in other games.

16635,"burgerlands

16636,"Trash tier game now. Navigating away from game via ALT+TAB now results in a permanent white screen and the need to physically unplug the PC as the game goes in an ""Always On Top"" mode. On top of that they've implemented a new online system ""SHIFT"" that apparently thinks the word Raccoon is somehow hateful, yet another casualty of the ever growing sensitivities of pansies running these companies. Pathetic.

DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH!"
16637,"I'd rate it up multiple times if I could.

After playing the awful Destiny beta in 2014, I finally decided to check out the loot shooter that caused the (still ongoing) rush of everyone trying to copy the properly successful game that did it. Within 10 minutes I was in love with Borderlands 2 and everything about it. The gameplay, locations, story, characters, dialogue, quests, skills, classes, guns, pretty much everything. Amazing. To this day (in 2021) it still has some of the best PhysX implementation in games. Sadly AMD moneyhatted Borderlands 3 and offered no tech of their own, just to lock Nvidia's superior tech out. Shame.

Borderlands 2 also has probably the best piece of DLC for a game ever made. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep."
16638,Great game to play with friends ngl
16639,clptrp
16640,good game yes
16641,"Borderlands 2 > Borderlands 3 > Pre-sequel.
I basically spent my real life in this game. Still haven't gotten all the skins tho so I guess I gotta grind god dammit. 

Worth it."
16642,"Story of my life. Buy game, play game, get frustrated with game and stop playing for a long time.

Then I come back and fall in love with it. 

This game is insane. It's like RAGE had a baby with Saints Row. And that baby has a robotic voice trapped in a tin can. 

There are so many guns, so many shields, so many enemies. And a ton of missions to go on. If you're looking for a game where you can get completely lost from the real world and get to destroy everything in sight in a virtual one, this is the game for you. 

Does it have glitches? YES (but not that many)
Does it have bad language? SOMETIMES (and usually from the player, not the game)
Does it have guns? I already told you that...but it's like that scene from the Matrix...

Go. Buy this and play it. You won't regret it."
16643,"I have played this game for countless hours on xbox one and the time on steam is not the total amount of time i actually played BL2 for. All i have to say about this game is it is a timeless classic and is worth replaying hundreds of times because there are so many guns to use and tons of easter eggs and ways to play like One Life challenges, Allegiance runs, Melee Only runs, and so so much more! But the main reason i would get this game is because of the personalities of the 6 vault hunters and the personalities of the NPCs (And maybe the crazy things that the psychos & midget psychos shout) and the fun missions like the Clan Wars mission chain, the Captain Scarlett & her pirate's booty DLC, the Mr Torgue's campaign of carnage DLC and well... all the dlcs are awesome. my advice Just buy the game and discover the wonders of looting Pandora and getting tons upon Tons upon TONS of guns."
16644,"""THAT SENTENCE HAD TOO MANY SYLLABLES! APOLOGIZE!"""
16645,"It was really fun, then Gearbox changed the multiplayer to their own server and now I can't connect with my friends to play.  I've tried every setting, but the connection keeps failing.  You have to revert back to its previous versions and play using that instead of the current version"
16646,epic
16647,"The farming in this game may seem tedious at first but over time it grows to become something that you love because of how satifing it is to finally get that one part you've been looking for. The game is also much better on pc than console in my opinion because of how much faster the loading times were but that could also be because I was on a Xbox 360, the game is also fun to play with friends and by yourself

10/10 fuels my gambling addiction"
16648,"Cool game maybe best ever i would probably say
10/10"

16654,I love looter shooter games and i always hear good things about this game. So i pick this up late and cheap thanks to sale and i absolutely hate it. The gunplay is flat without a satisfying feeling behind it. The story i will not comment on since i quit the game so early. I wish i have friends to play this game the way it's meant to be played but the solo experience is pretty boring and slow.
16655,one of the best games and if you think otherwise your a fucking slut

16693,"Get it, even in today's age. the timeless graphics and design, the replayability, the community behind the game, it makes the game so enjoyable. back in the day it was ahead of it's time and was awarded game of the year. Now, it's a relic of the times when games were games, and that fun wasn't forced upon you or put behind a paywall, or bullied out of the developers of the game via time crunch.
I do recommend. get around the fact it looks dated, and it's an amazing experience."

What I liked about the combat was that it is not exactly just happy fire instead to get more damage different elemental effects could be used to do more damaged to different enemy.
Despite there being 4 characters excluding DLCs I only got to play one as I was satisfied enough when I completed the game. I did not continue on to play the harder difficulties too ^^; Overall the game is amazing with their own unique graphics and humor to keep the audience captivated."

But beware those who don't play FPS games. I bought it because of positive reviews and legacy. And at first I did not like this game since I found it kind of hard and frustrating. So it took me several years to complete it's main story due to that.

On the positive side the art design and characters are great and carries the whole game to another level."

16733,"I haven't slept today and my mind is mush thanks to Borderlands 2.  I am a noob in the world of STEAM and gaming and my only experience comes from playing Hades and Witcher. This game fulfills my need to loot and kill and I don't regret the hours I've spent neglecting my health and family.  It is quite forgiving for beginners with little gaming experience and it isn't really heavy on exposition except for the first part so it won't bore you to tears. It eases you into the action with stages that complement your level of play (unlike Assassin's Creed which got so frustrating at one point--coz i'm really a sucky player).  For the price, the visuals are clean and stunning. The background music is cool too.  Not too heavy and jarring but lively enough to keep me company at 4 am.  It took a while for me to understand the mechanics but it wasn't frustrating. I still suck at this game and I don't think I'm progressing fast enough but I will keep at it because it delivers in all aspects.  I am having fun at the height of the pandemic.  That's the only thing that matters."

16742,"TLDR:  A clever, addictive looter-shooter that's a blast with friends

Borderlands 2 is kind of like the second kid who got raised right after the parents realized all the screw-ups they made on the first kid.

BL2 takes place shortly after the events of Borderlands 1. After the first vault on Pandora was found to contain a vagina-tentacle-monster, another vault is uncovered and it's up to the players to make sure the new vault's contents stay out of the wrong hands. Unfortunately, Handsome Jack, the sarcastic but ruthless CEO of the Hyperion corporation, is those wrong hands and he's determined to get the vault open first. Along the way, the player will see and fight alongside a lot of characters from the first game and there are a bunch of call-backs and references to BL1. Fans of the BL universe who enjoy the game's lore will love it.

The game returns the players to Pandora but varies the landscape; rather than every zone looking like a polluted wasteland or run-down town, there are icy glaciers, grassy plains, and sandy deserts. There are also strip-mined caverns full of acid and a tortured landscape tainted by Eredium, the special elemental currency of the game (which the player uses to expand their inventory and ammo carrying capacity). Each area is zoned like BL1, though the transitions between don't take long to load. Running on an i5-6600K CPU and GeForce GTX 1070, I didn't notice any real clipping or lagging and I can't recall the game crashing more than once or twice, even with the hours and hours I put into it.

The player can choose to play as a Axton (jack-of-all trades), Maya (lockdown), Salvador (burst damage), Zero (stealth), Gaige (pet class), or Kreig (melee specialist). All have their unique strengths and weaknesses. Figuring out the ins and outs of the characters and settling on the ones I liked was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game. Like BL1, the main story quests are the driving focus but each area has tons of side-quests of varying difficulty. One mission literally consists of shooting the quest giver in the face. Only in Borderlands ...

You like combat? There's tons of it. You'll be blasting bandits, wildlife, robots, and Hyperion employees right from the get-go. Enemies are more diversified from BL1 and bring some new features and challenges. For example, you can blast the heads clean off Goliath enemies and they'll go nuts, attacking anything nearby, even their allies. But every time they kill something, they get stronger and if you leave them alone long enough, they can be a Super Badass who runs out of targets and comes for you, and is now much harder to kill. As with BL1, enemies drop cash, ammo, and equipment (and occasionally Eredium now), though you will usually have to kill elite, boss, or raid boss mobs to get good weapons.

The game features several replay modes after beating it: True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM), which will run you levels 35-50 or so, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM), which is for 50+. Mobs in UVHM level with the player. Try not to over-level yourself between playthroughs, or you will run into problems. By this, I mean if you're level 50 and have finished TVHM, move on. If you clean up all the residual quests and hit level 54, you'll find your level 50-ish weapons inadequate against the UVHM mobs.

The DLCs range from decent to excellent, providing tons of missions, equipment, experience, and achievements. If you have any nerd roots, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is an absolute howl. I will say, the witch doctors in Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt are fucking annoying (and the miserable little bastards are everywhere), which made that DLC quite a bit of a grind. DLCs include raid bosses that will need special tactics to beat, ideally in a group. Grouping is where the game really shines and playing with other folks can be a lot of fun.

Normal mode is should be doable my players of any skill level but subsequent playthroughs get more challenging. Certain areas can become long grindfests, especially as a single player. In the town of Opportunity, you will face what feels like infinite waves of loaders. Past the normal mode run, mobs did have a nasty tendency to turn into bullet sponges. Then there are particular mobs, like Badass Pyro Threshers, who are unreasonable at just about any level and any difficulty. Some of this can be mitigated by having weapons at the appropriate level but even so, it often felt ridiculous. And though I like the irreverent humor of the game, it does become repetitive and the NPCs eventually turn into one-dimensional caricatures. Seriously, Scooter. I know you're an inbred hillbilly, so not every conversation has to revolve around it.

Steam Achievements are mostly solo-able, though some take a bit of grinding. Fighting some of the raid bosses are feasible by oneself but easier with more players. As of this writing, I had about 85% done, with a little time invested. Some are completely miss-able, so if you're into achievements, you might want to consult a guide. Fortunately, you can always pick them up on a later TVHM/UVHM playthrough.

What else can I say? Years after release, Borderlands 2 still has a lot going for it. It's fun, it's exciting, and it takes a while to get bored on it. For anyone looking for a looter-shooter to play with friends, I can't recommend it enough.

Pros
- Great combat and looting mechanics
- Multiplayer is incredibly fun
- Good DLC content

Cons
- Can be overly grindy/difficult in single-player, especially past the first playthrough
- Humor may not work for everyone

Final Score: 8/10"
16743,Best Game
16744,this game truly has an unlimited amount of replay time
16745,steam pls
16746,"Borderlands 2 is the only looter-shooter I’ve ever enjoyed. It is my second most-played game, and it’s kind of old. A lot of people find it extremely boring, but I don’t.

+ There are plenty of weapons
+ There are plenty of enemies
+ There are plenty of missions, areas, and secrets
+ The core gameplay is entertaining
+ There are 6 characters with different play-styles and skill trees
+ The story, dialogue, and characters are somewhere between average and good
+ A decent amount of the jokes are funny

/ The weapon mechanics are definitely outdated, but they aren’t bad
/ The animations on most things aren’t great
/ The menus are a little buggy sometimes
/ The weapon variety and much of the gameplay gets stale after 1300 hours
/ The music is inoffensive

- The driving is not fun
- Many standard guns are so bad that you will literally never use them except as a joke
- The boss fights are some of the worst I have ever seen in any videogame, ranging from simply boring to “get the bee shield and use an exploit or you die”
- The 3rd difficulty setting is more tedious than challenging
- The newest DLC is awkwardly balanced and isn’t good in general
- I wish I could purge the Hammerlock DLC from my memory"
16747,"Great fun, awesome design."
16748,"good game

16749,veri gut
16750,this is my favorite game ever
16751,Ive played this game for years started on ps4 then xbox and now on  pc and absolutely love it
16752,"Veri gid , comradis"
16753,"Inconvenience simulator: the game. The enemy can roll, but you can't. Random shit oneshots you from angles you can't see. A completely dysfunctional quest tracker, especially when there's any verticality in the map. 100% of the quests I have encountered so far are either completely arbitrary (kill x numbers of this enemy using this thing or in this way) or genuinely braindead. The quest where you're supposedly introduced to 'tech weapons' you're given a garbage minigun that drains your ammo and does basically no damage, and told to kill 25 bandits with it. So you're running around looking for bandits and ammo, just to complete this quest that doesn't reward you with anything (not even the minigun btw). Once I thought ""Gearbox made BL2, how did they go on to make Godfall?"" Now I know why. These are definitely the same devs because both games are complete dogshit."
16754,love it
16755,no border yes for me? aWDEOme
16756,good
16757,"Really slow start, I quit playing out of boredom until i picked it up again. My second try on the game was a 180 turn, i had an absolute blast and blew over 80 hours on it. I played Borderlands 1 after this game and lets just say I think BL2 is quite superior. This game also has one of the best DLC's I've ever played (Tiny Tina DLC). Some raidbosses are just way too easy with the right gear and others are just outright bullsh!t (or maybe I just lacked the skill/cheese/strategy who knows) 

It's a good game but it's faaaaar from perfect. 6.5/10 for me!"
16758,Runs on mac and it runs smoothly on my crappy pc so its good it runs well its fun with friends and stuff but yeah thats about it id give it a 8/10
16759,All time favourite game.
16760,"YOUR LIVER IS MY HOOD ORNAMENT!

16761,"I went to the border and there was no lands

16762,"legendary, played a bunch on my xbox 360"
16763,"eh, i like the game"
16764,LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS GOSE HARD
16765,yes
16766,"Legendary game.
The writing for the game didn't age well. If you can look past that, it's an iconic shoot/loot coop game and is prob the most fun I've ever had with friends next to something like Halo 3.
If you're looking to try and give it a shot I recommend playing with at least 1 or maybe 2 friends. Hard game to enjoy solo, personally, and a lot of the fun I find comes from the endgame which is basically non-existent with an old community."
16767,good
16768,One of the best games of the previous decade some mechanics are a bit outdated but nothing that cant be fixed through simple modding and save editing. I have hundreds of hours between my 5 copies of the game the gameplay loop seemingly never gets old.
16769,So muchhhh end game and a lot of hours to put in
16770,Don't let your kids play.
16771,an actually good looter shooter
16772,loot

16778,Good
16779,better than sex
16780,Ok lets get started on how unbeliveably good its great its open world ish and its fast paced FPS shooting and lots and lots of aliens ect its amazing and if i was you i would go get you credit card and get this amazing game iwth a great story line NOW GO BUY IT
16781,good looter shooter with lots of fun ways to kill bosses
16782,"Really good game. Gearbox, pls make the Fight For Sanctuary DLC free again."
16783,"Great game, but sometimes less is more. The number of side quests are insane, especially with DLC, and if you try to do them all at your required level, you will level far past the main story and other side quests. Many things unlock at the same level, so you can essentially pick one for a decent challenge; the rest become increasingly easy. If you are not a completionist, however, this game will keep a great level of challenge throughout, and is very repayable with the many available characters with thought out abilities and skills. The story is very good as well, with dark humor mixed with emotional dialog at just the right times. I would recommend this game, but I recommend only taking side quests when needed in normal and true vault hunter mode."
16784,claptraps mohawk gives me a raging boner
16785,It's borderlands 2...the starter of the popularity of looter shooters
16786,Nice.
16787,very nice
16788,"Play it if you've never played it. One of, if not the best, shooter I've ever played. Also I hate Claptrap but also I love him. basically 10/10 will do a 5th playthrough at some point"
16789,eh didnt really like it too much. but whatever.
16790,can't start my own game if the settings are above low always freezes playing with friends will have lag spikes all the time get it on PS4 it can run it better than a gaming PC. this game is a great game it's just that it is super bad on PC

16798,"One of my favorite childhood games, and it still holds up."
16799,Brilliant 10/10
16800,a timeless classic can be played for hours even without the dlcs but with them this game is truly something special i wish they made games like these now a days
16801,"This is probably the best game ever made, It has super fun combat and makes you feel like the god of this small yet spacious world. Amazing writing and great story. Memorable characters. Whats not to love in this chaos of guns and abilities."
16802,"Borderlands 2 is how you do a proper Looter Shooter!
 It's fun and addicting, and with the good gunplay, and the gameplay loop of getting and finding new powerful weapons and utilities, it never gets old.

But 2 things Borderlands 2 gets right from any of the average and boring Looter Shooters I've played is: The Narrative and it's World.

The Narrative focuses on the new Vault Hunters emerging to find the new Vault that Hyperion has found; a corporation led by Handsome Jack: the so called ""Hero"" of Pandora, he wants to rule Pandora with an iron fist, bringing Peace and Order; By killing every bandit, psycho, midget, marauder, nomad, goliath, and yeah you ""his point', he wants everything that opposes his rule, dead and only dead. And what's interesting is the Antagonist is from their perspective; actually is the good guy, he wants peace and order to Pandora: a planet filled with murder and discord,
And you are just one vault hunter, along with a few bunch from Santuary: the remnants of new haven from the orginal Borderlands, along with Moxxi, Marcus, Zed, Scooter, and etc.
You even get to see the main cast of the first game with:
Roland, Brick, Mordecai And Lilith who help you out and actually plan the fight to Jack himself.
What is interesting is Jack and Hyperion are the civilized goodies, while you and the others on Pandora are the only sane ones who aren't classified as Psychos and etc, but still are by Jack's eyes, and to end him and his rule is to stop peace and order from reaching the Borderlands, They even blame you for anything wrong that happens in the story especially later on when you do something pretty wrong (oof I kinda feel bad for Handsome Jack despite him still enjoying his murder, he's actually human inside! you can feel for him and understand him! this is what makes a good antagonist, you make him/ her compelling and you make their idealogies actually make sense!)

It's interesting that the plot goes that deep into the world of Pandora's idealogies and what happens when order tries to break through to rule it, but at what cost, all of Pandora dead?
The planet destroyed? because of the Warrior deep inside the new vault?
should you stop Jack? or you should you allow him to kill all of the potential and the very little good left of Pandora? 
And I haven't even touched on the world building on how Pandora feels alive thanks to the wonderful and huge colorful enviroments they give to you now, which looked average and dead in the first game or how even the bloody side quests are amazing! and how the stories in them are actually enjoyable and give you more incentive to play them all! and flesh out many returning characters and new ones too!!

Borderlands 2 is one game that suprised me, A looter shooter FPS Open world game with RPG elements sounds great! but if done badly can give you a bad taste in your mouth and leave disappointed (I'm looking at you Destiny *cough*) 
But Borderlands 2 acutally delivers on all fronts!
Good Gameplay, Good Loot, Great and interesting and fun scenarios, Something I forgot to say; Great and a riveting soundtrack and music! An amazing and unique art style and great animation (especially for the cutscenes, good lord the cutscenes are too good!) Actual funny comedy, touching dialogue and intrigue, A memorable and emotional Narrative, A threatening but likable Antagonist, great returning cast of characters that are even more fleshed out, and many more elements that give this game a legendary status in my eyes and many others

This game is unique and is what I've wanted in a videogame in a long long time now

(Also it's not hyper realistic with brownish browns and bad looking graphics which many games from 2012 have and had aged poorly there are exeptions of course, this game has actually aged pretty well, I mean it has a cell shaded, almost comic book and kinda Anime look to it, huh vewy nice)"
16803,best best best
16804,"played this back in 2012,awesome looter and amazing to coop with friends"
16805,"Good game, played this mostly back on my ps3 and completed nearly everything. Great if you love shooters, loot (esp this!) and atmosphere."
16806,"This is easily one of my all time favorite games. Started playing on the 360, moved to pc a few years later. You dont need the dlc to have fun, which is really nice considering how much youll spend to get all the dlc."
16807,"One of the best games out there, Borderlands 2 is an amazing ""Shoot and Loot"" type of game, with violence, explosions and many funny moments, one of the best games I have ever played. 9.5/10"
16808,top fun fps

16815,"After playing for a few hours i realized when people say this game is better then BD3 its really just nostalgic
for them. I came into the game with high hopes hearing how good it was and how bd3 was terrible compared to it but anyone who said that lied don't waste your money on this game its got no content that compares to the third game."

16850,This is a masterpiece !!!
16851,beepboopbop
16852,A must have
16853,"Borderlands 2 is the best game in the series, hands down. Fun and varied classes, a huge world with many sidequests and other stuff to do, lots of easter eggs. The story is probably the best in the series aswell - as Jack is an amazing villain.
Guns have a lot of character, with almost every legendary and unique feeling different and yet fun to use. The class skills give a lot of depth to combat and how you approach enemies.
It also has 5 major dlc's, plus a few more minor ones - that expand on the games world and are definitely worth it.

My only gripes with the game are: endgame can get very repetitive due to how UVHM is balanced - with most builds relying too much on Grog (This can be fixed with the unofficial community patch), Hammerlock's dlc is... kinda garbage, and some endgame content boils down to ""insert a bullet sponge enemy here"".

But overall - one of my favourite games of all time."
16854,Pure badassery.
16855,good game

If you don't enjoy gunplay that can be very mediocre at times, and slowly grinding up to better equipment, only to have to discard a good gun you finally found in exchange for higher dps.... then sure, this is fine with a friend. If I didn't have a co-oper, I would probably have not played it again."
16881,Still an excellent game despite it being released years ago! 10/10 would recommend
16882,somethin somethin wicked
16883,why not
16884,"Short Review, straight to the point :

9/10 - Co-op play with friends
7/10 - Alone
If you have a friend to play with, every penny would be worth it..Trust me :)
"
16885,great looter-shooter to play with a couple of buddies
16886,"To give you the general impression I have of this game, just ONE of my character has over 13 full days of play time on it. Not only did I enjoy this game so much I spent a lot of time playing, I took the time out to fully complete the game, all modes, all quests, every location and challenge. Up until the latest DLC I did also have all the achievements.

The characters, gameplay, style and immense fun this game has is never ending. Even years on I still find myself comping back to the game to enjoy its charms and wonders. If you like some good FPS action with fun, likeable character and even though in some laughs to boot, then this game is one to try."

16889,"AMAZING

16890,"Across platforms and accounts I think the only game I've sunk more hours into clearing and leveling and exploring over and over and over again was WoW, and unlike WoW I don't regret any of that time with this one."
16891,I'm just gonna come clean and say this is one of the best game's I've ever played. The story is fantastic and never gets boring to go trough. Gameplay is amazing (although would recommend skipping OP levels unless you wanna pull your hair off) That comes to my only point. UVHM is grindy as fuck. Now i love that shit just spending hours getting the right gear. But it can be tedious at times. If you can look past that tho i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of just looting and good story
16892,"It's fun.

Satisfying gameplay and nonsensical humour, absolutely brilliant to play with friends and drinks."
16893,good
16894,yea maya is hot
16895,This game ia good
16896,Fun as fuck
16897,"good game, love gambling and being blown up 10/10"
16898,its great :)
16899,"great game, always has been. I would highly recommend borderlands it is a great action packed looter game and is incredible to play singleplayer and with friends, maybe more so better to play with friends but it is not a game that is required to have friends to have fun.

Great things about it: it's got tons of content and different weapons and classes for your own preference, and tons of story and DLC's to complete 

some negatives: some people don't like the art style or graphics and shared loot  so if you are playing with friends or online players be it can be a hassle actually getting loot

now i can sit here breaking down the whole plot but it is usually on sale most of the time and is old so the pricing isn't that bad so honestly just try it for yourself

16908,"Despite appearing like it includes the game + DLC, the bundle does not actually include everything. The final DLC remains a stand alone product and priced at the full $20, because Randy Pitchford needs a new USB stick for his porn collection, or something.

In all seriousness though, this means you are essentially locked out of some endgame stuff that you already bought because its now locked behind a separate paywall."

From the multiple guns, the very funny and witty dialogue, and to the amazingly written characters. Handsome Jack was the first time I actually felt bad for the villain in a video game, and even today he's my favorite villain due to how fucking funny he is. Great game, and would heavily recommend buying it.

P.S- I know I don't have a lot of hours on steam, but on the xbox I have in total around 500~ hours"

16966,"good
"
16967,masterpiece
16968,gud geim
16969,"Best of the series, the loot,the shoot, the story, the characters. It's all pretty good and 4 player co-op just adds to it. 8/10"
16970,Better than BL3
16971,I don't know why but for me I'm having trouble with skiff the game starts up it off and starts up offline when I try and go online and goes into this shift Loop where it says creating online assessment or assistance something other than that I really enjoy the game I just wish I could figure out how to make that stop and now I'm about to try and play with someone of my friends and try and see if the ship Loop. For a minute at least stopped long enough for me to play
16972,You can't eat a frog
16973,Perfection.
16974,epic
16975,"Easily my favorite game of all time, I've replayed through its main story about 20 times now. Handsome jack is one of, if not the best video game villain of all time. The game is fun and replayable, however I will say Late game is horribly balanced so I would find myself just making a new save file instead of continuing to play at the higher OP levels. This game is a must play for fans of Looter Shooters, and if you aren't, you should still play it, it's amazing."
16976,"Hey Gamers, i have a question for all of you. So I was downloading this game and my PC froze while it was downloading. So i did what I thought was a good idea and decided to turn of my PC. and when I loaded it back up and try re-downloading it all it wants to say is error. I've tried uninstalling it and then re-downloading it and it still says the same thing. So the next step I did was I refunded my purchase, and then i redownloaded it again and it is still coming up with the same problem. Can someone help me please. I really enjoy playing this game and I just need some help. Thanks."
16977,Don't give Randy your money. He'll make it all greasy.
16978,The jokes are dope. Should definitely try it out!
16979,"Quick list based off of my experiences with this franchise (Best->Worst):
1. Borderlands 2
2. Borderlands 3
3. Borderlands the Pre-Sequel 
4. Borderlands

With that out of the way, Borderlands 2 is a looter-shooter which doesn't take itself to seriously while having amazing characters. The main villain, space-Bezos, is a funny, well-written character with more depth than he has any right to. Overall, this is a really great game which I would recommend to anyone remotely interested in the genre."

16981,very cool
16982,"10/10

16983,
16984,The replayability of this game is amazing.  Storyline and dialogue are a treat.
16985,"So after getting 100% of the achievements of the game, having 157 hours in the game, and doing all this since 2nd of March, I think its review time. I bought the game in the handsome collection, together with bl1 and the pre-sequel. after I ended bl1, I started in bl2. At first I closed the game in no time, because the way they designed the hud was something I did not like. After relaunching, I started to get used to it. The grind started when completing the first playthrough, and i completed the second one pretty fast after. The fact that you could replay the game, made that you could understand some parts of the story better, because you know how they end. It does sometimes get a bit bored, which is why I started a new character which I been playing with together with a friend. Going thru the game with some1 else does make it more fun. Currently im on the grind to the mighty level 80. Currently im at 60, so I got much to finish yet, but so far I definetily enjoyed the game. Some additions you had in bl1 like replaying echo logs, are missing in bl2, but overal a good, fun game with a nice storyline. 

Hopefully this review helped you in case you are thinking about buying the game, or just enjoyed reading it."
16986,bom!
16987,This game is really fun and I played it with a few mates of mine
16988,B2 is a visual and comedic treat. A great way to pass the time. I should know... I'm about to start my fifth playthrough.
16989,gg
16990,Loved every single minutes playing this game.
16991,Funni deathtrap go brr
16992,"the game is a fucking masterpiece its better in  every way than the third game in the series and the pre sequel is fucking boring mess (which is unrelated to  bl2 but i wanted to mention that) there enough side content as in dlc head skins and shit like that and bl2 is replayable and holds up TODAY and did mention legendaries and fucking CRYSTALS BABY (unrelated i created a psycho impression just  for fun i was thinking to go to gearbox and ask for role in  later years)
"
16993,"Bruh, It's a whole vibe! I can't even begin to explain how fvking great gearbox's creation is!"

17000,"This game is just so much fun. I just played it for the first time and now i can't stop. So much depth and variation. Sad thing is tho, there's almost never somebody to play with. I wish there was a PVP arena or something. Im thinking a kind of moba with the campaign setup."
17001,Absolutely EXPLOSIVE gameplay.
17002,its gud
17003,Good game. It's a classic. really fun to blast baddies in the face.
17004,Amazing game! What else there to say about it other than that?
17005,good
17006,"BL1: great game, but a bit outdated and has a disappointing ending. 
BL2: BADASS game. 
BL TPS: decent game, but poor writing and is way too easy for solo."
17007,gid
17008,"Bought Handsome pack, It supposed to have all content, but Demon of Greed is everywhere nowadays..they left one DLC OUT of pack....and I would like to know WHY? it was published at 2019 so it is ancient history.

Very stupid. Put it in pack and raise pack price a bit...NOT 15€..since value of that DLC (lilth and commander) is lower than that, since Borderlands 3 is out."
17009,fuck me daddy this game is so good please owner make me cum rn
17010,So many GUNS. I played it solo and it was still a blast.
17011,Very easy to play and has a great multiplayer mode
17012,"GOTTA SAY, IT'S REALLY CATCHY AND REALLY GOOD, THE STORY IS SIMPLE BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS GAME ISN'T, NOT RECCOMENDING IF YOU HAVE WORK/FAMILIES, THIS GAME TAKES OVER YOUR LIFE! my gf told me to play less and i think she's right."

17016,this game is alright but whenever i want to play with my friends these FUNNY GUYS just want to turn on ownage pranks and completely fucking ignore the entire games premise like my god i just wnat to beat the SECOND BOSS but noooo we have to play ownage pranks poop ikn the chicken chinese restaraunt prank MAN im gonna lose it dude god
17017,"One of the best shooters out there for sure, too much content to play, too much weapons to use. I just don't recommend playing UVH mode since it's poorly balanced, you have to slag every single enemy in order to do damage, so it starts to get boring after some time, remember you don't have to be max level in order to have fun."
17018,"Better with friends, or family."
17019,Amazing game that I've played many times over and would play again.
17020,"Ok so I have played this game as torrented version (yes I know shame on me but at that time I didn't had enough money to get this game), but goddamn to play it thru again is nothing more but awesome.

Why I absolutely love this game:
- Game sometimes gets infuriating but I love the game to pieces;
- Gives good amount of jumpscares when monsters spawn without a single warning beforehand, resulting in me shouting or mumbling in most weirdest voices that I can muster up to the enjoyment of my bf;
- The OST of game is just really awesome;
- Visuals even on trashy old PC and on low settings are still gorgeous;
- THE MEME SHOTGUN IN GAME IS FORKING DOPE;

On less enthusiastic side I don't exactly know what's bad with game. Maybe occasional overannoyance and overabundance of certain monsters that just don't allow player to back away and swarm player, making him/her to waste ammo on dealing with pesky monsters like Varkids/Rakks/Skags etc.

Anyway game is just awesome and I definitelly recommend playing thru it."

However, since then the Linux port has been abandoned, without functioning cross-platform multiplayer, or the more recent updates/expansions.


The game can be made to work okay in Proton (with some frustrating crashing issues - I suggest disabling the HD textures), but I cannot recommend the game in it's current state."

17130,"When I played BL 2, I just couldn't stop to be honest. Awesome characters, awesome story, just pure ecstasy. You don't wanna do the story missions? No problem! Just go shoot some skags or bandits. It can be hard at some point, especially from the start, but when you get used to the mechanics and you get some better weapons, it will go SMOOTHLY as a knife through the butter. 

Not gonna lie, every game has something bad to it. Borderlands? It's kinda unbalanced between you and your enemies, at least in my opinion. 

But after all? This game is fantastic. Counting all the DLCs and side missions, you'll have something to play for at least 100 hours."

Review: Good."
17150,"One of the best games ive ever played, its huge and loads of freeroam and missions there is always things to do, its also very cheap for what you get and almost every pc can run it."
17151,"It runs on quite low-end systems these days but the visual style has aged well due to being cell shaded.  Whether you want to just play the campaigns or sink a couple hundred hours into the endgame...  It has it's flaws but it's still a good game.

I recommend the Game of the Year pack (or even the Handsome Collection).
"
17152,good
17153,"Great game. Has aged very well (played in 2021). Graphics and gameplay are great, even by modern standards. Can't believe this game was released so long ago now..."
17154,"I bought this on PS3, PS4, PC. Yes Borderlands 3 have better gun play and things (not the story, BL3 story is garbage, I can't believe Gearbox developed Brothers in Arms series), but it's boring! Just buy the handsome collection instead (BL2, BLTPS + [ALL DLC]) for even cheaper price than BL3.

If you've never been exposed to BL games before, it's a game where majority of people is nice to you, and each other. Open up your game privacy to public and you can have fun together, and maybe they'll help you power level, and drop tons of awesome legendary loots!! I met the nicest dudes I've ever known in gaming history on this game either on PS4 or PC. God bless their kind hearts."

While the writing is indeed VERY 2012 the game itself is actually fantastic, great meaty combat great music and while the characters aren't all great I do really like them, I very much enjoyed this game in the first playthrough i've had in 40 hours and I plan on playing more.

However I wish there was melee weapons.

17183,great game!!
17184,"After around 8.5 years I've finally decided to review Borderlands 2. I have exactly 344 hours and am currently doing what will probably be my final playthrough of this game. Ultimately, I MUST recommend this game. I spent so much time with it and it's an entry in one of my favorite series of all time. It's my 2nd most played steam game.

However, this game has aged like milk. It feels horrendous to play. I cannot stand playing it anymore and now that i'm doing a marathon of each mainline game in the series, I have to say this is the weakest entry from a GAMEPLAY perspective.

In traditional steam review fashion, I'd like to highlight the pros and cons of the game (and some dlc) in comparison to other games in the series.

PROS:

Class complexity and skill trees
Coming off of Borderlands 1 this game features MUCH more robust skills trees. Each character can be built in multiple different ways rather than having a ""Best"" build that you wouldnt want to switch up too much. Beyond that, every character has a fun action skill feels good to press unlike say, Mordecai the Hunter in the first game who simply threw a bird at his enemies often to little effect or Roland the Soldier who threw a turret that could only shoot in one direction whereas in this game Axton the Commando has a turret capable of full 360 degree coverage, can stick to walls and ceiling, and fire NUKES. Also, the DLC classes are great.

Setting Variety
Borderlands 1 has a lot of shitty Brown areas. This game has that too but also some shitty GREEN areas and some Industrial Areas and a Volcano. This really speaks for itself. You wont be staring and Brown Wasteland for 90% of the game.  It has a timeless artstyle and that's really nice.

That's where the fun ends

CONS:

Gun Variety
In an attempt to make every Gun manufacturer feel ""unique"" they made some of them just straightup unfun or annoying to use. All Torque weapons fire these slow-moving explosive rounds that you have to lead with. Leading is fine! just git gud! They all feel the same and that sucks. All Hyperion weapons now feature a mechanic that makes them extremely inaccurate when you first start shooting and the aim improves as you hold down the fire button. This is novel for about 20 minutes and annoying at best after hundreds of hours. Dahl weapons burst-fire when you aim down sight. Don't like burst fire? Just ignore a whole set of guns. All Tediore weapons are grenades and consume all of the ammo in your magazine when reloaded. You ever do that thing where you reload even after you fire 5% of your magazine? Tediore weapons are gonna bother you.

Legendary drops and imbalance
Legendaries are really exciting when they drop. They're the strongest guns after all. Well...sometimes maybe. Some blues are better...and some quest items. In Borderlands 1 and 3 legendary guns will drop from any source. You can find a legendary in a trashcan if you're lucky. Borderlands 2 scraps that idea and requires you to kill certain bosses for certain legendaries. There's no more excitement to killing random enemies on your way to a boss or quest marker. If you want that cool Hyperion legendary shotgun you have to kill a certain boss for it. Hopefully the boss will drop it that is. You might have to farm him for a couple minutes or hours. Furthermore, some of the best guns in the game are just random blue weapons like Sand Hawk. The Sand Hawk is a simple quest reward near the end of a DLC campaign. There's no fun in obtaining this item. You just get it and if it's not the Sand Hawk you want, you complete that same quest OVER AND OVER.

Class Balance
Remember when I said the classes were great WELL I LIED (not really) but some classes simply have a harder time in later difficulties than others especially when playing solo. This is due to the worst part of Borderlands 2. Here it comes

SLAG
This is the worst thing in this game. This is what kills it for me the most. The game is piss easy the first time you head through it. After beating the campaign you unlock True Vault Hunter mode and later Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. Playing on these high difficulties almost REQUIRES the use of this element if you value your time at all. You need to cover an enemy in this purple slime before switching to a different gun to actually kill it. No gun feels valuable because you need an enemy to be purple before you kill it or you'll be shooting them forever. Certain classes like the Gunzerker or Siren can apply slag with little issue others such as the Assassin or Psycho will need you to switch weapons everytime you want to kill an enemy effectively and it just slows the game to an tedious crawl.

I want to still love this game so much but I just can't. You should play it. Once. Probably.

Borderlands 1 AND 3 are better. Yeah I said it."

17241,BORDERLNDS 2 IS AWSOME SO MUCH LOOT ACEVMENTS AND SIDE QUEST TO DO OVERALL BORDERLANDS 2 IS WORTH YOUR MONEY SO MUCH OPEN WORLD SPACE EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME INVISIBLE WALLS HERE AND THERE IT STILL MAKES YOU THINK :WOW THEY PUT ALOT OF WORK INTO THIS: SO YEA MY OPINION OP BL2 10/10
17242,p
17243,verr good
17244,ive been playing this game for 4 years and have yet got bored over 1500 hours on my ps4
17245,really enjoyed the game flow. Fun to do multiplayer as well. I like this game.
17246,ye
17247,Fun game.
17248,"Thought I wrote a review for this game, but I guess now. My playtime should speak for itself. Good writing, a great villain, memorable characters, general lunacy and strangeness, RNG loot that makes many boxes exciting to open, solid co-op options and tons of DLC for a rich post-game after the story is done. It is absolutely worth every penny if you like looter shooters or it looks interesting. One of my favorite games ever!"
17249,Still just as fun and iconic as when it came out
17250,is good. but if you play gunzerker your a beta male
17251,VERY GOOD
17252,This kept me entertained for hours.
17253,"good game, buy when cheap. too much dlc tho"
17254,"Played through multiple runs back on 360 and some on xbone, was fun enough with some friends but the gameplay is just shoot and loot, gets old and repetitive, the story was at least better than the first which was almost nothing, even though its still cringe. 

Still this game was never that good, even 3 is still meh. Gunplay is bout all it has going for it."
17255,"9 years and multiple DLCs later, it's still buggy. Just wasted two hours trying to get an enemy unstuck from terrain so I could kill it to progress further...feels bad man. Skip the grind and save your money."
17256,funfunfun
17257,Amazing multiplayer platform! Truly seamless gameplay.
17258,Nice!
17259,boderlands is my top 3 fav games recommend
17260,Best Borderlands
17261,this is the best fps shooter i have ever played
17262,"I like that all weapons are unique but despite level and rarity, some are much better than others."
17263,Great Co-Op game
17264,"Ah, here we go again. Meh, not really. As soon as you start the game, it instantly becomes familiar when moving around in the game is nearly the same as the first Borderlands. I knew it would be easier and boy was I wrong. Again.

The game starts out really easy but it gets harder. It got hard for me when I first encountered Buzzards. I hated these enemies the worst. The way they can fly above you and shoot at you and getting your health down quickly, I was raging and figured out one important aspect of this game, that is, to anticipate enemies and their special abilities. Even if you were two levels above the enemies' level, it was still a little challenging. If you can figure out their weakness, which elements in the environment you can use against them, the game obviously becomes easier. I didn't do this in my first half of this play through. I still had a great time doing all the side quests and the rewards that came with it.

First thing I hated about the game and it really annoyed the hell outta me and it was the reloading time. There is no reason the reloading should take such a long time! It's like my character does it all purpose just to try and piss me off. I wasted a lot of my skill points and tokens just to get it a little faster so I don't die when I'm trying to kill of tough enemies. Why does it take so long, seriously? Second is some of the bad map designs. I had a hard time getting around some of them. There was one part in one of the maps where you need to use a vehicle to jump down a gated town. Had I not played this game consistently, I wouldn't never remembered how to get inside the town with a vehicle. Not that big of a deal because some people like to get lost and explore, so I'm still on the fence about it. Well, that's pretty much what I hated most about the game was the ridiculously hard enemies. I still love the game. It's weird how that works out.

The ending for Borderlands 2 wasn't as exciting as the ending in the first game. I expected to be just as epic but it wasn't even hard. In fact, in my opinion, it was the easiest boss in the game. It was alright.

Overall, yes, Borderlands is still a REALLY awesome game series! 5/5"
17265,"FUN BL3 FUNER
"
17266,"A very good game, Played it alot on the PS3 and over all a very good game."
17267,This game sucks

17284,"Loot and Loot and Loot and Loot and Shoot.

Still my favorite out of all the Borderlands games. I could never finish 1. The mechanics were too unpolished, the plot was near non-existent, and the humor just hadn't reached its polish yet. The Pre-sequel seemed to rest a little too much on 2's laurels. Admittedly, I never got around to 3. 

Either way. If you can find some friends to run this game with you, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better multiplayer shooter experience. That said. If you're running this solo, you might want to look elsewhere. A LOT of the magic is lost in singleplayer. It's still functional, but you miss out on some of the zaniness and some of the later levels can be really punishing without team revives.

The writing is hilarious, the mechanics are crunchy and satisfying, and the damage numbers get to Disgaea tier ridiculousness at high levels. Hell. You don't even need to shoot guns. Most classes have perfectly good melee builds. Handsome Jack is one of my favorite video game villains. In any other story, he'd be the hero, but here he fits the role of villain to a tee. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying he's ""secretly a good guy"" like some opinions. He's a bastard and a sociopath, but the game does a good job of setting up his ideals and goals and making them seem semi-reasonable before he acts like a cackling Snidely Whiplash tier of cartoony evil. He's fun to hate, basically.

Some of the writing has aged a little poorly here, but most of the jokes still land decently. And you'll definitely want to be here primarily for this game's weird dark humor. 

Overall, a very fun experience."
17285,bad ending
17286,Just Hilarious & Addictive

17320,"I enjoyed playing the game in Co-op. In singleplayer, not so much, but it still is a great game, which everyone knows for its brutality, humour and variety. Variety meant in the characters, guns and maps as well perhaps. I didn't mean the game's re-playability however, because the story is always exactly the same, with some minor choices here and there. I don't exactly like the concept of ""starting the game all over again but the numbers are bigger"", so re-playing it wasn't an option for me, but I do like to revisit the game from time to time. 
Also wanted to mention, even though I played and finished the game first time not so long ago (2019), I have still built some nostalgic feeling for the game regardless."

17342,Everyone loves this game.
17343,"Great gunplay, well balanced characters and skill trees (except for gaige), very fun playing through, and especially with friends. the side quests are some of the most enjoyable parts, and being able to go off and do whatever is very enjoyable. however, at endgame, there are like 10 viable weapons, and its very difficult, and unbalanced. there are probably only 2 builds per character that work. overall, 9.5/10, due to endgame balance, but thats just me."
17344,4000+ hours need i say more? the best fun run n gun with great story line and easter eggs/ quirks/ pop culture references
17345,"10 things i love about the Borderlands 2 Game


1. Grenades -  the bonus package 10x times the fun 
 electric chair death by electric chair as capital punishment  , 
antifection burn baby burn 


2  music ( flamerock refuge ) has the sound and tone that's very similar to the animated tv show The Legend Of Korra 
the feeling i get when walking around or idling near the center of the town


3. graphics - the cel-shaded graphics 
more the legend of zelda:  breath of the wild-like games is much needed


4. guns -  unicornsplosion is like my little pony you know that show filled with sparkles , glamorous and colors

5. bosses - handsome jack you love him and hate him at the same time
the type of evil villian looking like aizen from the anime tv show Bleach

6. quest -  the claptrap's apprentice ,   grandma flexington story ,  shoot this guy in the face 


7.  shields - flame of the firehawk = beast mode , the bee shield  = a killer bee 


8.  characters - i like all of them each with their own personality and traits


9. classes - 4 commando = 8  
let's getting the killing sweatheart + Nuke


10. locations - all of the places in tiny tina's assault on dragon keep dlc
it always takes my breath away the atmosphere ,  the life and how haunted is it
meet me in the woods tonight"

Oh, to be young again, to be able to dump hours and hours of time into a meaningless but fun distraction with family and friends.... It's a good game, bye."

From the snarky comments and often hilarious dialogue, to the multiplayer and gun play you might just find yourself playing this game for hours on end, I know I have. The story is well done, nothing too terribly amazing, and the world building is amazing, the characters are well made with intriguing backstories. The story is one of tragedy and sacrifice, of course you wouldn't notice if you only looked at the protagonists but who can blame you for not paying attention when you have loot to find! All in all, I'd say this game is well worth the price and I can recommend it if you enjoy shoot-n-loot games with well written story if you care to look. Also the art style reminds me of the old comic books I used to snatch from my dad's stash, the kinds with super heroes and such not scantly clad women."
17377,best
17378,best game ever
17379,"God tier game, my only complaint is that the only funny character is Krieg."

17389,"There's a Pimento Taco in the glove box
"
17390,"I find this game to be one of my favorites overall. The gameplay, when combined with the story, create a great game that I recommend to anyone new to the series. While the game is old, it's unique style allow players to not feel like age is a detracting factor. Good luck with the raid bosses. Also, replay factor is great, which is important because you have to replay 3+ times lol.

17391,"Best out of the series I think objectively. Great story, genuinely funny, and great gunplay. 10/10 play if you somehow havent yet"
17392,"""I HAVE THE SHINIEST MEAT BICYCLE!!!""- KRIEG"
17393,fun looter and shooter
17394,"very nice time sink and mind-degrading game, highly recommended.
stay away from power lines after exposure of more than 40h."
17395,"Good Game Good Loot
"
17396,fun game and meaningful
17397,"A fun little co-op shooter to play with your friends. I wouldn't recommend this if you plan on playing solo, however. It's not a particularly good RPG, nor a particularly good shooter. Think Diablo with guns and virtually no active abilities. The humor is... mixed? They go for more of a 'fire off enough jokes and SOMETHING will be funny' kind of approach, so... your enjoyment will vary from mission to mission."
17398,"One thing to say: “Bring me a bucket, and I’ll show you a bucket!”"
17399,One of the best
17400,super cool
17401,great
17402,nice
17403,"Very fun looter shooter, good to play with friends, yet the boss fight system isn't all that great, but don't let that discourage you as this game is still fantastic and deserving of it's user rating."
17404,best game ever
17405,Brilliant and Classic Game
17406,epic
17407,This game is amazing! Me and my friend used to play it everyday years ago and we decided to buy it again and it was a great idea because this game is just so loveable and its very addictive which I love!
17408,it cool
17409,"This game is TIMELESS. There are so many ways to play, so many characters and guns to mix and match and lastly, the community is the best gaming community I've ever been able be a part of."
17410,hot and sexy game
17411,cod but more guns i think?
17412,love game play it
17413,Its borderlands 2 what can i honestly say that havent been said? It's just a great game and if you haven't played it yet get your buddys together and do it. Pretty sure you can find it super cheap somewhere online as well
17414,this game is awesome get it now
17415,"Thanks for ruining multiplayer. After the Shift patch the multiplayer isn't working because I'm stuck on creating online session loop. This game was awesome. If you want to play with friends you should avoid this game. I never ever had problems with Steam servers but Shift is totally garbage. And again, thanks for ruining the multiplayer..."
17416,Timeless classic imho.
17417,sick
17418,"Multiplayer could never be made to work with friends.  We tried LAN based plan, it said we had incompatible versions even though we verified all the exe versions.  Online play through Steam could never be made to work either.   Gearbox apparently has no clue how to make multiplayer work- it's OK if you just want to do single player, but don't even pretend you'll be able to play any multiplayer at all."

17422,"I am absolutely NOT the FPS type of guy but man... this game rocks.

- Bad language
- Incredible amount of guns
- Fun missions
- Super characters (NPC or not)

But also the great community. People in here are great with noobs like me.

So yeah,  I'll go pew pew pew some Nomads now."
17423,Its one of the best games ever made
17424,"Have fun shooting popcorn out of cereal boxes and looking through PNGs, losers."
17425,One of my favorite games ngl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

17442,aWESOME GAME...  BEST VILLAIN EVER
17443,"My first video game (when it was on ps3). Super fun looter shooter, blow people's heads off, playing with friends is exciting! Very comic like"
17444,Easily my favorite of the franchise.
17445,simply an awesome coop shooter with epic npcs
17446,"GOOD HAGA AG<<ME

"
17447,Yes
17448,No replayablity what so ever
17449,I'm enjoying the game - and I generally dislike games that have leveling systems. The world-building is pretty good and characters are entertaining. Have had fun in both solo and co-op modes.
17450,get it. now.
17451,gr8
17452,Loot. Shoot. BLOODSPLOSION!!!
17453,"You shoot stuff with guns, stuff explodes, you get more powerful guns, all while following a great storyline with some of the best jokes a video game can provide. What more do you need."
17454,is fun
17455,just get it vault hunter
17456,i like it
17457,this game is awesome. even this much time after it's release.
17458,"bängeri
"
17459,Nice game with lots of humour. Variety in guns and builds give plenty of replayability.
17460,Playing this in 2021 solo. It's still holds up incredibly well and if you've got buddies even better.
17461,yes
17462,real borderlands
17463,"It's fun, repeatable story and the only game I can bear farming for ages in (and it's usually relatively cheap)."
17464,"after the writing massacre that is Borderlands 3, this game is still a safe haven for those who liked the series.

Late game can be pretty tedious though with mandatory slag usage"
17465,i have hepatitis c and chlamydia now please help fund this shit
17466,Nice game to play with friends
17467,best
17468,"Absolutely buy this game if you have not played it before.  We own this on PS3, Xbox one, and 5 different PC builds. You will not be disappointed.  There is a LOT of game here for the buck, especially if you get it on a 2k sale.  The story is great, the gameplay is fun, and you can have millions of different guns!  You can play with other people or friends or family.  We just beat it again in about 41 hours, but there is still a ton of content to go back and explore.  You also have all the DLC's and Headhunter packs after the main game."
17469,games supa heat
17470,Addictive game

17476,big peen gang play this
17477,gun shoot yes
17478,Fan flipping tastic
17479,"its a awesome game to play with your friends, it still holds up now, art style is timeless, the writing is gold, and the gameplay is hecka fun. it can get grinding at time, but thats always a choice, if that's not your cup of tea there's plenty of unique and fun quests to go on. its also a great game to play alone but it shines with friends"
17480,"Borderlands 2 is not fun in my opinion. The first game took a great concept and had a fun story and was short and sweet and didn't stay over its welcome, but the second game is sluggishly long. 

While trying to enjoy the story I am sucked into mandatory side quests where I need to find audio logs that are basically jokes that fall flat, or I need to kill some reskinned bandits that I've killed 100+ times before. 

The game gets boring after awhile and any originality that was once fun and interesting fades away into mindless shooting.

I have come across several bugs that i never have before, such as not being able to complete quests because assets don't spawn in or quest oriented objects being under the map. 

I bought the borderlands series as a collection at a good price so I feel forced to finish this game along with the other two, from what I have seen Borderlands 3 is supposedly worse than this so I am not looking forward to it."
17481,"quests, writing and story is great, but it's hidden behind all the grinding and repetitive boring combat. the combat is really bad, it's just keep shooting and running away and mindlessly looting, i wish more complemented the great writing in this game"
17482,Why are you not playing this right now?!
17483,eh this game is pretty neet
17484,Good
17485,"Never wrote a review before but this game is just the Bees-Knees! 

Trust Baz Luhrmann on the Suncreen, and IndianaJonas on having a good gaming time playing this game. BO2 will be the Gem of your library. Hasta la Sanctuaria mis Amigos!"
17486,This game is a classic and is the best looter. Even Better with Reborn and community patch.
17487,"One of the best coop games imo.
loads n loads n loads of guns to loot, a lot of PEWPEWPEW and BOOM and stuff like that."
17488,Easily one of the best games of all time

17499,"Story Mode is good, can get repetitive, but overall, 8/10
first shooter on point, guns are a lot of fun, and blowing everything up is a bonus. :)
clap trap can shut up just only sometimes...
"
17500,The writing is all randomly generated memes from 2009 reddit but at least the gameplay is fun.
17501,this game money
17502,"Part 2 in the Borderlands franchise. Shit yea! I've always got good things to say about these games.

Do me a favor, do it, do it."

17505,"awful writing lol, play borderlands 1 instead."
17506,a lot of stuff to do. and better with friends.
17507,"Replayed (again) in 2021. Still holds up with a lot of fun and awesome dialogues. I played BL1 when it came out and the other titles each early as well. BL2 with its DLCs, mostly Tiny Tina's, draws me back ever so often. Pre-Sequel and 3 don't as much."
17508,dababy
17509,"This game hooked my pretty quickly, and I was suprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, as I bought the handsome jack collection for £3"
17510,"Without exaggeration, this is my favorite game that I played. The story line is at the highest level, character customization, complete freedom of action, madness and fun. Who has not played, be sure to buy and enjoy, you will not regret it, I assure you."
17511,"didn't play much on steam but i have like 400 hours in other platforms 

the game is a fucking masterpiece and has one of the best antagonists i've ever seen on a videogame 

that's a 10/10 game right here"
17512,Siemrpe genial 2K
17513,"childhood game, worth"
17514,one of the best games 3ver

17528,just get it
17529,its a great co op shooter with lots of bosses and side quests

The bad: Not super fun when solo. Some of the jokes really suck. The music can be repetitive.
Overall: great with the bois"
17536,I lik
17537,fun game
17538,"Play this game. If for nothing else, play it for the Villain. Every thing about him makes the game so much more immersive."
17539,The graphics originally put me off at first glance but the game play and story line are fantastic and all concerns  I had about the graphics were left far behind.
17540,cool
17541,"You know it, I know it.

17551,Awesome!
17552,Borderlands 2 is the best game available for Linux ... so far
17553,"Love the gameplay and different options for how to play the game through different characters, weapons, skills, etc.  Lots to do as well, even after the story mode is complete.  Definitely one of my go to games!"
17554,One of the best games ive played in years. I highly recommend.

17565,yeah
17566,banger game
17567,"Click heads,have fun ,collect guns and be sad because of some parts of the story ."
17568,"I LOVE this game. I remember getting it on xbox live gold back in 2017 and falling in love with the game. Beating normal mode the same month and a month later reaching level 50 and then getting the dlc and reaching 72 and op 8. I FINALLY got the handsome jack collection and im currently on my first ever playthrough of krieg. (Only dlc i got before were the main 4, marcus headhunter, and up to level 72 and op 8.) If you want a fun loot n shooter HERE IT IS. 10/10 game Great story, great humor, great characters, great writing."
17569,The story is very compelling and the mechanics are easy to understand. The one thing I dislike is the map.
17570,best looter shooter
17571,One of the best  games with incredible replay value and classic loot reward system.
17572,"ok now i may have refunded it but only because i have it on my switch but MY GOD THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE!!! borderlands 1 was ok but 2 just absolutely blew me away. If you never played this game play it story took me like 40 hours to beat and there are a lot of guns. I love this game and all of the other ""shooter looter"" titles were inspired by this game. 10/10 just amazing."
17573,love
17574,"One of the best games ive ever played
forget BL3, this is the real shiny gem!
played this game about 4 times i guess
get the dlc, all of them.
story is good, gameplay is good, characters is good, all is good"
17575,AMAZING
17576,"In honor of finally reaching 200h on Steam, I figured this would be a good time as any to finally do a review on Borderlands 2. 
I still remember watching the trailer for the first time almost 10 years ago when I was still a wee lad. And to this day, I can still remember that jingle for Short Change Hero
Nostalgia asides, surprisingly this game has aged quite well and still by far my favourite game of the series. The Borderlands series as a whole can pretty much be summed up as Diablo but with guns - practically spawned the Looter shooter subgenre. But BL2 itself with its charm, an almost quite indescribable unique flair and execution, along with arguably one of video game's most entertaining antagonist, created, in my mind and my childhood inner self, the best first person shooter ever.
And here's to many more hours.
P.S: would highly recommend getting the entire Handsome Jack Collection for the optimal full experience"
17577,"this is always going to be the best boderlands game. i really recommend it, its just so damn fun"
17578,"Wait for sale.


Would rate again"
17579,GUNS
17580,"I have played many more hours than 45, I played through the entire game on my PS4. It is a really good game, and very socially aware. 
I love the art style, and the gameplay is amazing"
17581,its 2021 everything sucks but this game helps me forget the pain of reality
17582,"amazing, enough said"
17583,Beautiful art and characters design
17584,"I didn't play this game when i first got it but when one of my friends started playing I decided I would give it a try and after beating it, I can definitely say it was worth the time. I can't really think of a time when the game got boring. I really enjoyed the range that the heaviness of subjects went through throughout the game, from characters joking around to people dying. Get it, It's better than Cyberpunk, anyways."
17585,it a beri borken game
17586,s
17587,"Haha niceeee.
Fun for the entire family!"
17588,"10/10 played again & again, dont buy borderlands 3 it was terrible but this game instead. way more replay value"

17590,"Lots of bloody, violent fun.  The PCs from the first game return as NPCs to help you on your fight against a villian you love to hate to love.  Would play this again.  Have played this again.  Will keep playing it again."
17591,addicting
17592,Played on xbox getting back into the game and I still love it
17593,Fun.
17594,Very Fun game one of the best games ever made
17595,good game makes me wet
17596,"Yes! Yes! Buy the game! It's really cool to play with friends! Really interesting lore ( if that's a thing you really consider) and characters.
I played this entire game on stream, and you should do it too if you stream as well, but apart from streaming, in terms of mechanics, you have a solid rotaion of loot. You have plenty of guns, which  have different abilities and elements, which generates randomly through out your playthrought.

4 out of 5 game.
Really recommend it!"
17597,"lol
"
17598,"The game continues off from the previous story of Borderlands (the original) with some homage of the pre-sequel. So if you don't play it, that's ok, however a lot of the story emotions may be lost to you in concerns of the OG characters. 

In terms of game-play, it is extremely similar but otherwise cookie-cut of its predecessors. If you are new, hello and please make yourself at home with these casual but entertaining battles. For our resident veterans, you aren't missing out if you choose to skip out the game, but you would be missing build-up to Borderlands 3. 

Note: don't rush to get a DLC bundle. Some are packed with content, others aren't so much. However the majority of the stories (if I recall correctly) happen post-game, and are in no way adding value to the main game apart from some skins and guns you get from DLC.

Overall, a nice casual game featuring some morbid/dark humour."
17599,brilliant game
17600,farmed tubby's for 4 hours and i didnt even get my class mod 10/10
17601,best in the series
17602,"Fantastic game...sooo addictive. Got B3 free with a GPU, so decided to play the previous games in the series. Still on B2 UVHM and 296 hours in...lol. I'm sure I'll get onto B3 at some point....
This game is highly recommended"
17603,ver nais
17604,"Fucking amazing game. All characters are memorable, great variety of weapons, unique artstyle, EXPLOSIONS. Game easily for hundereds hours. Definitely try playing with friends."
17605,"gameplay is good and even the co.op, there's a lot of story missions and optional missions, replayable, i already finished this game 3 times and i'm still playing it over and its still fun. So buy the game i assure you it'll worth it and a lot more if you're playing with a friend or someone."

17635,yeah its alright
17636,"Very fun and enjoyable game, it's an older game but it has tons of replayability and loads of content especially with the DLCs."

17638,Is pretty good
17639,Handsome Jack is best girl fight me
17640,great
17641,"One of the better designed FPS's of the year. Can be a bit slow and discouraging in the early game, but the mid-game action makes up for it."
17642,Great
17643,this is genuinely the most fun multiplayer cooperative shooter. it's up there with left 4 dead 2 but it's so much fun to just not have to think about anything and just braindead killing. if you have a group of 3 other people to play this then i highly recommend this game.
17644,one of the bestest games of all time
17645,"It's hands down one of the most fun-filled, immersive games ever put together in our lifetime. Worth every penny."

17648,fun
17649,put some time in it
17650,amazing game<3
17651,yes
17652,Shoot da guy or da guy shoot you pretty epic with gaming buddies 10/3
17653,"Meh, it's a good game, don't get me wrong, but I can't really bring myself to do a proper run of this game.
But I also dislike FPS as a genre in general, so take my opinion with a pinch of salt.
Handsome jack gets a trophy though, great antagonist!"
17654,cool
17655,Rooty Tooty Point and Shooty™
17656,Beautiful crazy. If you like looter shooter you should really play it. Has many things to offer and it won't get boring.
17657,NNNNice
17658,robot sucks
17659,8/10
17660,"Really deep game when the bandit said ""IM GONNA RIP YOUR TOENAILS OFF"" i felt that"
17661,borderlands 3 is probably the worst game in the series thank you that is all.
17662,"It will always have a special place in my heart.
I went into the game without knowing anything about it after I purchased it for 8€ on sale and later purchased the Handsome Collection for 5€. I am very happy that I did because I had such a great time and fell in love with the world and characters as with their incredidbly silly jokes while it all had a very serious dreary overtone. The game achieves everything it wants and because of the rather simple gameplay and graphics it has a retro style that perfectly conveys the abstraction of this franchise while making it seem funny and sad at the same time. The stroy and world are connected deeply, what makes it feel very authentic. The soundtrack is very supportive and brings a lot of atmosphere, starting right at the start of the game. It is a bleak tale but because everyone knows and accepts that it gives you a feel of refuge. 

If you care about money wait for sale and if you care about the DLCs check out the Handsome Collection. Besides I hope you will have a great time and that this game appeals to you."
17663,it is fun

17665,"Don't like the current character's playstyle? Sure, no problems. You just need to restart the game from the very beginning including the tutorial. That's the exact message this game is sending to you given its rather vague description of the playstyle of each character. I was lucky not to purchase any DLC along with it as I had given up replaying enough times just to experience each character's playstyle. 

The 12 hours of my playtime is purely within the very 1st chapter of the game while restarting and going through the motions of knowing 4 character's playstyle. IMO, this game is good for those that wouldn't mind grinding through the entire game just to get a feel of a character's playstyle suits him/her."
17666,I have played it for so many years and I still find it just as good as before
17667,i've been stuck on the first mission for 3 hours cause i threw my mouse at a wall.
17668,"GOOD GAME!
"
17669,"Well done.

The art style is well executed, if you like it, well, that's for yourself to decide.
Combat works well, but what this game does best is the humor and diverse AI characters.
I found myself laughing out loud multiple times during this game.

This game is great if you like FPS games and want to have some fun.
Also if you are not sure if you like Borderlands 3 or find it to expensive, try this game first."

17676,best game i had ever played.
17677,Boringland 2... some say this was way better than Annoyingland: The Pre-Sequel and Boringland GOTY. Truth be told... they all the same! UE POS! At least I got to laugh all over again at my buddy trash acting like a winjin pom and telling me we'll play borderlands next weekend... which really meant 3 months later each time. For the hilarious reaction this game invoked in trash... I give it a 0.1/10.

17690,"I kept playing because there are so many positive reviews, but it never got any better or different. 

The same old battles over and over with little to no variety, way too much time spent running around and manually picking up one item from every little container when they could've just put several items in one container. No variety between the enemies really. Villain never does anything and the bosses are boring and do cheap one-hit kills like throwing you off a cliff. 

NPCs constantly shrieking in your communicator. You can only track one quest at a time so you'll waste tons of time running back and forth between fast travel stations. Vehicle handling is boiled garbage. Traversal is the most awkward I've ever experienced in a AAA game, you can't mantle or climb and you'll waste tons of time trying to figure out how the game is interpreting your jumps. 

Sprint and walk speed are incredibly slow. Bosses and sub-bosses don't drop useful loot, the monetary value of the items doesn't match up at all with the quality of the item. Backpack space is super limited so you have to constantly look for stores to sell excess loot and you don't have enough space to carry different items for different situations.

I got the Game of the Year edition because I figured with so many thousands of positive reviews I'd better invest and get all the extra content. But this game handles terribly and just offers zero gameplay variety whatsoever. Horribly boring number-crunching loot action."
17691,"Fun, exciting, a big grinding game if y'all are into it!"
17692,"Does it REALLY need any more reviews? :)
At this moment - 1218 hours on the clock. I have this game on PC, PS3 and PS4 VR. Never get bored!"
17693,Just a fun amazing shooter.
17694,<3
17695,"A fun, quirky shooter that has aged well."
17696,"yeah I've played this for 60 hours, because ""its so good""
""youve gotta let it grow on you""
""trust me, its a really good game""
and like, i get it, but also, how am i level 32 and yet i get one-shot by nearly everything in the game? how will that grow on me?

I might get some hate because people are obsessed with this game, but i really didn't enjoy it"
17697,best game ever
17698,The worst part about this game is I haven't played it more.
17699,"This game is really silly and a lot of fun. The humor isn't necessarily politically correct, but it gave me a lot of chuckles. It's a really nice FPS with many different strategic approaches and play styles and a lot of fun to play."
17700,"Hours and Hours of content that is fun no matter how many times you've played. From beginners with no FPS experience to seasoned pros, there is something in this for everyone."
17701,its been my favourite game since it has been out played it on 3 different consoles

17712,"Played this on Xbox 360 for years during my childhood, I bought it on steam again for nostalgia, and ive been playing it alone with my friend chrome. :3 Its a must have on steam."
17713,good game
17714,"Since the third entry in the Borderlands series has come out, Borderlands 2 has solidified itself as the best in the series.  If you haven't played BL1 you should also give that game a try, I believe it still holds up to BL2 in different ways.  If you haven't played BL3, well let's just pretend that one doesn't exist and the world will be a better place."
17715,"So you want to hear a story, eh?"
17716,"Bruh
"
17717,"I have no idea what I am doing most of the time and yet it's a lot of fun blasting your way through a great variety of madmen and creatures. Lovely characters, an immense variety of weapons, good voice acting and a good story make this an exceptional game to enjoy with your friends, when competitive online gaming makes you angry again and you need to relax! Definite recommendation!"
17718,"I came back to this game years after finishing the campaign. I had never tried any of the DLC and was in the mood to get a quick fix. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is one of the best DLC experiences I've had in any game. I'm sorry that I forgot about you Borderlands, you are really great."
17719,"Just a classic open world game, to be blunt it's funny and immersive, with fairly good mechanics. only bad part is the endgame, where everything hits you to your health gate in one hit and has an incredible amount of health."
17720,"this is my favorite game
"
17721, 4
17722,i do like this game.
17723,"good story, fun game but most guns suck and have very bad accuracy. 9/10"
17724,"Oh look, a good Borderlands that doesn't run like shit on a decent system and is a lot of fun."
17725,yes
17726,"This game is without a doubt one of the best video game stories ever, with the best-written villain."
17727,"Great game.  There's a diamond pony named after me.

Great gameplay, lots of options for customization and different strategies.  The story is pretty good, but more of a background thing.  Gotta love Handsome Jack though, had some great talks over the radio.  I've laughed outloud a couple time.  Pure chaos in game form and I'd replay it again and again."
17728,Fun
17729,lag spike like mother fucker

17734,Borderlands Best Series.
17735,yes
17736,Very much worth the money. The replayability is amazing. There are literally thousands of different items and enemies. Action packed storylines with countless side missions. Great game overall. Have been playing since 2012 and still love the game to this day.
17737,"I guess it's an OK game if you like looter shooters, but I found it a little boring, tedious and annoying. Especially if you aren't playing in co-op. 

For starters it takes way too long for things to get rolling. A large portion of the beginning of the game is spent in a monotonous arctic region where everything is spread far apart. The firefights you do get into aren't all that engaging either; most enemies just seem to be bullet sponges. I'm sure as the game progresses, the gameplay becomes more interesting with the new guns you pick up, but my initial impression is that the combat is kind of bland. And finally the narrative isn't really winning me over. I find the sarcasm of all the characters to be a bit annoying, and the dialogue feels over-saturated with bad jokes.

I imagine that Borderlands 2 might be more enjoyable when played with a friend, and I assume the combat picks up later on. But I don't feel motivated to play on due to the annoying dialogue and sparse environments. One last thing that bugs me about this game is the lack of a local co-op mode. As a co-op centered game, it's disappointing that there are no ways to play split screen with a friend."
17738,"Its Borderlands 2, there's not a lot I can say that hasnt been said."
17739,The best looter shooter to ever come out
17740,"Awesome, hours of mindless fun. Great content and lots of loot. Has a high replayability value too."
17741,amazing game would give it a 14 out of 10!!!!!!!
17742,Great guns. Great laughs. What else? Oh... great grenades too!
17743,baddddddddddddddddddddddd
17744,played it on multiple consoles and are glad to finally get it on pc
17745,"The endgame has less balance than a redditor diet, but fuck would I 100% this game all over again any time.

11/10, you can farm a DPUH as early as lvl 8"
17746,"The artwork for this game is amazing and is continued throughout the entire series. No need to have played any before.
Definitely recommend."
17747,Bro/Sis/Thing... its good. End of it. No extra DLC necessary. Its just gucci.
17748,good game
17749,It’s ok ig
17750,This is just great
17751,This was worth buying
17752,"‎[i]It's not just a game, it is something [b]INCREDIBLE[/b].
‎The way how detailed characters are written, the amount of humor, and jokes.
‎I bet this game make you smile and laugh very often.
BL2 can offer you 4 different class, and two more DLC class.
‎Even in 2021 this game graphic may surprise you with free
‎UltraHD texture pack, and if this is not enough for you,
‎‎you always can download ReShade and configure RayTracing with it,
‎if you interested how game can look with it check my game screenshots.
Pandora awaits you Vault Hunter! [/i]"
17753,"Borderlands 2 is such a great game. The best in the series. The action is phenomenal, and it is a challenge, which makes it fun to play and not boring. It's also the funniest game I've ever played. Some of the things these characters say.... Damn.. Highly recommended!"
17754,"just like the storyline

17755,"One of my all time favorite games ever, better than 3 it has slag."

17764,"oh man where do i start this game is just so freakin good i have almost 300 hours on xbox360 ps3 ps4 xbox one 
and i just got it on pc. 
the characters build bonds with the players like tina or brick 
also the guns are so cool you got guns that shoot orbs of death 
also the games skills are so cool like salvador the gunzerker that has two guns 
or maya a playable siren shes awesome 
i say give the game a chance"
17765,its fun because you can use a gun
17766,"JUST GET IT! .... The End... LOL :D :D :D


For those new to Borderlands...

Borderlands is a first person shoot & loot game, great single player mode, even nicer co-op with your friends/family up to 4 players.  Great game play, great fun, has tense moments, funny moments, joking sarcasm, fun missions & battles, some big battles, some hard battles, some interesting mission completion tasks, but mostly just relaxed exploration, shoot anything that moves and loot everything... especially dung piles.

Oh, and some bandits make the funniest comments when you shoot them with fire damage weapons...  not all of them, but the ones that scream a lot... trust me, just use a fire weapon!


Quick mention, it is kiddie safe in terms of gore if you turn it off using the sensor option in the game settings.  No blood, guts or dismemberment etc, just good fun if you need that option as a protective parent.

I got this on special for (96% discount) including all the DLC and Borderlands Pre-Sequel which is another full separate game. Honestly, try get it with all the DLC if you can, just trust me on that. 

Some say to play Pre-Sequel after BL2 since the storyline follows better that way because the events of Pre-Sequel happen after BL2's storyline.  Some disagree with this but take it from me, Borderlands is not ""A Story Rich"" game.  Yes there is a story & plot, but they are not ""deep"" it is really unnecessary to play the game(s) in-order-of-release.  

91hrs game play later there's not much to say except...  JUST GET IT! 

Just play it, do it again, and then some more, rinse repeat.  If you haven't played the original Borderlands some of the puns and jokes have less impact but you won't know it, so no problems there.  Then on the flip side, just get the original if you can, play it first, enjoy then do it again till you dream about Borderlands hahaha.  Borderlands is always better on playthrough 2...  just trust me, IT IS!

If I had to nit pick and point out one dislike with Borderlands 2, it would be the loot boxes.  Loot boxes unlike the original Borderlands don't give rare loot or better weapons, mods, relics, grenades or well anything worth getting.  They are somehow still irresistible, you will find yourself opening them anyway lol, I know it makes no sense, but you WILL open them anyway...  

Though the loot boxes are a source of mostly useless items, it doesn't really matter too much, you can get so many free Golden Keys with Swift codes you will find the good stuff regardless.  Google some YouTube vids and you can find ways to have infinite golden keys, so ""mining"" good weapons is easy and repeatable.  There are ""saved game editors"" thus if better guns are your thing, you can simply ""make"" your own by combining the best weapon manufacturers, perks & effects till you have the perfect weapon.

One more ""dislike"" or rather omission, is that the main characters in the game were more ""larger than life"" charismatic, cool, funny & sarcastic in the the original game.  Again, unless you played the original, you won't notice that... at all... but will miss it if you have.

I would suggest during playthrough 1, to skip most of the side missions (you can do them on playthrough 2 instead).   I mentioned the saved game editor, if you want to start the game as a ""True Vault Hunter"" right away, then just make a character using the editor and choose the ""playthrough 2 or True Vault Hunter"" option right from the start.

I love the game, so playing it again wasn't an issue. I just enjoyed it even more the 2nd time round, plus doing all the side missions during playthrough 2 made the game far more rewarding and fun.  That said, there are options to speed things along if you really want to.  I amped up my first character but I soon grew bored, cause the game was just too easy.  I deleted that character and started the game over and played the game as it was meant to be played.  WAY MORE FUN that way if I have to be honest, but that's me, different styles for everyone. 

So final words...  JUST GET IT ALREADY!"
17767,eh
17768,"Did I fire six shots, or only five? Three? Seven. Whatever.
"
17769,"I went into Borderlands 2 as a player. I watched my closest friend battle, steal, and have fun playing Borderlands but as I didn't own the game, there was no room for more. HOWEVER, Borderlands 2 introduced the same characters from the game before: Mordecai, Lillith, Brick, and Roland; but this time as dialogue/story mission pinnacles. Though the games aren't completely progressive, the game follows a similar story arc of the prior in regards to searching and opening the Vault. Along the journey towards the vault, the player battles robots, bandits, psychos, mutations, monsters (bonerfarts), and dozens of duffle bags of side quests. This helps play into the progression and leveling up a character of your choice.. The options being Axton (Commando with a mobile turret), Maya (Siren with phaselock abilities) , Zer0 (Stealth assassin), and Salvador (Dual-wielding brawn). Other unlockable characters through DLC are Gaige (Engineer with a battle robot) and Krieg (Melee psycho). 

This game was and still is the pinnacle of my interest (as one can see with my hours), and I still haven't played it all yet. Play any character like another, make weird/effective talent trees, and enjoy a lethal amount of the game."
17770,is claptrap a beep bop?
17771,All time favorites! Love the characters and even the DLCs are expansive and immersive. Highly recommend.
17772,very fun but sometimes i get lost and don't know where to go
17773,"jogo mt DG, divertido pakas. Pra ficar melhor so se tivesse uma cena da dança entre os corpos conectando a alma."
17774,"Good game. the story is super cool, but the gameplay isn't as awesome. The gameplay requires hours upon hours of grinding for XP and guns just so you can progress. Also, there are barely any environment changes throughout the game, it's just ice, plants, and lava. I haven't played it much on steam, but on my PS4 I've played it quite a bit. Honestly, if you want story: play this, but if you want super fun gameplay with more environments (without the amazing story), play BL3."

"
17777,"Not usually a 3rd person shooter guy, but this game is so good. It has so much personality, the high-octane gameplay is so fun, and it's a blast to play with friends."
17778,First time playing Borderlands 2.. and i love it. I first played Borderlands 3 on xbox and got this BL2 and BL3 on Black Friday sale for PC. And i have to say BL2 is way more fun then BL3. Just Wish there were more people to play with
17779,dlc mahal mahal skinnya ganti warna doang anjim
17780,its a fun game if you have nothing to do and burn time because the missions are very long depending if you die alot or not but a mission usealy take me like 30 to 1 hour but i highly recomend it and plese play with a friend that know what teamwork means becuase you need to work together to become better at the game
17781,Kinda cool ngl
17782,"Great game, was playing it long time before. Now playing it again"
17783,yes
17784,One of the best FPS games of all time. Fun action tons of guns and great characters
17785,"Great games, great franchise."
17786,"An average at best shooter with a cool concept, interesting world and okay story. What sells this game is the gun variety and a handful of the characters introduced into this sequel.

It is also Gearbox' only good and *polished* video game title which, given their track record, should say something. 

It's a fun flick with a couple of friends for a playthrough or 2 and ultimately becomes a type of game, where most will go:

""Oh yeah we haven't played this one in a while... It could be fun to play again!""."
17787,gud gam
17788,Its Borderlands
17789,eh... its aight
17790,can shoot wildlife in face . 10/10

17797,"It gets boring quickly, play melee krieg he's the most fun. Also cheat, cheat any character you make to start at whatever character you have to start at the capstone of at least 1 tree, the early levels are just so so boring so just skip them so you can have a little fun before you decide it's not worth it anymore."
17798,Shooty Shooty
17799,good game
17800,Yes.
17801,"fun game, zer0 best character"
17802,"Not as good as the first Borderlands, but still a worthy successor. Borderlands 2 picks up where the first game leaves off story-wise. You opened the vault and found the treasure and... well.. are now in pursuit of another vault and other treasure. You'll soon find that the ""treasures"" of the vaults hold a particular secret which I won't spoil here. Top tier weapons don't feel as good as they were in the first game (Lava sniper) and finding them seems harder. All in all, a worthy time-waster as we wait for BL3,"
17803,"Really great gameplay, levels, story and 4-player co-op"
17804,"its an ok game op 10 is friggin hard
"
17805,"I had absolutely no expectations going into this when I played it for the first time in 2019. What I didn't know is that it would slowly become one of my favourite FPS games ever made. A great sense of humour, meaty campaign with memorable characters and literal THOUSANDS of guns that can materialise at any second makes this a game I'll never forget - despite how repetitive it can get for long play sessions. Oh, and the DLC is fantastic, too.

★★★★★★★★★☆"
17806,"I have 792 hours in this game, and Steam asks me if I would recommend this game. You know what, for the hell of it. No this game sucks."
17807,"Very fun. It has a good story and all, but my main problem is that side quests are practically all the same, and it starts to feel monotonous. 7/10"

17810,"Really a fun game to play with friends. Always packed with new missions, action and guns for days..."
17811,"[b]Another in a great line of games.[/b] This franchise will never get old.  This is what a post apocalypse should be.

[b]Graphics[/b] = Different in a good way
[b]Characters[/b] = Phenomenal
[b]Story[/b] = Kick in your teeth fun the whole way
[b]Weapons[/b] = Oh Yah


[b]Needs work
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Enemy VI = (virtual Intelligence).[/b]  
If you shoot anything they know exactly where you are and start running at you. With the sniper rifle if you are far enough away then they will give up and walk home.  This makes effortless sniper targets which are crappy.  Like all shooters, there should be four VI modes.

[b]Normal mode[/b] = They are unaware that you stealth killed one of their allies and act normally.
[b]Searching[/b] = They found a fallen friend, watch him fall, or lost your location and they are looking for you.
[b]Alert[/b] = They know where you are and you are in range to attack/run-up to.
[b]Take Cover[/b] = They know generally where you are and know that you are too far to reach.

Borderlands works at these modes but they are not quite right. Taking cover should take the longest to reset back to normal and I am talking minutes here.  It should be long enough that players are discouraged from killing everything at range.  Enemies should not attempt to run up to players if they are too far away. Adding a bullet ark to sniper rifles at max range would help, and giving enemies the ability to switch to long-range weapons and fire back would not hurt either.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Sprint to Skip [/b]
If you don't want to fight your way through an enemy hoard, well most of the time you don't have to. You can literally run through them and they will give up when you leave their area. This means if you know the path you can run past them and clear out the enemies at the destination skipping the entire encounter. There are some maps and enemies where this makes sense but not all of them. The thing is Coop is more fun than Single-player and often you get players who don't let you enjoy the game because they played it so long they no longer care. Your only option is to drop the Coop and hope to get better players in the next group up.

[b]Solution A)[/b] If a player passes an area where they alerted the enemies, then the next zone should be alerted to the player unless there is nothing left to search for them. If anything from the past area is alerted and the player enter the next zone, then alert the next zone to increase reaction times.

[b]Solution B)[/b] Next taking fire should slow the player & enemies (exclude bosses). If they are being pelted with bullets their run speed should decrease. If they are engaging the enemy this should not be enough to prevent them from finding cover but if they are sprinting to skip then the character should become a bullet magnet. After all, the point is to actually play the game."

17822,you can't not love it.
17823,Fun game to get lost in and great to play with friends and/or SO
17824,I recommend Borderlands 2.  The game is amazing and the graphics are very good.  The game play is easy and I am very happy playing the game all the way to completion.

"
17864,"Borderlands 2 is like the grand father of looter shooter RPGs at this point. An improvement all the way around compared to the first game, but its starting to show its age at this point. My biggest issue is the balancing of the game, enemies turn into bullet sponges really fast. And how strong you are is almost entirely reliant on RNG gun drops. But it is a lot of fun and worth picking up for $10 or less, especially if you play with friends.

17877,yes
17878,"The good points about this game are
1. Their innovative method to make cartoonish graphics with dark borders.
2. Filled with all kind of jokes sewn within the story.

However the combat is very lackluster. Unlike other games, mostly you never feel that you are doing anything special. Despite having multiple characters to play as, there is not much replayability."
17879,the best
17880,"I've played this game on PS3, Xbox One, and now finally on PC. I've easily in total put in almost 1000 hours into this game. I highly recommend playing this game especially with friends and get all of the DLC, basically each of these DLCs are top tier and absolutely slap. Don't miss out on this."
17881,I turned a robot into a gun and it asked me why there were no more bullets.
17882,Easily one of the best games I have ever played. No matter how many times I play through this game it never stops being as amazing as the first time.
17883,"Best Borderlands Game ever in my opinion. A must have for fps, action, adventure game fans. Awesome co-op and cool story. I LOVE this game! It never gets old. A timeless classic, that I could play through a hundred times and still not get bored of it. There is so much to explore and learn when playing this game"
17884,"great game, very differnt to other shooters. the world feels kinda lonely though at times but solid game other than that"

17895,the game is pish beacuse i keep getting kicked it stupid
17896,Salvador go brrrrrrrrrr
17897,Lots of gun lots of fun
17898,definetly one of the best looter shooters out there. not much needed to mention.
17899,Game good. Buy game.
17900,very good game
17901,"Borderlands 2 is by far the best in the series. The villain, Handsome Jack, is one of the best written bad guys ever, and the writing is overall sublime. The expansion, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is some of the most fun, I have had in a game ever. 

Borderlands skills have been improved massively, and the different classes makes for a lot of replayability. the gunplay is solid and the art style, while definetely a matter of taste, is unique, and I enjoy it tremendously.

Very few things make me hesitate about giving this a perfect score, but it is very very close. 

9/10"
17902,bordelrlands 2 gg
17903,We all know why I'm making a review.
17904,"where do I begin? This game is absolutely amazing. The story is really good for the genre of this game and the main villain i feel like is just amazing. The gun play might seem old but its still pretty fun. You can choose from 6 different character with different skills and each one can have many different builds and play styles which are all so amazingly fun to play. With some grinding, this game becomes so fun and you can really make your character over powered.

I would definitely recommend getting this game. I would get it as part of the handsome collection when it goes on sale so you can get The Pre-Sequel (which admittedly is not as good of a game in my opinion) and all of the dlcs and cosmetics.

Just an amazing game to really put your time into playing.

Also, If you seek other ways to play the game, I would recommend modding the game. It is simple and quick and can really change up how you might play the game."
17905,"i mean you can throw ur gun and it explodes n u just pull out another one, why not buy it"
17906,"The game that was its own meme. The comic book art style is unique, the humor is as over the top as the violence, and it doesn't take itself seriously, even a little bit. This is a gem that has aged very well, had a lot of support and updates over the years, and stands solidly as a single player or coop first person shooter. There is pretty much nothing that the videos don't show you, so I'm not going to write a book here. But if you're on the fence about snatching this up, you shouldn't be. Borderlands 2 is everything it says it is.

For perspective: Borderlands 3 is out. It's way newer, and still looks almost exactly like Borderlands 2. It's not that they got lazy. There's just nothing they could have done to improve from one game to the next. That is rare."
17907,It is a great shooter game with its unique graphics and weapons.

I bought the Handsome Collection this year and tried again - and I am hooked.  The story is not what I remembered.  Still not great, but fine.  The gameplay is sublime.  If you enjoyed the original Borderlands, or are a fan of loot filled arpg's, you will probably enjoy this game."

17926,"While my hours here may not show it, I've played this game (cumulatively) for easily 1000+ hours. This series is my favorite series of FPS's and this game is by far my favorite FPS, entry in the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. I don't know what it is about Borderlands 2 that makes it so replay-able. The jokes are outdated but I still laugh at them like I did back in 2012-2013, the guns are all fun and exciting, the new NPCs and playable characters are all great, the new maps are beautiful, the music is memorable, Handsome Jack is one of the (in my opinion) best video game villains ever. If you somehow haven't played this game, the huge bundle with this game and the Pre Sequel go on sale pretty often, so do yourself a favor and pick it up even if you think you're only slightly interested. This game holds a special place in my heart and I'll keep coming back to it.

17946,this game is fun just buy it its like 6 bucks for the 2nd best game ever.
17947,"The grandfather of looter shooters. A bonafide classic. Distinct visual style combined with visually interesting environments makes for a very good looking game to this day. It's a sort of timeless style that'll look good no matter what, like flipping through a comic book. Phenomenal story, lovable and funny characters, one of the best antagonists I've ever seen. The gun design, and gun play are very well done and satisfying. The unique weapons are so lovingly crafted for brutal destruction of your foes. The classes are all so well done, there are so many different builds and the skill synergies go bonkers. I can't praise this game enough, or I could, but you wouldn't care. I loved this game. I'd recommend this game to anyone."

17957,texas
17958,"Excellent ! 
Beautiful cel-shading designs.
Intensive pew pew gameplay, even more enjoyable in Co-op.
A cool storyline, a lot of humour with just enough seriousness.
"
17959,The Best
17960,The best all round Borderlands game by far
17961,"My nostalgia makes me want to say that I liked Borderlands 1 more than 2, but ultimately I enjoy BL2's polish, the amount of guns you can mess around with is more than enough, the story is much better than BL3 and more in depth than BL1, overall I believe this to be the best overall Borderlands game. Give it a try if you haven't yet/try it again if you have already elsewhere! TLDR IT IS WORTH IT!"
17962,这作的剧情做得比前一部出色，但枪械的平衡做得比前一部差多了，到了30级感觉不是金钥匙开出来的imba武器感觉用着都不是很爽，而35级之后话感觉不用都打不了。战斗时会插入ost，以及天赋树的改动都是比较容易感受到的进步。不过比较让人不爽的地方便是dlc地图没有动态难度，和上一部一样。打完一个之后等级就刷上去，之后打怪就像切菜一样，容易令人感到无聊，除非开二周目，但我又感觉我刷不动了。最后专门表扬一下tiny tina's assault on dragon keep这dlc，非常有意思，同时也是我唯一有兴趣打通的dlc。
17963,.
17964,I'm so addict to this game <3
17965,wonderful game 10/10 and when you get into it and commit to a play through it can get even better
17966,Surprisingly a great game! story rich and action packed
17967,im the conductor of the poop train !!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17968,its good i have played it when it came out on the xbox 360 and ps4 its really good
17969,one of the only games i will ever rate 10/10
17970,"Borderlands 2 is the best game in the series, and the ultimate looter-shooter. hours upon hours of fun. playing solo is good, playing with 3 other monkeys is much MUCH better. The quips/punchlines in this game are hilarious and iconic and are quoted by my friends and I constantly. If you've never touched the series before, buy this one. only this one."
17971,its good
17972,So you want to hear another story  eh?
17973,noice game
17974,Please go to Claptrap's birthday bash :(
17975,love it! great storyline and funny characters. I definitely enjoyed handsome Jack the best!
17976,GUNS LOOT AND KILL
17977,"Liked it enough to play 200+ hours.

Very stylized graphics, I personally really liked how it looked (and it still is pleasing to look at 8-9 years later). While it doesn't have the best plot in the world, the characters and side-quests are hilarious, the gameplay is incredibly entertaining, and the combat styles/characters are fun to experiment with. I completed the game on my own twice, and spent an ungodly amount of time into the early morning hours playing with friends."
17978,ITS FUN !
17979,funni robot
17980,cool guns
17981,"One of the best looter shooters ever made, and the writing is great fun."
17982,good my guy
17983,"Just picked this game up for PC after remembering how much fun it was to play on console. This game is every bit as good as I remember. The story is awesome, there are tons of quests to do, and a lot of easter eggs to find. This game is amazing in every aspect. 10/10 would recommend"
17984,its a really fun game to play
17985,mmmmmmmmmmm game good
17986,Also aye
17987,"Played BL 1, BL 2 and BL 3.     BL 2 is better than the others."
17988,"I don't know how to concisely, in one review, touch on all the hilarious characters that this game throws at you at every conceivable moment. Play it. Enjoy it. Laugh at the hilarity. Stan Tina."
17989,"i like it, play it"
17990,"""Argh, this is so frustrating. Y'see, this is what I don't get about you bad guys. You know the hero's gonna win, but you just don't die quickly. Example: this one guy in New Haven, right? City's burning, people are dying left and right, yadda yadda yadda. This jackhole rushes me with a spoon. A fricking spoon! And I'm dying laughing, right? So I scoop out his stupid little eyeballs with it, and his kids are all, waaahh!, and, he can't see where he's going, he's bumping in to stuff, and ah... I don't know, maybe you had to be there. The moral is: you're a total bitch."""
17991,"yes

18006,they say the gunplay in the fallout games are bad. but they are easily twice as bad in this game. i can't for the life of me get machine guns to shoot straight and it gives me honoust to god motion sickness.
18007,very good game
18008,"What you still scrolling down here for partner, you're missing out on epicness from a decade ago as I have.

18009,It'sa gud game
18010,very epic
18011,"I've been playing Borderlands since the first game came out and I remember getting Borderlands 2 for Christmas the year it came out and ever since then it's been my favorite game I've ever played. I can't recommend this game enough to people that haven't played it yet, and for those that have and want something new, BL2 Reborn is an amazing mod and adds so much even players with hundreds or thousands of hours will have a brand new experience, I'm currently around 9k hours and counting if you count all my platforms and accounts"
18012,"Lots of fun, make sure to disable ""Fullscreen Optimizations"" in the .exe Properties menu to keep it from stuttering on high-end machines. :)"
18013,"It's Borderlands 2.  It's a good game, if a bit of a grind and repetitive, but still fun."
18014,A very fun playing experience and tongue-in-cheek delivery makes this game a winner.
18015,good stuff
18016,"been playing this game since it was out on PS3 and played the first one there as well, personally this has to be my favorite game in the BL series with almost no competition from the others and for 10$ on sale this is definitely one of the best games you can buy and play on steam."
18017,Bad ass game.
18018,"My favorite game. The best looter shooter by far and has been for 9 years. Story, gameplay, artstyle, everything about this game is incredible. Been playing for years and always find my way back. Definitely a 10/10."
18019,it is amazing u have so much things u can do

18037,"Held out for years, but this game is actually fun."
18038,Nice game
18039,"Amazing game really, and still amazing today in 2021 with the upgraded HD texture DLC pack.
This game was EXTREMELY cheap when I bought it, I had this game way back when we all played the xbox 360 and enjoyed every minute of playing it.
The DLCs are a must really, they were also cheap when I bought this as steam was having a sale, I think I saved what could have been over £100 for the full game and DLCs.

Most of your friends will already have this game, so do yourself a favour and get it, you won't regret it.

18075,"When you have got burned out from reaching OP 8 on three characters on Xbox 360 so you decide to buy the game on PC for crispy graphics. Then realise that I've burned myself out of this game. If you have never play this game before, cherish it until you reach OP 8."
18076,"One word: GOAT.

It has guns, it has humor, it has an evil enemy, it has character progression, it can be played coop.

Simply perfect."

18082,by far one of the best games i have played
18083,"I hate this game's writing so much. So Fucking much. I want every character to shut the Fuck up constantly I hate all of them. Jack is fun sometimes and nothing and no one else. I fucking despise all of sanctuary. Every Single line of dialogue is ""exposition - funny randem"" the """"""""""""""""""""""hUmOr"""""""""""""""""""""" is just saying something and then saying something else dumb. ""Thank you for getting the iridium, I want to go and make a dance about sneezing"" SHUT UP SHUT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK UP. the gameplay is nice tho"

18102,"The best co-op game available. Borderlands 2 is populated with a unique cast of funny and memorable characters, and a gigantic cast of unique guns. The looting is awesome, the combat is fast and fun, and the ability to build your character as you like is always interesting. This game is at its best when you and three others are scrambling around shooting through hordes of screaming marauders, psychos, and robots, collecting as much money and guns as you can hold. Highly recommend to play through with some friends."
18103,b
18104,claptrap says yes
18105,ඞ
18106,The greatest game ever god damn created. I'd never write another review for a game because then I'd be wasting my time. I know Pandora better then I know where I live in real life.
18107,Has aged badly and is still deeply buggy.
18108,good story so far...good FPS game.

18114,the best borderlands there is.

18126,"If you suffer from depression, give this pill a try because it will make you laugh. The story is great, the world is full of stuff to pick up, and the random comments throughout the game will make you bust out laughing. I have to load this with Steam Offline or I get that rubber band stutter walk while the sound keeps going from my gimpy internet. But, I do not mind. I play it in full 4K and it looks beautiful and runs perfect all settings maxed. The game ages very well and the humor in it at times will leave you having to pause before you get killed. Thanks so much for the years of good times in this game and for making this game."
18127,good
18128,really fun to play with plenty to do definitely would recommend
18129,"The games exploration and experiment of skills and combos its where the fun is. Comedy used reduces the tension to make the game not too edgy. It by all account an overall improvement for the first game with different characters and class types. The story is a lot more flesh out. For non-first-person-shooter gamers, this is a good game to get started in as it helps you get used to the basic controls, plus the co-op options allows you to have other players to join you in the story mode."
18130,"i really like this game.leveling up your character and looting guns,highly recommended this game to anyone..."

18172,Great with friends
18173,i like this product
18174,very good game
18175,"Definitely yes. Just an overall fun game to play if you are tired of taking life so seriously. Love the art style and music. Although the story might not be super deep and heart wrenchingly meaningful it is still very well written and put together. The characters are quirky and over the top. And it wouldn't be borderlands if they weren't. The (oh so many) side quests also integrate very well with the main story of the game. Many in this case is not a bad thing. They are entertaining and flow very well with the rest of the game so you don't feel like you are being sent all over the map for random insignificant things that you are just going to forget the second you hand them in. They don't feel like random pieces of junk that were just slapped on top just to give the game more bulk. Often they actually tell a story that helps you to understand the world or a certain character better. 
I would definitely recommend this game. Oh, and it is 100x better if you can enjoy this game with some friends.
A job well done!"
18176,"Love the game, never gets old, nice graphics and one of the best fps games i ever played."

18215,"I've played this game for years, i love it each time. It's fun to play, funny, doesn't take itself too serious, and i love the art style. And my laptop can support the game no problem, which is an issue I have with Bdlds 3."
18216,gogd
18217,fun game
18218,"Great graphics, I love the art and the missions are real fun as well!!"
18219,fun
18220,"I've owned and played through cracked versions of the game, not to mention whichever many hours I've accumulated on the Xbox 360.

It just ain't good. If you do every little side-quest that comes up as you do the story, it turns into fetch-quest simulator as you yawn your way back and forth, steamrolling everything you come across because only a select few missions actually level with the player. You almost have to be decisive with which quests you actually want to have a fun challenge with, and ignoring more of the minor ones.

Much of the fun is in the challenge, and you can't do that if you're squashing enemies 8 levels below you, all the loot you find being useless because that doesn't level with the player either."
18221,its a good game and i love the game play  plus the story line of the game
18222,DSFSDFSDFSDFS

18229,"i have the fault symbol tattooed on my leg that should say enough. I was 11 when the 1st title came out and the second was everything a sequel should be, while borderlands 3 is a shiner toy this ones soul keeps it alive even to this point"
18230,It is very fun to play and the game-play is very good~
18231,"Borderlands is a great series of games. Very fun, even by yourself. Lodes of things to do, and dope weaponry to collect."
18232,it's okay
18233,Played for an hour.. wasn't really impressed.
18234,"I have played BORDERLANDS AND BORDERLANDS 2 for PS3 AND PS4 now I'm playing it on steam as well, but for steam I'm playing more contents than what I had on on the PS4. All the BORDERLANDS are fun to play especially with friends.👍"
18235,"Awesome game played fpr many hrs!!! I love it
"
18236,very fun rpg in my opinion
18237,fun
18238,"This game is famous. Reknowned and an award winner! Why are you here reading this? As long as you're not a pacifist, go get it!"
18239,"Game:noice
I just love this game.Playing by yourself is fun but playing with friends is much better!"
18240,AMAZING. i have so many memories with this game i love it so much

18243,Is good
18244,KUUL
18245,I've played this game more than I've done heroin
18246,One of the best rpg shooters ever made..... this series has helped shape new games in this new generation of games...
18247,"All the borderlands games are great, especially this one! So much content to enjoy, story was amazing; really continued strongly from the first Borderlands, characters were all great to play as (my favorite was the Physco) ;0 All the weapons were fun to use. Replay Value is also important for unlocking higher difficulties. Side quests were fairly interesting and overall one of my favorite Borderlands games. 9/10"
18248,good gaem big fun
18249,"Borderlands 2 is a great game overall. The story is amazing and the replay ability of the game is amazing. There are six characters to choose from and a wide range of downloadable content to play after you have finished the game. Overall if you want this game I highly recommend purchasing it, you will not be disappointed."
18250,Legends say the lava is still rising
18251,it fun
18252,One of the best series of games i can think of with reputation.
18253,"This game is constantly getting me addicted over and over again, its very loot heavy. balls"
18254,Awesome
18255,this game brings back memories
18256,Its Great.
18257,World would go boom boom without this game.
18258,"Good game shoot bandit have fun, lots of gun, and let me tell you this one small thing, this game is way more fun then borderlands 3, from a story standpoint, I dont mind replaying this game a million times, mainly because of the story and level curve in THIS GAME, but the 3rd one and Pre-Sequel arent particularly my cup of tea when it comes to story and gameplay (respectively)"
18259,"Borderlands 2 is a witty game with a good sense of humor. It avoids common cliches by making fun of them and has a cast of characters that are likeable, albeit assholes/dumbasses. I don't have much knowledge on game mechanics and stuff so I won't speak on that. But, as a person who's not that good at gaming, it is still fun enough to play by story alone, and it sure is a blast to play with friends."
18260,incredible replayability
18261,fun
18262,To have a lot of fun with this game get friends to play with you
18263,"Just get it for -
Story
Guns
Gameplay
Graphics
Characters
Basically everything

This game is a masterpiece."
18264,Borderlands 2 is the better one in the series.
18265,"At first, Borderlands looks like any other looting based shooter. Like, when you plainly look at it and never started the game once. Once you started the game and get to know the story line, it quickly develop into the whackiest game, jokes- and punwise. 
I got the big bundle with the DLCs (and 100%ed the whole game [which means EVERY DLC, even the Commander Lilith DLC]).

Even at high level, Borderlands 2 doesnt stop to surprise people as there is more than just playa through the story. The characters feel really immersed and for the standard when this game came out, damn it was on the top shelf for sure! 

Still today, Feb 2021, I absolutely loved playing it, be it the DLCs, the raid bosses or just do some quests. Props to the musicians, you guys crushed the Soundtrack. Personal most loved theme was Haderax, as it is energetic and almost on a Doom-like metal level.

Every coin has two sides, so does Borderlands. The game is grindy on the end if you dont jump into the higher modes. The drops of higher tier are sometimes just time consuming to grind. And lets just dont talk about JIMMY J3NKINS, that has to be found outside of the quest [I have done them before realizing that it had helped the spawns. 

Yet, to conclude this review:
 I absolutely loved the game, its on my ""Must Recommend"" list. It is the most time intense game, not in a way of grindy time consuming task. Its more like that game, that, once you close it, you gasp and realize ""How long was this session?!""

"
18266,Best game ever if your a crazy psycho that loves to kill and get infinte loot.
18267,"One of the best co-op games to date! Players are provided with a good mood, interesting and exciting gameplay, unusual quests and tasks, more than 30,000 units of various weapons (thanks to a random generator of weapons from different parts loaded into the game), and much more!"
18268,"YES
"
18269,Amazing
18270,nah i dont recommend it
18271,cool gun
18272,"TAKE THIS TRASH OFF THE MARKETPLACE. this game was designed for aim-assist, there is none and ads with any gun with iron sights is a nightmare. any co-op is only awful for anyone who isnt host. AND my fucking guns fall through the floor, i accessed the key chest in sanctuary and my guns fell through the floor when sorting. DONE, uninstalling. FUCK 2k FUCK ALL THESE FUCKING COMPANIES UPLOADING THEIR GAMES WITHOUT ANY ANNNNYYYYY OPTIMIZATION, HOW LONG ARE THESE FUCKS GOING TO JUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS, It's not just borderlands, try playing HALO:ODST co-op and tell me how that goes. It's criminal and damn near false advertisement because these games do not work as advertised."
18273,
18274,This is the best RPG out there. no question. Amazing story with memorable characters and tons of content. I have found myself coming back to this game again and again.
18275,This game is really fun but my only problem is I can't play with my friend because I have a mac :/
18276,Very good game!
18277,Very fun game and a childhood classic!
18278,"great game, always a huge fan of the borderlands franchise"
18279,"Super good, super replayable. Better with friends! The story's great and the voice acting is spot-on. Games are so much more enjoyable when you can feel how much fun the creators of the game had with it, and boy howdy, does this game ooze fun. 

Buckle up and have a good time!"

18285,It do be Pretty Worth
18286,One of the finest games i have played with my friends and enjoyed it every moment of it.
18287,"I love this game. Tons of guns,violence, and missions."
18288,I like how they bring back the characters from the first game but i ended up using a mod to give myself unlimited ammo and no reloading and just blasted everything with a rocket launcher.  Really made the game so much more fun.
18289,Very Bungis can confirm I would play again
18290,DO i have to say
18291,Witty and just plain fun to play!

18316,Funny as all hell. DLC is pretty good. Play this with some friends and laugh together.
18317,"Great shooter & looter. Story is lots of fun too and the jokes are epic if you like dark humour. Myriads of different guns and mods, plus different characters with different skills. I must have completed the game 5-6 times already, still tons of fun!"

18336,"This game never gets old.... however farming will take a while. i don't recommend doing op levels because the balance is all over the place  after the last DLC update. If you don't want to farm to get perfect gear, i also recommend the save editor mod"

18368,"""Immoral behavior must be destroyed."""
18369,"Pretty smooth movements, nice gun play. I just don't like the game's core. Has an okay story."
18370,"Absolutely enjoyed the game back in the day. DLCs are really amazing, especially Dragon Keep. Gameplay feels a bit outdated from todays standpoint, but still worth to play. Sad to see, that Borderlands 3  is not on par content or quality wise."
18371,Legendary.
18372,"i like this game, i just forgot about it."
18373,"I used to play Borderlands 1 on the Xbox 360 back in the day as a teenager and to be honest I didn't get much joy out of the game. Now it is 2021 and I thought to myself to give Borderlands 2 a try out, and for the most part this is a good game. I would like to try this game with other players so I did this playthrough on solo and I quite enjoy the challenge it have. I would recommend this game, also the music to this game is something fantastic."
18374,good art lol
18375,The best borderlands in the series!
18376,nice
18377,me like
18378,Fumnmny
18379,"When I bought it I had my doubts about the cartoon like graphics, it turns out it didn't bother me at all. The missions are crazy fun and the dialog entertaining. Many reviews do say many of the good things about this game so I won't go into that. Overall, it is a game worth buying.

That being said, while the game is cross platform, you can't easily play it in that way. The version on each platform is not in sync so you have to downgrade the Windows version if you want to play with someone on Linux.

The alternative is to play the Windows version in Proton (though deep down I bought the game to support native Linux game development)."
18380,good game

18405,A shooter game for people that don't necessarily even like shooters. There's plenty of story and world to explore. The characters and dialogue are the best part! You'll fall in love with every one of them (if you have a sense of humor).

18412,"This game is honestly pretty good, but gets stale after a while and it doesn't really have anything for you if you do a second run. but the core of the borderlands genre is still here.
This borderlands game is the one with the most solid story, character development and the best ""big bad guy"". The gameplay is good but isn't the best in the series, but bl3 story is a complete shit-fuck so we don't talk about that.
While i've done the main story thrice, i still have barely stepped into the DLC content, but from what i have heard it seems pretty good.
TL;DR:gun shooty, loot shiny, gamble at moxxi's i must.

8/10"

18419,"I love this game. My friend bought it for me on a whim because it was on sale and I enjoyed every moment we spent playing it together. Despite being over eight years old, the graphics still look great, and I really enjoy the simplistic artstyle. The humor is great, the characters are great, the gameplay is great. This has quickly become one of my favorite games. The only thing I didn't enjoy about it is that you can't fill out the skill tree in the course of the main story, which I have been told is possible when replaying the game."
18420,"This is so good, if you don't already have this, get it NOW, it is like $20 if not cheaper and its so good. The comedy is flawless, the game play is fun, the guns are unique, the story is just really good, and the pace is steady. But sometimes missions can be repetitive and annoying but it just makes the good missions. 10/10 almost perfect!"
18421,awesome

18423,"fun mindless, great to taking out the daily issues"
18424,pretty fun
18425,is fun really like story line
18426,"I don't understand why people like this game, it's literally the most boring game that I've ever played. Tried many times to like it, but it just doesn't work, there's a lot of weapons and a nice history and that's it? Because combat, mechanics, oh my god is so boring you can literally fall asleep while playing."
18427,best game ever
18428,"If you value your time, stay the fuck away. Aside from that its great"
18429,"The game was really enjoyable until the end of the story mission, it's a little bit grindy but never tedious, The combat was engaging, the overall gameplay was really fun, It's a really great game,"
18430,only got it to play with friends but they dont want to play
18431,For sure one of the best games i ever played and u need to buy it 10/10.
18432,"It's lit.

18433,Very fun with friends.
18434,Cool game
18435,It's pretty good
18436,"Game is fun and it made me feel good even when I am bad on shooting games. XD
Finished the main story and some side quest for 40+ hours, fun in multi-player mode.
Game is a bit buggy. I had an issue on my inventory and customization which sucks but overall, I really enjoyed the game!"

18458,"Gonna be completely honest here, DO NOT play this alone. it fucking sucks you WILL die over and over again. its extremely unbalanced and the leveling is complete bullshit. you need someone who knows the game to even enjoy it. ther combat suck and if i didnt pay for the bundle i wouldve deleted this game a long time ago."
18459,good game
18460,"The game would be fun if it wasnt a completely buggy and unsupported mess.  Despite having fixed my resolution, the screen spinning issue, and other settings.  Every update to the game completely resets all the settings to defaults and rewrites the ini files.  So every single update requires re-applying settings and fixes across the board.  The game is simply not good enough to be that much work."
18461,jumpy world
18462,Fun but old
18463,"Absolutely love this game. I've always loved the Borderlands Series but 2 is always the one I go back to. It's amazing. It's always a treat to build a new character in a unique way, play with your friends and just rain hell on Psychos and Marauders. Can't ever get enough of it. Easily a 10/10 masterpiece in terms of an open-world 1st person shooter."
18464,"Released in 2012, [i]Borderlands 2[/i] is the sequel to the positively received title [i]Borderlands[/i]. It is loot driven in a vein similar to the Diablo franchise, but has all the functionalities of a First-Person Shooter mixed with Roleplaying elements.

In my playthrough, i went solo with a Mechromancer that reached level 36 by the end of the DLC [i]""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep""[/i]. As such, keep in mind that your experience with the game might differ if you play in Cooperative Mode, or if you would play a highly different class (eg. Melee Zer0).

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay loop of Borderlands 2 is what is to be expected from an FPS: you run around in a variety of environments, shooting various bad guys in the face/body, with the aforementioned unconvential loot grinding system. The latter is one of three ways to theoretically spice up your gameplay, as each weapon has different statistics and a different purpose so as to not feel similar to one another. The other two ways are largely defined by your class and skill tree, each of which (i assume) providing unique mechanics to create your own playstyle.

Unfortunately, i feel like, even with the variety that is provided, the gameplay loop is too stale. If you would focus only on the primary quests, the game might be just about long enough as to remain enjoyable. I, however, did most of the MMORPG-styled side quests, which contributed to me burning out with the playstyle by the end of my playthrough.

[h1]Setting[/h1]
Ahh, the feeling of playing a borderlands game. The game has a very chaotic vibe to it. The world seems disorganised at best, with a single, most-powerful organisation/entity kind of holding the reins, but with no true law-and order system in place. Many groups and organisations run rampant across the game world, leaving all kinds of havoc in their wake. It is similar to Mad Max and Fallout with a post-apocalyptic vibe to it.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story of the game is good enough for what i would call a predictable tale. It shines in the cast of its NPCs; a bunch of the most varied and unique personalities you will meet in a game. The dialogue and script are enhanced with clever comedy, while still allowing room for serious moments. I found this to be especially true in the DLC i played.

Honestly, the writing and characters are main attraction points for the game. They are extremely well executed.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
I drew the short end of the stick in regards to the graphical fidelity of the game. I ran the game at close-to-lowest settings. At the very beginning of the game, my computer managed consistent 60 fps with the highest configuration, but as the game progressed i experienced more and more drops, especially during fights. In the end, i turned it down to low settings just to net myself a neat 60 fps gameplay experience again. I never bothered to figure out why the game behaved in such a fashion, as graphical fidelity does not matter too much for me, but i must admit i felt my eyes bleed looking at some of the low-quality textures in the game.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
I don't think i have encountered a game that has truly bad audio quality yet, and Borderlands 2 is not an exception to that. The sound of the guns are satisfying, voice acting is an all-time high in terms of quality, driving a vehicle, choppers flying overhead, creature noises, etc... it all makes sense.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Borderlands 2 definitely takes the quality of its predecessor to the next level. Whilst i noticed that the gameplay has remained largely similar, perhaps further adding to my burnout with it, the game has improved in most other aspects. The maps have received MASSIVE variation in comparison, which was another major issue for me with the first installment.

Without looking at its predecessor, Borderlands 2 is a very good game with only a minor gripe in terms of the gameplay loop's staleness, which i imagine can be avoided by playing the game in Cooperative Mode."
18465,Pretty fun with friends. The writing is absolutely horrible though

18473,Even in 2021 still an amazing game and very re-playable    :)
18474,"Borderlands 2 has a lot of playability and after completing the game, one can journey to the areas overlooked, attain weapons, relics/ artifacts, grenade mods and with the DLC that follow events post-game, an even larger adventure; 6 characters to choose from and customize. A lot to love... and blow up."
18475,
18476,"Pfft, only 348H. I am disappointed in myself, id easily hit 1000H sooner or later.

Just buy it, play all the different characters, level them up and try different runs and methods of playing. There is way to much to explore"
18477,"This is one of my fav games. So good that im writing a serious review ! The game even is extremely well made. 
The dialog, the way the introduce new characters, the powers of the characters and the boss fights are just great. I couldn't recommend this game more."

18488,"Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. Every time he closes his eyes, he's sees Charlie hiding in the darkness of the forest. Not that you could ever see those bastards, mind you. They were fast and they knew their way around the jungle. He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

Seven has a hook for a hand as well, which is very scary. Six is afraid of Seven because he is a damn psychopath."
18489,"i fucking love this game

"
18490,We need more villains like Jack
18491,"Wonderful game, unlimited amount of gameplay!"
18492,good game i get the funny weapons
18493,good game
18494,"Some fag trying to find vault then angry white men called jack try to kill u but hes noop and he die by purple women lmao
U fight big lava dragon and then kill jack cuz hes look retard
also thers fat lady that give u motorcycle"
18495,"It is not a great game, it is very average in its entirety and bad in many of its aspects. I want to highlight some of the negatives which are present in this game. Reviewers seem to universally fail to judge this game critically.

First of all, graphics are quite dated. Models are blurred, poorly detailed even for stylistic approach this game goes for. It also has an issue of certain models or cut scenes being completely blurred out showing poor graphical fidelity and lack of finish. In addition, despite game going for more cartoonish look, colours are very desaturated. It looks like Call of Duty Cartoon edition. Game just looks quite bad for a modern day video game.

Second issue is in its technical issues. You can't alt tab game without risk of crashing. From screen freezes to desync issues happening with alt-tabbing. Game is backwards to use, you can't just create character without going into new game and going through cut scenes. Game modes and settings are all done in a backwards fashion which makes it difficult to find something when needed. Furthermore, it does not allow to skip cinematics, so be prepared for a really slow start. Initial impression of this game in 2021 was quite poor, game aged poorly from technical standpoint.

Another problem is within game balance or rather lack of it. Game does not scale mobs according to your level and mobs have exponential power growth curve balanced according to your level or gear level with possibly flat multipliers in +10% damage done to you -10% damage taken according to their level. This forces you to grind sidequests and prevents you from doing main story quests. This raises additional problem that zones are level gated. Some zones are too hard or impossible while others become trivial. Mobs are not scaled to your level, but game requires you to grind sidequests. This means that there is precious little balancing done.

Map system is broken. There are list of all points you can teleport to. Their names are hardly memorable, there is no information which zone has what kind of mobs. It means that you have to go blind across zones. Even worse when game has DLC which it puts on a map like a common zone. This means that after finish story line, map is filled with marks and you literally can't find content you paid for. Even then this content has a serious problem of you needing to be of a very precise level. This means that you either know exactly when to go there or content simply is non challenging and it does not drop any gear for you.

Another issue is lack of decent gear. In roughly 30 hours of play during three player co-op we only got 1 legendary! That is quite shameful of loot shooter. Without golden keys itemisation would had been absolutely terrible. We got decent gear only because we basically cheated. In this game bosses drop nothing good. Loot system can drop very good thing for other classes, but you do not play them. There isn't even a proper stash to put away items for other classes. Itemisation in this game does not work at all and you will find yourself with boring weapons, being unable to get or farm weapons you want for your character and build. Weapons which you get are also quite boring as they lack special effects and combinations. The only combination was shotgun - sniper.... Yeah, game designers were terrible.

Lack of interesting characters. Classes in this game are just boring. They do not have much of dialogue nor they have interesting skills. You have ONLY 1 ability. This barely helps to make class identity and quite often your skill points are very boring. Put a skill point to do +2 weapon damage. Yeah, thanks, but no. System is very bad and it is a poor copy of better systems.

Story and writing tends to be quite bad. Quests go nowhere. At one point Jack starts talking about finding someone to be the Warrior, but that goes nowhere. We try to steal vault key only to forget about it halfway. Story is inconsistent and very forgettable. Dialogue is also very poorly written. We are supposed to care about Jack when we kill ""his baby girl"", but till that point he shown no emotion outside of ""evil"". It falls completely flat like most of the humour in this game. Writers tend to outdo themselves by making as silly and as wacky dialogue as they can. However, it falls flat, because it has no pacing. It is just joke after joke after joke. Characters try to be funny all the time and in the end they become flat and boring all the time. Furthermore, writing and jokes seem to be written for kids. Writing is extremely predictable and we could call all plot twists in advance. We could even tell what writers are going to joke about before it even happens. Writing is quite weak in this game and does not work for adults at all. However, game puts some efforts into it and that alone makes it better than nothing, it breaks complete monotony of a such game where you just grind, grind, grind.

While I'm being very negative here, my review is meant solely to highlight issues which this game has, because I can't seem to find anyone reviewing this game properly besides me."
18496,"Great game, fantastic storyline, what more do you want?"
18497,"idk why ,but it just didn't go well with me, i didn't draw my attention , just don't like the game"
18498,"I've played this before, trully fantastic
all I wish is it to not be a pest about Alt+Tab(ing) out of the game"
18499,One of the best games ever
18500,fun
18501,Yeah I bought the game and all the DLCs for like £8. So worth it
18502,"As of 2021 Its still one of the Best if not the Best Looter-Shooters out there, it gave quite an unique perspective of how loot works in games, because in this game It doesnt matter who where and why you kill, Pandora will reward you with something mostly cash money, or a brand new weapon, and with that comes a dopamine rush that will keep you playing while abusing these little rushes of dopamine to keep you playing, with as i said getting a new gun, or Beating that one boss that you just struggled so hard on.

I personally would recommend buying even today, as it holds it ground with its weird but beautiful graphics, game and most importantly Charachter Design."
18503,"It's what I go to when I want to shoot something in the face.
Great game!"
18504,"i remember pre-ordering this freshman year, and oh boy did it change high school me forever. this is about the third or fourth time i bought this game (i love it that much), and i'm still getting excited just thinking about playing it. i'm not an addict....."
18505,A great game with a different visual take on most. Well worth a go...
18506,"Does ""Comedy shooter with rpg elements"" sound fun to you? Then I would recommend this game."
18507,"Time consuming, Co-op, Amazing combat, Story driven, Choosable play styles, unique art style, memorable characters, badges + acheivments, awesome dlcs, secrets, and hilarious all in one. Easily one of the best games out there and so worth the money"

Even though the game was released back in 2012 it's just an awesome game, everyone should try it.

18526,Do you like min maxing builds and breaking the game with builds? Do you like breezing through the hardest difficulty which has turned off a fair portion of the playerbase from this game with a broken build you found on steam guides? Do you like farming bosses for op weapons? Do you like  goofy but entertaining and sometimes genuinely sad? Do you like funny ass sidequests? This is the game for you
18527,"Best game

18528,"best game in the series, lots of content and guns... lots of guns"
18529,the best!!!
18530,"Personally, I find Handsome Jack to contradict his name with his looks as he wears his absolutely atrocious outfit. Mans has no drip - 0/10 - I would recommend this product. If your reading this please get the man some drip, by playing the game."

18568,"WORST GAME EVER why would anyone spend a single dollar on this trash. if you consider yourself a decent human being you will stay as far away from this game as possible. sincerely, dissappointed."
18569,good i recommend to all first person shooter players
18570,"As anyone can see, I've sunk not a few playthroughs into this game haha. Perhaps the best shot-and-loot out there, with great guns, skill trees, and designs. The random weapon generation ensures that with every playthrough you get different favorite guns with unique properties. There are a number of really funny/crazy characters as well, my favorites being Hammerlock, Nellie, Torgue, and Tiny Tina, with Handsome Jack being one of the most enjoyable villains of any franchise ever. The comic book styling works very well. 

This game really isn't best played solo, as there are sometimes long stretches of running around as well as a few other boring parts. It's a good game to laugh at with mates. Also, this game has a lot of issues running fullscreen and tabbing out on Windows, so I recommend running it windowed.

In short, this is a solid co-op game and it is well worth buying it and all the DLC on a small sale."
18571,"fun, 
ya know."

18588,"Borderlands 2 is, in my eyes, a candidate for one of the best video games ever made. After being horribly disappointed by it's recent-ish successor I revisited the game and was reminded of how well-crafted  the experience really is. The story is a wonderful example of a well-written antagonist, the franchise's unique sense of humor still shines best in this title, and the wealth of gameplay is more than enough to keep one occupied for many, many hours. From my first playthrough with friends on PS3 to my current periodic excursions into the game, I don't think BL2 is a game that you are ever truely 'done with'. It offers an amazing time singleplayer and is even better with friends. Coming back to write this review in 2021 after a certain awful sequel made me realize how much of a gem this game really was."
18589,well made
18590,its a fun first person shooter and really enjoyable to play with people
18591,"I didn't know what I was missing. This game is a blast. 

Role-playing games are more my thing, and I am loving Borderlands 2.  Though it is a looter-shooter gameplay, it has a RPG vibe : story driven adventure, awesome music/ambiance, character customizations and skill choices.  Also really like the music with its western drama style with a funky or jazzy feeling (unlike other games where the music gets old). 

Just really fun to play.  In my first 20 hours, only one *side-mission* (Totem of Fire) got me bored or annoyed (in Frostburn Canyon).  I do not recommend the DLC missions. 

Price : I bought it dirt cheap with all the DLC (The Handsome Collection bundle). 
Tip : do not play the DLC missions until you finished the main game. 

Negative : one single autosave. I hate autosaves in general, but only one per character is worse. Trick: you can do manual copies of that autosave and there is a free software to edit the save if needed.

I should have played Borderlands 1 first.  I might still. 

( Nb : I do not intend to play Borderlands 3 though. Not enough time for all the games I have.)"

18625,"When you’ve managed to create an unexpectedly great first entry for a franchise, it begs the question: What the hell do you do with the sequel? In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.
The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun.

Guns really do make up the bulk of the loot, and that’s great because you’re going to spend most of your time in Borderlands 2 staring down a gun sight. No matter the quest, at some point something or someone is getting pounded with lead. Thankfully, snappy shooting and lots of environmental hazards combine with each class’s unique ability to turn every skirmish into a playground. You simply have to decide the best -- or most entertaining -- way to kill everyone.

While many guns operate similarly to one another, the stats and augmentations are just complex enough to create a seemingly endless number of combinations, without being so diverse that they’re hard to understand at a glance. You roll in, you kill anything that looks at you the wrong way, and then you walk around and look at items, utilizing the handy on-screen comparison tools to see if you’ve found something at all better than what you’re already holding. It keeps things from dragging, and drives you rapidly onward in the never-ending quest for loot.

Seeing as how Borderlands 2 takes cues from numerous RPGs, I still find myself disappointed with the lack of visual customization options (Borderlands 2 features the ability to reskin your character, but only with blanket skins that change the look of their body and their head). However, when it comes to class skill customization, Borderlands 2 is heading in the right direction. Like the first game, Borderlands 2’s four classes each have a unique ability. Unlike the original, though, a lot of options have been added to the skill trees to make it possible to create much more diverse builds...at least to a point. No matter what, every Commando will be about using turrets, every Gunzerker about raging out and blasting people with two weapons at once, every Siren about using a stun ability called Phase Lock, and every Assassin about temporarily cloaking and unleashing devastating surprise attacks. But how those abilities and characters function can be tailored to your playstyle (and can be changed over and over again for a negligible fee on a whim). For instance your Assassin might be focused on sniping and avoiding damage, while mine could be tailored to get in close and melee enemies while taking it on the chin. On the surface two people’s takes on a class might seem similar, but the new, more filled out skill trees allow you to create a version of a class that better suits your style.

Trying out skills and then reassigning skill points over and over is important in Borderlands 2, especially when you consider that you can play alone or with up to three other people. Grouping in Borderlands 2 makes the combat feel different; enemies get harder and you can use each class’s power to support your allies. The Commando could toss out a turret, drawing enemy fire while the Assassin closes in and pummels enemies to death, for instance. Since loot is shared you need to pick your partners carefully. Playing with strangers or super aggressive friends means you’ll likely find yourself in a race to see who can grab everything the fastest, and that’s really not all that fun. No matter how you feel about Diablo III, making it so each player only sees their own loot is brilliant design, and it’s a shame Borderlands 2 takes it in a route that means people are competing with one another.

If you want to take your character’s customization even further, Borderlands 2’s new Badass Ranking system gives you plenty of ways to work for it. A host of in-game challenges track things like headshots with a specific weapon class, or looting a large number of chests. As you finish each of these tasks for the first time, you’re given a token you can spend on a number of tiny boosts that affect stats like reload speed, recoil reduction and weapon damage. The bonuses per token are really small, but as you earn more than 100 of them, the benefits really start to add up. Best of all, these bonuses benefit every character you create, giving them a bit of a head start (you can turn it off if you don’t want the bonus). It’s another way Borderlands 2 makes you feel consistently rewarded, and it provides plenty of incentive to use weapons or play differently than you otherwise would.

Plot wise, Borderlands 2 is a direct sequel, with a story that picks up shortly after the first. You play one of four new Vault Hunters who’ve come to Pandora to hunt for – you guessed it – vaults. Unfortunately, since the opening of the last vault the planet’s been all but taken over by Hyperion Corporation and its insidious and somewhat charming leader, Handsome Jack. Through a number of events outside of your control, you end up getting wrapped up in a plot to stop Jack, save the world and help out some of the citizens and beloved characters from the first game.

The main story hits on notes you’ve probably encountered in hundreds of other games but, despite being clichéd and more than a little predictable, it’s still far more successful than in the original. Borderlands 2’s campaign narrative actually tells a coherent story, with endearing characters who manage to feel nuanced and real. At times the story can even be touching and heavy, though this is when it starts to feel a bit at odds with Borderlands 2’s overwhelmingly silly sense of humor. Ultimately, though, it’s a yarn worth hearing, one that ropes you in and makes you feel like what you’re doing has purpose – something the original game never really achieved.

The main story’s good, but the best writing in Borderlands 2 comes from the side quests. If you played and enjoyed things like the General Knoxx or Claptrap DLC from the first game, then you’ll be in for a real treat throughout Borderlands 2’s more than 30 hours of game time. Each time the main story starts to slow down, you’re almost always given a number of sidequests to jump into. Mechanically they don’t do anything all that different from typical RPG “kill this” or “collect that” fodder quests, but the writing, presentation, and acting turn them into some of the most memorable content the game has to offer. For instance one mission has you fighting off a “splinter group” of ninja-like bandits who just so happen to live in a sewer, eat pizza and talk like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Another side quest tasks you with collecting body parts for a robot who wants to become human, and his take on humanity, as well as the way he talks, turns into genuine comedy. Not many games manage to make me literally laugh out loud, but Borderlands 2’s mixture of gutter humor and sharp wit did so repeatedly."
18626,Good game. Great to play with friends and is cheap game.

18632,ONE THE BEST GAMES
18633,you suck. this is good.
18634,"For someone that doesn't play a lot of fps games, Borderlands 2 is not what I expected it to be. The game lets you choose how involved you want to be, as well as allow you to choose a character based on your gaming style (I know that sounds dumb to people who play fps games a lot, but it really makes a difference to us newbs). There are quirky optional storylines, and a main storyline that gets more fleshed out the more ""echos"" (basically mp3 files) you find. There are callbacks to optional quests that can be easily ignored if you didn't complete them, which makes the game more enjoyable. Save for some clearly OP/glitched enemies, everything feels scaled up to your level. I played 30 hours with my partner over less than a week, and I don't think we advanced that far into the main storyline itself, since there's so many optional things to go to (though it may feel repetitive sometimes since they're often in the same map you just finished in the main quest). Overall 10/10 would recommend"

18664,10/10 would play as the villain again.
18665,"Disclaimer: I only write a review once I 100% a game. Additionally I don't judge graphics and neither should you. Graphics don't matter. Proof? Dwarf Fortress, Stardew Valley, Among Us, Fall Guys, etc., etc.

What can I say about Borderlands 2 that hasn't already been said, written or drawn on Rule 34... Yeah... I mean especially nine years after the game has been released and Borderlands 3 has been out for a while too...

Well it's the founder of looter shooters, right? You shoot, you loot, you chuckle at some funny reference, rinse and repeat. Fairly mindless, as the entire FPS genre is, but the difference is this one is actually worth a crap. At least for a little while, it does get repetitive eventually.

The story is pretty good and a decent continuation of the first game and the art style is the signature Borderlands feel which is great. Also it includes Tiny Tina so that's a win.

I wasn't a fan of the elemental damage system, it simply doesn't work as well as you would expect, but then again I played primarily a Sniper Zero so I mostly just one shot crit everythig so maybe that's just me. Most of the UI works well, but there are certain parts of it that are simply idiotic. Why isn't there a ""Fill Ammo"" button at the vendor? The ""stash"" interface is also horrific.

Don't even get me started on compatibility. The game version is 1.8.4 on Linux, 1.8.5 on Mac and 2.0.0 on Windows. Now I generally would laugh at you if you decide to mainstream game on anything that's not Windows, but how can you half-ass a popular game so much that they don't even have the same versions? That means cross-play between PC platforms is all but impossible (there are workarounds, but not for the latest DLC).

There are too many god-damn DLCs and most of them are garbage. The Tiny Tina one would be amazing if it didn't have the worst enemies in skeleton types and the worst ""arena""-type quest. And to be fair I don't expect that to get any better with future games, considering Gearbox is now partially owned by an umbrella company.

It seems like I bash it a lot, but the main game alone is worth a playthrough and is indeed fun and entertaining. The rest is a questionable money grab, but can be fun, especially if you have someone to play with. But it all comes together in the Handsome Collection for like $10 if not less at this point, which includes the Pre-Sequel, so it's worth a purchase."
18666,Yes.
18667,"haven't played out the whole game yet but its pretty fun so far.

definitely worth it full price and on sale.


edit: if you haven't bought the game yet or haven't gotten far in please for the love of god try to grind and get some weapons and xp, if you don't you will be having a rough time further in the game."

18672,good sexy gamne
18673,Great game. I've played for about 8 hours and I am addicted. I like playing alone but I sometimes play with my friends too. I bought the Handsome collection because I thought it would be fun to play with almost all the DLC. And... I WAS RIGHT. The handsome collection is worth the 200$ although you should wait for a sale if you don't want to end up on the streets. I recommend it. IT IS PERFECT
18674,"Borderlands 2 is truly a great game, and I'm just 6 hours in. I bought it because The Handsome Collection was on a crazy sale and I wanted to try it. Needless to say, it was a good decision. Been playing with some buddies and alone and both is very fun. My only complaint is that there will probably be a lack of Golden Keys since Borderlands 3 is out. Very fun game, would recommend."

18682,"The game has aged like spoiled milk gameplay wise. It's definitely an upgrade from BL1 but unless you enjoyed it between 2012 to 2015 it's going to feel slow and not very fun for a newcomer. Also there might be a memory leak in the game because it has crashed twice now saying I ""Ran out of memory"" and just closes.

If you loved it before, you'll love it again. If you never tried it in the first place then don't bother now."

So I half wonder if I only liked the game because of the Pax experience I had with talking to the PR team at that time. I also remember this being fun with friends. Not sure the game has aged well, 2K Games hasn’t aged well and I suspect their only good at fan service and the illusion of creativity."

Firstly, I don't think it is a BAD game, just not for me. If you are into a hardcore shooter game than you will most likely like this, but I however did not.

[olist]

[*]Claptrap is annoying AF! Seriously F that robot!

[*]Enemies jump all over you. I enjoy a more tactical approach so being forced backwards just to stop enemies from jumping on my head is annoying AF!

[*]Expect to run out of ammo like all the time!!!

[*]Graphics (While pretty) make everything blend together. Can't tell the difference between an enemy and a loot box from a distance.

[*]Kind of grindy and boring...

If you don't mind all that, then you will most likely enjoy it as others do. I personally did not care for the game."

18756,By far the best borderlands. A huge variety in guns and enemies. no bugs to be found and holds up very well 9 years later. The online is very dead though so be warned. The only real downside is the story is not very deep but it's borderlands and isn't supposed to be the campaign is very funny with likable characters on the otherhand. There is hours of gameplay here and I have got all of the DLC which adds up to 100s of hours of gameplay. Would reccomend.

18797,"I feel a definite improvement over borderlands 1 (which I enjoyed alot). 

This game had so much to offer, especially for end game contents. Tiny Tina's Dragon Keep Assault was hands down my favourite DLC. 

I recommend playing this game after Borderlands 1 and Borderlands The pre sequel if you into following stories. That way you could probably appreciate the characters much more. 

Additional Note: If you buy the handsome jack collection, you will get all but 1 DLC, which is commander lilith. Quite disappointed that they decided to sell this DLC separately after giving it out for free initially."
18798,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize.

What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.

There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.

I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family.

For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious.

Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize.

I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.

18817,"Surely a landmark, gaming classic, Borderlands 2 is, in 2020, still a good-looking, very slick role-playing looter-shooter with engaging characters, a great antagonist in Handsome Jack, and a better story than most. The Tiny Tina DLC deserves special mention as one of the best of its type: a smart, funny, and often moving metagame that inspires affection for the main characters rivalling even mighty Mass Effect. BL2 has scarcely been off my game drive since it came out way back in 2012 and I've now lost count of how many play throughs I've undertaken. Admittedly, it's not the deepest or most groundbreaking gaming experience out there, but it is one of the most fun."
18818,"shooty-shooty, boom-boom-boomshakalaka"
18819,"It's like the action movie of video games; not a whole lot past the surface, but holy guacamole is there a lot of surface to keep your attention.

Quests and sidequests? Check. Getting lost and accidentally discovering a new enemy or some hidden loot? Check. Lots and LOTS of guns with all kinds of unique abilities? Oh quadriple check. If you're the kind of gamer who loves refreshing your inventory with things you found on your adventures, you'll LOVE this.

It's kind of so-so in the plot department, but to me makes up for it with a sense of humor that comes through from time to time (especially on sidequests), and the fact that you can play through a full campaign remotely with up to 3 friends (an absolute lifesaver right now because it gives you a chance to be social without risking your actual health).

Gameplay wise (especially if you're looking to capitalize on multiplayer), they made some small but significant tweaks in 3 that I think make it superior to this one. But if you care at all about understanding the plot, you have to play at least this one first."
18820,the game is epic
18821,"Chaotic and interesting, join the world of Pandora to kill so many crazy people and even befriend some.

18862,"This game is amazing.
Don't let my record of playtime fool you, I owned this game on my very first steam account and it really strengthened my gaming capabilities. This game has an amazing story and for a decently old game it still holds up. The game tries it's best to get the player hooked on it and it works for the most part, I know this from experience. The most frustrating things in the game itself is typically farming for a specific item with specific specs, or when the odd glitch gets in the way of a playthrough. I would recommend playing this game with friends for a much more satisfying and iconic experience. The DLC are great additions to the game and I also recommend buying them if you can.
TL;DR this is a fantastic game which is best played with friends, the biggest downside being the RNG in farming items.

11/10, Play this game."
18863,"One of the best FPS games, and it came out 9 years ago, I feel like that speaks volumes."
18864,"Simply second to none in the whole series. Aged like a fine wine. The only caveat is the pc performance where frenetic firefights can easily lead into inconsistent freezing and frame stutter. There you probably should turn of the PhysX but damn that goo, particles and cloth simulation."

BUT I can see why it might be a better game in co-op. I've been playing it solo, which is awesome at first but starts to get repetitive after a while. I'll have to recruit some friends.

It didn't help that my laptop has trouble running Skyrim and Fallout. I didn't have that problem with Borderlands 2 though, it's a fun game with plenty of extra content in the form of DLCs, and my laptop is able to run it, which is almost a miracle."

18935,"This game is absolutely legendary! The art style is unique and stunning, the atmosphere is amazingly captured by the landscapes and the amazing ambient soundtrack. The story is interesting and captivating, the side quests are really fun, the weapon choice is immense, you can play as 6 different characters with widely different abilities, driving is a blast and sort of makes you feel invincible, until you gotta hop out. You can also either play the game single-player, or have friends tag along during the whole experience.
I'd give it a 8.5/10, just because the 10 is reserved only for absolute flawless masterpieces."
18936,"Great game,Highly
reccomended. 
Thumbs up👍"
18937,"I got 1 play session per install and it would freeze on menu every time after that.

Did save me from the game of sifting through mountains procedurally-generated garbage guns to use on utterly interchangeable enemies while some marginally-amusing dialogue tries to hold me and friends who like it deny the pro-gen exclusively deluges shit."
18938,Fun game
18939,"After almost 131 hours on this game on PC, and another almost 1000 hours on console, I guarantee that you will get your moneys worth out of this game if you enjoy a very grindy experience. Many 'Boss' level characters have a limited drop pool of Legendary/Pearlescent weapons that they can drop, and to even get several of them, you are going to be seeing that particular boss many, many, many times for the PERFECT drop with the element/damage/magazine size/etc. weapon that you want. Same with Class mods, shields, and many other aspects of the game to build out your perfect character. 
3 different difficulties, with an additional 8 Overpowered difficulty options with the Digistruct Peak DLC. 
That isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's own share of problems.
The art style is Cell-Shaded, which can be a turn-off for a lot of people, the grindyness of the entire experience can get VERY very Very repetitive and as such is NOT for everyone. But if you enjoy Looter-Shooters like the Original Borderlands, Destiny 2, and even Warframe, you will absolutely LOVE this game."

18944,"Very addicting game, i have a crappy computer and it runs very well.
I suggest this if you like shooter games."
18945,"I know I'm only really listing what I disliked about the game but I still enjoyed it so I'd still recommend it.

In my review of Borderlands I mentioned the opening sequence and how it got me interested to play. Borderlands 2's opening was kinda meh...feel like I should also mention my starting experience. The game felt very dull, bland and old but that may have been because it started out in a mostly icy glacier. It feels like it was so long ago now but the scenery DOES change after some time passes!

::Dislikes::
- Assault Rifles STILL suck! I played Borderlands before Borderlands 2 and in my opinion, this series has by far the WORST Assault Rifles I have ever used in a game. Seriously, they're bad. Low ammo clips, high recoil.

- The developers added like 75% more explosive barrels and crap and you can bet that if you're standing behind cover then that's exactly what the enemy's are shooting at and they deal so much damage which brings me to my next point.

- The Shields STILL suck! I hate how they're just so worthless in this series, they barely block any damage.

- The Eridium currency system. So, if you've played Borderlands you know you could just buy ammo upgrades for all weapons at the Weapon shops and get Backpack upgrades from helping Claptraps. Not in Borderlands 2. In this game you have to find these little purple bars called Eridium which can be used to purchase upgrades for each weapon or backpack space. By the end of my run, I just had enough to max out my Sniper, most of my backpack space and a bit of Rockets and that's including me doing nearly all of the optional quests with that +5 luck artifact you get at the start if that helps. I also ended with like $200k because there's not really anything else to spend money on! (i am very glad that the devs lowered the cost of being revived though)

- The audio. By this I mean like how they made it so you have to be looking at the character talking in order to hear most of what they're saying. Dialogue keeps showing up during firefights. ""What's that you're saying Jack?! I can't hear you! Too busy to read the subtitles too!"" I kind of wish it had some kind of audio log thing since it kept doing that..one last thing on this is the enemies weren't all that interesting. Some memorable quotes from Borderlands were ""Ya gonna squeal before we cook ya?!"" and ""C'mon little one, time to die!"" but now I can't really hear them.

- Lastly...the worst thing in this game...the bane of my existence...the thing I hate the absolute most...those fucking THRESHERS!!! Too strong! Too many spawn all at once! Their critical spots are on the fucking sides of their heads! Caustic Caverns was literally Hell.
::::

So, in closing. My advice to anyone interested in playing is to play as the Sniper/Zer0 and keep one of each Sniper Rifle element in your backpack (Regular, Fire, Acid, Lightning and Slag) along with the regular variants of each other weapon. The point of that is in case you ever run out of Sniper Rifle rounds. Always have the Fire Rifle selected as it's by far the most useful versus most enemies you'll encounter unless you're going into an area you know is owned by Hyperion in which case you'll mainly be using the Acid Rifle. Lightning just like in Borderlands was fairly useless (Because Shields are just as worthless! Ha!). Regular doesn't rely on the enemy being weak to a specific element and...I mainly only used Slag to kill Goliaths and other tanky enemies."
18946,"One of the best games I've played. Ever. Fantastic gameplay, rich world, surprisingly great story, even greater villain. The writing is funny and witty without being overbearing (although not every joke has aged well). Overall, one of the best gaming experiences you can have."

I'm not quite done. I'd say about 50% but nevertheless I am thoroughly enjoying myself.

18993,"I can't believe I never wrote a review for this game because it is hands-down my favorite FPS ever.  I've played this game through solo twice and I've played it with a full team 1.5 times.  It's that fun.  Everything about this game is gratifying in my opinion.  The characters are fun, the story is awesome, most of the DLC is fantastic and the rest is still good.   The art is awesome.  The voice acting is on point.   I really cannot recommend any other FPS as much as this game.  And right now the full collection price is like 6 bucks?!  Get it."
18994,"I've started this game a number of time but I just don't find it engaging. The bullet sponge enemies and the pop guns make the shooting tedious, but not as tedious as the inventory management. I think the central story line is pretty solid, you love to hate Jack, but I wonder if some pruning of side missions/story road blocks would improve the experience. The side missions can be entertaining, but as I have stated the design of the weapons and enemies make them a chore. It doesn't help that I find most of the jokes fall flat as well."
18995,"This game is very fun (at times), I had a blast with some of the missions in the game but it just has too much level gating and content filler I find. The campaign is like 2h long if Gearbox got rid of the level gating, and there is too much content filler. Pretty much every main mission goes like this -> go somewhere to find out where the big bad is or where to find something or finding something -> something happens that prevents you from continuing and you need to get an item -> go get that item -> come back -> spend 5m finishing the mission after spending a while getting the item. Not all missions are like this however, there are a lot of fun ones. The final boss is quite satisfying and the Warrior & Jack are awesome bosses. I just really wish the level gating and content filler wasnt a thing. If you are going to get this game PLEASE buy the handsome collection, it comes with the pre sequel and all dlc for pre sequel, and this game with all dlc. The DLC is very fun, ive only done ""Torgues Campaign of Carnage"" which is very fun but I do know from seeing videos with some of the DLC it looks promising. I would recommend getting this game, but only when its on sale since steam likes putting it at full price for GOTY (its on sale quite often)."

19006,Game is pretty good play.

19008,"The Borderlands saga has been, in my honest opinion, the most beautiful marriage between the FPS and RPG game genres. The two playstyles dont normally blend well, but gearbox managed to somehow get it."

19016,nice
19017,"Great game, released in 2012, but still holding op really well. You can play the game alone or with up to 3 friends and it has a lot of replay value."
19018,fire
19019,All around fun game from my childhood that still holds up today. Co op is amazing and the custamization is great aswell.10\10

19027,I played hours of Borderlands but try as I might I just couldn't get Borderlands 2 to click. There was something fundamentally different that I couldn't place or explain. However having recently picked it up on sale on the PC I'm happy to say it seems to have stuck. Perhaps it's the mods?
19028,"this game hits the chungus button on my heart <3
"
19029,"Awesome fucking game! stories great, combat great"
19030,So good
19031,"Borderlands 2

Great Boss Fights
Cool Easter Eggs"
19032,one of the best games ive played lol
19033,This game has replay value.  The multiplayer experience is also quite fun.
19034,"Opened up the game, chose a character to play as, spent thirty minutes doing generic duck and cover shooting, opened the menu to figure out my character's special ability, saw the mess and immediately quit."
19035,"Much better than Borderlands 3, and less gay"
19036,The game to own
19037,With a matching grip!!!
19038,yet again i has this on 3 consoles ffs
19039,yeah
19040,good times
19041,"It's replaytble
"
19042,GOOD AF
19043,"I have played the Borderlands series for around 7 years now and have finally made the transition from Xbox to PC, however I am playing Mac OS. I was thoroughly surprised when the game booted and ran smoothly, I have now completed several play throughs on different characters, including beating all the raid bosses. Masterpiece of a game and i would recommend anyone who has never played this game to give it a chance and play through the whole game and all the DLC's. Truly exceptional."
19044,gets me moist every playthrough
19045,kewl
19046,it's way better then borderlands 3 the story at least
19047,yeet
19048,KEEWL
19049,nice
19050,"Very fun game with friends!
Guns..Guns..Guns..!

And the comedy and humor... :D Brilliant!

[But please let me strap claptrap too one of tiny tina's rockets and send him off! Can't stand him!]"
19051,It got gun
19052,"Just play it already 
"
19053,"Very fun to play with your friends, would not recommend to play alone, The Handsome Collection is the ideal bundle if you want the DLC. Combat is smooth and the Fight for Your Life system is great, I almost never came across the same weapon in my playthrough and as you get closer to the end the loot gets crazy."
19054,Would 100% recommend. THE best looter shooter ever made. Yes I'm telling you this game is better than it's sequel and YES I am telling you that you should buy this game! It's really good and has a ton of replay value. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game!
19055,"tldr: good game even without dlcs

Is the best borderlands game for some and thats understandable.

for me I liked tps better (EVEN THO i PLAYED IT LESS). 

this is the best bl for learning inventory management and play styles, and no element is pointless at all this is great."
19056,i'd fuck mad moxxi

19095,"Honestly, there's not much I can say about this game that y'all don't already know. It's had so much damn hype, and for good reason. It's fun, it's funny. I'm still early yet, I think, but it's fun as hell to play with friends. The characters are engaging and the customizations are varied without being over-complicated. Overall, a decent action RPG. 

The single-player campaign play style does feel considerably more MMORPG-like than a typical story-driven RPG. I don't find it super immersive in that way, but it's still fun and funny. Just something to keep in mind."

19116,"Awesome game! I had so much fun playing this with a friend. Excellent customization on the guns, exciting game play with plenty of cool fights, and the art style is beautiful. Add a captivating story, and you have an excellent shooter. I would recommend this game to everyone."

19123,A timeless masterpiece. The best looter shooter out there.

19136,"Quick and easy fun to play together, with memorable characters that are worth a few good chuckles. Lost track how many times I've played it through. They did a good job making it easy to join on friends - literally just start playing, and friends can join on you."
19137,"good solid game
"
19138,mhmm
19139,met a very close friend playing this game. very fun if you want to kill time fs
19140,"this game is absolutely amazing, mainly a game to play with others. but i've been playing alone, and i still have a grand time. what seems like millions of different weapons and variations, it never gets tiring. defeating bosses that drop the funniest, coolest, and most random loot. i highly advide to get this game and see where the story takes you."
19141,good
19142,Fun
19143,"bought this game when it was new on ps3, got this gaming laptop a few years back (i7/1070) and after putting 1500hrs into ps3, thought id get it here on a sale and give pc gaming a whirl. 

with how varied the FPS can be, i dont much like the performance, though the max settings difference is a lot better that what the ps3 could dream of lol. 

seeing as the game is like 8 years old now i dont see a need to say a lot about the game itself, other than its as amazing as all the legends say, jack still has one of the best character progressions ive ever seen, and the game undeniably has all of the guns it says it does
"
19144,"God I love this game. 1 was really good, but 2 just took the awesomeness of 1 and ramped it up with more polish. In terms of game play, world building, story, and visuals, Borderlands 2 is truly one of the best games ever made. So much content, and near infinite replayability."
19145,Why is the game crashing every 40 min and i need to restart my computer to do anything again????
19146,love the whole  series. recommend for all to play
19147,"I cannot recommend the game; I find myself completely unable to.
The actions of the company that made the game are just too damning; some of them were actually illegal like harassment and fraud, and they got away because money>law.

I still played the game, I had already spent the money before hearing on it and they already had my money, even though I wish I never bought it. Not the kind of person to cut my nose just to spite my face. To be fair, I didn't get to finish it. After a while, I had enough of it; got too powerful, no challenge to be had.

I'll never get anything out of them anymore. I will not finance people threatening old ladies, intimidation of critics, outright lies for the sake of money or any other mafia practices.

This is an unfair review and I realize it; but out of leaving an unfair review OR supporting unlawful practices; I have to pick the lesser evil."
19148,My dad just got into shooter games and I'm hoping to rebuild my old laptop so he can have this game to play. He seems so intrigued whenever I play it and sits and watches me play with friends while I'm visiting. We lost a lot of bonding time through my teen years and into my adult years. I would love to be able to bond over his new found love of games with him. The story is great but Borderlands has always been a game to reunite with friends. My boyfriend got me into it while we were in a LDR for 4 years and ever since it's been a chance to connect with my sister from far away. This game plays well and some of our beloved characters from the first and second one continue to pop up in the story line. Best played with an external hand controller.
19149,"best in the series, one of the greatest games of its type"
19150,"Actually one of the best game out there, it as a really long lifetime and even after 1000 hours on both of my accounts combined i'm still not bored, i highly recommend it.

If you don't play this game, then you miss so many things! This game is fun. I mean realy fun. Technicly great game too. Unreal Engine 3 still show awesome graphics too.
History nice, NPC's are absurdly funny, sounds and graphics good too.
It is timeless. You should play it.

Searched the web and found that many people have this problem since at least autumn 2020. Uninstalled this sh*t until the devs repair this mess. Won't buy any Garbagebox game again. Bye.

Don't buy this until you can't find any complains about this error on the web."

19200,This game is a classic!
19201,good
19202,"Amazing game. Been playing since release, over a hundred days on characters on PS3. Unique graphics, seemingly endless content, engaging combat, easily ran, and you can play it however you want. I don't usually come back to most games, only a handful, and this is a top contender."
19203,Yes
19204,sure.
19205,"This game is really good, no doubt about it. The story, combat, quests, characters, jokes, everything just makes this game absolutetly amazing. I played as Zer0 for my run, and I had a blast with him, and the lines he says are always pretty fun.
Now whether you believe a long game is a good or bad thing, I can tell you that this game is for sure long, very long. Now to be fair, this is only because I was trying to complete as many quests as possible, although I imagine thats how a lot of people would play first time.
I will say this, the difficulty feels random at times, and will go from very easy, to very hard, which sometimes can provide a fun challenge, but usually it just annoys or bores you depending on which side of the spectrum it lands on.
Overall, this game is really good and the very few problems it does have are very minimal. 9.5/10

(P.S. The game is suprisingly stable as well, I never experinced a crash while playing the base game.)"

19239,"Much harder than BL3. Handsome Jack is pretty cool. To the ones who prefer this to BL 3 because it has a better story: you know you aren't being that honest. Admit it. You love BL 2 mainly because it's much grindy than BL 3. You don't even get the first genuine corrosive gun till you are well past level 18 or even level 20. You constantly find yourself needing to find better guns because any ordinary enemy, not even badass can cost you one whole magazine of bullets out of a decent rare gun. Gun is never good enough, and ammo is hardly ever enough. It's exactly like Diablo 2. This game won't start  to feel remote fun till you have invested well above 100 hours into it if you play solo. Be prepared to be farming if you play it solo."

19257,idk what to say just a really fun game
19258,"Borderlands 2 is in my opinion the best one in the series. Over the years, it has been polished to perfection, well, mostly. It offers you great playable characters, enjoyable story with a good written antagonist, a lot of different guns and loot in general, which translates to amazing farms, and it offers a challenge for those who seek it in the form of OP levels and great raid bosses (apart from Master Gee of course). Talking about the OP levels, they can be a little imbalanced. They were okay-ish back in the day there were only 8 but nowadays with the 10 of them, they tend to get a lot messy with the scaling and all. Anyways, you may choose not to do OP levels at all if you wish so.
If you like games with a lot of different loot, RPG elements, lot of different viable characters and builds with great bossfights and challenges to conquer, you won't hate Borderlands 2."
19259,better than cyberpunk
19260,"Get some friends and some DLC, and you're set for an adventure of your life"

19278,"F*cking Amazing Game, it may seem like a normal shooter, but goddamn, you will want to play this game over, and over, and over again. I don't even know how to describe the game, it is so original it's in its own category. I promise you, if you buy it, You won't want to stop playing it"
19279,good game
19280,in my top 5 games of all time
19281,YES
19282,It is very fun with friends and if you don't have any (like me) you can still play solo and it will be fun. the story is amazing and the game is just generally amazing! But if you gonna get this game just buy the handsome collection it's cheaper then the game plus you get all dlc's with it.

19293,"It's an old game now but its one of those old but gold, definitely the best story out of all the borderland franchise games and an epic villain that will be very, very, hard to beat in future installments I have played this game a lot and I am dragging my girl into playing it with me again since she wants to play 3 with me. so if you want to play 3 definitely start with 2 you will not regret it and its pretty cheap nowadays"

19314,very nice
19315,Perfect
19316,"é muito bom ;-;
IS A VERYGOOD ;-;"
19317,"First game is better, story is a rehash and to play the new characters you need to pay for a DLC."
19318,One of the best games I have ever played. Worth getting in discounted bundle. Also better    than BL3.
19319,this product is one of the best games i have ever played.
19320,"Borderlands 2 really irks me. Here’s why.

This isn’t because I’m incredibly bad at the game or anything, but the games difficulty curve really switches up fast after the first play through. Because of this, you’ll need to optimise your build with whatever class you’re playing as. 

Personally, I shy away from harder games as I find video games as a medium to escape from the harsh realities of life and to at least get one win under your belt. If you’re into things that get progressively harder, then you’ll probably like Borderlands 2.

Besides this, I do recommend the game for the storytelling and gunplay. Shooting weapons in this game is incredibly satisfying and could be compared to the satisfaction of other games like Destiny 2 or Call of Duty: Warzone.

Nevertheless, pick this one up on sale with all the DLC."
19321,This game is like a luau at Mel Blanc’s house
19322,Fun
19323,good
19324, claptrap
19325,Late to the party but a ridiculous game
19326,yeah
19327,yee
19328,"I didn't get the new DLC while it was free now my game is downgraded.
Level 72 character no longer has access to the Overpower levels even though it's decked out with OP8 weapons.
It effectively blocked me from one of the features of Digistruct Peak."
19329,"Over 600 hours across all my platforms, so it only made sense to get it on Steam as well!"
19330,fuuuuun
19331,YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY NEW MEAT BICYCLE!!!!!
19332,"We wouldn't have Borderlands 3 if this game in question, Borderlands 2, wasn't as good as a lot of fellow fans of Looter-Shooters claim. 

Story: The plot is meh at best, it is a basic plot about revenge and revolution against a gigantic corporation. The planet of Pandora is filled to the brim with bandits, psychos, and beasts that stand in your way. You're a Vault Hunter ""hired"" by the game's main villain, Handsome Jack, who is a self-proclaimed savior of Pandora by massacring anything he wants. Of course, you're going to be the one of up-to-four hunters that can stop this sexy bastard from annihilating the ravished civilizations on Pandora.

Music: It's decent, nothing to write home about. BL3 hits the bullseye though.

Gameplay: The gunplay in BL2 is a bit archaic, but it is still fun and satisfying to shoot psychos in the face then rob em. The manufacturing brands of the game are not exactly balanced: You pretty much should be using Jakobs. BUT the drop rates of weapons in the vanilla game is abyssal, the grind for legendaries is simply too exhuasting. Also, the endgame aka the OP levels of New Game are so heavily reliant on one element: Slag, so try to play with friends or start a new character if you don't want to enter OP hell.

Verdict: You'd be stealing a great deal should you ever get BL2 on sale or better yet when the Handsome Collection is on sale. It might not be as well tuned as BL3, but BL2 has its own charm and a better story imo.

8/10

19333,Excellent
19334,good game
19335,Cartoonish graphics are terrible...
19336,good
19337,"Borderlands 2 is still an absolutely masterclass in the looter shooter genre, it is the rule-book in loot, design, bosses, story telling, and tone. 
Although it's sequel and even predecessor do things better, this is overall the best Borderlands and perhaps Looter Shooter ever made."
19338,yes very crack indusing game
19339,gg
19340,"Borderlands 2 is absolutely great game. It has unique graphics and very unique characters. You can get a lot out of the game playing solo but it will be more fun to play with friend(s).
There is good humor and references in the game. Some characters and missions have nice reference names.
I first bought this game on Xbox360 when it was released and I have played it almost 2000 hours in total and the first Borderlands for almost 600 hours.

In my opinion the game has aged well and is still very playable. I also recommend buying the dlcs because they bring a lot of nice content to the game.

My opinion of the game is 9/10. Anyone who enjoys loot shooters and likes unique graphics and humor I recommend to try this."

19349,"Unreal game, great story with one the best villains of all time. Witty and hilarious at every turn. Great DLC to boot. If you're new to Borderlands you couldn't ask for a better version than Borderlands 2! 10/10 all day."
19350,very nice
19351,best co-op game and solo game with a good graphic and fps
19352,"Really, when you consider it as a whole package, this game is nothing short of a triumph. It's been out for 8 years, yet people are still playing it, and even better, players are still discovering the joy of the Borderlands franchise by jumping into its strongest entry. The game is positively massive, but it's still being ported to new consoles (Switch), and the cel-shaded graphics mean it holds up against even modern games. What other game that's been out for 7 years got a new, large DLC (Commander Lilith) and an entirely new weapon rarity? And then it got an HD textrue pack while its predecessor got a remaster.

There is just a staggering amount of content here, and if you can get it on deep sale (which happens ALL the time), it could very well take over your life. To be clear, even after all this time, this game is still worth It has 6 campaigns to play (Main story + 5 large DLCs), plus 5 bite-sized DLCs with great farming locations and loot, an endgame horde mode, a repeatable raid-like challenge in Digistruct Peak, two totally new DLC characters that have wildly different playstyles, plus near-endless replayability which comes in the form of minor quest decisions and divergent skill point allocation. It's possible to build into a couple different playstyles on each character, each of which feels viable for at least Normal and TVHM. 

I've read that Gearbox set out to make a Diablo-esque style of game but in the first-person shooter space, something that had an endless loop of fight, loot, build, increase difficulty, then repeat. Something that rewards long-term player engagement but still requires some of the 'skill' required in a first person shooter. Everything reflects this sentiment, that it's possible to grow infinitely stronger but also that there's always something more to learn about the skill point mechanics, a different weapon behavior to master, a new boss to learn how to farm quickly. 

Other looter-shooters exist, sure, but there's just nothing quite like Borderlands. This is the best one, by far."
19353,game good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

He flies outside the hive for the first time and talks to a human (Renée Zellweger), breaking a cardinal rule of his species. Barry learns that humans have been stealing and eating honey for centuries, and he realizes that his true calling is to obtain justice for his kind by suing humanity for theft."

19370,"It isn't irredeemable shit like the first.
That's the only thing good about it.

The writing is horrible. Every character is a ridiculous caricature. Whoever designed this garbage didn't feel the need to add depth to anything and just make everyone as likable and interesting as the lolsorandumb bandits trying to murder you in the desert.

Gameplay is fun with friends and if everything is brand new, but there is absolutely 0 replay value. Apart from your character's lines and the off-comment from the bandits, your class doesn't matter. You have skills to separate you from the other hunters, but the gameplay is the same and nothing changes between characters. It's like World of Warcraft but without the class and race quests. You all start in the same place and have to do the same quests.

Tiny Tina forced me to turn my review negative."

19419,I've decided to start putting reviews on games after 17 years on Steam.  This game is good enough that I bought it twice.  Thank you for your time.
19420,haha kreig go raaaa
19421,"Absolutely phenomenal game that will forever be a classic. It excels at doing everything that a sequel needs to. It builds upon everything the first game did and makes it even better. While it can seem slow at a few points, it's still dumb fun in pretty much every aspect. The gameplay is spectacular and it isn't hand-holdingly easy like a lot of games nowadays, and the graphics still look great 8 years after release, despite the fact that it's been remastered twice. It's a great time if you're playing solo, but obviously it's even better if you play co-op. Most of the bosses are really fun to fight, especially the raid bosses. Fantastic story with masterful writing from Anthony Burch that features, in my opinion, one of the greatest video game villains of all time. Handsome Jack is charismatic, compelling, and hilarious, and after playing the Pre-Sequel (and a particular side mission in Borderlands 3), is easy to sympathize with. It's almost hard to hate the guy. Combine all of this with 4 fun and unique playable characters (6 including DLC) that each accommodate almost every play style and have engaging personalities and backstories that make you love them even more. Even the characters you meet throughout the story (and the ones that return from the first game) are very well-written and lovable. Weapons are fun to use and a joy to dive in-depth with. Each DLC is great too, especially Torgue's Campaign of Carnage and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Those 2 alone are the best DLCs in the entire series. Tiny Tina's can almost be it's own standalone game because of how unique it is. If you're looking to buy it, GET THE GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION. It includes all DLC in it. There's plenty of content in it for the price. However, I do think that Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary should be free, if not $5, because that DLC alone is not worth $15. It's still fun though, and does a good job at bridging together this game and Borderlands 3. This game will forever remain in my top 5. So many memories. Just hearing the intro song, Short Change Hero by The Heavy, is almost enough to make me shed a tear."
19422,6/10
19423,i love all the borderlands and jack is the best villain in game history and this game had the best claptrap and i love all the fun guns in the game plus its really funny
19424,"Still one of the best shooter-looters ever made. Solid gameplay mechanics and, candidly, a better story than either of its sequels."
19425,Makes me wanna look up claptrap rule 34. Would recommend :D
19426,its fun
19427,So im trying to play this game but this one player keeps kicking my ass
19428,"My boyfriend used this as my introduction to first-person shooters, and it's a really good game to start on! The learning curve is a little higher, but it's not too hard to figure out the controls and the choices of guns, characters, and side missions makes for a very interesting playthrough! For first-time users, I'd probably go for either the Assassin or the Siren choices; I've used both and they're pretty easy to figure out. (Plus, with the Assassin, you can just sit and snipe people from behind cover. X) If you hate confrontational fights, he's a good choice to pick!)"
19429,all borderlands games are good fps shooters and they are really lengthy games
19430,Love this fucking series!
19431,"I mainly played this game on playstation, and a little on xbox, i must say i really like the pc version, this is one of my favourite games and definitely worth buying"
19432,"I only have about 200 hours on the pc version, but i also played this game for years on end on xbox 360, and xbox one. so i maybe have more like 20 to 30 thousand hours on the game.

but yeah it's ok, i guess."

19434,no
19435,allright but sometimes the system dont let me play with friends LOL

[b] A GAME THAT GOES BEYOND ITS BORDERS [/b]

Borderlands 2, developed by Gearbox Software, is an action game in the FPS genre with its unique graphics.

The first game brought a new breath to the game world by combining different graphics, fps, and RPG elements. With its variety of weapons and shooter looters, Borderlands has become a game that players will enjoy playing single or with friends.
Hyperion company, which is the manufacturer of the weapons in the first game, sends an H-shaped spaceship to that region after hearing that there is a more abundant vault than the riches in Pandora.
The company puts the Handsome Jack in charge, who discovers that he can control the eridium supply of this mineral extraction mission.

19449,"THIS GAME IS MY COMFORT GAME

i got this from a friend on x360 back in 2012, after playing for days and days perfecting my build, finding new bosses, new gear, random guns, this game hooked me from the start,

fast forward, i was talking to a friend  on the XONE saying a borderlands remaster would be amazing then got announced the next day, so me and my friend played like old times again! trying new builds, challenging ourself, it was great reliving old memories in updated graphics, 

now im a pc gamer,. im playing the game once again. trying allegiance builds. perma death runs, anything i can think of!

this game has tons of character, amazing story, great lore, the best villain of all time, and just down right hilarious.

i had 21 days on xbox 360, then 34 days on xbox one, and as of now i have 40+hours on pc.

TLDR, after over 1360+ hours. i am still enjoying the game, finding new things, new builds, secrets, 

BUY THIS GAME. THANKS KIDDO <3

19450,the comic book art style along with the humor makes for a GREAT game

19452,Good game
19453,"In this game there are a lot of guns and you can shoot a lot of things with them.

 The games got a pretty good sense of humor and its got a pretty good story. There is quite a bit of DLC to work through, but I think you could get a good experience out of the game without it. The games a bit older so I would probably suggest waiting for a sale on steam to buy it unless you really want it. I would also suggest getting the DLC for the game and if the GOTY edition or whatever goes on sale try to convince your friends to get it too. The game is more fun with friends, but doable solo too. Sometimes this game is frustrating and maybe a little boring. the combat gets a little stale sometimes but there is a pretty good variety of enemies that can keep things interesting. The games got some good writing and some cool characters If you played borderlands 1 and liked it you'll probably like this one. Even if you didn't play the first one you'll probably have some fun too

7.5/10 Its a fun game.
"
19454,"Having played this for roughly about 300 hours across my consoles and now my PC, I can safely say that this game is an absolute gem that most of the people who I know that played it will agree is the best in the series."
19455,one of my favorite games still

19457,Farming For Hours BB ^^
19458,Good.
19459,i just love claptr4p
19460,hell yeah tons of guns and they all go boom
19461,i think its fun to play you can play 1 player or more
19462,"I'm using my first steam review to act as a warning for how Gearbox are currently unable to fix their servers. Currently this game in not playable in Co-op, which, to me, is the best way to play the game.

Edit:
This is now fixed, but the service is flakey at times. I have left the issue below, but the game is working, so changing to recommended. But beware


It's a shame, because otherwise I love this game and had recommended it to friends recently. However I recently convinced two friends to get the game so we could all play together, and the functionality is not even working.
Edit:

It is two days later and although ShiftSupport claims the service is fixed, crossplay between Epic and Steam via Shift is still not working. The game is still fundamentally broken through patches because of the broken epic integration."
19463,I am just here to say gaige is the best
19464,"Amazing story, plus fun sidequests, multiple playthroughs are fun, and DLC is worth getting."
19465,Great game with hours and hours of game play. Plenty of extra DLC's to keep anyone happy. The highlight is being able to play the complete game in Co-op! Humor is great through out and if you liked the first BL you will love this one too!
19466,great gameplay smooth and it has many options and weapons and humor
19467,"i have metaphysical retardation, and i think this game is perfect."
19468,love loot
19469,very fun. reminds me of a time when my parents were still together.
19470,"play game
"
19471,"Epic integration has completely broken the game. Can't get past the main menu, and numerous name changes through shift do nothing. Good job gearbox"
19472,<3
19473,"It's the best full Borderlands experience money can buy (especially when the Handsome Edition is on sale for like $6, buy it then!)

1 is too shallow

Pre-Sequel has pretty bad writing and lots of lame filler content

And 3 has the best gunplay of the series, but it's also upwards of 5 times the price as the Handsome Collection when it goes on sale (it also has some of the series' most annoying characters constantly shoved in your face)

So yeah, play 2. It's pretty fun with friends, you shoot a lotta dudes and loot a lotta guns. The jokes are actually funny in this one too! (Well, some of them are pretty bad haha, but a good chunk of them are funny!)"
19474,"the shift drm has rendered this game unplayable for me, what were they thinking?"
19475,"Borderlands 2 is the classic looter shooter, very easy to get lost in the multiple campaigns that the game and it's DLC offers. I'll be honest, some of the humour of the game can be a little immature and/or repetitive but this in no way holds back the game as a whole. The eccentricity of this game shows that gearbox clearly put their hearts and souls into this game. Its an great game with unique art style and a sense of humour that sometimes falls flat. Overall a great experience made better playing it with friends."
19476,"I downloaded the game, and right away it requested a ""shift"" name, I didn't think much of it, but then when I sued my very unique steam username, it told me that there was an internal error, I didn't know what that meant, so I looked it up, some people said that there might be a problem with my firewall, but that wasn't it, others said I just had to link a shift account, that didn't work either, so until someone tells me how I can actually play the SINGLE player part of this game, I don't think anyone should be scammed by this."
19477,I JUST FOUND MYSELF A SHINY NEW MEAT BICYCLE
19478,great game tons of fun... huge worlds... the bad guys are super hard to kill ... motivates you to get better guns... its all about the guns 17.5 million variations...
19479,Great game
19480,good ig could be better
19481,Shift ID stopped soft locking the game
19482,"I've bought this game on every device that I own and didn't mind buying it one more time once I got a decent computer to play it on. While the other games in this series have amazing qualities to them, this one just has to be the best in all around quality in comparison. I can't wait to sink more of my free time into playing this game once again but this time on PC."
19483,"There was an internal error setting the display name.  

;/"
19484,Shift is a piece of useless crap... internal name error and cannot play the game I bought... Never touching a game from this company anymore
19485,good
19486,one of my favourite games of all time
19487,oh fuck this game grabbed me on the 360 and its still as good

19511,"Love it, can't put my enthusiasm for this game into words. So much replayability with characters that actually have a character unlike other self insert shooter looter characters."
19512,you'll spend 1567 hours getting that legendary you always wanted for it to only have shite parts

19542,"STILL the best Borderlands game to this day. if 3 is a 10/10, this is and 11.5. I LOVE KRIEG!!! We will never have a character like him ever again unless they bring him back which I hope they do. Best borderlands game. Must own. 10/10."

19544,good good
19545,this is a very fun game to play with friends and solo
19546,"I've own this game on PS3, Xbox 360, Ps4, Xbox One, and even Switch. I didn't even own most of those consoles. This is a great game that you need to own."
19547,"One of the best shooters iv played in a long time and the writing is superb, if you have never played any Borderlands game this is the one you need to try!"
19548,Very Dissappointing to me.
19549,"you are the villiain i am the goddamn dhhero
"
19550,This game came out 8 years ago and is still somehow the greatest looter shooter ever released.
19551,Badass Loader!
19552,"Borderlands 2 is a clear improvement over the first game in ever way, from the overall attitude, tone, and theme -- which is carried to new heights of hilarity and over-the-top inappropriateness in this sequel -- to the graphics, levels, and gameplay, all of which are extremely satisfactory. Loot is tighter, each gun feels more unique and more powerful; action skills are more varied, offer different unique play styles than those in the original Borderlands, and are supported by much better-balanced and fun-to-explore skill trees. 
Compared to the first game there is a lot more content and most of it is interesting, this time around there is an actual plot to the story. There have been quite a few improvements made to the coop play which make it a lot easier to find and get into games. Also the ability to trade and store items makes things a lot more manageable for your loot. Small problems, like the lack of minimap outside of the menu, that were present in the first game have mostly been fixed and the game feels a lot more polished. The drop-in drop-out cooperative play is seamless and certainly adds to the experience, though unlike the original Borderlands, the sequel is actually playable as an individual; additional players simply add to the fun. The game is worth the money, overall, but more so, I think, to the Borderlands franchise fan."
19553,UHHH big pew pew gun but big pew pew damage but need dlC!!11~!111!!11 make sure have yes good grub game made me do thinbgs that are pwoggers need friend too no have frind? got o tinder get big friend ; ) make sure not under 18 tho big issue if u are but yumn yum game

19555,one of my favorite games
19556,funny game great with mates
19557,Crazy Man Buzz-Axe go BRRRRR
19558,"This is a first person shooter gamer's need, a game that to this day I still have a hard time finding anything to complain about.  All the classes are fun and unique, the story is interesting yet consistently funny, the randomized weapon system makes every play through fun, and I have shared many great memories with people I've played co-op with."
19559,It's a great game with good tasks that keeps you entertained. A classic!
19560,everything is amzing
19561,gives me succy suc
19562,About time Snake!
19563,"Amazing graphics, fluid gameplay, witty jokes. everything needed for a great game."
19564,gun good :)
19565,"i played this game a WHOLE bunch on consoles and its pretty good i think. im not sure when i got it the first time, but i think my dad bought it at superstore. the lady at the counter like customer service asked me if the psycho on the cover of the game case was a zombie so i had to explain to her what a bandit was. i remember one time i was like 9 and i asked my mom if i could buy the first borderlands game on xbox 360 (best console ever) and she said yeah so that was cool. also there was one time where i was playing the game and i was saying the lines with the characters. also my and my brother played the game once and i found a legendary gun called sledges shotgun (best gun in the game) in a gun vending machine and i bought it and i was really happy. i like this game ALOT and i played it a WHOLE bunch."

19573,Best co op experience! Just love this game. Can't wait to play the next one.
19574,No no no -- slag him first!
19575,"Borderlands 2 is excellent, full of interesting characters and story lines and effects. Well, just look at how many hours I've played the thing — 5,237! I put it away for a few months, but I'm ready to again start exploring its worlds and people."
19576,This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life and the DLCs are incredibly good too!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
19577,its ok i guess
19578,Loads of fun with loads of replay options!!
19579,You can spend hours in this game.
19580,"I'm certainly late to discovering just how awesome this franchise is, but I'll say it anyways: this game combines RPG and FPS elements beautifully."
19581,"yes
"
19582,GOOD GAME.
19583,"This game is absolutely wonderful, and I love it very very much. One of the best looter shooters out there, if not THE best.

Story's well made, the characters are great and unforgettable, the scenery is excellent, and the gameplay is amazing! There's quite a lot to do and a good amount of places to explore, not to mention the variety of loot, especially the unique rewards.  

It's not a necessity to play the first Borderlands before this one since both of them sort of have separate stories, but if you'd like to know a thing or two about the original characters and story, go for it! 

Last but certainly not least, the DLCs are awesome for the most part. (Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is not for the faint of heart.) Best experienced after completing the main story."
19584,"Loved very much this game - many hours playtime years ago - bought all dlc
I want now to play again et finish my dlc stories... and no more online games! 
Can't join a game nor friends can't join mine. Seems to be a NEW incompatibility between Windows/Mac/SteamOS.
Aspyr you sold me a game (and dlc) running fine on all OSes and now my experience is limited to solo gaming?! WTH!!!"

19587,"The game server is becoming more laggy. Host will not have any delay but players who joined that game server will undergo lagging issues, like teleport all over the places and shooting delay during the fight. This had happened for about 3 days straight, please fix it as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution, appreciate it very much."
19588,my mom died in a car crash
19589,"idk man i found this in my library
"
19590,"This is definitely a must-play game and I bought it on every platform I own. It's one of the most iconic games I've ever played and it pretty much defined the looter-shooter genre together with Warframe. Story: does the job, but the main villain is iconic. Gameplay: it's what you buy the game for basically. Tons of replayability with 6 classes total (4 base + 2 dlc, just get the GOTY edition), 3 skilltrees per class, each with a specific playstyle in mind. But that's not all, there's new game+ (if you want to get your characters to the level cap you'll have to play that). Oh and don't forget the guns, ""bajillions"" of them, 8 manufacturers, each with unique weapon traits and 6 weapon types so you're bound to find a favourite. You can also experience all this chaos with up to 3 friends. Visuals: The outline shader and overall artstyle make the game feel a bit like a comic book which I love, but you can look at screenshots (or the trailers) to see if you like it. 

TL;DR: This is the best Borderlands (including BL3) and it's the most iconic. Buy it and tell your friends to buy!"
19591,"fun game but i need to know ?? can i play with friend in epic store
"
19592,Good game
19593,I like it.
19594,"Borderlands 2 is probably the best looter shooter game ever made! The content seems endless even without DLC. You can choose between vault hunters that each offer a different blood filled playstyle as they have upgradeable special abilities. My personal favourite is Salvador as he becomes unstoppable when you use two unkempt harolds, especially against raid bosses. If the glorious main storyline isn't enough, there is countless side quests to keep you entertained. And don't get me started on the loot farming. Borderlands 2 has stood the test of time and has earned itself a dedicated fanbase that is still continuing to grow. If you simply want to play for looting and shooting then Borderlands 2 is the best game for you!"
19595,Pew Pew
19596,Very re-playable
19597,"Recently replayed Borderlands 1 and will be playing through this game on my way to Borderlands 3. Enjoyed the first 2 immensely and looking forward to trying #3. Fast-paced, goofy, action packed, good storyline, challenging enemies, lots of variety."
19598,good
19599,"Fun variety of weapons, enemies are a challenge, great graphics"
19600,fun
19601,I even enjoy playing this as a single player in this game.

19606,"I HAVE PECKS FOR PECKS!!!!!
"
19607,"I would recommend 100% , it has good story , good gameplay mechanics , it aged well , its has great replay value (atleast can replay 7 times for each vault hunter)"
19608,"After spending over 1,500 hours playing Destiny 2, this is a nice palate cleanser."
19609,borderline double ;)

19623,"yes
"
19624,cool
19625,I've bought this game three times because that's how much I love it. Buy the Legendary or Handsome Collection because this game's DLC is absolutely worth it. Gaige best class. ANARCHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
19626,just overall good
19627,Badonkadonk!
19628,"okay. hear me out.

it is fun to run around meleeing enemies so hard they explore while screaming.

it's also fun to just snipe them from a distance.

there's many different playstyles for this video game. find yours."

10/10 Would reccomend!"
19641,TIS GUD
19642,"Cute, quirky and super cool game :)"

19647,boob. goog bayme
19648,"insane godly love it
"
19649,"All i can say is that as a Co-op game , this was a blast. The weapons and game play is outstanding. Hard boss fights also make it worthwhile. This is a must play for any Co-op fan. Silky smooth game play and immense story line keep you coming for more.  Cant wait to play The Pre -Sequel version."
19650,"Co-op open world, free for all with ""Epic"" boss fights and load outs that are pretty ridiculous."
19651,An Excellent Open World story enriched and non stop shooting CO-OP experience! Highly recommend playing it with friends.
19652," Yeah,its awesome"
19653,so good XD
19654,
19655,"A great game, especially with friends."

19659,Good game if you play Krieg... just unleash your inner psycho
19660,its the best game on earth
19661,awesome game. loved every moment of it. Great for co-op too
19662,"One of my most played games on Steam Loved Every Second Playing this game! 10/10 

The gameplay is stellar, which combines a FPS with the RPG Element.
Each Character is unique and is worth playing at least once
One of the most funny games out there
Tiny Tina's Assult on Dragon Keep DLC was by far my Favorite DLC Content and Favorite part of the game overall.

If you played The Sequel it is worth playing even if it is an old game now."
19663,"pain in the ass: almost every fucking time when I follow the ""!"" to find out any mission object or items - I can't find last pieces until I reload the map to kill another bunch of new spawns, and also this fucking instruction do not precisely concretely show where exactly the target or item is .... really a waste of much time  -   
Except this, others are fine!"
19664,GOOD GAME FUN TO  PLAY WITH FRIENDS.....(IF YOU HAVE THEM)
19665,fire bro
19666,It is stupid and fun. Run around kill a BUNCH of robots buy better guns.
19667,10/10
19668,"Borderlands i şu ana kadar oynamadıysan kendine oyuncu deme bence . Kusura bakma ama öyle yaniii.Hayır yani, sen değerli insan şu ana kadar bunu kaçırmış olamazsın lütfen yapma.Ama merak etme ben sana yardım edicem,iyi dinle:.Bak şimdi ne yapcaksın biliyor musun oyuna tek girersen sıkılırsın topla ARKADAŞLARINI bak o zaman nasıl oluyor. Bu oyunda ARKADAŞ gerçekten önemli yok ağzına s*ç*yorlar. Ciddiyim ARKAŞSIZ girme.He bi de daha eğlenceli olur . Biz bu oyunun 4 kişi bitirdik ve aşırı keyifliydi nasıl 50 sa oynadığımı bile anlamdım. İndir , ARKADAŞLARINI topla ve "" for mother PANDORAAA"" ..."
19669,A great game with friends or by yourself. Theres alot of loot and leveling to keep you busy.
19670,love all bordlands games highly recommend
19671,dqzf
19672,ahh
19673,not really balanced but i dont think we're here for balance tbh
19674,haha Krieg go brrr
19675,very good game. unique graphic style that will probably never look old or outdated. i highly recommend getting the handsome jack pack if they ever put it on sale again. it has all the dlc which are very good and i got it when it was 5 dollars.
19676,♥
19677,pure perfection
19678,"Great game for solo and coop, might be a bit unoptimised for high end hardware like win10, nvidias 10th and further generations.

This should help you stabilise the performance:
1. Run the .exe as admin with win 7 compatibility + disable full screen optimisation in the settings.

2. In nvidia control panel set physx to cpu and download physx software provided on pcgamingwiki, install it and copy all of the files from installation folder e.g. /program files/nvidia/physx/config to the game folder /binaries/Win32. The physx option will be greyed out in the game settings and disabled.

3. Tweak WillowEngine.ini file in your documents/games/borderlands2/willowgame/config/. Specifically the strings below [AppCompat]. Set values of CompatLevelComposite, CompatLevelCPU and GPU to 5 and save the file.
Worked for me."
19679,great game tons of fun
19680,is ver good
19681,It’s great
19682,GOTY for a reason
19683,"its just a good game
"
19684,"Good
as
balls"
19685,one of the best games ever made
19686,"Even when it's hard to level up sometimes and you always get yourself killed so many times, I still enjoy the game. Will have to play the first game before I complete this one before Borderlands 3"
19687,poggers
19688,itss amazing
19689,"Fun, run, gun, pun"
19690,Just play it. You'll love it.
19691,"I just finished this game (without DLC) after having beaten the first game last month. While this game has some high peaks that trump anything the fist game had to offer, it also has some deep pits that made me put the game down for days. The following pointers are based on solo play, as Borderlands should be a singleplayer game first and a group game after.

[h1] The Good: [/h1]
- The new classes are fun to play. Whether you want to wield two guns and go ham, snipe people from a long distance or simply want to rush at people with an axe, there is something for any kind of playstyle.
- No more weapon proficiencies means that any character can wield any gun without handicapping themselves. These bonuses are replaced by badass rank bonuses that carry over in future runs, meaning that you can rack up very strong bonuses if you plan on doing multiple playthroughs.
- The new weapon RNG is very fun and silly. Unlike BL1 where the only weird weapon is a shotgun that shoots rockets, this game has all kinds of weird weapons. Assault rifles that spin up like miniguns, snipers with burst fire, pistols that shoot rockets, grenades that create voids that pull enemies in, rockets that explode in smaller rockets, the list goes on. 
- The beloved main characters from the first game return as starring side characters that help you out on your mission.
- Some amazing new side characters. A British hunter/philanthropist. A small girl who tinkers with explosives. Scooter's sister. Turbocancer victims.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
- The original Borderlands crew acts very stupid compared to the first game. Rolands has become very awkward, Lilith acts like a high school girl who's hopelessly in love, Mordecai became a drunkard, and Brick sounds like a black man turned gangsta. it really saddened me to see those cool characters being turned into stereotypes.
- The reload speed of certain weapons is unbelievably slow. I can understand how reloading a big rocket launcher takes time, but when some of the assault rifles take just as long it becomes very annoying. Each weapon of the same type should have the same reload speed, not have massive difference between each weapon.
- The game was very obviously designed for multiplayer, even though it claims to be a singleplayer game. Enemies swarm you in big groups and use flanking manoevers to make your life hell if you don't have a team member to take some of the aggro away from you. I've had plenty frustrating deaths in the first half of the game because the amount of bullets they throw at you is uncanny for a single player to handle in the early game.
- Some of the bosses (such as the Gluttonous Tresher) are completely impossible to beat solo unless you abuse the AI's pathfinding. If you need to look up how to beat a boss and the only answers you'll find is to abuse how the AI works, you screwed up royally.
- Some of the missions are also a complete pain when trying to complete them solo. There is nothing fun about defending a beacon against a massive group of infinitely respawning robots, or defending a supply crate against elite enemies that focus it down before you have a chance to kill them proper.
- The Borderlands humor i grew to love and enjoy in the first game is completely gone. Claptrap is no longer the silly robot, but instead acts bossy and smug. Scooter no longer makes subtle jokes about inbreeding, but instead openly mentions how he shared baths with his cousin and how he had a crush on his sister. He changed from a silly redneck to a full out Alabama hick. And those are just two examples. Instead of wanting to chuckle i wanted to facepalm every time a ""joke"" popped up.

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
- The model of water leaking from a cracked water pipe looks like ooze instead of water. As a matter of fact, i'm pretty sure it's just a reskin of the ooze that comes from the exploding corrosive barrels, as the consistency is the same. 
- The elemental weapons just look like recolors. I read reviews raving about how they glowed and how cool they looked, but i didn't notice any of that. (My graphics are all turned up to the max and i didn't download the HD Graphics DLC, as i read that it messed with graphics even more)
- Salvador. Just...Salvador.

Overall, i would say that the first game is the better one among the two. The first game wasn't the most amazing game i've ever played, but it kept making me want to play more of it. In this game, i got checked out about 40% in and i had to mentally force myself to boot it up after that because i wanted to know how the story ended. It's probably a lot more fun when you're playing with friends, but as a singleplayer experience it's not something i would personally advice. 
"
19692,"Better than the first, and arguably better than the third.  Handsome Jack is probably one of my favorite villains of all time, has great replayability, and is fun to play with friends.  Lots of stupid humor too"
19693,pogchamp
19694,yes
19695,"shooty game, like destiny but funny"
19696,this game are veri funy
19697,"While graphics are not stellar, it still looks pretty good thanks to the art style. Gameplay is bombastic fun and rewarding. Story is funny, witty and in my opinion well written, characters are fleshed out and the villan is specially superb.

Probably more fun with friends. Great solo too though."
19698,"It has borders and lands. Great game!
"
19699,you aren't a true vault hunter unless you own an ellie body pillow. change my mind.
19700,"It is EXTREMELY fun... I would recommend Borderlands 2 to everyone
"
19701,"incredible game, farming, learning weapon parts, gameplay, the massive variety of builds, phenomenal story, maps, ost, characters, missions, just an absolute classic of a game."
19702,I love it when funny robot does funny joke
19703,
19704,good game
19705,"aww yeah, pretty bang average game if ya know what I mean. I think its worth a buy, but what do I know?"
19706,h
19707,"A great game that is crippled by design. After spending considerable time on this release, I decided I was sick of returning to the same levels to fight the same enemies for different objectives. So much potential - squandered."
19708,"This game, it defines an immersive and crazy fun shooter game. 

There's sometimes a game you strumble upon, you try it out, and you become so obsessed and in love with it, that it just takes over your life completely. Playing Borderlands 2 is so fun and addictive, I just felt really bad when I finished it. It's pretty much everything that I love on this game. 

- The story contains awesome humor, tons of action, amazing character concepts, intresting dialogue, great use of parralelism from the previous Borderlands game, and a compelling build up towards the end.
- The gameplay is so exiting. It has a great variety of mechanics, the game is greatly balanced in terms of action and rest. The guns, grenades, shields, powerups, etc are SO MUCH BETTER than the first Borderlands game. There are some items that are so fun to use and unique in their own ways, I often find myself collecting some gems I find and storing them in the vault! The quests are variable, you don't always just go kill some enemies or search for items, this is also majorly improved from the first Borderlands game. It's just perfect.
- The design is... astonishing. It still amazes me that this game is from 2012, and yet looks so freaking good. The game has some very pretty graphical features, like sun flares, and detailed shadows on the guns you hold. It's absolutely great. I love that Borderlands 2 uses a very wide variety of different environments. There's snow/ice, desert, volcanoes, main lands, ACID WASTELANDS (I hate the Caustic Caverns, but it still looks so good). Every environment is different and unique. In the first Borderlands game, the environments became pretty repetitive as it mainly used desert type of areas.
- And last, sound design. Top notch. Amazingly designed sound effects. They don't only sound good, but they are very dynamic as well. The fact that my footstep sound changes on snow, and that it has a seperate sound for when I'm sprinting and walking just pleases my ears. The soundtrack adds so much to the gameplay, and doesn't get repetitive at all, which sometimes occured at the first Borderlands game.

This game is just amazing. It rarely happens that I love a game so much. Therfore, though it's weird to say, but this game is a straight 10/10. Even weirder to say, but I dare to say that this game is my favourite shooter I've EVER played. It's worth any price to me, and it has a special place in my heart.

And now... I'm going to play the DLC's, replay the entire game with other characters, play Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, play those DLC's , probably replay that entire game with other characters as well, play Borderlands 3, play those DLC's, probably replay that with other characters as well, and PROBABLY, I'll return to Borderlands 2 after that."
19709,"man, this game is awesome!"
19710,cool game i like to shoot people
19711,"Really good gameplay and amazing loot and customisation, the humor is admittedly a bit outdated but the story is still decent"
19712,i play this so much i forgot to stand up and poopied my pantalones
19713,best game in the world
19714,fantastic
19715,Great game to play with your friend(s). Especially the ones that just want to something cathartic after work
19716,Only problem is blatant paywalls with levels :(
19717,best game back in the xbox 360 days with the boyz
19718,"AWSOME, the story great the gameplay great"

19721,특별한 감성을 느끼고싶다면 이겜을하세요
19722,it good
19723,tons of fun with friends
19724,"for an older game, the mechanics still feel great and the aesthetic is wonderful. The world is interesting and the main antagonist is one of the best I have ever seen in a game, rivaling Sephiroth. The best part is you can often pick this game and every single piece of dlc up on sale for around 10 dollars. Sometimes less.

10/10 would recommend."
19725,"Best game ever!!!!
"
19726,"I wish i started playing this game from the start of launch so addictive. better than most games that have come over the past 10 years for sure
"
19727,"Hay its borderlands 2. If you have not heard of it then idk who you are. Its a good game and changed the gaming industry. 

Issues with base game. The main characters are rather poorly balanced in terms of fun and quality. There is an entire area you have to go to before going to the hyperion settlement which is pointless and forgettable. Gun variety and balance is not great with uniques and legendaries being mandatory to farm for on higher difficulties. 

DLCs are great for the most part. 
Tiny Tina assault on dragon keep DLC is a big reason to play the game and is in my eyes still pretty much the peak of the series aside from maybe presequel's DLC. Assault on dragon keep is just a really well balanced, way better paced, refined version of the base game and I cannot suggest it enough

Scarlet's Booty is not quite as good, but still a very solid DLC. Very funny with great writing of the main character of the story. Scarlet feels very similar to Jack in that she is just constantly saying funny interesting stuff. Due to the large map and attempt to use vehicles in borderlands its rather poorly paced, but still reasonably enjoyable.

Torgue's campaign of carnage is 'eh'. its reasonably funny at times and the pacing is not dreadful, but the tasks you are given as well as the plot feel rather random and pointless. Its mostly just a big arena dlc with extra steps. Would only really suggest playing through if you just want more borderlands

Hammerlock's wild hunt is really bad. Its pretty much the distilled version of the bad aspects of borderlands, Horrific pacing due to a large map, awful transport and distant objectives. On top of that the plot and objectives are literally just random bullshit. To really just rub salt into the wounds  Hammerlock just isn't really funny. Hes a nice dude and everything and pretty well written, but his dialogue just is not actually interesting. So you are left kind of just wandering around bored listening to some dude just talking."
19728,just got into pc gaming and this bad boy was the best thing i could have bought
19729,its kinda like that game
19730,phuni
19731,good game.I recommend it.
19732,"Despite my lack of experience in shooter games, this was a lot of fun. Definitely even better when played with someone else."
19733,"I haven't been so bored in my entire life. Not only is there no free-for-all style roaming and exploration, the enemies you battle come back! Basically, if you don't follow the story, you literally waste your time.

With that, the graphics are horrendous, the gameplay isn't particular fun, and the story isn't all that motivating."
19734,its very laggy for me
19735,"O that this too too solid flesh would melt,

Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!

Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d

His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!

How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable

Seem to me all the uses of this world!

Fie on’t! O fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,

That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature

Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

But two months dead!—nay, not so much, not two:

So excellent a king; that was, to this,

Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,

That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him

As if increase of appetite had grown

By what it fed on: and yet, within a month,—

Let me not think on’t,—Frailty, thy name is woman!—

A little month; or ere those shoes were old

With which she followed my poor father’s body

Like Niobe, all tears;—why she, even she,—

O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,

Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,

My father’s brother; but no more like my father

Than I to Hercules: within a month;

Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,

She married:— O, most wicked speed, to post

With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

It is not, nor it cannot come to good;

But break my heart,—for I must hold my tongue."
19736,Best FPS for Mac.  Ever!
19737,Very fun i am very happy
19738,GUNS! GUNS! GUNS!
19739,"Not recommended, if you had the UVH upgrade to level 72, you now need to pay 15 dollars just to re-unlock content you already had (the OP levels)"

19751,"Games story is fun enough to be replayed, and in all honesty thats what makes this one better then 3. 3s story is a chore, with a terrible plotline, characters, and writing, while 2 has a story that will keep you engaged every second of it. Yeah the gunplay is dated compared to 3 but thats about the only disadvantage."

For the most part, this is a FANTASTIC game. Unique setting, larger-than-life characters that are real characters, lots of unique enemies to kill, and far too many weapon variants and not enough inventory slots.

It would have been nice to be able to disassemble weapons into their constituent parts and build new ones, but apparently all I can do instead is sell things I don't want..."
19778,its so fun and i enjoy it alot trust me if i enjoy u will too

19800,"Amazing graphics, scenery, and game-play. I could play this for hours!"
19801,probably the best looter shooter ever made it has it problems but almost all are fixed with the community patch

19818,"last time i played borderlands 2 i was co-op on a play station in afganistan. it was pretty easy then but i've been playing again solo now as a psycho and it's a bit challenging to say the least. the only downside to this particular class, at least in my opinion, is that its kinda hard to aim your buzzsaw then youre in ultimate mode if youre playing mouse and keyboard. i do like that second wind aspect though when you throw dynamite instead of wasting bullets as well, though i dont deal as much damage as i would like against the hyperion robots when they are of a similar level because it doesnt have slag damage."

19831,"Choose a player and it's color then ""Shoot, Kill, Loot, and Repeat"" or ""Shoot, Go Down, Kill, Second Wind, Loot Repeat"" to be more accurate. Sounds fun to me!"

You will hear it here and you will hear it everywhere else. Borderlands is one of the best shoot & loot games that exists. It's (in my opinion) better than Destiny. It has a great story, and I love the cartoonish outline artstyle. Would recommend if you like to grind guns!"
19836,this game is so fun and after you beat it it gets boring unless you get the DLS or do the 2cd playthrough

19846,"Need a game to relax running around like a lunatic shooting things in a crazy ass environment in some backward story? Got friends who might join you to shoot these things and help you completely miss what's going on, but spend hours laughing together? Borderlands will suit you well."
19847,"The combination of a fantasy fps game, with a good portion of sick humor, where you can do a LOT of side quests, either in single player or in co-op, gives me a good laugh and relaxation on rainy days. A good main story line, together with fun characters, keeps me playing this game together with my friend over and over. I will keep playing this edition, even though edition three has been out for some time. Good Buy, indeed! I give it 9/10. 

The only thing that bothers me a bit is that a level 21 weapon/equipment may be better than a level 23 weapon/equipment in the same category. If not for that, it would have been 10/10!"

Borderlands; A game that puts 50% effort into realism, balanced gameplay, or any of the other stuff that's suffocating all fun and creativity out modern games. I hope we'll always be friends after you read this Gearbox."

19861,"its a timeless classic with endless amounts of replayability, very poggers"
19862,"My favourite game, absolutely hilarious and amazing to play with your friends, always something to do, the fun never stops"
19863,"Just play it, flat out!

Great value for money.
Time vs reward has a good balance.
Nearly infinite replay-ability with new twists along the way.
Some of the best map layouts I've experienced in an FPS.
Near-perfect learning curve as well.
Awesome attention to the gaming experience as a whole - those that appreciate will really enjoy this game.

Makes sense why the series is so well known!"
19864,Played for less than an hour. Got randomly stuck with no option but to exit game. Did not go back.
19865,"My favorite game from the borderlands system. I have no idea why they went back to the borderlands 1 loot system for borderlands 3 but it was in my mind a mistake. Borderlands 2 takes everything from Borderlands 1 and improves it, the story is amazing and will leave you wanting more, the guns are truly awesome even with some game breaking overly powered ones and the DLC will have you wondering if you bought a whole new game!"

19867,While dated borderlands gameplay continues to be a great experience with plenty of hours of content. Overall definitely a game worth trying at some point
19868,not big on grinding out loot but its pretty fun

19870,it's alright i guess

19872,Cyberpunk 2012
19873,"tl:dr: i dont say this is a bad game, its just not for me

its just this game is actually a lazy shooter game, with overwhelmingly many loots. and this game didnt give a reward to actual preparation or skillful approach to the battle, this game just about shoot and loot. this game design is both too lazy or too repetitive to me.

quest are pretty much the same, go here, fetch this, and kill this enemy. and the enemy themself its not much different. its just you come with the better equipment, better skills, and area are different.
it makes whole game is anticlimactic and no real ""moment"" you get when you accomplish a progress. the only progress you felt on the game is when you grind the same boss many many hours to get a very rare item, a thing that should be gone on current gen game.

if you kind of player that want to scale your power indefinitely, kinda lazy on shooter, and willing to repeat whole same thing over and over and over again, and dont care how mediocre the gameplay and story is, this game might be for you.

and from my point above, im not that kind of player. thats why i rated down this game"

19880,good
19881,"Borderlands 2 is a huge open-world game, offering a plethora of loot, picturesque sceneries, and alluring foes to leer at. Immerse yourself in the vast world of Pandora where psychopaths thrive and lust for chaos and blood-thirsty critters strut along blighted plains and ominous valleys. Pandora is an artwork, one huge painting. The art style makes the whole world look and feel so sublime. Scour your way through the fluorescent crevices of Caustic Caverns, wade through the tropical shores of Wam Bam island, cast your gaze at the sight of lofty precipices, or fight through mobs of bullymongs under the opalescent night sky of the Northern Lights. The enemies you encounter are also creatively crafted. They're funny, crazy, cool, and grotesque. Fill a nest of psychos and midgets with lead, pierce through steel-cladded Nomads with flaming bullets, or smite open poison-spewing spiderants. The gameplay is fun as well, I enjoy hovering my panoply of weapons to find the most effective gun to use for a specific enemy, and by doing that, I get to appreciate the nuances of each weapon and discover what distinguishes them from one another. The exclusive abilities of each class is another bonus to the fighting element of the game, nothing much else to say about them. 

Other the compliments, I do have a handful of things to critic about. It's important to take note that Borderlands 2 is a grind-heavy game. It takes a lot of time, shooting, and deaths to level up. This game can get difficult if you're playing alone. Enemies are stronger as you progress, around 2-5 levels stronger than you as you move from story mission to story mission. Because of the difficulty spikes in each mission, you'd have to grind previous levels or complete side quests to farm XP, and even then, completing side quests won't be enough to catch up to the levels of the enemies you'd have to fight in order to progress the story. This is really when the game started to feel tedious for me and took away a lot of the fun factor. If you're looking for a game with a steady difficulty to have fun with throughout, then this game might pose a challenge for you, because this game progressively gets balls to the walls hard if you aren't grinding. That's really my only complaint, it's more of a personal criticism but that's my negative take nonetheless.

All things set aside, just a fun (pretty damn hard) and beautiful game that deserves my extols."

19889,Its one of the best co-ops you can find
19890,:DDD
19891,"game is fine, but one of the bosses is pretty much unbeatable as single player, and no way to get around that without restarting entire game"
19892,"i have the GOTY edition which comes with the max lvl 72 and extra 8 op levels. yet, when they released the new dlc (lilith somthing), it essentially removed my op levels, and i can no longer farm any mobs above 72. they made it so u need one dlc to play another dlc (that i already had and played). then they changed the new lilith dlc that gives up to op10 from free to 15$. [u]so they locked me from content i already had and want 15$ to re-unlock it[/u]. really disapointed in the game right now and will probly uninstall until a change is made."
19893,"fun

19894,"this game almost got me killed. no, i'm not joking; so long story short my house was on fire and i didn't realize because the music in this game is so loud. I only realized when i felt the heat of fire on my arm and that's when i realized. so i grabbed my laptop and ran out of my house with a few minor burns. Good game though."

It ran well on my computer until I get to a certain point in the game where my frames drop like crazy. I didn't think I played for that long so I tried refunding it.
Moments passed and I got an email that said my refund was denied because it turns out I've spent SEVENTEEN HOURS playing it.
Despite it not running super well on my device, a game that made my 17 hours feel like 2 hours definitely deserve to be recommended."
19900,"[b]From gun play to game play to story to love and to loss, best in the series for a variety of reasons, but the biggest contender being fantastic character writing. New cast and returning cast. [/b]

Handsome Jack. There is a reason why that name carries so much weight, from witty remarks to massive power plays, this character elevates the experience. This character alone deserves an award for best written character in any media.

Honestly words can barely do the fantastic work Gearbox did on this entry into the series, their vision fully realized and untainted [strike]by the greedy need for a poorly written sequel[/strike].

19912,Great multiplayer fun
19913,This product was very adventurous for a video game and actually gave me since of wanting more. This lead to the buying of the entire collection even though the story is  basically the same throughout.  it was so fun it took me and my sisters a little over 3 years to switch to another game but not before 100% every game. this even included the off story Tales From The Boarderlands. So I greatly recommend this game to anyone with a great amount of time and ambitions.
19914,"great but could not put my name in the game
"
19915,.
19916,"Fun w friends, I dedicated 2k hours to this game on my console, no regrets."
19917,This a very enjoyable game to play. The story line is clever as you are constantly berated by the NPCs. You have to invest some time into the game in order to get your character to level up in order to take on some of the bosses. The gun names are interesting and have great effects. I like that your character needs to be at or above the gun level in order to use it. That gives you incentive to keep playing almost to the point of addiction.
19918,"Good game, even though my luck with with loot sucks."
19919,Great shoot and loot game that you can sink hours into. Storyline is awesome and the humour is dead on. Highly recommend trying this bad boy out

19989,yes
19990,"The shooting and looting is fun but very boring I found in my first playthrough. I found it gets better in True vault hunter mode and Ultimate hunter mode is just, a third playthrough of the exact same thing. It's very repetitive. Some of the DLC is really good though, the Tiny Tina one is the best so I recommend this game for Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina DlC but if you don't want to put that much time into the game, then I don't recommend it."

20013,"This game is not particularly the best Borderlands game to be released, and at some points in the game the setting that a mission takes place in seems a bit repetitive. Yet this does not exclude this game from being one of the best borderlands games up there on the tier list. The playable characters like usual, are very fun and the ending boss battle ( no spoilers ) is absolutely challenging yet fun at the same time. This is definitely a recommended buy, especially if it is in the handsome collection bundle which is great to pick up on sale for $10 with the pre-sequel and borderlands 2 and all of the DLC's that ever existed for both of the games. Rating this game on a scale of 1-10, in my opinion, i would have to give it a solid 7.9/10. SOLID game Borderlands 2"
20014,Sometimes the missions are dumb owing to the final part of the mission is pure sh*t. However it is interesting.
20015,no
20016,"I've played both Borderlands and Borderlands 2 w/ dlc to completion on the Xbox 360. My opinion of Borderlands 2 is very positive. It is a faithful sequel to the original game and improves many aspects that were, in my opinion, very clunky. Enemy difficulty is perfectly scaled to the player's level; this is exaggerated moreso in Co-op play with enemy levels increasing as more players join. If both players are of comparable levels, this is a beautiful innate aspect. If there is a sizable contrast, then an even more rewarding experience for the lower-leveled player. 
Bosses are unique and well-constructed. Missions are immersive and extensive.
My only caveat with the series as a whole is that some portions of the story require a large amount of backtracking. However the variety of guns and gun generation makes up for this as the player is more privy to exploring different parts of the map to find better loot.
Overall 9/10 game. Must-play if you enjoy fps' with rpg elements."

Tiny Tinas Assault on Dragons Keep is an awesome DLC, Bosses, music and overall comedy were on point.
Scarlets Treasure Hunt was kinda meh. The bosses were way to easy.
The Carnage Campaign was ok.

20027,"good story, nice art style. the reason I don't like the borderlands games is the map system, it's too confusing as you're going from map to map trying to figure out where tf you need to go, that's just a personal gripe though. the game itself is pretty good"
20028,have alot more on cracked tbh before it dropped so hard i price. Really worth the money if u love shooters!
20029,i like this game because i like the 1st person shooter games
20030,"(English)
If you have a bunch of friends it's one of the best coop games i ever played with the homies+ jack is a really iconic being.

(Português)
É um ótimo jogo para se jogar com os amigos+ jack é um dos personagens mais icônicos que lutei contra~."
20031,"If you are looking for a game that has a fun story, outdated humor (Some of it still being funny) and some awesome guns to shoot this is the game for you."
20032,fun
20033,"This game is so addictive and tons of fun to pass the time with. Even playing solo, without network turned on/available, it's a blast.
The dialog, story, gameplay, its like comedic humor meets Mad Max Thunderdome meets Skyrim world size meets CS:GO"
20034,"Best singleplayer/coop hybrid game I've played. Pretty good campaign. I'm not really a big fan of open world, RPG style games, I tend to give up on a few of them. But not BL2. But the gameplay, story and visual style make up for it and compel me to finish the game.

Also, the ability to have friends join in sometimes is great. Makes taking out some tougher enemies more fun.

After playing a bit of BL3, I'd say this game is still better overall, though BL3 isn't too bad."
20035,"I really went into this wanting to like it. 

And I do in theory but I get sub-optimal performance, and somewhat lackluster gameplay.

It's not terrible but steam doesn't give the option to give it a middling rating."

Ive never played this game really up until now and my friend told me I should get the game and I dont regret it. Very fun to play with a friend or multiple friends theres a ton of guns to get and a ton of stuff to see along your journey in the game.
20041,borderlands 3 is better

Game is fun in any possible way. Playing as Mele Zer0 or even Mele Maya (not the best but still). 
I don't like playing solo game is ""boring"" same quests and fights alone is not fun in my opinion.

Combat is fun, the story is decent, it's pretty funny, and there's great quests here. Just try to forget who it is that oversees this series (and that the reason Colonial Marines turned out so awful is because they took that game's budget and used it for this)."

Even though we're moving on to Borderlands 3, I can definitely see returning to Borderlands 2 to play through True Vault Hunter Mode or even just tackle certain DLC mini bosses again for the fun of it. Check it out if you can, co-op is amazing but if you have poor internet then soloing it is still a satisfying challenge."
20147,this game is fucking increadable i highly recomend it also sorry for the bad spelling but it is a very good game
20148,"Fixed a lot of the issues from the first game while honing down and polishing the combat and story. There are some apparent problems and a few bugs, but it's easy enough to look past."

20155,Its a great open world game with many different paths to choose. overall a great buy
20156,"I will open up by admitting I am a bit biased. I have over 200 hours on this game on ps3 and on ps4. Individually.  When I was in the final few years of high school my younger brother introduced me to borderlands 2 split screen. We spent hours playing each day and made many memories together. Pre-sequel and Borderlands 3 has some memories too. However none were as great as the ones provided by Borderlands 2. I miss those days when he would come to my room and ask to play borderlands after I came home from school. We would defeat bosses together. Take on every sidequest, finished every DLC, and prestiged to nearly the highest badass levels. He would always choose Gunzerker salvador and I always chose Zer0. These were the last few years where we spent the most time together. Now he's often out and about at work while I'm finishing up college. I miss those days. Borderlands 2 in my opinion does not have the best graphics but its whacky fun and guns will help create memories that will last a lifetime."

20168,"Borderlands 2 is a classic looter-shooter RPG. The story is fun and engaging, the writing is quippy and hilarious, and the gameplay is tremendously fun. It feels the best when playing with a group, but is worth the price of admission for solo players as well."

20182,Lots of fun!
20183,"Borderlands 2 is one of the all-time classic FPS games. It has a unique RPG element which I feel inspired some other RPGFPSs such as the Destiny series. The characters are all unique & fun to play; truly inspired pieces, rather than bland cookie-cutter character types. The story is genuinely entertaining, & the bosses feel like a boss should. The account ""B.A. Tokens"" leveling system is genius, allowing for miniature buffs that apply to all of your characters. The variety & unique game elements means there's something for everyone, a great game to play with all your friends (mostly imaginary, I'm sure, but hey). This game is perfect for gaming newbies & vets alike. An absolute must which holds up profoundly well to the test of time."

20194,"Borderlands pefected - great sequal to the original game !

Positive:
+ Graphically looks great, lot's of visual effects and graphical options
+ Lot's of content, with extra DLCs, even after finishing main quest, there is still so much to do. I've clocked 51+ hours, but I bet there is so much more to do
+ Quests are intersting with memorable characters and objectives. Some are silly or stupid, but that's the flavour of the game
+ Skills and amount of customizations are impressive
+ Weapons have incredible variety of choices and combinations between them
+ Loot explosions !

Negative:
- Getting stuck all the time..
- What's up with a shift button, it doesn't work some times ?

Overall, it's a great shooter to play through. Just know, that it's going to take a while and a lot more time if you want to go through all the extra quests !"

20210,"Borderlands 2 is a first person shooter with rpg elements.
The story takes places 5 years after events of the first game. A new group of Vault Hunters must ally with a resistance group made up of civilian survivors and guerrilla fighters, to defeat Handsome Jack before he can unlock the power of a new Vault.
There are four different characters to choose from, each with their own set of skill and abilities. The four characters include Maya (""The Siren""), Zer0 (""The Assassin""), Salvador (""The Gunzerker"") and  Axton (The Commando).
The missions and side quests can be quite rewarding in Borderlands 2 and allows characters to score all sorts of loot and weapons to help them accomplish the game's main objective.
Up to four players can play together and can choose any one of the characters and play through the campaign.
It has great sounds and music. The graphics are still good looking.
Borderlands 2 is an excellent mix of RPG elements without sacrificing FPS game play. It is a perfect choice to play with your friends, definitely worth to buy, as it delivers fun for more as hundred hours.

20243,"I'm insanely late to the Borderlands 2 party. Possibly so much so everyone is already passed out or left. That's fine by me. I'm not the best FPS player on earth due to hand injury in my right hand and hardware. For a long time I played no FPS because it was frustrating to die because my hand cramped and I couldn't push a button quick enough. I finally decided to get this game due to frustration playing other games. Borderlands 2 so far is proving to be just enough challenge for me. I die here and there because I'm a noob and I forget to use the Gunzerkers ability. Once I fell in ice water while getting attacked by some huge flying bats or whatever, and that killed me. I'm averaging about a death an hour. I'm having very little issue progressing, but not fast enough to make the game boring. 

+ Graphics. Just a really beautifully cool game so far despite being a mixture of cartoon and life like.
+ Soundtrack/voice overs.
+ Sense of humor. Even the annoying stuff is fairly humorous and will receive a chuckle. I.E. Claptrap in the beginning of the game. ""I'm this way, if you can't find me follow the sound of my attractive voiceeeeee"" in the most annoying possibly sounding voice ever.
+ Character development. I have not even come close to seeing all the characters yet. But if they're anything like the ones in the beginning of the game I'll be in good hands. So far they're all picking on Claptrap which cracks me up.
+ Tutorial. It didn't carry me through. I actually died during it from an enemy. I was really impressed with this. Usually games are like ""Okay, so press W to walk forward approximately 100 steps to the red X, open your journal with J, then go right to the rock, around the block, jump 57 times, while opening your inventory with I, if all the highlighted sh*t wasn't enough to help you figure it out, here's a huge text wall of b.s. that explains it more thorough. And if that's not enough, you're welcome to come back and play it again!"" Borderlands 2, kinda just threw me to the wolves and it was awesome, and I actually figured stuff out in a game. Kinda felt like some 80's and 90's nostalgia. So 2K thanks for that. There's text and and all that, but notto the extent of some games where the tutorial just babies you into a boredom coma.
+ Deaths. A lot of the enemies you killed before dying yourself stay dead. (Although if you have to run back anywhere there are a couple of areas I saw that will re-spawn enemies, which is slightly annoying but not enough to ruin the enjoyment.)
+ User interface. Despite being a little older, I love the UI. The menus are easy to read and navigate.
+ Story line is really excellent so far.
+ Obtaining items/money/XP/etc. I have had no issue running out of money, obtaining gear and weapons, or anything. You're grinding slightly, but it doesn't feel like it. That's really refreshing to see in a game.

Before I list the cons, these are NOT game breaking or anything. I have not seen anything totally sucky in the game yet. It's really just some minor annoyances.

- Gun cross hairs. Not used to them. What also adds to this being annoying is every gun has an accuracy percentage. 
- Some enemies move too fast. Like those giant beasts in the first area. They can jump large distances, and if they can't they toss boulders at you. Them jumping at you during a reload is a little hectic sometimes. Luckily there's shields along with your life, so you don't get insta-killed or anything. Also you can bang out some melee too, at a fairly nice quick rate. A really nice balance in all actuality.
- The gun recoil is slightly too much. Just barely. But it's easy to adapt too. Within a few hours you'll start getting the hang of it.

There's a reason an 8 year old game has shipped 20 million units as of 2019. Because it's GOOD. Highly recommend so far.

Overall: 9/10"

20282,"bro this is one of the best games ever made, it has a great loot system, great writing, and great art. definitely worth it."
20283,"I own this on every single console it's been released on as well as PC (obviously lol) and it's one of my favorite games of all time. Easily in my top ten of my lifetime. It's even better with friends, you get more loot, rarer drops, the enemies are stronger so more exp, and with all the dlc's out that are all amazing it's just a good time all around."

20293,Yes.
20294,"Game is amazing and has almost no flaws, I was playing it with my friend the other day and he said he likes it and would play it again. I had bought the game for only $4.99 because it was on sale when I decided to buy it but knowing that the game is this good I would definitely buy it for a much higher price."
20295,"My all-time favorite game. Depth, gameplay variety, early game and endgame content variation. Fun for speedruns. Great easter eggs in it. Lots of humor. Well-designed world. Character creation and growth along the series is fantastic. Co-op is fun.

Can't think of a single thing I would complain about. Maybe that I would've loved more DLC's instead of Borderlands 3?

Honestly, only game I would ever give 100/100. Everything else would be stuck in the 90's, even if fantastic."

20326,"Also have played this game on Xbox for easily 500+ hours, so if that doesn't give you any indication, then let me tell you more. 

This is a masterpiece of a game that has lasted for years on end for a reason. Tons of replay ability, on top of the fact that most of the DLC's and headhunters are amazing (Except Hammerlocke's but that's alright). This game is exponentially more fun with friends and I would highly recommend anyone wanting to play just enjoy it."

ceo is a pedo"
20339,GOAT
20340,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good"
20341,"There's some great stuff in this game and unfortunately some idiotic stuff that undermines the entire experience. The save/quit system is just stupid and if you're not careful the game will force you to repeat an entire level. If this isn't the definition of tedium. There's already tons of repetition in this repetitive game without forcing players into replaying entire levels because of a poor save system. Users should always be able to create their own saves points. I don't think there's any excuses not to especially for PC games.

But they should really rename this game Ambush Overkill instead of Borderlands. That's because Borderlands 2 is basically just that: constant ambushes from re-spawning (the height of annoying) enemies. You fight the same enemies over and over in what looks like a budget sci-fi ""space"" western that could have been set anywhere including a post-apocalyptic Earth rather than another planet. 
If you like grindy video games that don't respect your time or effort this is the game for you.

it isn't all bad though. I enjoyed playing as Axton, the gunplay is great once you level up some. But sometimes you just want to experience the story, characters or even the scenery without constantly having to fight enemies. Like you can't even hear an Echo because enemies are spawning, shooting at you and talking over the recording. Just bad.

p.s.: 

The game has great gunplay (provided your character and guns are at least one up on the enemies)

When you jump from a great height you don’t die or lose health like in some other cheap games. There are odd locations where you can die by falling out of bounds though. 
Driving vehicles isn’t an endurance test of player tolerance. Of course, there isn’t much traffic in Pandora’s locales to complicate driving.

The emphasis on co-op play seems overwrought and might be more a marketing gimmick (multiplayer means more dollars than solo play). This is a single player game at heart and can be beat by properly leveling your character and weapons pretty much like any other game involving character progression systems. You’ll reach a point where you just wreck foes. 

The game let’s you strategically fall back to locations without closing doors or sections behind you after you enter. Makes a big difference in the numerous fights where there is a surfeit of enemies.

The Old West theme actually fits the sense of living in a hostile, lawless frontier. It does take some getting used to though and I still didn’t always like it. You can keep the space rednecks too.

I never cared for the animation style.  The humor does get stale after a while.

Fight for your life is frankly stupid. Sometimes I died after killing all the enemies or sometimes the enemies disappeared and I couldn’t reach them to get the kill: meaning I died anyway. Meaning tedious repetition time.

Perpetually respawning enemies is incredibly tedious and should have an off button for solo players.

Tl:DR: I wouldn’t consider a replay of this game. It just isn’t that much consistent fun. Nor would I play the expansions or sequels either. The boss battles were nothing to write home about. I’m pretty much done with the series after one playthrough."

20350,Imagine anarchy but with capitalism
20351,The thing I like about Borderlands 2? Yes.
20352,"You know what Borderlands is and what its about. You probably own it already. The writing makes me want to gouge out my ears but even doing that wouldn't help much since I'd still have to stand around and wait for this wonderfully quirky cast of colorful characters to shut up before I can return to shooting. Math of the game gets funky pretty soon after the start of new game+ and you'll find enemies overly tanky and statistically good weapon upgrades a rarity. Numbers scale into absurdity, something the following games would rectify for obvious reasons. Its fine at what it does I guess. I keep reinstalling it every year or so to play for a week before getting bored again so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth."

20356,good game
20357,"I'm coming to this game some years later, but it's new to me. It has a lot of the things I enjoyed from the original Borderlands title. The sense of humor is definitely adult and warped - I like it, but it may not be for younger players or uptight people in general. I'm having fun with the Game of the Year edition, which has a lot of extra content that will keep me busy for some time to come."

20361,"It's a decent coop game to mess around with. Sadly the native Linux version has been abandoned and is not able to be played with users on the Windows version now. So if you play Linux you will need to run it through Proton to play with any Windows friends. Otherwise yes, it's fun to play through a few times to see all the missions and guns you can find."

20388,"Nobody likes having the inferior version of a game. 

Borderlands is a game praised for its co-operative experience. However, as the only of my friends with a gaming PC, I don't have the same opportunity that console users have. Split-screen on PC has reached the same accessibility as consoles through Steam remote play, the Steam link, the many controller options, yet the games that boast multiplayer options lack a trait that should be the standard.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend a multiplayer game that doesn't allow actual access to reliable multiplayer."
20389,it's incredible
20390,"i own this on everything now, I was a little hesitant to get it on pc because of playing mouse and keyboard but, I've loved every minute of it and for the sale making it ten dollars it Feels like a steal!"
20391,love
20392,"The perfect sequel to the first game, outdoing it in every way there is to and without killing off anything within the franchise that is Borderlands. 

I feel that the continuation that BL2 set out on, is a perfect example of how to introduce a new group of heroes or grow within a series. All while still keeping the classic characters of Old intact and even giving them big parts in the universe and really making a story whole between the two.

Still the best borderlands in the series, may they remaster it or something else down the road.

Highly Recommend..Upon finishing the first that is."
20393,This game is not so EPIC!
20394,Great game for people new to shooters and veterans alike. A great humor and overall fun gameplay. Also has some RPG elements that other shooters lack.
20395,"I love the game, but I am unable to play with my friends who own MAC computers due to the update disabling play between MACs and PCs. This should really be listed on the game description, it was purchased as a gift so the other person wasted their money."
20396,This game is fantastic! I love the part where I got to make love to my gun
20397,"Great class system. Tons of guns. Challenging enough to keep it rewarding but not too hard. 

It also has the elements of a great narrative: nuanced characters, an evocative setting, and great humor!"
20398,One of the best RPG's ever made.
20399,fun to play with friends
20400,Still loving it
20401,One of the best games for killing time. Great one liners that NEVER get old and just all around good story.
20402,"This is one of my all time favorites. I don't game as much these days, but when I have the chance this is probably the one I'd pick. Best things about it:
- Choices don't matter. I don't like that my choices matter in real life, much less in games.
- Seamlessly deals with loss of wifi signal. I don't play with others anyway and many games die for ten minutes like a digital Hamlet even if it shouldn't make any difference.
- Fairly lightweight and fast for all that's packed into it.
- Unique art style.
- Fun hack and slash with tons of loot.
- Excellent balance in terms of challenge. Can go for a while wiping out a whole area like a god then find a bigger crazier god you have to actually work on.
- There's so many ways to build a character that replay value is infinite.
- The hilariously rotten dialogue.
If there's anything that could improve this game, I can't think of it."

20523,"This game is amazing.  Handsome jack is a hilarious character and I love playing this with my girlfriend.  Bless her heart she can't actually hit anything.  My advice to you other homies out there living this life is to get used to consistent headshots with the sniper rifle.  Then after you get a kill make sure to tell her ""great work"" and ""amazing""."

Movement can feel a bit dated at times along with some other mechanics that have not stood the test of time well.
If you do not normally have the patience for looter shooters steer clear of this.
6/10

20538,Lovely <3
20539,My favorite looter shooter. With my combined on xbox 360 on pc I beat this game around 20 times and there are still a ton of builds I want to try out.
20540,One of the best fps games ive played great story very funny humor awesome weapons 10/10
20541,pew pew
20542,really fun classic
20543,"Borderlands 2 is Diablo of First person shooters. The never ending loot system is well designed and will keep a player engaged for a long time. Funny dialogues and great voice acting make the campaign really entertaining. 
The Co-op is really fun, I had a blast playing this game with my friends. Highly Recommended!"
20544,"This game is only great if you get the Handsome Collection not gonna lie cuz then you get Torgue, Its just good as the base though. Overall I'd give it a 10/10. It still stays strong as a game even though it is many years old"
20545,the game in my opinion is quite challenging so it is not so boring
20546,"Liked: everything
Disliked: Can't remember anything"
20547,"its an ok game would recomend to anyone who is looking for a new story game 

i would not recomend playing multilayer"
20548,8/10 great game
20549,"The best one, buy it and all the DLC. Be ready for putting a lot of time in."
20550,not rly my type when playing with friends it gets boring as friends have op combo stuff
20551,good game
20552,"I have played for over 500 hours, and I still love the loot system and storyline.  I even bought all of the DLCs which I usually don't do."
20553,"The main story was amazing and the ability to play through it multiple times (with new or the same character) was great.
A lot of the DLCs also added depth o characters which was greatly appreciated. 
The headhunters DLCs are short and good for XP but they add very little to the game besides XP and loot.
I recommend (for DLCs) getting the upgrade packs and tiny Tina's assault on dragonkeep. 

This is a great game and I recommend it to anyone who likes shooter looters"
20554,fun
20555,Amazing Game
20556,"I love this game. This is my first go on PC with it after playing for years on console, from PS3 to PS4. I mean, if you don't already know, you're late. Buy it."
20557,A fair first person shooter with a decent storyline.
20558,Yes Sir
20559,game that i loved on the 360 and still do
20560,It's good
20561,"If you like blasting faces, picking up loot, and farming for good gear, you've come to the right place. I have sunk a ton of Hours into this great game. The dlc is worth it and if you find this game on sale, pick it up because it is worth it. There is hours of good gameplay in store for you and a lot of bad*ssness for you."
20562,One of the most re-playable games ever made.
20563,Cool and cult
20564,"great game

20565,Great fun with friends and solo
20566,"yes

20567,"fun and addicting game, better to play with friends, but solo is fun aswell"
20568,"""I'm Fats Waller, and this is my favorite game on Steam."""
20569,all i have to say is played it and beat it 10 times over on many diffrent systems and to this day is still fun
20570,Fun
20571,"The game follows the same formula as the 1st one, which isn't a bad thing. Enjoyed it playing co-op with 2 other friends."
20572,"it good
"
20573,Peak Borderlands
20574,"Tried playing online but i always get bad connection. Armored enemies are too hard to kill even with corrosive weapons. Drones are impossible to hit unless they are flying directly at you. The constructor, which is a mini boss that shows up a whole fking lot, fires missiles that lock onto you non stop and sometimes a nuke that one shots you. If youre gonna make an enemy show up so often, at least make them not as annoying for solo players."
20575,yuh
20576,its good
20577,"Humor, Awesomeness, and Explosions!!!!"
20578,"Note: Unfortunately, because the latest DLC (commander lillith) was released for free, but is now paid, (????) and rather high price for it's 5 hour long extended endgame content, the overall game review gets a thumbs down from me. The game itself is fun as h*ck and I think anyone who enjoys FPS games should give it a try.

It's a good romp. The dialogue is funny, heartwarming, and vile. There's a bazillion guns and I only managed to get the same 2 guns one time in (probably?) over 500 hours of total playtime across all platforms (PS3, PS Vita, Xbox One, PS4, and PC).

It's a good game. Buy it on a sale, play with a few friends, and you'll have a great time. It's like if an FPS game had as much content as a JRPG."
20579,"Borderlands 2 has proven to be a great game to play with friends - I can't imagine running through this game alone, I'm sure the story is a lot of fun, but, would most recommend playing with others. I'm looking forward to the DLC content after having finished the base game!"

Easy to run (though pretty poorly optimized for being in DX9.)
Loads of things to do
Near infinite gameplay content 
Mod support
For anyone who plays this game first time, please play with the Community Patch, this game is very buggy and characters like Gaige feel frustrating to play (in terms of making death trap function) without it. This game is honestly one of my favorites of all time. Loads of fun with friends and still a great time solo. The Handsome collection is the best version to buy, especially on sale, it’s too cheap to pass up. Just mind the dated humor."

20604,I've been playing BL2 since the launch and I still love this game to this day. I started out on Xbox 360 then I switched to PS4 and now I play it on my PC. In my opinion BL2 is far better than BL3 so I prefer playing this because I love the weapons and bosses in this game more than anything and the DLCs in this gaming are far superior to any of the other Borderlands. I could type more but you get the point.

20646,Its good
20647,Do I really need to say anything...
20648,"
It's a lively pile of sarcasm humor, with the shooting fun of border lands 1."
20649,It's good when you get it in the Jack bundle for 5 bucks.
20650,I played this on the xbox and then I bought this on steam and it it better and is best played with a gaming mouse
20651,"Pretty good looter shooter, though it's not really my cup of tea these days.  If you think the graphics look silly, don't worry about them: see if you like the game play.  If you like the loop, you'll grow to accept—maybe even appreciate—the graphics.

The characters are often pretty funny, and I say this as someone who usually doesn't care at all about story in games.

The game gets a bit desolate, lonely, and grindy towards the end, so I never finished it, but I got my money's worth out of it."
20652,the autistic wall-e robot is funny and stuopid
20653,FUN GUN
20654,Best looter shooter ever. Check out Joltzdude139's youtube channel for good videos on it. His videos showed really cool strategies and fun bugs and stuff that make the game more enjoyable. Highly recommend this game.
20655,guyd
20656,buy it damn it
20657,I actually love this game and find myself keep coming back to it.
20658,"This game is better than I thought it would.  Sometimes steampunk bullshit is a little too up its own ass.  But this is wedged in there just right, like a cozy little butt plug filled with above body temperature cocoa"
20659,yes
20660,The best Borderlands ever *****
20661,The slot machines are too addicting. Great game!
20662,"Stop teetering back and forth when trying to decide if you want this. It's a good game. Buy it and enjoy it, that's all there is."
20663,"Played 30 days on Console, amazing game with great replay ability. Would Recommend as £5 on sale and £20 normal is well worth the price."
20664,Awesome Game. best of all time.
20665,good
20666,Great Game
20667,"This game has everything: cool story, challenging gameplay, unique graphic and a final touch of irony. Love the loot & shoot style, if you like to level up stuff while having fun all around the map, this game is for you. With friends this game becomes 10 times better, so keep that in mind, but even playing solo you can spend a lot of hours without getting annoyed. I can't find any negative aspect on this game, it's just good."
20668,"IMO this game is the #1 contender for 'Game Of The Century.'

99.90% of this game either hit or exceeded the mark, and is a great example of what developers can do when they pour everything into a single title without focusing on Pay 2 Win loot boxes (cough...EA), or releasing a buggy pile of shit that you then have to pay more in order to unlock the full content (cough...Bethesda).

Unfortunately I think this game is Gearboxes crowning achievement, as all other titles released in the series have just straight up failed to reach the benchmark set by BL2.

My only issue with this game is its relatively poor optimisation on PC. 
Although most modern GPUs will hardly break a sweat with BL2 it does draw heavily on your CPU, so if your cooling isn't quite up to scratch, you could find your cores starting to creep towards the redline during extended play. 

Small price to pay for an absolute work of digital art."
20669,One of my Fav games. Much better than BL3!!
20670,"I haven't played THAT much this game, but I recently spent a few hours on PS4 playing another Borderlands game (the pre-sequel) and I remembered how I liked this one.
I am not a fan of the story-telling or the theme, but I certainly see why it is so liked by players. Let's say that I perceive the artistic value, the effort, the originality and so forth.

What impresses me the most are the mechanics: the blend between RPG (specifically MMORPG) and FPS features, the variety in weaponry (which have plenty of visible stats and elemental damage - again like RPGs), and so on.
Some day I will pick it up and give it a more in-depth run, for now I just wanted to add myself to the throngs of people who positively reviewed the game. It deserves it."
20671,"A hilarious spin-off of the original Borderlands. Borderlands 2 follows the tale of the vault hunter fighting against Jack every step of the way. This game has hours of fast-paced, action-packed looting and shooting adventures and is a blast to play! Co-op your way through with up to 4 friends for an even more fun! I absolutely love the Borderlands franchise and Borderlands 2 has been AMAZING!"
20672,This game is fantastic! 29838897428678 out of five stars.
20673,"Big fan of the series, the borderlands 2 is the best of this franchise, good writhing and charming characters especially Handsome Jack."
20674,Amazing game. 100 out of 10.
20675,"This game is a great game. It is a general improvement over the original, and word is that it is better than both games that came after it in the series.

Over the original, the gameplay feels better, it looks better, there is a wider variety of areas to explore, and the story is better and actually easier to follow than the first game. The loot is awesome and this game is fantastic with friends. Character abilities also feel like they all have actual uses, where as in the original they didn't always seem relevant.

The only way that I can think of that this game is or was worse than the original Borderlands is that using save editors or such, people were able to determine that there were less possible part combinations for guns in Borderlands 2 than in Borderlands. I don't know if it is [i]actually[/i] true, but it can feel like there is less weapon diversity sometimes.

8/10 game and one definitely worth playing."

20681,"after 143 hours, I like to think i have enough parts to build my own ""shiniest meat bicycle"" 
Yes, though Bl2 is worth playing,as much as i hate to admit, the DLC are worth the money, the storyline is an great wrap-up for BL1. 

Play BL1, BL2 and it's DLC's and if you're desperate, maybe even Tales From the Borderlands, Do not Buy Bl3: it's complete garbage"

20690,"A fun game for anybody that likes looter-shooters, a well written story, sometimes pacing can feel slow only because of level requirements but the game is definitely great."
20691,is good game i like
20692,Not friendly to new players. Cant navigate most of the time 99% time wasted on finding map figuring out what to do and most hilariously reloading guns. Within that 1% time actually playing 99% you are running and dying from some unknown AOE damage. So thats 0.0001 fun time trade off with 99.9999 pain.
20693,ive only played this game for 10 hours. i dont pay attention to anything i just pay attention to the guns and the things that i shoot :). idk i recommend it. yeah go buy this game.
20694,"The best borderlands there was, or ever will be period. I always come back to it every now and then. 

If you didn't play this when it came out, you missed something magical and i give you my condolences. 

"
20695,Made me laugh uncontrollably... is that a word?! I'm gonna buy Borderlands 3 some day!
20696,Great game with lots of content!!!
20697,Favourite game of all time by a mile (1000+ hours on xbox consoles too). So so so replayable both solo and with mates. Dont think anything will come close to bringing me the levels of enjoyment this game has brought me. Everything about this game is a positive and i genuinely don't think I say anything seriously negatively about any factor of the game
20698,"Hours of fun. I have probably more than 2000 hrs on this game across PC, XBOX 360, XBOX1, and PS4. If you like looter shooters that do not take themselves seriously then you will enjoy this game. Lots of farming. Has great DLC so get the GOTY or Handsome Collection. There are lots of ways to make this game fun even after you beat it with all vault hunters."

20710,Masterpiece. Hands down my favorite game ever. I bought it more then 5 time overall on all platforms
20711,"As someone who works long hours in an IT job and often comes homes tired as shit after work, there is always one game that I can boot up and play and never gets old for me. That game of course is Borderlands 2! Out of the thousands of games in my inventory, this is the one game I always come back to. It is getting up there in its age (8 years) but for some reason the game always feels just as fresh as it did in 2012. I don't know if it is the art style, combat system or dialogue interspersed between the main content and the various DLCs but everything comes together perfectly. If you are like myself and take 300 hours to play through Fallout 3 because you wanted to loot every single container in the game, then this game is for you! If you like to cringe at jokes that were funny/relevant 8 years ago but are so dated they are funny again, this game is for you! If you want to cool down after a long day of dealing with dipshit customers and boomers that can't use IT equipment, than this game is for you! If you don't own this game or any of the other Borderlands series, you are definitely missing out. Please take my advice and buy this game and all of the DLC as you won't regret it.

A true classic that's always fun to revisit"

20717,"Removed this one from my account at all. I enjoyed the first one (Lilith main). Maybe I was too young and stupid. Maybe looter-shooter isn't my genre. This game in a disappointment for me. OP levels is unbalanced as hell for a melee builds (tried Zer0 melee). Characters from the first game behave like an idiots here.
There are some good points: additional shields specifications (in the first game shields were like an additional health bar, but here its have different characteristics and functions), charismatic main antagonist, humor (some jokes are good/great like in the first game), Krieg (the most fun protagonist).
If you liked Borderlands 1 you definitely need to try the second one. Just don't forget to play less than 2 hours to refund it.
Don't want to try the third one at all."
20718,"8 Years of pure fun right here, The classic, amazing Borderlands feel with some better gameplay and systems!"

20761,This game makes me wish I hadn't been shot.
20762,"My favorite FPS of all time hands down, BL3 does have better gameplay, but you´ll never beat this gem and its phenomenal DLC's. I used to play this by myself but on the PS4 and had a solid +500 hours in it and it never got stale, now on PC I can play with my buddies and have access to the amazing mods that people do like unoficial patches and what nots. If you're thinking of buying it do it and WELCOME TO PANDORA KIDDOOOSS!!!!"
20763,yes
20764,"Can be interesting and entertaining at times, but it's so repetitive that I can only take so much and only play multiplayer to have the added enjoyment of killing with friends."
20765,2/5
20766,a really fun and funny game. i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good FPS game.
20767,Played it alone and with friends. Amazing game even now.
20768,YES! BUY GAME! IS GUD!
20769,Not so much but OK

20773,"Still my favorite borderlands, has much more content and more variety in vault hunters but all dlc are a must."
20774,"I cannot stress how WELL OPTIMIZED this game is. I have a crappy laptop with a 940MX which makes gaming almost impossible with newer games. Borderlands 2 is by far the most stunning game I can run on my laptop in full 1080p resolution. I get the same fps as I was getting with the first BL, but this LOOKS WAY BETTER and with the shadows enabled. Congrats to 2k and Gearbox for how well they optimized this and for giving me a decent gaming experience on my laptop. Thank you!!"

20781,if you're a masochist who enjoys dying every 30 seconds & you intend on playing solo this is the game for you
20782,i love the borderlands series... enoug is said by me.

20784,I enjoyed this one. Much better with friends.
20785,"good
"
20786,One of my favorite games and I don't generally like FPS's- best to play with others.
20787,"This game is old and everybody knows it is good.  Linux support is perfect as far as I can tell.  Graphics still hold up because they were cartoon-like to start.  I like the whimsy.

It has its problems, it gets really grindy at times and the mechanics peak out from behind the curtain pretty easily: 90% of your success is dictated by character level and loot found and only 10% is some skill or strategy during the fight, but hey, that's the game.  You end up playing a lot of missions that you don't care about just to get to the stuff you do care about.

In the end, you get addicted to seeing if you can get a better gun or whatever that might help you get past that next area, even if you really don't care about whatever DLC you are playing at the time."

20795,"In this game, you play as all of Tumblr's users, rolled into a world that consists of meme culture, and shallow gun-play. It's wretched writing, lack of actual freedom, and god-awful character writing makes it to where I can't stand to play it for more than 1 hour at a time. Go play the first Borderlands instead, it's much more fun, less annoying, and isn't written by committee to appease the kiddos."

Fazit: Absolute Kaufempfehlung"
20843,"hmm, zer0 is a spicy alien man and i would give him a smooch
10/10"
20844,"I loved the original Borderlands for so many good reasons: it was a innovative for a fps, with actually good mechanics of an RPG without losing the fps touch at all. Add also a lot of exploration, a lot of black humour, gore, blood and whatever gets in your mind, no wonder Borderlands was a great game (not a master piece: it had some flaws and it was repetitive at a certain point). When this game was announced I was very curious and I couldn't wait to get it. In the end, I had to wait for a discount instead...but there are good things in the game anyway: the mechanics are almost the same, if not THE same as the previous, but with some good tweaks in controls, weapons (some have unique ways to shoot just like the previous game), classes and so forth. The new things are not a lot really: we got some more customzation, we have a bank and the possibility to store items for your alts, we got some better controls now and much more fluid (than the previous). Also the inventory is much better designed (ALWAYS than the previous game) and some better shooting (it's much more handy and less stiff). But there's not really much else to add really, because it's almost the same game.

Except it's plagued with DLC.

BUT WAIT, before anything else I want to say that I don't dislike the dlcs: I had all of them in the original Borderlands and it was fine. But here it's different, because the game was plagued from DLC literally from day 1 with an embaressing release of dlc in a very short time (first came out 21 september, the season pass, then 9 october, then 16 october, then 20 november and so on, until now). But again, as I said, Im not saying I'm against them...but I feel ripped off to the bones like this, because while they aren't relevant for the game, they tried to take away as much as they could from day one, and give it us back as DLC (and each dlc is 10 bucks by the way, so it's not cheap either). Sure, also the original game had dlc but they came out with good distance between them and I could play the game before trying the extra content. In here, it was so fast, I could barely keep up even when there was a discount and I at least wanted the 2 extra classes, which was 20 for both and 25 for the game when discounted. In other words, I felt ripped off from their greed and from a ""humble yet innovative"" game as Borderlands now we get a ""hungry for money"" game that whenever they can, they'll serve us another dlc for another 10 bucks. The dlc, in other words, may discourage you for the big amount of them, and I feel sad to see this game becoming a greedy franchise. Still a very good game and fresh to its core, but just too greedy to feel satisfied."

20910,"I have not played the first Borderlands but this Borderlands is amazing, great story line, great graphics, and awesome gameplay."
20911,Shooting up pandora with friends makes this one of the best 4 player coop games with its variety of classes to play through. However despite having played through the game at least twice with every single character in the game I wish the game had had a mechanic that let you skip to higher level playthroughs instead of having to go through everything on normal first. Additionally in hindsight a lot of the story and mission structures do not lend itself to repeat playthroughs very well since you can't really skip dialogue or anything despite having seen it 8 times. However the game is definitely worth playing through at least once completely.
20912,yes

20929,"Borderlands 2 é o melhor da franquia, com toda certeza. É até hoje um dos meus jogos favoritos.
O gameplay é divertido, com uma variedade de playstyles bem diverso. Mods ainda podem fazer o gameplay ficar ainda mais diverso, como o Borderlands 2 Reborn e tal.
A história não tem nada merecedor de Oscar, é uma história simples que é carregada nas costas pelos personagens. Jogar sem prestar atenção nos diálogos dos personagens é não aproveitar todo o divertimento fornecido por esse jogo.
O único ponto que não gosto nesse jogo é o endgame. Eu particularmente não sou muito fã do grind necessário pra fazer builds viáveis nos níveis mais altos do jogo. E o balanceamento de níveis também é um pouquinho estragado por side quests. Se você fizer todas as side-quests, vai ficar over-leveled pra main quest, e isso foi bem melhor feito no pre-sequel.
Conclusão: You're a total bitch."

The main campaign is about 40-50 hours and the story is pretty good and quite humorous too.

Its pretty, optimized, fun, a blast with friends, so many good memes, a great experience for anyone who likes gun games, as I guess this is THE gun game aint it. I Honestly have nothing negative to say. Good Game. Buy it."
20945,"I have to be honest, I got this game and almost every DLC for $6 American. That being said, it is a lot of fun, but the terrain seems to be your enemy and it gets old after a while. That being said, I'll still leave it as a recommended."
20946,i want cl4p-tp to cl4p my tp
20947,"You can tell by the number of hours I have that I love this game. My Steam hours make up probably a third or a quarter of my actual hours, since I spent an absurd amount of time with this game when it game out on the Xbox 360, when I was 12. This game was a large part of my life and friendships in middle school, and some of those friendships carry on to this day.

Borderlands 2 sports a fantastic co-op experience, but it's single player experience doesn't miss a beat. A lot of co-op games are built for co-op and really lack in the single player department, but that's not the case here. 

This is definitely the best adventure RPG FPS game I've ever played. The writing is great, the gameplay keep you engaged (even after hundreds of hours), and the times you spend with you friends while playing it are unforgettable.

At $20, this game is a steal. Add on a sale and this thing goes down to ~$5 and you're getting one of the best bang for your buck game experiences of your life. I highly recommend."

20963,"Kings of loot n shoots, hours of game play, bought this game on xbox and PC."
20964,good
20965,gr8
20966,Great shooters game. Enjoyable story and side quests
20967,"Borderlands 2 is just an absolute classic at this point. The gameplay consists of some pretty slick shooting and looting, with tons of interesting and unique guns, and plenty of enemies to try them on. The story isn't super important, but there is plenty of drama, high stakes, and that signature Borderlands humor. Tons of side activities add depth, the opportunity for better loot, and more funny stories from the people of the wastes. I'd say the best part of this game was the Tiny Tina D&D-style DLC, which was so on-point and interesting, so if you get this I highly recommend that as well. I played single-player all the way through, but of course some people will prefer to play with 3 others. Multiplayer is fine but it felt lower-stakes since most of the time I would show up in the quest area to everything already being dead. If you're an FPS fan, you should absolutely give this game a try, and don't worry about playing the first game before this one. Highly recommended!"

20969,"My first impressions were very negative compared to Borderlands - unbelievably weak guns, stingy loot drops, I don't like the HUD, I hate the backpack mechanics, etc.  However, after having played 19 hours, it is growing on me. I've finally acquired a good smg and a decent sniper rifle and the pistols are finally worth using.  The enemies are still rather OP but the guns are starting to catch up. All in all, a rather slow and frustrating start but it's beginning to be fun. I have a pretty decent gaming desktop (i7-6700k w/ a gtx 1080 in a cooler master haf xb case w/ 200 mm roof fan) and this is the first non-stress test software that has caused my case fans to ramp up to high speed after a half hour of playing although the gtx 1080 is happy with it.
  Ah!  I now have over 300 hours into the standard game and it is what I return to every time I have a spare minute or hour to spend with it.   I have hit a few bugs that caused the game to freeze in odd places. Some maps I love and some I hate.  At this point in the game, I feel a little OP and tend to do a John Wayne walking right  up the middle of a fight but I'm sure that will change in another level or two.   Somewhere between 20-50 hours, this game became addictive and I'm very glad that I stuck with it.  I absolutely recommend this game!"

20972,"Well this is now the fourth system I've bought this for.

Right, the age-old PC vs. console argument has been shown to be bang on in this respect.  This runs so much better than 360/PS3/PS4 (duh, right?) that it's hilarious.  Smoother, more particles and just a generally nicer experience.

Top drawer looter-shooter that everyone should try out - but remember to get the Handsome Collection, it's such good value."
20973,yes
20974,"my favorite game of all time, do yourself a favor and get it on a steam sale"
20975,"rad game, even better with bl2fix"
20976,Didn't like this as much as i liked Borderlands Pre Sequel.
20977,Very fun game to play. If you love to explore and or play fun games with your friends this game is great.
20978,This game has consumed my life on multiple occasions just because everytime I think I'm done with this game the game comes back around. If you like adult jokes and lots and lots of loot I suggest this game for you
20979,One of the best games of all time amazing story and amazing characters with each twist and turn you feel your heart drop. Then there's the farming for better loot expanding each characters with skills points and not to mention the AMAZING DLCs if you haven't played this game you're missing out.
20980,"its the best

20998,"In my opinion, this is the best Borderlands in the series to date! Best combat, best weapons, fun missions, and great character class choices. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get into this series. Also, this game runs smoothly on most computers, even ones without a dedicated graphics card which was a huge plus for me before I got a gaming computer. 10/10 hands down!"
20999,"Grindy, boring, and unfunny"
21000,yes yes yes yes good game
21001,"This is a really great game, with a lot of really crazy choices. It really kept me invested when I first played, and to this day, I am still invested in this game."

21003,Guns go BRRRR
21004,good job! a fun game
21005,"Maybe I'm just a simple guy but there's a few things about this game that make the play (and replay)  just a whole lot of fun. For one, the graphic style is very appealing to me - cartoonish but with a steampunk feel, an iengaging cast of characters and mission plot and, of course, the bad guy comments which I never get tired of. And did I mention Claptrap? He hasn't lost any of his personality from the original game. In fact, there's quite a conversation between him and Sir Hammerlock concerning Bullymong fur that is my personal favorite :) Borderlands 2 is, in my mind, a classic mission-based FPS. As long as you don't mind a little gore and graphic violence, this game is a treat."

21041,this game is the best borderlands game so far with the amazing content bo3 is missing out on no raid bosses and also not a single new person to play as sadly but bo2 has it all

21068,"I have never quit playing a game no matter how boring. I just can't play this anymore. This has to be the most boring feature title ever released. After 74 minutes, there is no story hook, the dialogue is lame, the characters have no depth. The weapons are all pretty much the same. I bought this two years ago and was just getting around to playing it but dang this is the worst game."
21069,vgnjzposinh
21070,"Played this game multiple times (on multiple consoles) through on almost every mode possible with every character possible. This is an ICONIC game. It is one of the best stories thats ever been created and what I believe to be some of the best writing ever possible. THERE IS NO ONE THAT CAN OUT WRITE THE VILLAIN OF THIS GAME EVER. He's the best character ever made. That being said if you love stories and want a really really good one combined with some of the coolest weapons and art work this is the game for you.

This game still to this day holds up as one of the best and is currently being challenged by Borderlands 3 which is almost as good if not better. They certainly improved many things in number 3 but number 2 is definitely worth the money and time.


10/10 i wish I could find a better game then this."

21126,Really fun if you got friends to play with!

21128,"Do I recommend the game? Yes. 
Why do I recommend it? I had fun with friends while drunk and it was a good time.

Do I support the latest actions from Gearbox Studios and how they released/handled the press for Borderlands 3? Absolutely not."
21129,Tons of fun. Great story. Great game.
21130,This game is alot of fun. All the different guns are so crazy. Avoid bandit weapons. They suck
21131,A classic
21132,"This is the definitive Borderlands experience for me. The humor is there, the combat is there and the looting is great. BL1 had it's charm and was a great starting point but they really hit their stride with this one. Handsome Jack is a great nemesis and fighting his faction is some of the best combat. The destructibility of his robots is key and co-op is definitely the way to go! I've played through this game twice on PC and once on xbox 360 when it came out."
21133,bad

21141,good game give me awards
21142,"It is not that fun, but I guess it is justified for the price. I still would not recommend it."
21143,fun game

21145,gud
21146,"When i comes to how to do a FPS the right way and keeping it over the top, look no further then Borderlands 2.  Tons of guns to fit anyone's needs, a villian who is not some over the top bad guy but one you can love to hate and an annoying rapping robot that we all want to shot."
21147,"The original Borderlands was groundbreaking, introducing Cell Shading in video games and making it actually work, and work well! It had massive replay value as you really wanted to explore the various characters and their skill trees. The weapons were a huge draw as there was always one just little better dropping from that next bad guy.

Borderlands 2 doubled down and made most things better. Better stories, some new and exciting characters and weapons that made you sit up and say, ""Oh, HELL YES!""  I like the new baddies and loved some of the NPCs so much, I was hoping BL3 would make them playable. 

Unfortunately, I think BL2 started to go off the rails with some of the characters, introducing some mechanics that were, in my sole opinion, problematic at best, seemingly solely designed for the anal retentive stat junkies who spend hours and hours pouring over each piece of gear and drive their coop buddies absolutely insane when they have to wait for them. Again. And again. 

I get that some folks actually like them and more power to them, just not my cuppa. Still, if you set aside Gage and Kreig's horrible modifier nonsense, the rest of the game was outstanding and stood well on its own. 

The DLCs added hours of fun and were a real value, not some stupid skin or other worthless trinket. 

One of the best game series I have played in years."

21153,Timeless RPG-Looter Shooter that will appeal to any fans of this type of genre.
21154,"Fucking hilarious, awesome gameplay, neverending badassery"

21157,pretty damn good now get me mas loot hooker
21158,"++++
The gameplay is fun although some key feature like slide and climbing are missing. 
The story was fine and made me laugh many times (in a good way).
Each character is unique.

1. STORY- The story is one of the best stories you'll find out here, the plot twists, the characters and 
                  everything is so well made!
2. SIDE QUESTS- Side missions are a must do in borderlands 2 because of all the characters you meet, the 
                             unique weapons you find and the stories they add to the game.
3. DLC- Some are good, Some are bad
4. WEAPONS- Over 3 Billion weapons so that sums it up for you.
5. MORE WEAPONS- Like A L O T.

21180,Funny!
21181,Very Nais Game
21182,its good
21183,Hours of pure action.
21184,"a Legendary game, 100/10 recommend!"
21185,"H
"
21186,fantastic game with a lot of life left in it after 8 years
21187,11/10 Would shoot Butt Stallion again.
21188,one of the greats
21189,A good game with good humour. I just personally don't like the game or find it funny. Art style makes up for it though.
21190,Is good
21191,Best game <3
21192,this game is very exciting
21193,Best Game in World
21194,"Its fucken sick
"
21195,"Great game, tons of variety and different play styles"
21196,yeeeeeeeeeeess
21197,i always come back
21198,This Game brings back alot of memories for me with my dad that has passed away recently to me back in middle school. this game is a classic and to see it come so far is incredible. its sad that my father didnt get to see how good the game has truly gotten and the player base that it still contains to this day. the community is thriving with people eager to talk about the game and what they do and dont like about the game and have in depth conversations about the best way to beat a raid boss. this game was a childhood favorite and brings back memories of Yoteslaya he was a gem untill he unfortunatley passed away but still great game.
21199,shoot bad guy get loot
21200,yes
21201,"I have played many, many video games over my lifetime. I'm only 18, so of course that isn't a particularly LONG lifetime, but it is a full one. Whether they be classic platformers, turn based RPGS, more niche titles, relaxed simulator games, or brutally difficult action games by FromSoftware, I have played them all. I say this because out of all of these games, Borderlands 2 is my favorite. Buy this game. I won't say ANYTHING about it even though you've all played it by now. Just know this. You're in for the time of your life."
21202,Loved this on xbox. Love this on mac...keeep it coming! Cause I still love it!
21203,Good Game
21204,pre good
21205,fun
21206,Fantastic shooter/rpg with lots of randomized loot and endless replay value.
21207,"yes
"
21208,"Can't recommend the game

I tried to play through it but it gets really annoying.  I can't get past one of the boss enemies without running out of ammo, as it's not a bullet sponge but a god damn black hole. The vehicle parts suck, the story isn't that good (so far) and the weapons are boring.

Forcing myself to get though the game, but I really wish I hadn't spend the money for this"
21209,"The best game to play during the lockdown, to be honest."
21210,"The story is quite alright, even if the characters are a bit hit or miss. The gunplay is a lot of fun and the areas have a lot of variety. The enemies are kinda same-ish and the skill tree pretty much irrelevant due to how little a level up really matters. It's mostly a looter shooter than an rpg shooter."
21211,"Just made my switch to pc from console, I played 900 hours of borderlands 2 on console and I just got it for pc. I'll tell you what, it is worth the buy. You will never get bored of this game. It is a whole new experience on pc for me."
21212,A great game that is a blast to the past of the original borderlands. great with friends or solo
21213,"Game Good! Shoot, smash, kill! Many Pretty Lady. GAME GOOD!"
21214,nice
21215,"Not a bad game, and its really fun with friends."
21216,most of the community content is moxxxi and her bewbs
21217,Good.
21218,Game good
21219,sadly the coop is so laggy and I can't enjoy the game because solo is pretty boring
21220,very nice
21221,"I picked this game up after not playing for years, and it's still fun as ever. A definite classic."
21222,"Despite playing this game for +3 years, and only mastering 1 character (Maya: the Siren), I love the story-line, game-play, and build of each of the characters' back stories (excluding Zer0 who remains to be hidden). This game is great if you're looking for a mix of light hearted humour and having your feelings stomped into the desolate, barren, Pandoran dust."
21223,good game
21224,"Cool
"
21225,"One of the best games ever made. Best villain ever to be made! Character tree freedom and creativity along with the LOOOOOOOOT keep me constantly coming back to Pandora. ""Are you ready?"""
21226,"CPU intensive yet fun to play
"
21227,"as a fan of the entire Borderlands franchise, Borderlands 2 has got to be my favourite of them all. the gameplay and storyline are very fulfilling, and even the side missions are fun. i'm glad i got to play this multiple times over!"
21228,"its fun its great the guns are creative and amazing they are rare so you feel great when you get it, some of them are tedious to farm because the nearest spawn to the guy you kill/turn in is across the map. another thing is if you dont turn on read only, the only way to farm quest items is to alt f4 out and join back in game which is annoying. the co op is ok I guess, the servers kinda suck since gearbox switched from steam to its own, they crash often and they lag frequently. dont bother with co op if your farming because you have to reconnect every time you save quit, for bossing its ok i guess since its easier with multiple people. dont bother with this game if you have a shit pc because the options to make the game run easier dont make it run better, you cant turn off god rays, the low quality textures dont affect much at all and particles eat a lot of ram and cant be disabled. the dlc are fun and mostly worth it (aside from hammerlock) and one of the two dlc characters is really good and the other (gaige) really only has one decent build and its forced so you cant do much else. the many assorted people (playable and otherwise) in the game are great and well written and voiced almost perfectly. the weapons system is amazing, you can have different parts on your gun to change its stats in different ways i cant describe in a reasonable amount of time, it makes it so you cant just get an item and go, its makes it so you have to farm more so you can get the item you want perfect and if you dont get the right parts a great item can be made so much worse, its a way of balancing and really working for a stupidly good gun when it could be okay, this works especially for quest items because if the parts weren't randomized, you could do a quest (most of which are not hard) turn it in and get a great gun garunteed and win the video game. overall, this game is good as a single player game with ok co op 7/10 would get on sale"
21229,This is an excellent game. Its got a great story and great gameplay while also maintaining a chill kind of shoot and loot vibe. This is definitely my favorite game out of the franchise and I would definitely recommend it.
21230,it game
21231,its extremely addicting and i had a good time 6 years ago i met my best friend on it
21232,Fun game. Even better when you play with friends!
21233,"Definitely recommended! Great cooperation game and If you got friends you can play with, so go ahead. It's worth buying."
21234,This games cures boredom.
21235,Shoot and loot and laugh
21236,"Still one of my favourite games to date, idc how old it is, please buy this"
21237,9/10.
21238,its good
21239,good
21240,ye
21241,Still better then Borderlands 3
21242,good game
21243,it ugf
21244,masterpiece!!!!!!
21245,Loot galore!
21246,"Overall very good and enjoyable game, bosses have a little too much health but other than that I have no problems with gameplay. However, the main menu frustrates me, you are only able to have one game at a time, so if you click 'new game', it overrides your current save, and it doesn't have a conformation button, it just does it instantly. 

Twice now I have lost all my progress because I clicked 'new game' rather than 'continue'"
21247,lit
21248,No idea what they green lite the 3rd. Should have died with this one.
21249,"Bruh, if you don't know about this game yet then you must be living under a rock. This game revolutionized gun mechanics and inspire MANY subsequent games. I've beaten this game a few times and it's always one that I'll come back to. Whether it is for the incredibly rich story or the fun shoot shoot shoot game mechanics. Yes, there are quite a few fetch quests and if you are a completionist it can become a bit daunting but I would highly recommend this game to anyone in the market."
21250,HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
21251,"This game is fun and can be grindy but its fun either way
"
21252,<3
21253,"Really fun game, bet it would be better if my friends would actually play it with me"
21254,"42 hours in, and I've only barely scratched the surface."
21255,fun gayme
21256,It's pretty fun. Still makes me laugh in 2020
21257,"you get to beat up some D&D tiny tina lookin person and then u beat Deathwing from World of Warcraft: The Video Game

21262,u run around doing missions looking cute as hell
21263,its good

21268,Best ever invested money in a game!
21269,lots of fun
21270,stellar
21271,A great masterpiece
21272,"Honestly one of the best FPS to play, especially since it's on sale every month. 

It's very fun to pick up and play, and it's REALLY addictive when you get deeper into the game story/DLCs.

BL2's Late Game, however, is hard as hell (not to mention UVHM and OP Lvls, Matching 
Element Types, Slag being almost Essential To have).

But even after all that, it's still holds up to the test of time, plus playing co-op with your buddies is KINO!

Shame that Randy Pitchford is a scumbag tho"
21273,very epic game+ handsome jck
21274,I wonder what it's like to have a belly button
21275,"a great classic, hilarious voice lines and perfect for just relaxing and running around in an fps"
21276,"yup
"
21277,9/10 the only thing I hate about this game is the W A L K I N G time like damn I gotta run back and forth an entire map sometimes just for one side quest but other than that this a pretty boppin gaem
21278,"Did not find this game to be particularly satisfying. Combat is ok, just not for everyone."
21279,"best game ever 
"
21280,Eh
21281,Great game
21282,"after 2000 hours of this game I can't say it's not worth the price. Amazing co-op game, though no splitscreen on pc, who plays splitscreen anyway these days? But even singleplayer, it's fun to farm for gear, the gear is fun to use, and even in the end-game, a lot of it is viable. So much variety in play-style, and the sheer amount of content there is in side missions, dlc, and the main story gives it huge replay value. It's one of my favorite games of all time, however I do have some complaints. It has a lot of glitches, and they're not always the fun kind. and the art style while being charming, can sometimes get in the way of actually seeing what the player is doing. With enemy rockets flying at you and explosions it's possible to get lost, and miss shots because of it. and the particle effects that hit the screen on some maps are just annoying, I wish I could turn them off, but they're somewhat easy to ignore. After all these years I just see these things as part of what I love so much about this game. Just buy it."
21283,I have played this game on the console first so i have way more time played than this and have been playing it since day one i would recommend this to anyone who loves looter shooters
21284,Clap the trap
21285,is good
21286,"nice graphics at 1080 or 4k, great game to play with friends."
21287,lewis said buy it
21288,It's a good game.
21289,legitimately better than bl3
21290,"Only good with BL2Fix found on Nexus Mods. Gives the best experience for a casual player
"
21291,great game love it
21292,Good game and always fun to come back to after you haven't been playing it for a long time
21293,Best story game ive ever played.
21294,"It's Borderlands. One of the gaming staples of those who like First Person Shooters. Chock full of references, secrets, easter eggs, 'plodable baddies, guns that laugh at you, it's hard not to feel like a bada** yourself as you run across this not so desolate wasteland."
21295,its a cool game to play i have played before and its my first time on pc and its kinda fun
21296,too many guns
21297,Lots of action and quirky humor.  Love the game.
21298,"just an awesome classic I revisit every couple years
"
21299,Great story! This game has one of the best stories in any game in my oppinion. The game looks good and the loot system is awesome and makes you want more!
21300,"2 gud
"
21301,Hey Guys!  This game is a blast!  Lots of fun shooting things and all the crazy trash talk with the game characters!
21302,"Cartoon mawn go squill, after the skrrt skrrt on nthe big boy van while 4 armed shit goes uwu."
21303,:D
21304,just a good game to play with friends.
21305,"If you are looking for a single player game, and looter-shooters are your thing, this is the best option.  Amazing game, cant recommend enough."
21306,"Better than BL3, that's for sure"
21307,i dont even know what the heck you doing with your self if you didnt play this yet
21308,"I find it just as great as the first one, except lots more to do to keep you busy!!!!"
21309,a true classic
21310,"Nice game, with hilarious comedy. Recommended if you like looting in games."
21311,Great Game. 3rd time replaying it.

21314,fun
21315,Its awsome game i recommend to everyone!
21316,"goud
"
21317,"Best looter shooter of century. No other words. Lots of fun in mechanics, collection, story, over all gags value, the actual game play, graphics."
21318,nice game
21319,gun go boom
21320,The only thing about this game that I genuinely dislike is the Dragon Keep DLC.
21321,better than the first by far
21322,"goo game
"
21323,"Great art style, and the open world FPS game works really well. You can easily get 20+ hours of entertainment from this game (depending how much you enjoy side missions)."
21324,fun
21325,It has multiplayer and the dialogs are very funny.
21326,My wife left me
21327,Fun Game. I like the story and the DLC is cool too. It can get boring after finishing the campaign for the first time though.
21328,Flame
21329,"classic, great character builds and abilities."
21330,big fun
21331,"very fun with friends and not when you are alone because you realise how lonely you actually are. 
8/10 alone
10/10 with friends"
21332,uh yeah duh
21333,if you play this solo its kinda boring but its 2021 and theres still public online lobbies. Some people come to my game to play. The graphics run better than a console i have it at 72frames or unlocked. its smooth like butter. The guns dont have weight to it tho they are like worse than nerf guns paper weight.
21334,very good!!!
21335,Really love the storyline. I have played it like 400 times and still enjoy it. I also like the variety of characters and playstyles. And the best part hansome Jack Probably the best villian ever.

Not much, standard borderlands game, same old graphics, same old game play, can't complain about it. 
Can get repetitive after while but depends if you are with anyone or not.

6/10"
21342,just shot and loot
21343,"This game is really well made. It's 8 years after the release of it, and It's still fun to play with pretty solid graphics, for it's time. I'm a massive fan of the art style in this game, and the campaign is well crafted"
21344,not gud
21345,pew pew pew .... BOOOOOM... and something about this jack dude but ultimately making holes in monsters with various weapons types and abilities is a great core game play mechanic.

I can no longer type without the risk of shooting a hole through my 3rd keyboard.
I can no longer safely high five my children.
My prior career as a professional basketballer is all but ruined.
There is no future for me. There is no hope. There is only guns.

21355,Yes
21356,Лучшая игра для игры с лучшим другом.
21357,very good game it got me addicted to it when i was a little pube and 8 years later im a bigger pube and its the best game of all time
21358,Finally got around the this game. Glad I got it.
21359,"This game can be played by both young and old. Its a standard first person shooter. Its really fun and difficult at times. Can be played alone or with up to 4 players. Can even have a team of all the same characters. There are lots of guns to buy, earn or farm. Can customize your character with different skins, heads. It can be enjoyed alone but it a bit better with others."

21376,"Very gud
"
21377,"I know I'm one of the few who don't like this game. The gameplay was ok, nothing more. he  respawning of enemies was really annoying."
21378,"I'm gonna say it straight: I think this game is overhyped as fuck. The artificial difficulty is absolutely infuriating, the dialogue and humour are just plain cringe, the story felt rushed and lackluster to me and the ending was generic in my view. I wasn't a big fan of the fact that enemies have so much health that you can unload all of your ammo, grenades and special abilities on them and they're still standing with 3/4 of their health? Unbelievable. 


I guess the guns are pretty cool though (even if they are practically useless as mentioned in the above statement), so there's that."
21379,I just found the whole aesthetic and gameplay pleasing and engaging in so many ways.
21380,"Classic looting fps. Many hours of multiplayer fun. Beautiful graphics, gore and not too serious atmosphere."
21381,"much good idk wut 2 say ummm kill people

and second the game feels like shit to play

(im not mad)"
21408,There isn't much to say about Borderlands 2 that hasn't been said already. It's a beautifully stylized game with witty and hilarious humor and incredibly likable characters. This isn't even touching upon the smartly crafted areas with tons of fun yet challenging enemies and bosses with weapon variety that keeps the game feeling fresh and intuitive the whole way through. Every play through is completely unique with skill trees and varied weapons to suit any play style. Paired with a fun and chaotic multiplayer and you'll be playing for hours trying to complete just one more quest.

21416,Even years later the game is still fun and worth a play.
21417,happy happy fun time
21418,"Do you like guns? Do you like shooting baddies? Do you like looting?

Great for singleplayer or playing with friends.

Summary: Great bang for your buck, especially in 2012!
"
21429,the game is just bad and i dont like the art still
21430,"I think I'm finally qualified to rate this Game, after getting All characters to OP8 (some multiple times) and some to OP 10 (from Level 1). It is and I believe always will be my favorite game ever. I don't even know what I love about this game. There is so much to critique badly about it; It's super glitchy at times. Getting specific Gear is almost always an absolut Pain in the Ass. There are to few viable weapons on higher difficulties. The huge reliance on Slag throuoght OP levels and UVHM. Some huge Plot holes in the story. Most things tend to be super grindy.

 But, somehow, I still love all this about Borderlands 2. The glitches add an element to the game to explore after you are done with playing it ""vanilla"". Getting that perfect parted weapon you are looking for fills you joy and you are happy to find that one unexpected World drop. Higher difficulties are actually difficult and expect some expertise in the game. The story is still one of the best vide game storys I have experieneced; the characters, the humor, the story itself are all great IMO. I love these super grindy games, because it gives me some sort of goal to keep playing it. And if I'm done, I'm just starting a new character and do it all over again. No two Playthroughs are the same. The Community is huge and has come up with so many challenges and mods for the game to keep it fresh it is insane. Playing it with friends is great fun. It's fun for players who just want to go through it casually once or for those who want to beat everything.

This game is IMO one of the greatest games we have had in the last decade or even since the 2000s had begun. I love it for what it is and I can only recommend it for everyone out there."
21431,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
21432,"This is an FPS where your character has a promotion tree, so there's some customization.  I was worried it wouldn't really be my kind of game, but I was worried about nothing.  The story is just good enough to keep you interested, but the challenges and the humor make it enjoyable and replayable.  There's hundreds of hours of enjoyment (about 60 if you only play through once but do the optional missions)."

21450,"The game is overall good.

The loot game is good, but the gun part of it feels bad, specifically A LOT of guns are extremely inaccurate, so playing this shooter game with guns that shoot everywhere but where you aim is quite frustrating.

Very limited inventory space is also the bane of any hoarder-type players.

There's a lot of post-campaign replayability for people who care about things like that, grinding loot and killing world bosses, possibly in coop. I personally don't see a point in that.

I also personally really don't like the cel shaded look of the game and the same stiff looking animations as the first game."

21489,"Pretty weak game. Overwhelming amount of ammo, can't make it harder, crappy movement, rewards (like money in random boxes everywhere) make no sense, and, worst of all, the story is just lame. ""go do this."" ""help us and do this."" ""Now go do this."""
21490,"One of the best game series ever, bought it on PS3 PS4, now on PC, by far the best Borderlands story ever compared to that garbage 3 is."
21491,
21492,"Even with the years that I've played this game there's still things that I know I haven't done or seen and I don't mean that in a bad way at all. Definitely my favourite addition to the series and easily the one with the best writing. Like a-many other I came for the characters and writing and stayed for the gameplay and grind.

Combined with hundreds of hours on console this may be that game that I've put the most hours into ever, and I'll only keep putting in more.

EDIT: Automatic non-recommendation due to in-game advertising. Get your wonderlands ads the fuck outta the game. Disgusting.

Second EDIT:

*You've played an additional 64 hours*
not since changing my review to negative for in-game advertising I haven't
*Would you like to revise your review?*

Actually, I think I will. I've recently learned that by going to Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Borderlands 2 > WillowGame > CookedPCConsole (or more simply just browsing Borderlands 2’s local game files) and renaming UI_Frontend_Upsell_SF.upk to anything else you can disable the newly added in-game banner ad!

My review, however, will unfortunately and indefinitely remain unchangeably negative until any and all in-game advertising is removed, as I consider it absolutely unacceptable.

Kindly, fuck off steam, if I recently changed my review to be negative, then I did it for a fucking reason."

21498,its amazing
21499,"Having played this game for a bit, and getting all the achievements, I can say that without a doubt, this game is worth the investment. I got it for dirty cheap and frankly it is worth a lot more than it's sequel. If you are into looter shooters, this is [i]The[/i] looter shooter."

21508,very good
21509,"I got this game for $2.50 and have spent over 400 hours in it. It will probably end up taking a spot on my top 10 video games of all time list sometime in the near future.

The tag-line is ""Dig, fight, explore, build! Nothing is impossible in this action-packed adventure game."" And that is pretty darn accurate. It is a very in-depth sandbox that is also content driven. Think 2D Minecraft, but with more content (as in more developer created mobs/challenges/objectives for you to take on). The addition of an expert mode brought a whole new challenge to the game that added at least another 100-200 hours on the game for me. I heard there's even a mode beyond this now that I haven't tried yet, but likely will someday.

I love how there are various play-styles you can choose. You can be a heavy melee fighter with beefy tank armor. You can be a nimble ninja with ranged weapons, using your grappling hook or wings to dodge and keep clear, you can be a spell caster to bombard enemies with magics, you can be a summoner and let minions do the fighting for you, or you can mix and match any of these: like have 1 or 2 minions with you, while you drop a spell on the enemy, as you rain bullets on them, and then finish them off with a sword, its up to you. You could even do virtually no combat at all and just mine and build.

I love sandboxes, but I think one of the downsides to them is the lack of an objective. I have played and enjoyed Minecraft off and on for years, but always found that, once I built my house and collected some diamonds and ventured into the Nether, I was feeling tired of it all. (To Minecraft's credit, there's a huge amount of modding and more content added so don't think I am a Minecraft hater, its a great game) But in Borderlands 2I have these hours played because there is another boss to take on, a better weapon to seek, an accessory to shoot for, a new challenge to overcome - but it's also not on rails, it has that sandbox element where I can kick back and build an entire town for a while, between seeking out the next boss/challenge/dungeon. And I can really put my all into building - much like Minecraft, there is a huge assortment of blocks and ways to customize/reshape them to make some really amazing structures.

Oh yes, and I am doing this all with my friends on a self-hosted realm - which amplifies all of the fun.

To think I could spend $2 on a game and get this amount of enjoyment, I almost want to buy it again just to support Re-Logic. I was crushed to see borderlands 2 official patch get cancelled. I really hope there will be something big for this game (like a sequel) in the future.

This game is worth every penny if it were $20. At $10 its a deal. Anything less than $10, buy it immediately and never look back. I LOVE Borderland 2."
21510,nice
21511,Better than BL3.
21512,I can personally said I've had a good go at this game. Now in the future I've decided to share my enjoyment of this game with my partner. She likes it. I like it.

21517,Muy divertido con una historia entretenida que si juegas con amigos va a ser la experiencia de tu vida.
21518,"Wow. What can I say that already hasn't been said? If you own this game, and haven't played it... well you've done yourself a major disservice. A stunning array of playable characters, all with lovable personalities and the deadliest of skill trees, versus what is in my opinion the all-time best villain EVER in a game series... Handsome Jack. This evil, Hyperion CEO is out to clean up Pandora... starting with you and the rest of the Crimson Raiders! He also yammers at you constantly through your echo device. This makes getting to the end and defeating him SO satisfying. And the DLC has to be seen to be believed. A thousand times better than the original in every way, this is a classic that I am almost always playing."
21519,"If you love Adventure,this is the game for you."

21535,FUN
21536,"I mean I tried it for a couple minute's it's pretty cool
That Jack guy is pretty handsome I guess everybody just collectively agreed"
21537,"This game very good, i play much"
21538,"Though I was late to playing the game after its prime (In other words; I first tired it in 2020), this game is an absolute blast.
The blend of shooter, RPG, and even some open world elements make this a fantastic title to play for the long run, or even as just a nice, hectic timesink.
I had originally started playing this thanks to one of my friends sharing his Steam library with me, before I eventually bought it myself in the Handsome Collection, allowing me to also play the DLC I was missing.
The class system in the game is a great way to give options of players of different playstyles, and the looter aspect of the game allows a flow of constant change and adaptability, without feeling like your options are limited to you, or that you have a chance to lose everything you find. (Like in roguelikes)
Overall, an incredibly solid game. While I've never tried out the multiplayer for it yet, I have heard that it's really fun, and an absolute blast to play with friends. But even as someone who played the game solo; the massive amount of content, story, and sense of humor are enough to keep you engaged the whole way."
21539,yes yes yes yes yes
21540,"It's borderlands, you run and gun and loot them all!

No part of this game is necessarily 5/5, but all of the parts are consistently at least 4/5.
Good music, good characters, good story, good gameplay, good progression, good enemies, good missions, etc. etc.

As long as you don't mind the mindless killing and gore, it should be a must play.

21550,"Great game if you enjoy rpg/fps games, can easily put hundreds of hours into the base game let alone the dlc."
21551,"This game is boring, obnoxious dialogue, trash gunplay, boring story. Don't buy this even when it and all of the DLC is $5"
21552,story yes
21553,Better than Borderlands 3.
21554,"GG,
After the first 17 hours of playing, you'll begin to feel boring if you will play it solo but with your friends you will not get bored ."
21555,"While Borderlands 3 improves the general gameplay immensely, in my honest opinion Borderlands 2 is far more deserving of praise and being called the best Looter Shooter. The characters are VASTLY more enjoyable than in BL3 and BL1 and the gameplay while maybe not as good as BL3 is still extremely solid. This is the best game to jump in with if youre interested in BL or the Looter Shooter genre and it's aged very well. Grab all the DLC on sale if you can theyre great (another thing BL3 didn't do as well)

And as a sidenote, Handsome Jack is legitimately one of if not the BEST villains in gaming ever (Vaas from Far Cry 3 being his main competition) and that was another thing BL3 sorely lacked. Seriously if you haven't played BL2 yet. Do so."

21569,The matchmaking works unlike BL3
21570,"Fun game, constant fetch questing gets boring quick tho. SIde missions intentionally appear after a main mission in an area forcing you to explore again. Kinda wack tbh"
21571,"Great with friends, fun gunplay and a comedic storyline.

7.5/10 :)"
21572,My audio will not work no matter what fix i may try the game is super broken.
21573,"I'M THE CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN
Seriously, this game is such a masterpiece! The characters, the story, the weapons, hell, even the DLC is phenomenal!
If I had to pick between TF2 or BL2, I'd pick BL2 because this game is such an enjoyable one since it can be replayed thanks to the many playstyles you can make with the 4 (or 6 if you have the DLC) Vault Hunters you can choose from. I honestly like playing all but Maya and Zer0 since I have no friends to play this with yet.
 The dialogue in this game is amazing and when you meet Torgue in the Dragon Keep DLC, you get to hear the ""PUNCH HIM SO HARD HE EXPLODES"" line that everyone should listen to at least 5 times
Oh yeah, never forget the antagonist in this game: Handsome Jack, he is one of, if not, the best antagonists in an FPS, maybe even rivaling the Makyrs from Doom Eternal!
Please, if you can, buy this game along with the Commander Lilith DLC to have the full experience with this amazing game"

21585,"One of the best co-ops, I have played so far"
21586,"nice with it
"
21587,yes
21588,Still the best game in the Borderlands series. The story and humor save it from the potential repetitiveness of looty-shooty type games (like the first installment of the series). Also offers surprisingly great replay value and DLCs that actually add side stories worth playing.
21589,"Excellent game as a singleplayer and excellent as a coop one, although, recommended with friends rather with random people.
The variety is overwhelming in a good way, the enemies can really punish you if you don`t have the correct weapon but there is a lot to choose from.
The story is not great, but is not bad either, and you can enjoy it just by the humour some characters handle.
I have played this game on another gaming system but I`m glad I got it here now,
"
21590,"This game is amazing, I have played it multiple times and it gives me a nostalgia feeling like no other game can. I love the characters and story arcs. Ten out of Ten. KABOOM"
21591,Nice
21592,"Finished it on the PS3 and PS4 still playing through it on Xbox 1 and then thought I'd play it on the PC because this game is awesome its so fun and insane.  If I buy the Switch I'll probably play it on that.

Highly recommend this game."
21593,"This game is just Looove 😍😍😍
If you haven't played this, do it now, like right now.
The story and the characters will stay with you for a lonnnng time. 
Also, If you can, buy the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep dlc. you'll love it.
Finally, Handsome Jack. That is all."
21594,Coooooooooool!
21595,"Played it for 2-3 characters, still much game to be played."
21596,You get to be a poop train conductor
21597,Masterpiece <3
21598,"Disappointment from the first game.  Cringey humor played up dramatically.  Personalities given to characters from first game are awful.  Gameplay is a basic looter Shooter so leveled zones must be balanced well, but they aren't.  Don't play this game unless you have a couple of friends who are willing to put up with bullshit and just make your own fun in a very meh looter shooter attempting to give you a ""MMO feel""."
21599,Really good looter shooter game
21600,Oh god so much replayablity
21601,"Still holds up after all these years, works well with Discord, tons of content.  Playing with friends isn't a must, but it does improve the experience."
21602,I love the art style and humor of this game. It's replayable with so many different challenges and fun things to see and do.

21618,"good, i like. not borderlands 3. p gud"
21619,"absolute classic. story line is funny, characters are memorable, handsome jack is one of the best villains of all time, skill trees and guns play great, community mods are amazing, end game and dlc is some of the best, multiplayer is always fun.

down side is if you want to get all 6 characters maxed you have to complete the full story line for each which is boring as fuck. can get around this by copying a save file of a character that has already completed tvhm and changing it to another class in gibbed so not a big issue."
21620,"After all these years, i still come back to this game once in awhile. Great game overall. Definitely must get it!"
21621,gg
21622,"With friends it's fun in short doses, especially if one person cheats for infinite golden keys.  Alone, the gameplay loop just gets tiring and tedious.  Just constantly looking at stats and trying to think if something is ACTUALLY better than what you have, usually you find out it kinda sucks right after you thought it was better and sell the other gun you had, and even good ones aren't very good for long because the guns don't level up with you."
21623,"If you want to grind a old game this is a good choice, although you are better off getting Borderlands 3 :)"
21624,yuh
21625,Old but perfect
21626,One of the all time classics!
21627,Bad.

handsomecolection when on sale is ur best bet all dlc 
if u dont want all i would sugest
1.tiny tina asault on dragon keep (good story wise and farming)
2.headhunter pack 3 merchenaryday    (just farming the chests)

21641,"If you are looking for a unique art style, your favorite easter eggs, good skill tree and leveling system then by all means buy this game. I highly suggest you get 3 of your buddys to join you and complete normal, true and ultimate vault hunter modes. Do all the DLC's because you will look back and say damn that was a f***ing great game!"
21642,"One of my favorite games of all time. Gameplay is fun, guns are plentiful, and story is still fresh after years. Not as action-packed as some games, but has more story-based side quests too. Out of all the Borderlands games, I think that this one is least deserving of criticism, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
21643,its great game
21644,This game's pretty good.

21671,lame
21672,"Very Fun and good story gameplay , has bugs here and there , but its best fun and more exciting with friends"
21673,"Garbage.

The game doesn't really deserve any other description. Boring gameplay, uninteresting weapon-levelling mechanics (like any other shooter), ridiculously unfunny writing which makes you want to throw your monitor out every time a character opens their mouth, horribly annoying voice acting for many of said characters, the list goes on. I honestly cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy playing this pile of shit, as I find it to be less fun than doing literal chores."
21674,wack
21675,buy this instead of bl3 and save some money KEKW
21676,P good
21677,Absolutely top tier game.
21678,its fun

21680,i got this game when it was on sale and i have to say it's still doing good 8 years later
21681,I know I may be a little late but this game is one of the most amazing FPS I have every played I really enjoyed even playing it solo. Their is plenty content even with out buying all the dlc. I put 40 hours in it already and still havent beaten the game which is a great thing for me.
21682,"One of my favorite games: the story is pretty good, there are a lot of fun ways to play, and it isn't too grindy for a loot and shoot. Some of the DLC are also real fun."
21683,i would because its good come on really?
21684,it's alright
21685,"Fun to play co-op and solo! Frustratingly, though, it often kicks us out during a boss battle! (And the internet connection is fine so....?)"
21686,"been playing this for years, it even better with friends. the dlcs are very fun and it has an ok amount of content"
21687,shits gangster
21688,Solid 8.1/10
21689,"Top tier, love it, fuck it tho."
21690,"Great game, hours of fun and challenges"
21691,"haha loot go brrrrrrr
"
21692,gaming
21693,Good. Nice.
21694,excellent!!!
21695,"It's just one of the quintessential looter shooters, play it if you like those games"
21696,and now i know what it feels like to be addicted to crack.
21697,"The story line is not as rich as I would hope, but it's decent for a shooter. The game itself is an incremental improvement of an already successful game engine and UI."
21698,wowww
21699,Great game recommend getting even thought there is a newer borderlands
21700,Guns
21701,"i really like this game it's actually really fun and addicting

21703,"Great game, Still fun after 8 years. Best Played with Friends"
21704,Best Game
21705,im forced to write this just so i can give it a thumbs up.
21706,Fun and hilarious
21707,yeah its a good game and i have played a lot on ps3 when it was popular with my friends and it still can be popular if we work hard enough to get more people to play
21708,AMAZING
21709,Borderlands 2
21710,"It's a great game and i've played it on ps4, ps3, xbox 360, but it's lack of cross-play between mac and windows has made it really shit to play online, it'd be great if they'd fix it. if you're wanting to play online with someone on mac while you're on window or vice versa then don't bother buying it as it doesn't work."
21711,Topofka <3
21712,"Cell Shading, Looter Shooter, Co Op...One of the best Games ever!"
21713,"One of the best games I have ever played; story will keep you enticed for hours, on top of the whole day you already spent playing it..."
21714,as someone who finshed the frist and thought it cant be beat but this is the best squeal i have ever played just fucking but this game now shit
21715,A Really Perfect Game
21716,this is a great game. Ive played many hours across 3 platforms and still come back to it today.
21717,amazing

21719,Its addicting

21721,"Ive only seen a game and its successors (BL3) get an update once and then be completely unplayable. It will not even start because of the legendary UE-4 glitch. I run an all AMD system. 3700x, 5700xt, x570 mobo, 32 Trident RGB, 750 PS. NOw what may I ask is the problem AND DONT SAY WINDOWS OR A GPU DRIVER PROBLEM !!!  All of the games were working fine until a week ago. Cmon STEAM/GEARBOX get you head out of your asses & fix this.
"
21722,amazing game till this day
21723,This game is so good
21724,"handsome jack was written really well written.
dlcs are boring.

fun with friends.
"
21725,"Playing co-op with a friend, I'd say with the cheap price its worth it... lol I got it for like $3.5... go for it :)"
21726,i love the graphics and that the makers of the game fully focus on whats going on story wise and not focussing all too much on graphics. Good game
21727,"great story, funny lines, loveble characters and so much more"
21728,ok
21729,"because it jammed packed with fun stuff like bullymong hunting
"
21730,260+ hour on Steam and more before on consoles and I don't think it's enough for this game it's deserved more :borderlands2::bandit:
21731,Gun go brrrrrr
21732,game is sick. music is tight. psycho’s are pretty psycho ngl
21733,.
21734,"Possible best part of Borderlands franchise by now, even after the release of third installment. The best story and charismatic antagonist, wonderful playable characters and big and diverse DLC's - that all make a game wonderful and fun to play. Game mechanics and loot drop are not as good as in third part but still good. Highly recommend to buy as part of Handsome collection + Commander Lilith. Game is  still actual for 2020 and fun to play."
21735,I LOVE THIS GAME
21736,"This game has all the right elements for a first person shooter, however, the story line is a bit short. I decided to get all the DLC's (which I DO NOT recommend) and finished them all in half the time it took to complete the campaign. It really is a great game with a fun campaign, doing 10x better than the pre-sequal, but once you reach around level 35 there isn't anything left to do except restart the entire campaign."
21737,It a old classic but is still a good game to play
21738,Old but Gold.
21739,not being able to hit anything was fun
21740,Still a good game after all these years.
21741,"I've been playing this game for more than 5 years now, the story never gets boring and everything about this game is just amazing"
21742,One of the best game experiences!
21743,"If you can, buy the Handsome Collection during a sale for obvious reasons. Any ways, Game good. The game plays good, but I did have to restart my computer to change resolution, I also had to turn V-sync on to stop screen tearing. Not a big fan of gearbox but the game is fun. It's funny, has great visual style, and great music. The guns are fun to use, and the enemies are fun to kill. I think you should buy it. maybe not worth the price since it's from 2012 but I don't know since I got it for 10 dollars with dlc. Good game, buy today."
21744,I got  it on x-box before and loved it but due to my x-box crashing I could't  finish it so I got it again
21745,gfcxd
21746,"So good 10/10, am playing it again"
21747,"One of the best games i have ever played.

Among the DLCs, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep is probably the BEST DLC content of any game till date."
21748,bagus sekali saya suka
21749,"Phenomenal shooter in every way, please play it, it's soo good."
21750,It's alright.
21751,Is very good.
21752,"This game is incredibly fun, especially with friends to play with. online does require good internet tho. i recommend that you get the handsome collection when it is on sale. the handsome collection is really good. it includes all of the dlc that is available."
21753,very fun to play with friends
21754,nice game
21755,"Well i this game have it on the PS vita but the run button don't work but it was still fun even tho i diidn't had tiny DLC which is goes with the ending for when tiny Tina say good bye Roland "" I'm not complaining but it does go good with"". In over all this is really good game also i'm run this game of a bit of a potato pc but it good to run. I hope who ever read this i hope you injoy this game"

21763,yesnt
21764,"Great shooting, greedy looting."
21765,"I like the responsiveness in the combat mechanics, you really feel your actions through the crit hitboxes and elemental interactions. The diablofication of the shooter genre was implemented masterfully here, balance is good, no OP weapons: cool ones are cool only against particular kind of enemies.

The dialogues and random captions in the game are quite smart and fun to read, I especially liked the character of the Handsome Jack, he's awesome.
"
21766,fantastic story
21767,ю
21768,absoulutely love it still even from the first time i played the first original borderlands #Fun Still..

21789,"Great game, charismatic in a dark and twisted way. 
"
21790,Even though the game was released a long time ago it stills very good
21791,"Classic game, it never hurts to hop back on Borderlands for another playthrough"
21792,"Epic guns, nice story and fun action! Especially entertaining when playing co-op. Very re-playable game. Runs quite well in my old computer."
21793,I enjoy having so many things to do in a game and the game just looks cool!
21794,"GUD
"
21795,"I got this 2 days ago. I already have 8 hours. If you like shooters, get it. However, this lost me many moments. Still 10/10"
21796,"good with friends, not that casual."
21797,This game is great having one of the best villains of all time and the game play being amazing for me to always be able to come back and play it all over again and i love the feature of you just being able to skip to level 30 if you wanted to just play the dlc or something like that. all around 10/10 too bad the bl3 had shit story
21798,Extremely fun! Graphics run smoother than borderlands 1 and the game writing has improved quite a lot!
21799,This game is a must buy
21800,"This is my all time favorite game.
Cannot recommend this game enough."
21801,"When someone says something about looter shooters I can only think of this game for the reason that it hits everything. It's old enough for so many people to know this game and series for what it is great at, but even then it is easy to tell what it's bad at. It's great to play for years on end for every playthrough you do the next won't be the same like you may need to farm for a weapon longer or you got a purple weapon instead of a white one that time. Borderlands 2 is one of the best Borderlands games in the series, and the competition between it and 3 is becoming harder and harder for each dlc that comes out and the weekly patches. Even if BL3 wins in the end I will always come back to this game that I know well and love and even listen to that good soundtrack."
21802,"Porr*! Esse negocio de micro segmentação é uma m3rd#.
Tudo tem q pagar se vc quiser jogar/usar.
Tirando isso... é um jogo maneiro!"
21803,"Fantastic game for friends to sit together, lauch BL2 and just have fun while enjoying the game"
21804,"This game is extra fun. Has great story. Inmense areas that you can navegate. You can find yourself just wandering around, listening to the background music to relax a bit. Then when things get serious, you can laugh a lot with what the characters are saying. No matter if this game is old, you should play it and enjoy."
21805,probably the best game i own
21806,is good
21807,Very nice
21808,"OMG, the graphics are not the best but they are NICE, gameplay, plot, characthers, and humor is good, i rate this game 10/10, NOT MY FAVORITE GAME BUT ITS NICE"
21809,Good game
21810,I've played this on console for years but it feels so much more satisfying on PC.
21811,"Borderlands is boring...

...it's a solid game don't get me wrong but like, the problem with Borderlands is that Destiny 2 exists.

haha unpopular opinion go brrr."
21812,Must have game
21813,"""Can I get a refund on this gun? It uh... it doesn't work.""
*ponders for a moment and shoots man in knee cap*
""Seems to work fine to me :)"""
21814,e

"
21816,10/10 would smash again
21817,gud game ;3
21818,"its good
"
21819,"Played this game for countless hours on xbox finally got around to getting it on pc, To anyone who has a gambling addiction but doesn't want to spend real hard earned cash this is the game for you, want a game thats easy to start but hard to finish... (op levels looking at you) then buy it and enjoy knowing you'll never quiet get that perfect DPUH after five hours of mind numbing farming."
21820,"its just awesome
"
21821,poo
21822,Best Co-op game ever

21832,fat
21833,"Still Best Game to kill time . You are bored ? Play Borderlands. Have problems in life  ? Play Borderlands. Tired of Borderlands ? Again, play Borderlands...."
21834,TAIP
21835,"Honestly, this is one of the best games I've ever played. Even played it multiple times on console! You'll easily learn to love the characters for their unique personalities and interactions with one another. Not to mention the lore... OOOH it's so good! BL2 is the perfect mix of humor and a serious story. I 100% recommend this game to anyone and everyone! I believe this is actually my favorite game :D"
21836,It's great.
21837,"Very good, no drawbacks, very worth buying！！！！！！！！"
21838,"Let's skip to the end for a moment before I get specific. This game is decent and very cheap, which is a plus, but there are way better shooters to spend time with. First off, I've never seen a game waste an art style as hard as this one. It's striking and can work well (see Borderland 3's maps) but you can hire Picasso, and it won't matter much if you're having him only draw literal garbage, which I estimate to be what 90% of the games environments are made of. On a moment to moment level, the gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of Halo with way worse art design; Decent enemy variety, weapons are often awkward and bad, psuedo-regenerating health, with an overarching story that's competent but nothing special. So I guess what I'm saying is if you're after a basically competent shooter and don't want to spend the money on the greatly superior MCC, this could be a decent option."
21839,"i love it so much

21849,Ya its fun. its a lot like the 1st Borderlands.  More loot than you can carry - too many guns & not enough bullets.
21850,"best of the borderlands series (besides the original), but has some missions that are very unnecessary and time consuming but besides the annoying missions lost of fun and worth the money.

21903,"Borderlands 2 all the way for me. Bought BL3 on Epic and played it thru, but i'll always fall back to BL2. It is hands down the best game in the franchise in my opinion!"
21904,Story and game-play has you hooked from the beginning. No doubt within in my mind that this games still one of the greatest games and worth every penny.
21905,"A timeless classic in PC gaming.  This is my favorite of the series.  I do like the newer ones but I put many hours into this before getting it on Steam back when it was on console.  Since getting it on Steam, I have played it with my family and friends for years.  We always come back to this game eventually.  Very well optimized and it can run on many devices at high settings so you can enjoy it to the fullest!"

21912,Amazing
21913,"grindy, never boring. 10/10"
21914,"Over the years, I've found myself coming back to this game time and time again. The pacing is just right. The options for connecting with other players have increased. Even single player, you can blaze through the story pretty quickly and get to the good stuff if you're so inclined, or you can level up a few characters at once and have them trade gear to assist each other. The base game is cheap and worth it, I'm gifting this to a friend. It's the D'n'D of First Person Shooters and good value for money, even before considering DLC."
21915,Really fun game with great story and interesting loots. massive gameplay amount.
21916,EXPLOSION?!?!?!?!
21917,"the mayham continues.........I got this to play for one reason.......the dlc character kreig the psycho, couldn't stop laughing throughout the game and dlc maps"
21918,"8 years after its release, Borderlands 2 is still fun to play. Feels different each time I play with different friends, and different characters. Unlimited hours of engaging stories and action."
21919,Borderlands 2 straight amazing:)
21920,Super fun to play a story with friends
21921,i HAVE played this game all the way thgrough on xbox and wanted to play with patch and mods and stuff so I got ikt on computer I wouldnt reccomend with a bad pc but if you have a decent one or higher I highly recommend this game
21922,"Phenomenal game, would recommend to any type of gamer."
21923,Good Game
21924,"Enjoying this game, multiple personas, feels new each time. Always finding new areas and weapons (especially weapons!). Haven't tried multiplayer as yet but it's worth the price."

21933,"The second release of the fantastic FPS series (Borderlands) and it's as fun as ever.

Another fantastic game from Gearbox and it's still holding it's own, 8 years since its release - 8/10"
21934,Is best game.
21935,grat
21936,I have bought this game for every platform I've played on since its release and I do not regret it.

21942,"this 👏 game 👏 is 👏 amazing. borderlands 2 came out 8 years ago and its still amazing. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engaging, and the story. oh the story, needless to say the story is awesome"
21943,i like it a lot
21944,pog
21945,played it for a while didnt like it
21946,Great gameplay. Love that it gets slowly more difficult and doesn't just become unplayable for a noob like me instantly.
21947,Best Looter-shooter. Better than the 3.
21948,"This game has an amazing story with each character being unique and I keep replaying this game as I love it so much. Every boss has their own personality too and it's fun to hear them talk about how they are better than you just for you to beat them giving you the satisfaction in knowing that you have a better technique in defeating that boss. There are side quests too and each one of them also have unique characters and weapons too.

Personally, I recommend this game to everyone as it is really fun and a whole lot of joy for people to play."
21949,very fun arcade shooter game. Level design is really good and fun. Good humor in the story. Good characters. Fun the play with friends and mess around. Tip: stay roughly the same level as your friends.
21950,BOOM BOOM BANG
21951,"One of my all-time favourites! 
Love this game to death"
21952,"Before I played Borderlands 2, I was lonely, had no girlfriend, no friends. I was always the last one to get picked in football practice. These things haven't changed, but the game is still pretty awesome."
21953,This game are beautifull!!
21954,"Even in 2020 this game still stands tall as a masterpiece, best borderlands game and one of the best looter shooters."
21955,"Goood game
"
21956,Best game of all time. GOAT
21957,its allota fun.

Five years have passed since the events of [i]Borderlands[/i], when four [i]Vault Hunters[/i] defeated [i]The Destroyer[/i], a valuable mineral called [i]Eridium[/i] started flourishing through Pandora's crust. [i]Handsome Jack[/i] (One of the best videogame villains of all time), president of the [i]Hyperion Corporation[/i], secures this new resource and make use of it to attempt to ""bring peace"" to the planet. Now, [i]Handsome Jack[/i] rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive space station, [i]Helios[/i].

21968,Good Story To Play Solo But It's Better With Friends With Antics
21969,I've played all the Borderlands games and beaten them multiple times. But this one is a gem. The best among the Borderlands series. The replay value of this game is endless. Especially the grind for legendaries and easter eggs this game has packed inside it.
21970,"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE

21978,"one of the best games i have ever played before! great story line love playing it over and over as it gets hard and hard. weapon keep getting better and have to farm boss for some of the really good weapons which is nice. really fun to play with 1-3 friends to take on a boss. art style of the game is great feel like your in a comic book or something. DLC for the game are also great almost like a whole other game in its self worth the money and the time to get your self maxed out. this game also allows for different player styles heavy pusher, sit back and snipe, or support ... etc. choose what you want to be and how you want to play. fun playing by your self even better playing with friends."
21979,Great game !
21980,ok
21981,This game is amazing to play solo or with friends.
21982,Its da best
21983,"This game will remain a masterpiece,and the replayability is huge with all the gameplay styles and different characters at disposal to choose from.
One of the best loot-shooter that was ever made with an open word environment,this game is made for casuals and for people who look for a challenge (try op 10),if you have friends to play with(wich sadly :( I don't have ),It will make a fun experience for 4 players,overall have fun playing this amazing game."
21984,"Shoot first, ask questions later.
Just kidding, we don't ask questions around here."
21985,"It's pretty good. For me it had a steep learning curve, but playing other characters certainly helped with that. Not to mention, it has good replay value."
21986,"hella fun

21987,Never get bored.
21988,Just for the badge but still a good game after all this time
21989,good game :)
21990,"KILL ALL THE BANDITS AND GET ALL THE LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

very fun game"
21991,"its a really fun casual straight forward game , the game will guide you through the campaign with an indicator on the minimap , has alot of stuff and unique weapons and unique mechanism to each guns , very fun experience"
21992,It's as good as people say it is. This game rules.
21993,"Picked this up in a sale to play with friends. The first 10-20 hours were fun, but I didn't really know what was going on. Probably because I was playing with friends and they were doing a lot of things for me. Once I started playing alone, focusing on side missions etc I really got to know the game, how the menus work, learn properly about the gun stats and I have ended up really enjoying this game. 

The only issue I have is the number of strange bugs. My system runs the game great, unless I go to ""Opportunity"" location where it will crash after 30 / 45 mins. Fixed by turning off PhysX, but that makes the game run like garbage when there is a lot going on.

Overall a highly enjoyable game, with a great story, great characters and funny moments. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours if you want to 100% complete this game"
21994,good shit
21995,"It's a superb game that I have sunken 800+ hours into (split across two accounts). It's a lot of fun leveling up your character and growing in strength. Grinding for items might seem boring (it kind of is), but it is also very rewarding when you've been farming for 2 hours and you finally get the item you've been wanting to get.

There are a lot of different playstyles in the game, because all of the characters in the game have three unique skill trees they can ""spec"" in to and get upgrades."
21996,Best chill and farming game. ever. and even better if u play it with friends in multiplayer.
21997,"Haven't played that much, so there is something im still not sure"
21998,"Borderlands 2 is still a great Co-op fun, gun glory fest of goodness for everyone to enjoy

22024,Epic games bad
22025,Fun game
22026,"When I first learned about Borderlands 2 I though almost nothing of the game and never had any intent to buy it. However, fate had different thoughts...

I had just gotten some spare cash and was scrolling through the steam store eager to buy some new games rather than spending it on ones I already owned (looking at you tf2.) I hadn't seen anything worth buying as of yet so I just kept going, and going, and going until I happened to stumble upon Borderlands 2: on sale with most of the DLC. Intrigued by this and lured in by good reviews I decided to just say, ""Fu<k it"" and ended up buying it with literally no clue for what It had in store for me. What came next can only be summed up in 2 words=Ooooooooooooooooooooh Boi
Instantly I was thrown into the chaotic world of Pandora and it's array of crazy characters. I fell in love with the gameplay, the addiction of leveling up, the insane humor, and most importantly: the loot. Everything about it was such a fresh and eye-opening experience from what I normally played that it actually encouraged me to buy other games. 

Although in the recent years Gearbox's business practice has been extremely shady and the third game being a bit of a letdown to hardcore fans I wouldn't let that deter you from buying Borderlands 2. All around I don't regret spending any money on the game, and most of the DLCs are actually pretty good as well. If you have the cash, the time, and a really messed up sense of humor, go for it."
22027,i play with my BF.. its really fun
22028,yes
22029,A cool shooting game that's fun to play with friends. It might be an old game but it's still fun. And it still gets updates once a while after all these years
22030,"Best game out of the BL series. Loot nature of this game always feels satisfying (even with mods to fix certain aspects - search for BL2Fix). Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC is one of the best DLC's I've played to date. I was even a fan of Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty DLC as I love me some pirate-y side missions to venture on. I played 99% of the entire game solo and didn't get bored as there's always stuff to do and secrets to find out of the blue.

Recommend this to anyone who is a fan of heavy looter shooters and RPG-galore to keep them busy and revisit often."

A ton of great mission writing and dialogue.

Humorous dialogue and quest writing.

Enticing loot and experience rewards.

Intriguing skill trees.

The Bad
Spoken messages sometimes interrupt each other.

Audio is intermittently overburdened.

One character ability is not substantially different from the core gunplay.

Frame rate slows during heavy combat."

Was going to change this to a thumbs up, until the SHiFT servers went down. Now I know it's been connecting to SHiFT every time I play, without permission. While they're down, it halts every 3-5 seconds again, trying to connect.

22089,"Borderlands 2. The 2nd entry in the best selling fps series to put it bluntly, likely blew whatever other shooter games were also released in 2012 out of the water and into space. In this review, I'll be covering the base game, and all the major DLC. Let's grab our Unkempt Harolds and Infinities and see if Borderlands 2 still holds up in the face of its successors.


THE BASE GAME: The base game has a great, compelling story, with an even more compelling villain, Handsome Jack. It sees you running and gunning all over Pandora as you seek to put an end to Jack and his Hyperion goons. What I like especially is that the game knows when to be funny, and when to be serious. I don't wanna get TOO spoiler-y but a few major characters end up offed during the story, and the game handles those moments very well. Gotta hand it to Anthony Burch for his writing and world-building. Oh, this won't be the last time I mention Anthony in this review.

CAPTAIN SCARLETT: Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty has the imposing task of handling an original story without relying on pre-existing characters. And knocks that task out of the park. It's a hilarious story of hidden treasure, scurvy, cursed weapons, betrayal,tentacles, and self-inflicted gunshot wounds, all as you team up with the eponymous Captain Scarlett, who DEFINITELY will not backstab you in any way!(Pssst, she will, heads up.) 

CAMPAIGN OF CARNAGE: Ever wondered what made Torgue guns so awesome? Look no further than the company's (former)CEO, and founder, MR. TORGUE. MR. TORGUE is hosting an illegal offworld deathmatch tournament in THE BADASS CRATER OF BADASSITUDE to see who will earn the right to open a newly discovered Vault. Fight your way through a multitude of memorable bosses, like the deranged Pyro Pete and the cowardly Piston, on your journey to become Pandora's #1 Badass! Mr. Torgue is probably the best NPC in the DLC if not the entire game. Oh and there also Torgue Vending Machines and they're hilarious. 

HAMMERLOCK'S HUNT: To be honest, this DLC is rather underwhelming compared to Torgue and Scarlett, which is disappointing, because I love its whole ""Classy Gentleman Hunter"" theme, but that gets thrown out the window with a plot about some guy called Professor Nakayama who wants to clone Handsome Jack and probably simps for him too. So you need to stop him from cloning Jack as you murder lots of local flora and fauna, as well as ""Savage"" tribesmen...who are all black....OK, getting some not so good vibes from this. Not to mention, despite its title of ""BIG GAME HUNT"" there's very little actual hunting except for a couple of sidequests. Overall, very underwhelming, with a lot of wasted potential.

DRAGON KEEP: Hands down, the best DLC, Dragon Keep follows you as you play Bunkers & Badasses with Tiny Tina, in a noble quest to slay the vile Handsome Sorcerer, who has kidnapped the lovely queen. However, its not all just fun and murdering wizards. There's also some subtle, yet noticeable undertones that in order to explain, I'll have to spoil something that happens in the main story. Throughout the campaign, you can notice that Tina seems to be denying Roland's death, which can be clearly seen in the quest title: ""Denial, Anger, Initiative"" and in a sidequest, where Roland(Note: an NPC version Tina made for the game.) sends you to find a sword that can bring back the dead.(And rewards you with the 2nd best gun in the game.) It shows just how strong Tina and Roland's friendship was, and how devastated she was when she found out about his passing. It just goes to show that Anthony Burch(There he is again, told ya!) really is a expert writer, who can somehow make us watery-eyed when playing a friggin' shooter. 

 COMMANDER LILITH: Borderlands 2's grand finale, setting the stage for Borderlands 3, by all accounts is a great DLC. With an intense story, sidequests that are actually fun, and best of all, RAINBOW GUNSSSS(Including UNICORNSPLOSION, which is easily the best gun in the game.). The story goes like this: One day the Crimson Raiders were talking about turning Sanctuary into a spaceship, then outta nowhere, these COD type soldier guys calling themselves The ""New Pandora"" Army, led by some old dude called Colonel Hector, swoop in and take over Sanctuary with some gas that turns people into plant monsters, forcing the Raiders to move to some place called the Backburner with Vaughn from Tales From The Borderlands. In attempt to take back Sanctuary WITHOUT being turned into an abomination of flesh and flowers, you go see Cassius, also from Tales, to see if he can whip up an antidote. However, he winds up turned into a plant monster, so you kill him, grab the absurd amount of legendaries he drops, grab the antidote, and with your newfound immunity to the gas, head into Sanctuary to kill Hector. After running through a vined-up Sanctuary, you face off with Hector, in a legitimately fun boss fight that barely even drops vendor trash. Lilith realizes it's too late to take back Sanctuary, so she blows it up, taking Hector with it. One criticism I do have for this DLC is that the New Pandora soldiers can be unnecessarily difficult to kill, but overall, pretty good way to cap off the story of Borderlands 2.

BONUS: SON OF CRAWMERAX: I know this is a Headhunter, one of those small, 10 bucks a pop DLC packs. But it has a lot that sets it apart from the others. First off, Wam Bam Island is simply gorgeous, with sunny beaches, bright blue skies, gleaming green grass, it's a nice departure from the beige deserts and barren icebergs found in most of the game. My favorite aspect of it is this one part where you find yourself walking through an underwater aquarium. It was so stunning that I think I found my self just standing there, staring at it. By now you probably noticed it's title, Son Of Crawmerax. Who is this Crawmerax? Crawmerax was a raid boss from the first Borderlands, and one of the most farmed at that. And now his son wants vengeance upon the Vault Hunters for repeatedly killing his father. He serves as the mission's final boss, and afterwards can be fought (And farmed) as a raid boss. Ironic if you ask me.

GENERAL(Where I put things that don't conform to a specific DLC or anything.): The gameplay is intense with baddies everywhere, meaning a lot of things to kill. Not to mention, the game is difficult, but in a more""Fun Challenge"" way rather than outright frustrating. No game is without flaw, sadly, my main criticisms being that 1. Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is quite unbalanced, often forcing builds to devolve into max DPS and Health. 2. This one doesn't apply to just this game, but I feel that while Handsome Jack is definitely an entertaining villain, Gearbox may have done maybe TOO good of a job with him, cause now they can barely do anything without finding a way to bring Jack back into the fray. Just ask Pre-Sequel and Tales.
3. Farming minibosses with an ""increased"" chance to drop a specific legendary is tedious and I wish it wasn't one of the only few ways to obtain legendary guns.

In conclusion, Borderlands 2 is the epitome of badassery in video games and deserves all of its garnered praise. Oh, I forgot to mention, there's Minecraft in this game. Just go to the Caustic Caverns, look for some familiar looking blocks, melee them, kill some Creepers, grab the Minecraft themed heads and skins and maybe the legendary sniper that shoots arrows, rinse, wash, repeat, Enjoy!"
22090,Best borderlands Game
22091,"This fantastic first person shooter let's you shoot ""face mcshooty"" in the face. amazing game. 10/10."
22092,good game very pog
22093,SHOOTING
22094,"Borderlands 2 is an example of a game that holds it’s appeal  to me.  Graphically, it has never been anything to sing about, but that was more of an artistic choice.  
I tend to stay away from bullet spongy games, but this is one I have always came back to again and again.  It is a fun party game, you don’t have to think much, and the mechanics are pretty straight forward for a first person shooter.
If you want a game with an incredibly deep and immersive story however, might want to set your sights low on this one.  That isn’t to say there isn’t a story.  It’s just that unless you are really focused on the dialogue going on during fire fights, some of the nuances of what is going on may be lost.  It’s really hard to hear the reason why you are going to the little diamond and what you have to blow up, over the sounds of other things blowing up. 
I enjoy it however, as the game is simple in its concept, and beautiful with it’s follow through. 
"
22095,zero popped a perc

22097,"Good game! It's just fun to mess around and doing missions. Story is good and better as well then the first title, also longer too. Yet it's the same game, same world, same good humor. The main villain is 10/10 too.

The first play through loot is so-so because legendaries are rare and you pretty much guaranteed to get better stuff from the golden key chest. But still there is enough variety between the weapons if you want to try different playstyles.

The only thing I didn't like is the fast travel system. For some reason I felt there is much more back and forth walking between places and less direct travel than in the first game. Not a big deal but sometimes felt a waste of time (especially if you already cleared the zone)."
22098,"[h1]My First Taste Of Crack[/h1]
As my most played game to date on Steam (as of 2020), i suppose it's only appropriate I review it now. Whilst the first Borderlands game was brilliant and i played through a shedload of it on consoles, this sequel took it to the next level. Once again taking place on the diverse planet of Pandora, you have the option of choosing from a new set of Vault-Hunters this time around - again with a diverse set of abilities each - and team up with the [i]Crimson Raiders[/i] (featuring some familiar faces ;) ) and take down the now infamous, tyrannical villain with a trap, [i]Handsome Jack[/i].

The game builds upon the cell-shaded style of the original and expands it with larger expanses and a more colourful palette which i appreciate more so than the the drab , brownish shades of its predecessor. The designs of the monsters, raiders and other types of enemies you'll face across the wastelands are also magnificent with each being interesting to face and hilarious lines that they may shout out at you. Finally, your own playable characters and NPC's you shall befriend through your journey are brilliantly designed with intricate details to really stylise them and show off their personality. 

Gameplay as usual is centrally focused on the Shoot n' Loot magic that they found with the original and which ultimately contributed to my shameless addiction with this game. the Bajillions of procedurally generated weapons available to you here are all a joy to collect and mess around with, but i spent a particularly long amount of time just grinding for them lustful Legendaries. Ugh, they're beautiful. If you didn't enjoy that aspect of the original, this game certainly won't change your mind. What's equally contributed to my playtime however is the increased focus and expansion of the Vault-Hunters perks and abilities this time around. Each one of them including the DLC classes, Gaige and Krieg, have are able to be deeply perked out to your playstyle and liking and all their abilities are simply so much fun to mess around with. 

it's impossible to talk about this game of course, without mentioning the immortalised Handsome Jack! To this day still regarded as one of the greatest video game villains of all time - he is an absolute joy to detest! His charismatic yet douchey quips and lines really you going on your journey, just waiting for that next interaction or battle to take place. Behind all that narcissistic, and sociopath exterior of course is significant insecurity and shame that the game briefly explores. This game IS Handsome Jack - and is all the more better for it. 

[b]Shoutout to Face McShooty <3[/b]"
22099,YES YES YES!!! Love this game...
22100,"I highly recommend getting the Handsome Collection of this game as rarer loot spawns or at least get the bundle with the DLCs. I accidentally bought this game on both Steam and Epic so by now I've actually played at least 70 hours of the game by now, and even then I think I'm getting my money's worth - on a sale each mission is less than $1/h
The only gripe about this game is the damn map at Incinerator Camp / finding the Enkindling - though it appears they have improved map directions to be much clearer in the Presequel."
22101,"lovely & funny game to play with friends, runs well, feels nice, looks pretty"
22102,By far Borderlands 2 is the best game out of the series as it has a really good story that you'll enjoy playing back to back. I think the developers did a great job on this one...
22103,"Not a fan of the gameplay. MEH

6/10"
22104,"What a ride. Still after all these years the game is witty, fun, and so entertaining. I would play through again tomorrow. Amazing job with this game."
22105,Runs at about 30FPS on my surface go
22106,"A very cartoonish FPS game which is best with friends. Playing this game Solo, is fine (so so)."
22107,its fun
22108,PogU
22109,"An old one but a good one. Currently going through my first play-through, and I am really liking it, especially after getting bit forward in the game and my character doesn't suck any more."
22110,gUn
22111,really fun game my wifi is really bad but i was still able to play with friends smoothly
22112,"Better RPG, and way more fun, than Fallout 4...
6.5/10"
22113,Oldie but a goodie
22114,"it panders to the wrong crowed. the writing is also really cringe and terrible. a  few funny moments for sure, but overall really bad writing. the gun play and loot, and level designs are nice.... thats really all thats  nice about it."
22115,"So Borderlands 2 is a first person shooter, a sequel to Borderlands. The story continues from the first game with new character and story. The guns are main source of all damage it the game. There are plenty of enemies to kill and blast them to pieces. You can play it as a single player game or as a multiplayer game:

-Single player: The story is interesting, there a lot of places to explore, cool secrets to find, nice abilities to use. But at harder difficulty some quest are really hard. For example raid bosses. In the end game as solo player you can't do much against them unless you are like 10 levels higher and have a nice gear. Still fun to play.

-Multiplayer: Oh this is where fun begins! I played with one of my friends for hours. We made a lot stupid fun builds, like Axton using only his turret and having no guns. We died a lot but was fun. I recommend to play with friends (if you have any). 

-Price: I recommend getting it in a bundle (Handsome Collection), I think you still have to get Commander Lilth's DLC separate which is a bummer (costs like 15e). Although everything else is worth your money.

-Cons: There are not really  cons they are just things that are not balanced like that some guns are way better than other even tho the rarity is different (a blue item can so much stronger and easier to get than a like a pearl that's meh in comparison). Also when you get to OP levels some playable characters lack in damage and performance than others(Zer0 and Salvador are top tier). Oh yeah, I forgot...the Hammerlock DLC...yeah that one is so bad.

-Pros: It has so many fun mods you can add to make it more enjoyable. Hours of content and pure fun. Generally a great game.

-Achievements: For you guys that like to have all of those, most of them are pretty easy to get, I have all of them except one. That's to at least level 1 badass rank on all of the challenges. I'm close to getting them, some require trial and error and some require friends (trading, dueling);

-Overall: Great game, lots of fun, buy it! 9/10

22119,Games seems to be going on forever. The graphics are awesome and the storyline the same.

22123,"I have a borderlands waifu 
Thanks 2k she’s a hottie"
22124,"I am extremely late to the Borderlands Series party, but I gotta say, this game is a a solid 8.5/10. It's INCREDIBLY fun with friends, got a ton of jokes and funny references, sweet guns and upgrades, cool bosses, unique animation style, compelling story, and all around an excellent investment of my money. Try finding a TV show or a movie that can keep me as entertained and social. I've played this game on Epic Games store as well as on Steam, but Steam has achievements and more of my friends on it, so I've begun playing it on Steam.

There are some freemium features in the game like special keys that open what can be considered ""loot boxes"" of sorts, but anything gotten from those chests end up being potentially dropped during the game anyways, and still doesn't guarantee amazing guns. Even so, the creators of this game are constantly giving away FREE codes, even to this day despite the game coming out so many years ago.

My only drawbacks to this game is how grindy it starts to feel after you restart the story with the same character. (Minor spoiler- if you want to repeat the stories on harder modes, there are some name and level upgrades, but that's about it.) If you're going to play  multiple characters and try to max them out, then definitely, definitely, definitely try to level up with friends. It's WAY faster and more fun.

Like most things in life, this game is much better with friends. Find some through the game, a steam community, reddit or school, but get them to come play! There's a really good chance they'll like it."
22125,is gud
22126,...
22127,...
22128,5 hrs in and I love the game! What a gem...
22129,This game is absolute fun. The story is compelling and the gameplay is great but it's the dialogues and the NPCs that make this game so memorable. I don't think a game has ever made me laugh as hard as this one.
22130,i go pew pew mech pew pew unmech pew pew everybody dead

22137,"Absolutely hilarious and the action is amazing.
The story is also 10/10 if you dig deep enough."
22138,best game
22139,One of the silliest and funniest looter shooter ever. If you are new to the game remember to do sidequests at the beginning or you may struggle. lots of fun and interesting characters you will meet. This game is even more fun with friends. 100/10
22140,Loot shoot and laugh. Great game.
22141,Game goood
22142,.
22143,Playstation 5 brings a new kind of immersive gameplay as the gates for the next gen of consoles opens up.
22144,"It can be addictive, especially in this life situation."
22145,"One of my favorite games of all time, fantastic gameplay loop, and have been playing with the Unofficial Community Patch that has breathed some fresh air into a game that across PS3, PS4, and PC I have spent an embarrassing amount of time playing."

22157,It is just awesome! the bizzare things that happen and the emotional tension on the story is really amazing!
22158,ye
22159,One of my most favorite looter shooters by far.
22160,"Great game, gigantic variety of guns and ways to play and replay. DLCs are just as good. Recommend for Loot Shooters lovers"
22161,"Still bugs, crashes and it's 2020... 
The HUD doesn't scale to ultrawide screens..
Enemies jumping in from invisible doors, Constantly running into invisible walls, and getting stuck on small pebbles throughout the landscape.
It feels like a mobile phone game, very poor attention to detail and execution.
Storyline's very forgettable, which is amazing because the gameplay is completely Linear.
Almost made it to the 10hr mark, and already was thinking ""Why"" with a feeling of disdain.
With what's out now and the way this game runs and is structured, there's almost no reason to play, especially in 2020.
Time is too precious."
22162,i did like this game very much that i told my friend also to buy..what i liked most is that it has all options lan cross play and the storyline
22163,very good very cool
22164,GRIND GRIND GRIND KILL KILL KILL!
22165,Just one of the best single player and 2-4 player coop story based shooter with a lot of humor and by 2020 the best Borderlands game so far!
22166,"This game  alongside  the dlc will let you get lost in the wild and crazy world of the borderlands. The builds start out simple but as you progress into the late game, there are loads of complexities that can be explored. The story is great and absolutely hilarious. 

9/10 must play"
22167,PLAY THIS GAME ITS AMAZING EVEN THOUGH ITS OLD ITS AMAZING
22168,"I know this game is very popular and has a serious fan base but i found its mechanics unbalanced. Especially in co-op, in which most players play this game. If one player dies,  he re-spawns in a nearby save point with FULL HEALTH but the boss or other enemie's health don't replenish. So you can comeback again & again where you left and do a little bit of more damage  each time to the boss and still be a PROUD winner in the end. So - no matter how inept player you are, you can still succeed, it's a matter of time, actually."
22169,my first fps game played!
22170,Awesome fun
22171,"this game is fun 
"
22172,I've played so many hours of this game on console. I got it on computer to keep playing this game. This game consumed my teenage years. I'll never recover
22173,Very Poggers
22174,"Good story with some amusing dialogue. Gameplay was smooth and easy to pick up. I liked the world building and setting. Weapons stats were sometimes overwhelming and too complex, but a nice mix of weapons to suite your style of play."
22175,Playing this games with friends on discord is lit af. Most fun you can have for $20 without committing a felony.
22176,Nothing to be said. Just play it.
22177,Great game with friends will always love this classic
22178,hehe gun go bang

22186,Great fast pasted and fun looter shooter. Great even now for a second game if you're playing something else and need a break.

22193,yes
22194,this game is super fun
22195,"If you are typically a console user, this game takes a little bit of getting used to. However once you understand the game mechanics, it is absolutely amazing. The art and graphics may seem outdated, but it fits the atmosphere and the story. The NPCs are hilarious, as well."
22196,Fun  gameplay
22197,"Even with Borderlands 3 being out and about, I still find myself going back to this game. A classic at it's best!"
22198,Bonerlands 2 pretty wacky
22199,"Amazing game, great storyline"
22200,reminds me of school
22201,just do it
22202,"It's an old comical RPG FPS game, and has some controversies in balances/lvl scaling, but these do not overlay the fact that it's an unprecedented masterpiece. Much more mature story-, mechanics-, skill tree- design in compare to BL1. Each of 6 main characters can have very different play styles depending on your understanding of their skills. The maniacal and whimsical characters presented in a comical fashion are all alike yet distinctive from one another. Along with the rich stories (lines) and challenging end game contents, they will not disappoint you. 

IIRC, GB's SpeedRun World Records are still active now.

PS: it got a bunch of DLCs (either Essential or Useless). Make sure to buy the ""Handsome Jack Bundle"" that include em all (BL1 and BL TPS included as well)"

22224,"One of, if not best coop game ever made"
22225,I like all the hours of action and lots of adventures to experience.
22226,"Really boring. Borderlands 1 wasn't the best game ever by any means, but this is a massive downgrade."
22227,"honestly a good game apart from Tiny Tina,  everytime i see her i wanna blow my brains out. i would reccomend putting the game on mute and tabbing out till you dont have to see or hear her,apart from that 9/10 for me"
22228,Moxxi is hot
22229,"Good game would play again
"
22230,"Great follow-up to the original with a lot of changes.  Most people will tell you that these make the original obsolete, but I think I still prefer that to this.  I'd also say that a lot of them aren't better or worse, but just different; it's a lateral move.  I think that's smart, too, since you have so many playable characters; miss the other game?  Play it with someone else!  They're still both excellent and absolutely worth your time.

The manufacturers of the weapons matter a lot more now, as most of them have their own little gimmicks beyond the stats they provide.  Now, more than ever, you'll really want to test a weapon out before replacing your old favorite with it.  Challenges now provide additional perks, instead of experience, and are mostly well-balanced; some of them are just stupid or excessive.  There's more enemy variety, too, and while the monsters are hard to hit in their weak spots, bosses are generally very interesting.  MOAR???

The artstyle is the same, but the environments have quite a lot of variety.  You start out in a frozen wasteland, and while you do make your way back to the desert, you'll find mountains, high-tech facilities, and places that defy explanation.  While the first Borderlands provided a visually consistent experience, this one is visually diverse, and equally a pleasure to explore.  The guns also have a very different look to them that's sleek and futuristic, and each manufacturer is distinct from the others; if an NPC has a gun, you can look at it and tell who made it and have a good idea of what it does.  There are lots of visual customizations for your character and your vehicles, as well; instead of choosing your color scheme, you find customizations from missions or just dropped randomly, both for your head and for your outfit, with some really cool options.

The writing is excellent, just as it was in the first game.  Returning characters are great as ever, and get fleshed out a bit more, and it's like getting to spend more time with some great old friends of yours.  Predictably, the new characters are great, too; I found myself liking them just as much as the old ones.  What's different here is story: there actually is one.  It's written very well, and remains compelling and dramatic throughout, without getting in the way of shooting things.  What I liked about the first game's story is that its non-presence let you turn your brain off and just shoot and explore; you don't have that here, but that's not better or worse, so much as different, and now, I have a Borderlands game that's more meditative and one that's more story-driven; best of both worlds.

Voice acting is top-notch, once again, both for your character and for the NPCs you meet along the way.  Really, this is something I rarely even mention, but the delivery is just perfect, bringing out subtleties that even the excellent writing doesn't tell you; it does a great job of making you laugh or twisting the knife.  Gun sound effects have a great impact to them, making them satisfying to fire.  One area that [i]is[/i] a full improvement is the music; it's just excellent.  You've got moods ranging from serene to dangerous to melancholy to friggin' Donkey Kong Country, and as a huge VGM nerd, I have to say that this is one of the best modern video game soundtracks I've heard in a very long time.

The DLC's a little confusing, but you have 5 full expansions and 5 smaller ones consisting of a single map each.  These are also a big improvement over the first game, as they are pretty consistently good; the weakest of them is Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, and even that is still pretty good.  The star of the show is easily Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, which puts you in the middle of a game of Bunkers and Badasses, and yes, that's exactly what you think it is.  My favorite is either that or the beautiful dried-out tropical paradise of Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty; it's like a Hawaiian desert, and I've been dreaming of a world like that for ages.  My biggest gripe with the DLC is their insistence upon raid bosses, which aren't meant to be fought solo, effectively locking any single player out of part of the experience, or at least making it incredibly tedious to complete.  The Headhunters expansions are the smaller ones, and every one of these is worth playing; they tend to focus on individual holidays, and are just packed to the brim with good old Borderlands lunacy.

Like the first game, I can't recommend this enough.  Usually, I'd shy away from something with this much content (over 275 hours on my first playthrough), but I could play this again and again.  It's not without its occasional frustrations, but I don't regret my time with it at all.  If you've ever wanted to get into First-Person Shooters, give this a go; if you watch your sales, you can grab this and The Pre-Sequel with all of their DLC for about $6, like I did.  Discover the wild world of Pandora for yourself!"
22231,jus play it game speaks for its self
22232,"I have over 300 hours in this on console, I only recently got into PC Gaming and nabbed this while it was on sale. Truly an amazing game, one of the best of 360/PS3 era. One of the best looter shooters ever, if not THE best. Highly recommend if you are looking for a fun, easy to grasp, lighthearted co-op game. Can be played solo of course, just more fun with friends."

If that doesn't say how amazing this game is I do not know what will. This is the best game in the Borderlands franchise, and honestly is one of the best games ever made. BUY IT, I have 3 times now"

That's the game, Its mechanically sound with a lot of good content at this point. If you're looking for an easy to pick up shooter with a wild story and are also a fan of RPGs then this game, being the game that coined the term looter shooter, is a solid choice. Mostly played on Xbox 360 so I probably have over 100 hours played time.

10/10 would simp for Moxxi again"

22293,"As of the the date of making this review, I have only played borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel. 

I would recommend this game while on sale, but then I buy every game on sale :sbpenguin: 

In terms of DLC, I wouldnt recomend buying them. Sure, they add more content and are fun, but some of them are not worth it IMO. 
I like the torgue one, and the dnd one. All of the others felt kind of meh to me.

Overall, if you want a singleplayer/co-op story based shooter, this is pretty darn fun"
22294,"Great game, does take time, but well worth it. Also the ability to customize not just the apperiance but the game play experience are pretty awesome. Definitely play it!"
22295,Great game.
22296,"I know, it's full of black humor and kinda memorable characters. Still I felt it extra tedious and unbearable. Only good thing was the golden keys obtained through twitter to get extra cool weapons. Besides from that, I was so desperate for the game to end (thing that took forever).
The tedious part I'm talking about is the travel distances between quests which implied crossing the entire map for every tier, the map itself felt empty and dull (even moving with teleports and cars didn't make the experience a little bit better).
I just don't get it."
22297,"Good game.
"
22298,"i am a really big fan of this game, if you like looter-shooters i highly recommend this game. It has so much content, even without DLC."
22299,shoot

22301,hahahahhaha
22302,"Good Game, 51 hours in and still not finished everything, just finished the main story line and a few sidequests on the first character, still got 5 more characters to go and new game plus for each"

22326,"This game has great co-op and campaign. If we are looking for a fun fps shooter with low pc requirement, i definitely recommend this game, it doesn't require a good computer and can still run smoothly with nice graphics. The co-op campaign is a little challenging at first but once you do the side missions it will become a lot easier, the game is really open and gives you lot of freedom to go anywhere and take any mission u find. Worth the money 100%"
22327,"The story line in this game is amazing, you will love it.
"
22328,fun game yum yum
22329,"Within the treacherous wilds of Pandora; lies an assortment of eccentric armaments, hostile flora/fauna and the sub-par writing of Randy Pitchford. Simply Put: A Pulp-Novel given form in a video game medium.

8/10: An Excessive amount of Low Brow Humor, Neat Visuals, and an addicting gameplay loop.
(Please don't scrutinize the contents of Randy Pitchford's laptop)"
22330,modde
22331,game good
22332,very good
22333,hella fun grinding!!! :D
22334,if you can stomach past the humor written by an autistic cantaloupe then it's a good game
22335,good game if you dont have anything to do

22343,one of the best games i have ever played but there is a glitch that puts it in an infinite loop where i cant play

22349,story way better than bl3. good game i like and recommend especially those are co-op/pve players cause this a game for you and your friends
22350,The sequel to Borderlands
22351,Sequel to borderlands and just as crazy.  If you've never played borderlands and like FPS games with RPG elements then give it a go.  Jumping into Borderlands 2 before playing the original makes the story a little bit confusing though.
22352,"Controls are bad, gameplay is bad, cars are bad, guns and aims are also bad. Pretty world and interesting characters."
22353,"I own this on various platforms but have always come back to this one.  Fast, funny and the graphics are great.  The quest system works so well with the difficulty being ""just right"".  There is so much to do that even after finishing the story, there is plenty to do.

Never a dull moment - highly recommended."
22354,i feel dizzy everytime i play this game
22355,"The best of the series. Gameplay is just as good as any of the series, but Borderlands 2 nails it on story, both on main game and on the DLCs.

Forget Borderlands 3, if you never played any Borderlands and wanna try, go for this one."
22356,I had a nice long run with this game. time to go. Man Did I love it.
22357,have been playing this game sense middle school and i still find time to loot and shoot on this game and im now 21 it been a long time
22358,"its Borderlands

22370,gg game
22371,(played on xbox) Amazing story but not a fan of bullet sponge enemies.
22372,Do you like FPSs? Do you like RPGs? Do you like never running out of stuff to do? Then buy Borderlands 2.
22373,"Handsome Jack is one of the best video game villains of all time. There were times while playing when the gameplay got repetitive, and I was sick of the 78th d!ck joke, but then he'd show up and everything was... alright. Rest in spaghetti, king. Never forgetti."
22374,Amazing
22375,Best game ever
22376,star wars reference and midgets
22377,"good game,not a lot of characters but a lot of weapons(I approve)"
22378,"Uno de los mejores juegos para jugar cooperativo , es un juegaso por la historia tambien.Cada personaje tiene su propia historia y momentos divertido."
22379,good
22380,its a great shooter u can play for hrs
22381,"One of my many favorite games. The graphics are so unique and I love it. It is so easy to get immersed in the story and feel attached to your character. Even when not on sale, this game is so worth it!"
22382,shoot a lot
22383,"Played the story only for a little and gave up, game gives me headaches."
22384,is nice
22385,moe
22386,Great game. I had hours of fun with my friends.
22387,"One of the best looter shooters out there. The base game has quite a lot of content in itself- also do yourself a favor and just buy the Handsome Collection. All DLC (plus base game) of BL2 and BL:TPS. Both are great games. BL2 is probably one of the best examples of a looter shooter done right. Balance/gameplay is chaotic and fun, you can have so many different playstyles and builds, the story is great, Handsome Jack is one of the best villains in video game history, and overall its a blast. I highly recommend. Plus, if you get bored of base game/dlc, theres always community content like BL2 Reborn or the Community Patch. Its a blast."
22388,Its like Skyrim but with cartoons.
22389,"i love the replay ability, I also enjoy the story line. but mainly, I play for Shade, we're best friends"
22390,It's fun
22391,awsome game
22392,"nice and simple, but EPIC fun!!!"
22393,"good game, very fun to grind."
22394,I wish we could have hummor like that one day
22395,"Pros:
-A wide variety of weapons, skins, heads; all around some really creative and fun customisation that allows players to feel comfortable in their skin while they're exploding/melting/burning/perforating their enemies.

-Different classes/characters, each with a set of unique skills that allows them to navigate enemies and obstacles in interesting, show-stopping fashion. While they don't feel like the most intricately written characters, they posses plenty of personality and attitude to make up for it.

-Borderlands has always expressed a profound love for graphic/comic stylisation in the way it shows itself to players and the way it creates its world for us to immerse ourselves. Borderlands 2 is no exception with its gritty art style of thick, illustrated lines, vibrant colours, exaggeratedly bombastic personas and general flamboyance, all to really grip the player's attention. The experience is definitely far from dull.

Cons:
-Recalling to my previous statement about the characters not feeling very well written, it's unfortunately an issue that the main story suffers from as well. I can definitely understand why most people would quickly fall in love with this game for it's light-hearted, stark and slightly offensive humour, and the fabulous voice work for its characters. However all that wasn't enough to distract me from the more obvious twists cliched plot lines. There's also a distinct lack of motivation for a lot of characters to be working together, communicating, hanging out. In general all of the relationships feel either stale or forced, lacking in good justification for certain decisions or emotions because we don't really get to know them ie. how they came to be who they are and the way they interact with their world and others. Sure the voice recordings lying around give us a glimpse into some characters' backstories but nothing too particularly gripping. It's hard to be emotionally invested in anything that's going on in the story when you've either a) seen it done many times before or b) you can't relate to the characters in said story. In general, the relationships feel lacking and the characters are either one dimensional or flat out unlikable, and it takes away from the experience.

-I've heard a lot of praise for the game's main villain, Handsome Jack, for how well written his character is. On some accounts, I'd certainly have to agree that he has some good justification for how he became the tyrant that he is in the main game. At times, he was admittedly even interesting and funny to listen to. But I'm kind of disappointed at just how lacking his character and story is. He's very quirky, hot headed and makes a lot of humorous/beguiling quips, but by the end of the main story, he really just feels like your typical, run-of-the-mill villain with cliched ""evil speeches"", ""how could you have done this"", ""I'm doing what needs to be done"" type of deal. There was a certain twist that I won't say what, but I could see coming from miles away, some lines alluding to a deeper story with his history that I simply didn't care about. It was honestly kind of exasperating to have to deal with him sometimes, and not in the good way where you feel like he's going toe-to-toe with you as a protagonist, but more of a mild annoyance. A lot of times, he tries very hard to be intimidating but just comes off as laughable. Maybe his character will be explored more in the pre-sequel, I'm not sure since I haven't played it, I'm really just speaking about my experience with *this* game. Case in point, while he wasn't a terrible bore, he wasn't as good of a villain as people claimed he was, at least not to my expectations. But all things considered, I do understand that it's challenging to write a compelling antagonist when your main character is a blank slate that can comprise of different selectable classes.

-This is a smaller issue but one I feel still needs to be addressed: the game has a tendency to freeze up sometimes, where the visuals stop and the audio makes a disturbing ""whirring"" sound. From my experience so far, the game can freeze up to 8 seconds or less.

-Maybe this is just for Krieg, whom I played as, but there's a tendency for your character to get stuck on the small edges of certain polygons in the environment. This is especially problematic when you're trying to manoeuvre around enemy projectiles and you're caught on a small rock or a bump in the ground or whatever. Again, smaller issue but I feel needs to be addressed.

-I'm really not a fan of how ladders work in this game, where you have to be a specific, small distance away for your character to latch onto it. If you're too close to the ladder, your character will not hold onto it, an inconvenience which has annoyed me repeatedly throughout my playthrough. A better alternative would be to give an option to press the ""use"" button in front of a ladder. That way, you can't accidentally climb the ladder again trying to get off it (which has happened) and you don't have to worry about being too close or too far from it because you'll just see the ""use"" option when you're within range.

Conclusion: Borderlands 2 is a fun shoot-n-loot game that sports a wide range of customisation for your character and weapons. Just don't go into it expecting a anything emotionally gripping or any deep, complex characters that make you think. A lot of it just mindless fun, but at the end of the day, maybe that's enough."
22396,Dude i once got rickrolled by ironclad lunatic in this game bruh
22397,The best in the franchise
22398,good ga
22399,
22400,hehe gun go brrrrrt
22401,"It's my first time playing a first person shooter, it's a bit gross at times, but I've played it for 20 hours... so something has me hooked. The quests are fun and the landscapes are pretty."
22402,best game 9.5/10
22403,It's great!  Watch some reviews.
22404,"good 
"
22405,"Fun game, even better with friends."
22406,"Not a big fan of FPS games, however, there are a few exceptions.  This game is one of them.  Offering a story that's worth playing through over and over again.  Numerous way to play each character, it's fantastic."
22407,Love the format and different styles of play you can choose from.  Fun if you have a limited amount of time to play besides if you have loads of time. Highly recommend this game.
22408,"Who wouldn't like this?! This game just keeps on giving. The more I play, the more I enjoy it."
22409,Would recommend
22410,AGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOO
22411,fun and keeps me interested...
22412,"Best looter shooter around since it released 
only negative point i could think of is that the engine of the game doesen't supports its own physics option well"
22413,Great game
22414,"Did I finish it six times, or only five? Three? Seven. Whatever."
22415,"This is a great game. Despite only playing for a short time so far, I really enjoy the art style and unique humor of this game. It is also a unique world in many respects with a mixture of vast frontier wild west style areas combined with a sci-fi dystopian culture, people, and equipment. The detail for weapons, armor, and items is also extensive and makes for a very fun side task of finding the most powerful combination for your character and play style. Play for the game, stay for the story... it's that good."
22416,Liked it. Would recommend
22417,An amazing shooter game.
22418,"This game is miles better than the first one, but I still feel disconnected from the world, enough that I don't get drawn into or immersed, and/or care about the characters.

Weapons feel balanced compared to Borderlands 1 and Borderlands Pre-Sequel, and BL3.

It's also a complete package unlike BL3, which seems to know no end to its shite content.

This is a mild recommendation as if you like looter shooters, its for you. Avoid this game if you don't want to slog through hours of content to get an annoying gun you'll have to use until you find a better one, or have to listen to unskippable cringe dialogue.

Also pick this up if you plan to play Coop, otherwise this game is really boring after 3-5 hours on your own, which is something to be said as I can replay Bethesda games over and over."
22419,"What is there to say?
Out of the whole Borderlands Franchise... Borderlands 2 takes the crown!
Hands down one of the best Shooter/Looters in existence.
Just the humor is enough to buy it peeps! 
And if you don't enjoy it, crawl back under the rock from whence you came.."
22420,Too hard.
22421,GUUT
22422,good
22423,fun
22424,easily one of my favorite games of all time.
22425,Loved this game for many years and still do
22426,nice
22427,"I don't know where to start with this one (in a good way). This game did so many things right and is very good for the time it was made (2012). The diversity of the loot with gun parts/manufacturers, and the diversity in the play-style/strengths of the Vault Hunter lineup, this game will keep you playing for a long time if you're into looter shooters. Getting one of the Vault Hunters to end game is a rewarding experience, with each of the DLC offering raid bosses, and many farm-able bosses to perfect your loot.  I would also beg to differ that this game's narrative is the best in the series, carried solely by Handsome Jack. I know this is cliche to say, but I have never wanted to kill that guy so bad, but for all the right reasons. He is constantly in your ear mocking you, even moments after killing some of your comrades. Having a relationship with a game's antagonist helps so much to drive your narrative, or else the game just turns into ""I AM BAD MAN, I DO BAD THING BECAUSE I AM BAD MAN!"". I don't want to go too in-depth about Handsome Jack or else this would be an essay, but just know that you get to know this guy well through main and side quests. One more thing I like about this game is that it is easy to understand, and easy to play so pretty much anyone can pick it up. Just stick to a skill tree and keep your level/loot up to par with the recommended levels and you'll be alright (you can make/find a build for your character in the later levels, I don't believe it matters in your first playthrough (oh yeah and there are new game plus-type modes)). If you're new to looter shooters, this is probably the best introduction you can get. I recommend picking this up with a friend or group of friends."
22428,Its Good Trust Me I'm a Good Person Just Look at Me......... It's GOOD!!!
22429,"pog
"
22430,good game
22431,The Gameplay. The story. The humor. The guns. It all wraps up in one amazing package.
22432,This game is great and very fun thats why i reccomend it
22433,
22434,"Shooting, driving, rpg, explosions??

Borderlands 2 is a riot of great bad flank fun!!!"
22435,"A good game with a great storyline and interesting plot, with A LOT of guns and explosies!"
22436,dog shi t
22437,"This game is great, especially with friends. You also need to watch out for rushers when you start for the first time.
They are basically like street racers, All speed and no caution."
22438,best game ever made
22439, my cock stinky
22440,Best Borderlands game in the series
22441,great
22442,haha gun goes pew pew
22443,To this day this game is still my favorite Borderlands to play in the whole series. Would seriously reccommend giving this one a play through!
22444,Nope
22445,reeeeeee
22446,amazing game. the best in the borderlands franchise imo
22447,f uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
22448,"This game is fucking amazing. Literally my only complaint is the gunplay. Though a little ways into the game the gunplay gets better, for the most part. Besides that, great game, even greater with friends."
22449,Best game of all time imo.
22450,suppose its good yeah
22451,one of the best games of all time
22452,"Remember when Borderlands was originally shown and marketed to be a photo-realistic looking RPG with lots of guns? One that had little to no humor in it? Yeah, me too. I have the original Game Informer with the awesome looking Raak Hive picture on the cover. Then, all of a sudden, BOOM, cell shaded graphics and raunchy humor. Not that I'm complaining, considering the sheer joy that is Borderlands' loot gathering and numbers based gunplay/combat. I don't say skill because there really is no skill required to play this game. Just a basic knowledge of loot systems, numbers, and a generally idea of the character you want to be based on the abilities the game hands to you along with your chosen protagonist. I'm sure a million bagillion people have said it before me, but I'm going to say it again, because it's so true. Borderlands is Diablo with guns. You have an area, with branching areas, in which there are multiple missions and side missions. While going on these missions, you accumulate huge amounts of loot which adds ever increasing power to your character. As you play, you level up, which allots you skill points, which you then add into one of three separate trees. Sounds like every RPG ever, and while that's a solid argument, Borderlands' charm is how well its art style suits the world and its characters. Play it for the guns, not for the gunplay."
22453,hahhaha gunzerk go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
22454,"love this game so much (probably in my top 10 games of all time). zer0 is one of my favorite characters of all time as well, he just has that sort of deadpool personality and it's iconic. the characters are written with so much wit and charm and the art style is bursting with personality. so excited to check out BL3 and the pre-sequel!"
22455,i dont like art style
22456,"Top tier, lots of guns and farming. I love it, even after so many years"
22457,Cringe
22458,Looter shooters at its best. Haven't tried the other games but highly recommend this one
22459,"Its pretty chill, and overall nice."
22460,very fun

22470,"Increible, lo juegue mas en Epic, pero el juego es muuuuuy bueno."
22471,Best game i have ever played
22472,Pretty Good
22473,"Fun game, very good multiplayer. Much better if you mute the dialogue of random NPCs, as the script felt dated in its treatment of people even when the game came out and hasn't aged well. Gameplay, on the other hand, remains solid."
22474,great game play!
22475,love this game series 1 and 2 are awesome
22476,"Fun, hilarious, and jam-packed with content. This is an awesome Shooter RPG."
22477,Is Good :)
22478,this is by far my favourite besides skyrim lol. havent really had time to play lately but i had it on ps3 when it first came out but now i love it here on steam becuse i can use either my keybord and mouce or i can use my controller! awesome gameplay and open world (ish)
22479,Wonderful game. It's both insanely fun and hilarious. 10 out of 10 Claptraps. Highly recommend.
22480,Great game

22492,Fun to play.
22493,"Anyone who knows borderlands 1 would like this game.
Big difference in in the special abilities in each class. Worth a try"
22494,"Just got my early access review copy of Borderlands 2 and quite frankly, I'm in love. One of the best new games out on the market by far. Gearbox really out did themselves here compared to the games predecessor, Borderlands. BO2 is quite possibly the best game ever made even though it's not out till this winter. Pick up a copy or pre order this game ASAP, cause if yoou don't get your hands on this game when it's out, you're an idiot."
22495,This is my favorite game in the Borderlands series. Well worth playing.
22496,fun as hell :)
22497,its an american fantasy
22498,"great game played on console first and pc is a great experince

22501,"Wonderful game, logged thousands of hours and it never gets old!"
22502,"I do like the game but there is only one problem that I have. When I save  the game, it doesn't load to the place I was before. If the owner do a little favor and do an update changing that, PLZZZZZZ!"
22503,gg
22504,amazing game with graphics that can stand up too the 3rd game 1000 recommad over the 3rd
22505,good
22506,"Great looter shooter, with great characters and a lot of content to go through."
22507,"10/10 worth the money.

22509,gg
22510,.
22511,"Actually, I'm a jungle person who likes to hunt in the games (or real life, maybe?). To become an invisible character is suits me always. But in the desert, mostly you can't hide behind anything or you can't blind like a chameleon easily. But I love this game because it has the Mad Max atmosphere. And supporter friend, he always reminds me Wall-E. (don't) stay away from the psychos.

22512,AAAAAAAAAAA
22513,im gon catch u a riiiiiiiiiiiiiide
22514,"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Get this one over BL3. I have bought the handsome collection 3 times, now on PC, originally I bought it on the Xbox One, then the PS4, and even after beating the game 15 times over, I'm still finding more to do. This game is an absolute must buy!"
22515,a good good games way better than the 3 for many reason
22516,Good game
22517,good game
22518,Funny af.
22519,"This game is REALLY unfunny and relies too heavily on outdated 2012 meme humor. However the gameplay mostly makes up for it.  Get the GOTY edition as it comes with most of the DLC, most of which is good. The game can get really difficult for solo players, especially in new game plus modes, but it is still tolerable. Borderlands 3 can go get double donged in a bathroom stall for all I care, Borderlands 2 will forever reign over these radiated halls."
22520,It's ok
22521,ow my knee 2
22522,this game is actual trash. borderlands 3 is 10x better but 10x0 = 0
22523,"its awesome 
"
22524,"imagine committing numerous war crimes.....with this game, you don't have to imagine anymore

"
22525,"I personally believe this is the second best Borderlands game. I personally like borderlands 3 better. I enjoy the co-op, and story as whole. I love the idea of the thousands of guns this game has to offer. I like the games humor as well."
22526,"fantastic game, fun with friends lots of humor"
22527,best game
22528,"Really fun, and great for the whole family! My son now wants to be a psycho!!!! Yayyy!!!!"

22533,"sorry, late review and bl3 comparisons

Fun coop
For me, Kreig and Gaige (DLC) are the only toons that got me into this game and without them i probably wouldnt have been playing this much.
Farming here not too bad compared to Bl3, altho the two new DLCs made bl3 more enjoyable for me, ive enjoyed every DLCs here.

The one thing i reall ylike about bl2 was that it was actually fun resetting game save to new.  1)There were actual useful quest rewards.  Bl3 ive only found one.  Rest are just ""for fun"" altho in the latest krieg dlc u cud get purple versions of some of the legendary guns in dlc.  No actual good reasons to reset in bl3.  For anyone else, thats no biggie, but for me i actually prefer farming doing a playthru with randos again, rarher than doing the same boss over and over for a week.

At least with bl3 every character was penjoyable enough to get to (first) level cap."
22534,gg no re.
22535,I think good game
22536,"i absolutely love this game. great humor and unique graphics, <3"
22537,Love trilogy game

22544,GREAT GAME .
22545,"Borderlands 2 was released September 18, 2012 and as of October 5, 2021 (Over 9 years later) it holds up to this day. I play Borderlands 2 using an i7-6700k @ 4.0Ghz, a GTX 1070 FTW 8Gb, 32Gb of DDR4 2133Mhz RAM, and an Acer 144Hz 1ms Monitor.
THIS GAME RUNS AMAZINGLY WELL. It must be noted that I use a small collection of mods to improve the game, and I 100% recommend them. They include, but are not limited to the following must haves: BLCMM, Hex Multi Tool, and BL2 Fix. These 3 mods are the perfect starting point for modifying your game just the way you like it, and you can find them over at the Nexus Mods website for free.
I also recommend not paying for Nexus Mods, as even the ""Slow"" download speeds download the mods incredibly quickly. It is also worth mentioning that there really great YouTubers out there who explain each character's best progression in an easy to understand way. To keep track of my character(s), I just write down what skills to unlock, and at what level in a small .txt document and follow it accordingly.
The story is also really awesome, and the guns are incredibly fun. I absolutely love this game, and I recommend it to anyone with a computer that wants a good, fun, and expansive shooter game.
Thank you for reading, and have an awesome day!
P.S. If you want help with this game please feel free to add me, but also please comment the reason why you're adding me at the bottom of my Steam profile so I don't throw your request into the shadow realm!"
22546,"Love this game. I recommend it to anyone who likes rpgs with less plot, you can skip dialogue and just shoot shit!"
22547,"I've played the game for 140 hours and have not completed it :/ But its very fun and I think everyone should play it. Cheap and fun, was even free at one point on epic games with dlc content."

22560,"The game is shit and overhyped, the graphics look like a toddlers drawing, the gameplay is repetitive as hell and they give you loot 4 levels above yours its dum as shit also the boss sucks"
22561,excellent
22562,"It's a fun game, great art style, and plenty of amusing humour throughout.  It feels old however, like a game from 2002.  You can get it cheap in a lot of sales and with all the add ons there is plenty of stuff to do, so that small price provides huge value.  I paid under ten pounds and I've played 78 hours, with maybe another five or so left.  The biggest annoyance however is mission padding, where you have to go back and forth from one place to another over and over to go kill a guy then report back and now go back to steal a thing, then report back then go back to take the thing you stole and plug it into a computer.  Also you will go to a map to do mission X, and along the way pick up a few side missions and then you achieve one of those goals and get a new mission, and with each new mission your active goal changes and if you dont keep track of that suddenly you're heading to a different level and mission X is long forgotten.  Bottom line, buy it cheap and make sure you do all missions on each map before leaving to another map."

22571,"It's just not my kinda game, I get that, but I truthfully don't understand the hype aside from the art style and the characters. Dictionary definition of a looter-shooter. I think the game has no real problems but as someone who's a bitch for story I just couldn't get into this one for some reason, sorry. 4/10"
22572,its pretty good

22576,"I'll be honest, I can't properly review this game without being biased.
The Borderlands games are my favorite and despite not having the time to show it for the first 2 games as I played them on a different Steam account growing up trust me in that these, games, are, awesome.
I sincerely recommend these games no matter when you decide to play them as they've aged like Fine Wine."

22591,"This is a terrific game. Great game play and story, with the same wit of the first game.this is my favorite of the series, and though the game is getting rather old I find myself chasing that same feeling that borderlands 3 just didn't deliver on."
22592,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
22593,Best looter shooter period.
22594,Rlly good game Played for a long time and its amazing even if its old
22595,Game is alot of fun with some humor. My old iMac can play this without any problems. You play with many weapons to choose from and can play multiplayer which is always a plus.
22596,"i kinda play this game, i mean i have for the past 10 years, and somehow I am still finding bugs in this masterpiece. Good Job guys, takes genuine skill for it to still not be bug proof after releasing 3 more games"
22597,drop reloading works lol
22598,"A great mindless grind a thon. I wish there was a way to upgrade all weapons to a current level version when you finish a campaign. But other than that, 370 hours logged and enjoyed all of them!"

22605,"Honestly enjoyed this game a lot more than 3. I think handsome jack is a really good antagonist compared to the overall story in 3. But game play wise, 3 is a little better."
22606,"Much much better than one, but the movement is still clunky and shooting does not feel that great. A good CO-OP Shooter tho."
22607,One of the best games ever made!

22616,"a great game! replaying the story mode can become quite boring quite quickly however, but that's to be expected at some point. incredible fun with friends :)"
22617,"this game is great, with a beautiful art style and intriguing story line. this game is perfect for anyone looking for a great singleplayer or coop videogame, i've played through the game many times and it never gets boring, trust me you want to play this.
PS if you want to play this game you have to have played borderlands 1 and pre, after you have played borderlands 2 play 3"
22618,"this game is amazing fun with a few friends. we would play this to the wee hours of the night, zooming around in the cars and shooting stuff. i almost completed the game too, but the friend group i leveled up with stopped playing so my Gaige save is stuck in there so whatever."
22619,"It's fun, easy to play and you can play it with friends where the real fun begins."
22620,"Game of a lifetime. Excellent visuals/artwork, good storyline, great character development, plus an enormous weapon arsenal! All together one of the best games I've played, a must-have."

22622,"FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN KILL A CHILD"
22623,"This game reminded me that video games are meant to be fun, and not a pain in the ass :)

Easy fun, with plenty of potential to be an idiot. if you need to find your class, here is a little help:

Axton: The commando - You like Call of duty? You like putting sentries in random locations just to make people mad cause it's funny? Axton is for you! Make your own D-day while storming the hyperion headquarters, or expertly defend a position in the arena

Zero: The Assassin - Do you like genji in overwatch? Do you wish genji had a sniper rifle so you could be the ultimate cool guy on the playground with xX on both sides of your name? Play xX_zero_Xx and pretend you're good at things until you become good

Maya: The Siren - Did you like lillith in the original borderlands? Do you like making crowds of enemies melt with every single type of elemental damage known to man, alien, and skag kind? Do you like hearing your enemies cry to their allies as you trap them in a bubble of pure energy? Play Maya! Hope you like maliwan SMGs!

Salvador: the Gunzerker - ""i don't know what happened man! I just used my action skill, held down the fire buttons and everything died!"" - every salvador player when their buddy stops being AFK

DLC 1: Gaige: The mechromancer - Do you have trouble with aiming? Do you like spray and pray tactics or using shotguns willy-nilly? play anarchy + close enough Gaige! 

DLC 2: Krieg: The psycho - STRIP THE FLESH! SALT THE WOUND! ACTION SKILL SPAM! KILL EVERYTHING! REVIVE EVERYTHING AND KILL IT AGAIN!!! KILL KILL KILL!!!

And that is an Angel's short guide to borderlands 2 characters. Have fun, and may RNGesus bless you with legendaries"

22641,"The Borderlands game to play, BL2 is the pinnacle of the series."
22642,"I personally do not find this game fun or humorous but I am just a man and humor is subjective. really my opinion doesn't matter and shouldn't influence your decision in purchasing this game. if I were you I'd make my own decisions. take charge in your life, you are capable of doing things on your own. if you really feel dedicated enough you could stop playing video games all together and get a girlfriend, a wife, a better job, anything man. what is any of this really accomplishing anyways? or keep playing games I don't care I'm not your fucking therapist."
22643,better than 3
22644,"Fun game with comedic characters and colorful textures, had a blast playin it, not a serious game mostly made for entertainment by comedy of different kind."

22664,"Kinda weird, but when borderlands 3 came out i was super excited, played it for hours, but after beating every character i found myself coming back to borderlands 2 and starting up a new campaign even after playing 200+ hours on multiple platforms. So while dated, its definitly a classic"
22665,"Feels like a no brainer leaving this review soooo many years later but BL2 is the best on in the entire franchise. 10/10. Get all that sexy dlc. Drag your dick through normal, true and ultimate difficulties then let the game drag its dick through you on OP mode. Buy it. Now. Play it. Now. lol."
22666,bery good gem

22674,one of the best games ever
22675,"Very fun, very classic shooter.  By classic I mean this game was an instant classic, not that it bears resemblance to hallmark shooters of the past.  Very funny, but slightly dated comedy, paired with good looter-shooter mechanics."

22690,gave me motion sickness 0/10
22691,Very fun
22692,fun
22693,"I was studying at university when this game came out and it pretty much changed my life for the better. I was never a PC guy, or even a fan of FPS-games. I'd occasionally play Wolfenstein ET or Timesplitters, but that was it. Borderlands 2 was a game that made me love gaming on PC. BL2 was the best! What made it so great? Is it still as good as back in 2012? Let's explore the ups and downs of the game (+, +/-, -, ?):

+ The game looks great and timeless. Cel-shading was a blessing for the game.
+ BL2 is a nice hybrid of FPS-mayhem and RPG. Nice customization options too.
+ Playing the game feels perfect. Moving, shooting and looting feels like being in heaven.
+ The loot is great. Whatever your style is, BL2's got you covered. You can be stealthy, you can be smooth, you can be heavy, you can dual wield rocket launchers...
+ Getting a legendary/pearlescent item feel freaking great (unlike in BL3 where you're shower with legendaries). Overall, you can use almost every weapon you come across. But, don't use Bane, okay?*
+ The story is great, but the best part is the main villain, Handsome Jack. He's one of the best video game villains of all time. From the very first moments, you know you're dealing with an awesome villain.
+ The side missions are almost always great and worth your time. There are some trolly side missions, but the worst one are the delivery missions. Fak 'em >:( Still, you'll want to do them all.
+ The playable characters are awesome, even thou their personalities could be explored so much more. Gaige is my personal favourite :3 She's a sweet piece of hell.
+ These NPCs are awesome and it's so fun to talk to them. I love the fact that the game has personality. Or multiple. Moxxi is love, Scooter is bro. Ellie is deadly big gal... and so on.
+ Every location just looks awesome. It's fun to explore and exploring feels so rewarding.
+ So many enemies, so many elements, so many reasons why I hate rabid skags... :D
+ Almost all the DLC is great, and adds great stuff to the main game. For instance, you can be a nice pirate! Buy it all. Yes, even the weak Hammerlock DLC. Trust me.
+ Modding the game is freaking awesome! I especially love the randomizer!
+/ The soundtrack is very fitting, but I can't say it's something I would rock out to it on my free time.
+/- *The Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is a bit sucky. You need to apply slag all the time and only a handful of items is actually useful. But I like the challenge, even thou it really limits your choices.
- The vehicles are a nightmare to control.
- Sometimes your loot just falls off the map or through the floor. There goes my skullmasher again...
? The humor is either a complete hit or a complete miss. It really depends on your personal preference. Personally, I find the humor quite entertaining here, but not in BL3. Yeah, there are some baaaad moments, but nothing mega-cringy.
? If you play BL3 first, don't expect sliding, climbing or other great additions to the series, That game came out 7 years after this. Those additions, would have been awesome in this game thou...Many thous were used in this review.

Borderlands 2 is almost perfect. To me, despite the negatives, it's still the a 10/10 experience I always recommend. You don't know how much fun it's to shoot with wanderlust after maxing Gaige's anarchy stacks... Unless... You play the game. Play the game ;) One of my all time favorites, thank you for getting me through my university years. I know I've not played you recently, but don't worry. I'll be back. I know it."
22694,very good game!!!
22695,gud gam
22696,"Honestly Loved this game when i was younger, still do. Love the nostalgic feeling i get whenever i goto play this game! I do recommend to newcomers, might be a little dated but still a piece of art."
22697,I have played this several times now... great way to disconnect from the everyday churn...
22698,yes
22699,Yes.
22700,"game good gun go shoot and fan and stuff

22711,"good game to sink hours.

why the fuck can't it run now?

this is bullshit dude."
22712,Play Krieg.
22713,This game
22714,"You've probably played this franchise. This is one of the best. The absurd humour really resonates and there are some shocking reveals and unexpected twists in the continuing story of Pandora. Sadly a whole bunch of story relies on the last DLC for Borderlands which is super dated and I just never played. Dr Zed is less funny this time. Krieg is amazing and the character development is excellent for an FPS.
Some of the DLC can feel a bit arduous and the loot generation system makes you wade through tons of math trash waiting for the next purple gun/grenade/shield with minimal items from the vendors ever being of use. Still, it defined the looter-shooter genre and you'll have a good time playing this no matter."
22715,Best ZOMBIES!
22716,It is good.
22717,"Very nice and chill game, but throws everything at you. I recommend to play with a friend"

22727,they added a new system for online and now i can't use my username  that i used for years on the game because it is already taken.
22728,the best game in the whole wide world ever Burn all the babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22729,yes
22730,yes
22731,"Great game with smooth controls and more than one player does not crash the game. This game has been a staple for years now. With over 2k hours of game play, I am still having fun with this game."
22732,it be fun
22733,"So, you made it to Banditville! Congratulations. It'll be nice to see friendly face when I'm burning that place to the ground."
22734,"borderlands 2 what can i say other then  its in the top 100 games ever made in my opinion for this reason i do recommend this to all of you, if you have not played it by now you need to the story is amazing but remember to play the first one first if your the type of person that plays the games for the story"
22735,"They ""updated"" it and by update, they added Borderlands 3 advertisements and somehow ruined the performance on every PC. Fu cccckkkkkkkkkkkkk YOU 2k you slimy greedy shortsighted lazy pieces of human feces, I hate you. 2k is also trying to raise the price of TRIPPPLLEEE AAAAYYYY games to 70$, you wanna know what their first dry run was? You know it was the game they change nothing every year, dont even update graphics, everyones favorite NBA2k
"
22736,I regret even buying this for 10 dollars. The writing is worse than i remembered. The gameplay isn't even good. Nothing about this is redeemable. 3 is a direct upgrade in every conceivable way.
22737,"Why the game just stuck at the beginning video over and over again if I choose Traditional Chinese as the priority language? I tried to press esc to skip the video, but the screen just black out for like 10 second and play the video again. 
Any solutions guys?"
22738,Do I even need to write anything here? C'mon.
22739,i like this game alot it is fun
22740,10/10 got this game for Tiny Tina but everything else about the game is amazing too
22741,"Yeah, its pretty good"
22742,good game just didn't get around to playing it a ton.
22743,Such an amazing game to play alone and/or with friends.
22744,"A really good Time as a COOP group with FRIENDS. (Beware of PUG's with Strangers)
A bit of a slog as single player.
Ninja Looters (people stealing all the good rewards) is always a risk as the game does not give you exclusive rewards for your character, but, group loot that you have to decide how to share. Very bad design decision in my opinion. That's the only negative really though."
22745,"Not for me personally. cant get into the art, mechanics, or story of this series. It may be better for you, but i just wont be investing further into any of this title series."
22746,"Its amazing, nuff said"
22747,MAYHEM!
22748,The best entry in the whole borderlands series
22749,Awesome game!
22750,ye
22751,Its with no question the best borderlands game and to have the best experience with it follow a playthrough by joltz or K6
22752,Still the best game in the franchise
22753,it's been 8 years just buy it
22754,"It was dope
"
22755,Beat the game about a dozen...dozen times. It's ight.
22756,"Fantastic continuation in the best Looter/Shooter, and dare I say best FPS, out there. The new types of baddies are interesting and challenging, the maps are beautiful, the quests are hilarious, Handsome Jack is a fabulous antagonist, and the new guns are a blast. Oh, and the new Skill Tree and Bad-ass Coins add fun customization to builds. What a fun f***** game"
22757,Good Game
22758,"crazy looter shooter fun, basically the same game play as number 3 but cheaper so a good start point if unsure if you will like the franchise. 9/10"
22759,Very simple....Best looter shooter of all time!!
22760,"good
"
22761,"epic game
"
22762,great
22763,"amazing game
"
22764,"Light the fuses, bitches!"
22765,"very liek game pretty good yes okay
"
22766,"If you plan buying this game , pick up the handsome collection. Its very cheap on websites like g2a and worth every penny.
Hammerlocks big game hunt is probably the worst thing about this game but other than that this game is really good for singleplayer or co op"
22767,"fun to play for 20 min, fun to play for 4 hours"
22768,"This is one of the best shooter/ARPG/loot n shoots in the entire game market, i have very little negative to say about this game. In fact i think the only negative thing i have to say is that i wish that they would've made even more content for this already massive game. The characters are funny and creative, the game play never gets boring and i am constantly finding new ways and different play styles to try out. Every single vault hunter is fun to play with in their own way, and their really is a character to fit every players play style. Again one of the best video games of the modern era, id even argue to put it in the top 100 games of all time.
"
22769,"if you havent heard of this game then for shame, prolly the best looter-shooter in existence

Cons: edgy, outdated humor at times."
22770,big guns fun
22771,a classic
22772,brilliant.
22773,"I mean, it's fun, and I got it 95% off, so shout-out to steam for the sale!"
22774,"[h1] Intro [/h1]

Borderlands 2 is an action looter shooter that has you traveling across Pandora to stop Handsome Jack from taking control of the Vault, while taking some of the loot for yourself. There is a ridiculous amount of weapons in this game and many of them are extremely fun to use. The game is decently long, roughly thirty hours in length without DLC, too. 

[h1] The Good [/h1]

This game is gorgeous. The different locations feel so alive. The characters that you come across in this game are all so interesting and they offer a lot of unique and fun side quests. The main campaign is also really fun and thrilling. You get to fight crazy boss battles for insane loot and you can hear all of the comedic jokes from the different characters you encounter. Also, there's a lot of post-campaign content to unpack in this game. Like, a lot. However, I'll let you experience it. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

As good as this game is, it has some issues. Mainly, the DLC. Most of the expansion packs for this game are terrible in my opinion. There are five total, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragonkeep, Torgue's Campaign of Carnage, Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, Scarlet and Her Pirate's Booty, and Fight for Sanctuary. These expansions deliver some new areas, a new campaign, and new loot. I absolutely loved Dragonkeep and Campaign of Carnage, but the other three left a lot to be desired. All of these expansions are pretty short, roughly three hours each. Also, many of them were just boring to play through and barely did anything interesting. This might be more of a personal issue, but the leveling grind can be tedious sometimes. It can be painfully slow. However, this is just something that I had a problem with. 

[h1] The Verdict [/h1]

For the most part, I really enjoyed my time with Borderlands 2. The main campaign was great, the weapons were fun to use, and the characters were very well written. However, the leveling grind can be painful and the expansions were, for the most part, not worth it at all. The game on its own is excellent, but I would wait for a sale to purchase the DLC, if you want to purchase them at all.

Overall Score (Borderlands 2): 8.5/10

22778,"One of, if not THE, greatest mindless looter / shooters of all time! Has a great story and keeps you wanting more!"
22779,"it ok
"
22780,"good gameplay, nice multiplayer, good choice of characters, and a wonderfully happy bad guy!"
22781,Good game friends.
22782,"Someone said me and Handsome Jack would make a cute couple..

Handsome Jack responded with ""ewwww!"" 

This is the worst day of my life
"
22783,"It's Borderlands, why are you makeing me comment on it? bah fine... IT'S BORDERLANDS!! Bro bro bro... bro bro... bro bro..."
22784,this game is another one of my childhood favorites; blasting through psychos and cannibals is surprisingly entertaining for young children. 11/11
22785,Classic.
22786,"10/10 game.  This game is extremely fun to play, especially as co-op with friends.  I never lost interest, and the story line combined with the action and RPG gameplay keeps you coming back for more."
22787,Love the gameplay. Sniper rifles are my favourite thing. Grenade or headshot the psychos before they see you and you're golden
22788,Badass!
22789,"Fantastic game play, and story.

"
22790,"A game made not to be taken seriously ,yet it's thrilling and has tons to do.

Játék ami azért lett csinálva hogy ne vegyék komolyan, de mégis tele van érdekességekkel és élvezetekkel"
22791,"beautiful game, the artwork is amazing, and the gameplay is phenomonal, i rate this a 8.4 bruno marses"
22792,"Excellent game, vast content available and an almost endless combination of playstyles.Only gripe is the lack of moderation in multiplayer games that allow some people to cheat in 3rd party gear. But playing with friends its great fun!"
22793,WASD not my thing
22794,its a good time
22795,"In my opinion, this game along with BL1, has revolutionized the open world RPG genre of gaming. I love this game and will highly recommend it to every person on planet Earth. Catch-A-Riiiiiiiiiide"
22796,booger
22797,"I liked that it was easy to play and it was easy to understand what was going on in the game. Many action games such as this one are normally difficult to get the hang of, but this one was fairly easy. it also has a lot of action in it and it is very easy to play with others."
22798,"I love the game. I can come back to Borderlands 2 at any time and its still fun it never gets old. 

Its a 10/10 game trust me."
22799,game good
22800,good game
22801,"Yes, I played 92 hours, but a lot of that was from idling in the background. I tried and failed to like this game. Take out the salty language and the occasional d!ck joke, and it would be perfect for 12-14 year-olds. It's not mechanically bad, it works fine with no big glitches or issues. It's just not for adults."
22802,Definitely the best looter shooter of all time!
22803,Some good old crazy fun
22804,made me smile made me happy nice
22805,"I claimed this game on Epic games when it was free, and noticed that epic games sucks, so i bought Borderlands 2 on steam as well. best £15 i've spent."
22806,"I don't hate this game in and of itself, but I just hate 2k Games' business practices. Game of the Year edition should include all DLC but it doesn't.

You shouldn't have to be expected to subscribe to the game like it's an MMO to get all the content you paid for when you bought it."
22807,"Another game who Ive played huge amounts on Xbox and still find it to be enjoyable after all this time, especially when playing with friends."
22808,"great game 1!!!!! Nuff said
"
22809,Amazing Game 10/10 would play again. Never played any of the others but I absolutely would
22810,Very yes!

22812,this game is what I am
22813,The best shooter I have ever played!
22814,10/10 would shoot claptrap
22815,still the best borderlands game. by far.
22816,Best Borderlands ever
22817,well what i love about this game is the play stlye the vault hunters the skills they have even the back story's they have great weapons and dlcs best game ever sad i wont be able to do 3 but i hope u guys keep making this game amazing like u did to this one
22818,"Not really all that fun alone, but the fun increases with more friends in co-op."
22819,"very good game, yes."
22820,"I first played through this game on the PS3, but I'm enjoying it more on PC.

Fun single player and even more with friends.

If you like loot, shooting stuff, and dated humor this game is for you.

22826,Claptrap just different. He carry's the whole game series.
22827,"This game is the best Borderlands game hands down!  The Vault Hunters are awesome.  The humor is spot on.  The main antagonist is actually interesting.  And most importantly, there is no Ava!"
22828,"Bought this game 3 times on 3 different consoles, loved it each and every time. Always plays well and has interesting combat, and I think that the formula really peaked with this game. 10/10"
22829,Great game. Obviously.
22830,The game has a shotgun that flies and shoots before exploding. 10/10
22831,"Overall, its such a great game. Theres only a slight problem. The saves are wonky and if you re-install it after uninstalling or moving machines (Mac to Windows), your save is gone. Then you have to go to the work of getting it back from the steam cloud if you had it enabled. Luckily I had it enabled but when I loaded into the game after putting the save back into the SaveData folder, the file was corrupt. There goes around 100 hours of playtime gone."
22832,"it good
me like"
22833,good
22834,"This game is truly amazing!

At first, the gore was a bit much, but I soon realized that I could turn it off and I eventually got used to the little gore left behind. So, if gore disgusts you, have hope!

Overall, this was an amazing experience. It is full of adrenaline-rushing combat. This game will make you feel like a bad***.  The combat sessions are so engaging that you are bound to forget about everything else in the universe. It serves as a captivating place to escape from the dreadful realities of humanity. Also, there are tons of loot, humorous characters, a complex villain, and lots of content in general. 

It is also an awesome multiplayer game! When I first played with over two people, it was really chaotic, but soon enough I realized how fun multiplayer is on this game!

I tell you. This game is... EPIC!"
22835,ok
22836,"it good
"
22837,this game is good buy if u like a good game
22838,"I really enjoy this style of game as its very nostalgic and has such a good story. The general play through is so good and the whole leveling up system , tropthy sytsem, and guns etc are so amazing. I would suggest to players who also enjoy grinding games."
22839,"Aged horribly lmao. Do not play this game.

If you are an average redditor, this game is for you. You'll love Claptrap, and all the quirky references! 1337 xD

Overall 2/10 over-hyped, over-rated, ultra shit."
22840,It's really fun and a great First Person Shooter game. I love the quests and its just and overall good game.
22841,good game. made me realize I need to go to outside
22842,The gameplay is still solid after all this time. The humor is still good but some of the joke are dated. Axton Falls off in the second playtrough.
22843,"Big fan of this game since I was younger. Significantly more engaging and interesting than Borderlands 1 and 3, but the DLC is a bit lackluster (besides Tina's and the additional Vault Hunters, of course). You'll get good mileage out of this game, especially with friends."
22844,this game has huge pp
22845,It's fun
22846,"This game is amazing, it has an amazing story, with one of the perhaps the greatest villains in all of gaming. There's plenty of unique characters to meet, with many memorable side missions. All the DLCs are worth playing, and since this game is 8 years old, grab them. Each of the playable characters has a unique skillset, with lots of customization, of course the LOOT!!!"
22847,Game fun
22848,.
22849,Lots of bullets and humour. Some content feels a bit harsh to the sensitive mind.
22850,"Disliked the first one and I don't like this one either.

Some other day maybe"
22851,i like
22852,"p chill game
"
22853,yes
22854,"The game is a fun looter shooter, and I would recommend it if only it was stable. I reinstalled windows clean and updated the GPU in the meantime, so it's not my system.

The game requires an online server to play, but doesn't bother to save your progress on said server when you crash and doesn't let you save your progress manually, meaning that when the game crashes, you lose all your progress up to a random point, usually about 30m to 1h. 

The only recourse is to disconnect and reconnect regularly which is terrible because it respawn you at a hub and is not available if you are trying to clear missions.

40h in I lost maybe 4h of progress this way. I'm trying really hard to finish it, but I'm this close to dropping the game. The game is not recent, it should be stable by now.

I do not recommend playing a looter shooter in which you lose loot and progress to random crashes."

22862,While i have only 4 hrs here so far i have previously played this on both Xbox one and 360 and can say that this game has taken up a total of 6000 hours of my time on those platforms. This game is a must have and has the best villain in any game ever. I can not recommend this game enough that is unless you want to keep having a life in which case i say stay as far away from this game as you can.

22864,12/10.

22875,"I've played this game (PC and console), like over 10 times. 'nuff said."
22876,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

22941,"Greetings as I hope all is well! Below is my Steam Review for Borderlands 2, thanks for reading and good luck have fun in all your gaming adventures...

STORY/LORE - 9/10

The overall story of Borderlands 2 was pretty good and a great continuation of the original game. I loved how they added in the original three characters from Borderlands 1 as the overall story was fun, engaging, and keeps you hooked until the very end. Solid voice acting all around but keep an eye for Handsome Jack as he stole the show. You will genuinely hate him, even though he is handsome.

GAMEPLAY - 9/10

If World of Warcraft had a baby with Call of Duty, it would be Borderlands. It’s a fun looter-shooter that has so many interesting and unique weapons, the creativity truly shines from start to finish. They have all sorts of fun weapons with elemental damage, different kinds of scopes, and my favorite, weapons that instead of just reloading normally, instantly become grenades. Then you have other things to collect from shields, grenades, and even unique skills specifically for the class you picked.

The weapons selection is fantastic. Assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, snipers, handguns, rocket launchers, you name it, it’s here. This goes well with pretty fun and varied gameplay as you’ll have a fair share of easy enemies, tough ones, and some that will truly see how much ammo you can carry at any given time to kill since they’re quite challenging. You can mix in story missions or optional missions and truly get into some immersive and hilarious gameplay. Keep in mind it can be a bit repetitive but it has a good mix of quests, including some you need to use your vehicle for. You can even hang out and play slot machines in Moxxi's bar.

SOUNDTRACK - 9/10

Borderland 2’s soundtrack is just like the original, it’s perfect background noise that changes depending on what is going on in the game. Once you get into a firefight with enemies, the music ramps up and gets you ready for the challenge ahead. Same thing with boss fights as it makes the game feel that at any given time, anything can happen once you hear the music change. Each new area has a distinct theme to it and it’s just all really well done.

MULTIPLAYER - 9/10

Keep in mind I’m playing this in 2020 as Borderlands 2 came out back in 2012 but it still holds up nicely to this very day, including the multiplayer. It’s very easy to get a group of friends and all play together as they even made the ability to create a generic class at Level 30 so you can jump right into DLC content and not have to redo the first few missions of the game. Nobody is really playing Borderlands 2 that much anymore so it’ll be hard to find people to co-op with but the option is still there if you plan to do so. It also has LAN support which is a huge plus in my book.

FINAL SCORE - 9/10

If you’ve played the first Borderlands, this is definitely a much better experience. The graphics are great, gameplay is solid, and it’s just a ton of fun whether playing solo or with friends to go through things even faster. Everything that you loved in the original is back but much better as it’s easier to navigate across areas, the weapons have gotten even more creative, and you’ll enjoy all the unique and returning characters of the game.

The multiplayer is super simple and easy to get into as it is still supported. If you’re looking to get into the Borderlands franchise as a whole, now is the perfect time. It’s an incredible franchise that is headed in the right direction as there is never a bad time to get into it if you’ve never played it before. The classes to choose from got even better and added another dimension to an already awesome game.

Overall, this is a must-buy game and one of the best FPS games you could play. This is especially so if you enjoy collecting new faces/outfits for your character, doing runs/raids/dungeons for loot, and getting a unique RPG experience in an FPS. What are you waiting for? Get this game right now, jump back into Pandora, and start breaking faces!"

22971, i really like everything about this game from the graphics to the sound effects an i would recommend it to anyone but i would like to say some times the game does not always save where you last were in the game on pc but other then that the game is amazing thank you
22972,Best FPS game i've ever played
22973,"played it for a lil bit, it's okay."
22974,"This sat in my steam library for over a year, with me playing a few minuets to an hour at most. Anyways, if you’re like me and one: Like FPS games, two: need something to waste a good chunk of your lifespan on, and three: have a computer so bad that you can’t run anything that requires DX 11. The yes, this game is for you. Also just a side note, you are going to have to do side quests to progress in this game, it’s a loot shooter so there is a lot of grinding. Anyways, I played this at a solid 20FPS and still loved it."
22975,"I have an additional 110 hours on the Epic Games version. Hella worth, tons of endgame and stuff.

Get the handsome collection tho its more worth than just BL2's basegame"
22976,"I don't get how this franchise became so popular considering the outdated game design. You spend an hour or so clearing a level, follow the steps to ensure it saves your progress and when you ""continue"" the game it starts you from the beginning of the level - enemies, and everything you looted will respawn, effectively destroying your efforts and any sense of completionist you would expect from a looter shooter. Not to mention, they put a Borderlands 3 banner in the middle of the main menu, again destroying any sense ownership of the game.

This game has a lot of potential with it's unique visuals and interesting characters, but the painfully outdated savings system will infuriate you and waste your time when you could be playing a game that respects your efforts."
22977,All games pale in comparison  to Borderlands 2.

The first one has a way better ""feel"" to it. The weapons in this game are silly. Just give me a gun that shoots straight and doesn't turn into a grenade when I reload for friik-sake hahaha. And the characters and skills suck, one of the characters literally promotes you to be bad at aiming and not reload your weapon which is just... not why I play shooters? But, you know, works nicely as a co-op option I guess. We need more games in this genre."
22989,"...I don't even know what to say except that this game is worth every penny I spent. Stars, I can't even...these disaster people are my jam."
22990,"I have played through this game on the 360, the PS4, and even the PS Vita and every run through I find a new way to love it. If you are on the fence get it you won't be let down."
22991,"+ Diversity in enemies and weapons
+ Big, interesting world
+ Nice skill tree
+ Good story
+ Humor
+ Fun playing co-op
+ Lots of LOOT

23000,i like
23001,It's a well optimized shooter game with stupid jokes that make it quite unique alongside it's unique art style. Game features multiples classes to choose from each quite unique to its own style. Story is stupid but good. In total a good package with handsome collection when it goes on sale. Best enjoyed with multiple people.
23002,Still  has better story then Borderlands 3 HEY GEARBOX FIX YOUR GAME AND STOP
23003,Best bang for buck youll ever find. The amount of content in this game is RIDICULOUS. Seriously a staple game.

23031,One of the funniest and unique game i have ever played.
23032,I will say this over and over this game is tied with the first one as best in the series. I really liked BL3 and TPS however the story lacks hard on both and BL3 lacks in DLC characters (which i want to say fuck you Randy for ruining DLC characters just take my damn money and fuck off my game play).
23033,this is borderlands 2.

23047,"Easily the best Borderlands in the series. I'd recommend this game even for people who haven't played the first game. Borderlands 2 improves on everything from the first game, is less gimmicky than the Pre-Sequel, and the story and enemies are just superior in every way to Borderlands 3. It's really good but isn't perfect. I could sing praise about this game all day, but here are some of its flaws:

1. The way DLC is handled and level balance. In the first game you beat it, then again on Playthrough 2, then DLC scales to your level until you hit level cap. This game you go through Playthrough 1, then TVHM. Enemies still scale to your level, but the level of loot is capped at 50. Meaning if you want to do all the DLC with 1 character on TVHM, enemies will over-level your gear. I would of liked it better if there was no UVHM (Playthrough 3) and instead you hit max level via DLC. The only way to get gear higher than 50 are with golden keys (limited to epic tier), and playing on UVHM. Speaking of which:

2. I do not like UVHM. This is the hard mode of the game. Enemies have high HP and you basically have to slag everything just to kill anything. This ends up being very repetitive and is a turn off for the majority of players."
23048,Amazing game. Amazing graphics. Amazing story. Never run out of things to do. The details are incredible.

He asked me, who ninja is. I said ninja i shte best gavmer on the history of esports. Esports are an insane breed oif gamers. Anywayu, my dad heard handosme jack and said, wow i wish that was me.

23060,"My review
Pros
really loved the artstyle of the game
handsome jack was dope antigonist
zillions of guns to get
awesome towns and locations
Cons
not enough towns and locations
some unnecessary back tracking 
My final of rating this game is 9.5 Out 10"
23061,"I find the game pure fun, and it makes me laugh..."
23062,"Boring game, cringy dialogue."
23063,"The first game is infinitely better than this one for gameplay. You could get good guns anywhere in the first game, from vending machines to killing world ending monsters. The only guns you had to do endgame content for were pearl weapons and even then you could get them from multiple sources.

In BL2 you have to farm the same shitty boss dozens of times to get the drops you want because each legendary item is basically only dropped from that one boss. It makes the game extremely repetitive.

Also the guns don't feel like guns in BL2 and the stat scaling is so fast that you will get destroyed if you don't have weapons within 1-3 levels of what you're fighting. In BL1 you could use the same gun for 10-15 levels easily if it was a good gun. The guns look and sound like toys in BL2 as well and completely lack impact. 

This is the most over rated looter shooter in the genre and it baffles me why people praise it so much."

23077,Fun looter shooter that almost always has interesting loot and will also give you some satisfying combat with some laughs for different kinds of humour sprinkled in. worth getting and if you enjoy it and want more then theres DLC if you want to see more plus other characters to try and play if you want to mix it up.
23078,"Everything this publisher touches turns to cancer. If you require yourself to avoid scummy corporations like I do, you've got to avoid 2K and Gearbox."
23079,"Borderlands 2 was the first FPS I ever played and it still stands as one of the best FPS's and Looter Shooters ever made. It's campaign is hilarious, gut wrenching, and engrossing, while also boasting one of the best villains in media, Handsome Jack. It has a multitude of unique weapons and characters to play as, making it one of the most replayable games ever. Borderlands 2 is the reason why games like Destiny exists and it is undeniably the definitive Looter Shooter experience. Get it if you are one of the few who haven't already. It is easily worth your while. A lot of the DLC is worth your time also. Borderlands 2 easily stands the best First Person Shooter I've ever played, with DOOM Eternal being a close second."

Every location is packed with almost all types of enemies whether it be nomads , maraudres , psychos , bullymongs , insects , loaders , constructors , engineers or monsters (except sanctuary ofcourse). One of the best things about this game is the villian, handsome jack , who is arguably one of the best villians in video game history. The story is very well written with jokes here and there plus the side missions are very interesting and worth playing as well.

23168,"Borderlands 2 is still the crowning achievement for Gearbox, while it's special ed brother Borderlands 3 kinda just poops in the sandbox. If you want the S tier quality BLands story, characters and insane damage numbers, pick this one over 3. Sure, the movement is wonky and the graphics are dated compared to the newest entry but it is far superior in mostly every department. 2 > 3~1 > Pre-Sequel"

PROS:
-nice mixture of FPS and RPG elements
-4 different playable classes each with unique playstyle
-many different types of enemies each with unique weak points and optimal ways of fighting
-memorable characters and NPCs with AMAZING voice acting
-biggest amount of loot, weapons, items ever
-unique artstyle
-smooth, fun gameplay
-good humour
-options after the campaign (story ends around level 37, with True Vault Hunter mode and DLC, the level cap goes to 80 with 10 OP)
-multiplayer/co-op for more xp/better loot

CONS:
-story is kinda meh
-music is kinda meh, except maybe in 2 areas
-inventory managment is headache inducing, especially in the beginning when you are not used to it
-very few minor bugs, nothing game breaking (got stuck and door not opening), quick restart fixed everything

23206,"I know my opinion won't be popular but that's my experience with BL2 : Boring.

I started 3 playthrough to finally throw the towel and stop trying to convince me that this game was for me.

My main grip are :

* Xp balance : When you're a completionist like me and you're given the choice to complete some side quest, you do it, no choice. Gaining more and more XP the game becomes too easy and main quest becomes a breeze.

* Side quests: Bland and uninteresting, lots of backtracking... Too much and not well integrated in the main story, the main story becomes secondary and it drags the game too a slow pace.

* The loot : During my two first tries of playthrough got s*it tier equipment, third one I luckily came across a pistol that made the game more easy than it was already. Luck & randomness, two thing that goes hand in hand that I hate in a game and why I don't play MMO anymore.

* Story : Didn't get in, didn't care about Handsome Jack he's just a voice  not a menace, not charismatic  etc..

I really loved the first one, it was a real breath of fresh air in the RPG world, more focused, with less randomness, less side quests and a story. 

This one feels like a MMORPG stuck inside a single player game.

Anyway, thanks for the Linux port.

23207,Definitely the best looter shooter of all time

The game is dangerously addictive and worth every second you play, every DLC and every waking moment of playing this game will not be wasted. I truly recommend this game to anyone, even if you don't like FPS that much you're probably love the game for its humour.

The main story is good enough for what the game does and there is a clear divide between gameplay and story, however, I am not complaining because Borderlands isn't known for its story."

23230,"Borderlands is one of the BEST looter shooters out there. It isn't easy either, regardless of how you play, you'll have fun. There's a build out there for every playstyle. Crowd control, or just plain s'plodin some midgets with shotguns. You'll never want to stop playing!"
23231,mmmm Moxxi boobies
23232,Borderlands 2 is a game that stands out in the series. It's a game that I continuously come back to.
23233,more like awesome cock
23234,"Just finished it. 

What a great game. I love all the characters, they're all memorable (even that one npc that you met for some mission). The villain might be my favorite characters. 

The gameplay is okay. Pretty much what you expect from single-player fps shooter. Sometimes it's a pain to manage your inventory. The sidequest can get boring sometimes, but eh, it's optional, nbd.

Highly recommended, even at full price.

23235,"Absolutely phenomenal game, I've been having a blast playing it. You definitely won't regret the purchase if you like games like Terraria or rpgs and/or shooters."

This game is a must have for looter-shooter fans, sure, it's 8 years old, so what? If you enjoy sarcasm and humor in games then this game is for you. The storytelling is good and the antagonist is one of the best ones out there. The DLC's are one of the bests, Tiny Tinas assault is my favorite. But as looter-shooters tend to be, there's a lot of grind, but that's only if you want to be on level and have the better weapons, grinding is much easier on pc since the loading time is much faster than on console. The legendaries are pretty rare in this game but boy oh boy.... they sure punch like a truck (not all of them). The only cons are that sometimes there can be bugs, not game breaking but annoying, like getting legendary and having it fall trough the floor to the infinite void, also there was a mod that ""remade"" the game, but since patch last year it doesnt work anymore, which is a shame. And if you're going to buy this game you should wait for a sale, they tend to be big on this game. Overall i give this game 9,5/10."

23338,"8 years...wow didn't know this game was so old... 

Anyway, Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite light rpg-loot-fps. its predecessor, Borderlands 1 was already good but this one is a gem and mainly because of its scenario and dialogues all over the place. It makes the journey on Pandora less monotonous and tiresome than it could be in the first game. so Borderlands 2 is also a loot game, because you'll loot a lot of things (manly garbage but sometimes a good sub-boss will drop the weapons you need to improve your fire rate and firepower. 

I played this game solo and finished it once but wow what a game. Long, you can spend hours and hours on it. It still suffer from some tiresome moments where nothing happen but nothing that should prevent you to launch it nor to replay it with another character.

Speaking of them, the new host of characters is quite good, it reminds me a bit of the cast of the first game, more skills and some QoL improvements.

graphically its cartoonish style has aged pretty well and it's always  a pleasure to hear Clap-Trap telling nonsense and getting stuck when he sees....stairs.

if you want a good fps with a very good scenario,  a cast of memorable characters and a lot of enemies to kill with a good lot of items to loot.... make yourself a favor : play it, you'll never regret.  I don't."

23362,its good and long and i don- I mean i like it.
23363,"Weapons go boom
"
23364,"One of my favorite games, I originally played it on my Xbox 360. The DLC is fantastic and adds a lot of post-game content, and the campaign and bosses are still a good time. With plenty of weapons, monsters, and quests, experimenting with characters and your arsenal are all very fun and the game has good replay value. I enjoy it a lot."
23365,"It's one of the best FPS on the market, what else is there to say. Anyone who's been playing fps games for as long as I have been knows that."
23366,no
23367,Because... NIPPLE SALAD!!!
23368,"Absolutely LOVELY. One problem, but it's not the games' problem. When I was family shared this game, I had every DLC except Commander Lillith. So when I bought Commander Lillith it said I must own BL2. So when I bought BL2 I lost every DLC except for Commander Lillith, and the new one I just bought, Digistruct Peak. I assume since I didn't but the UVHM ugrade FIRST is why everything is now on TVHM difficulty. Again, not the games' fault. Here is my review on the game:

So we can play as some type of Roland character ""Axton"", A siren with different capabilities than Lillith, A gunzerker who can weild two guns at once for the price of normal ammo and can throw two grenades when in his ability for the cost of one, and everyones personal favorite (jk), Zer0, the assassin who can go invisible and throw kunais and explode his hologram when unvis and can find crits on enemies, etc. There are also other characters that I won't talk about yet. I also won't explain the entire campaign, I'd and you'd be here all day reading an entire book. I personally hate the part where you have to kill angel. The difficulty on it is insane, and if you go down with no enemies around then you have to restart. It takes SO long for an injector's shield to go down. But my favorite part of the campaign is Bunker, the part BEFORE angel. Terramorphus? I think that's his name? Is my favorite raid boss, the dragons are my second favorite except I can't fight them again. The LOTR easter egg is difficult, but really fun.
The easter egg where you can see Terramorphus? is pretty funny. There is really nothing else I can say, except for wish me luck. I will be completing every side quest in base game and Commander Lillith.

23407,"❝  It's Cute That You All Think You're The Heroes Of This Little Adventure, But, You're NOT ❝ .
-Handsome Jack

[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]
Borderlands 2 is a solo/co-op  1st person looter shooter, that requires no introduction. It revolutionized the gaming franchise back in the day and still continues to be a very pleasant gateway for many players such as myself. I can not express in simple words how much work has been put into its production. From the amazing art style to its well-written characters and exciting gameplay, all combined are offering an unforgettable experience that lives up to its reputation even after many years.

[h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1]
Bl2 continues the story of our beloved vault hunters (Lilith etc…), however with a fresh new cast. The plot revolves this time around Handsome Jack (among the most  [b] well written [/b]  villains in  [b] all [/b] gaming history) whose purpose is to rule over Pandora.

Bl2 brings forth an overwhelming variety of characters, each unique in its way with an impactful role during all your adventures. The game can be extremely humorous, with many jokes and funny dialogues between heroes, villains and even NPCs alike, thus creating a unique bond between characters and players that I have rarely seen in any other game. The plot at the same time offers heartbreaking moments (no spoilers here), that can have a strong impact, especially on those fans who stay loyal to the franchise from the very beginning.

Overall, as long as you like destruction and good humour I guarantee that Borderlands 2 will become your  [b] “special” [/b]  place to be.

[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]
You have gazillions of weapons to choose from, each manufacturer has a different “speciality”. There are 5 major effects and a farming system that even though requires some tweaking, remains supreme in its way. Bl2 introduces 6 different vault hunters (DLC included), each with a unique playstyle and range of abilities. You will be losing yourself for countless hours in front of your PC, either grinding for a specific loot or reading guides on the wiki/watching YouTube videos to build your skill tree and playstyle. I can’t even recall how many runs and playthroughs I‘ve done in my spare time to create the “ultimate” killing machine.

The grinding potential is immense and you gonna stuck on small details, like whether you should go with this build or whether you should main for a Siren or maybe a Commando etc... There are 3 types of difficulty, that scale up only after the completion of EACH difficulty's main story. Unfortunately, there is no endgame plan since the gameplay is focused mostly on grinding and repetition, a feature that many people do not enjoy. Overall the game revolves around bringing havoc, a specific trait that flatters us the fanbase.

[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]
I really enjoyed the DlCs since they further expand the BL universe, forcing the player to undergo the goofiest yet most enjoyable adventure hands down from any other game. However, since the overwhelming amount of content can become a deep hole in your pocket, I suggest you wait patiently for the steam sales (buy the package !).

[h1] 📣 References: [/h1]
I recommend VinylicPumaGaming for its rich Borderlands content. There are builds, tips and tricks that proved very useful for me, and I hope as well for you in the future:

[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]
Guns, loot and an unreasonable amount of weapons all await you in Pandora. So grab your bags, hit your Cl4ptrap in the face and let’s break this planet into smithereens Vault Hunter style!"
23408,yes
23409,could be better 6/10
23410,"I was late to the Borderlands party, but nevertheless, the game is still awesome and I am having a lot of fun hunting down Psychos and exploring Pandora!"
23411,I have countless hours on console so I give it a 10/10
23412,i like first person shooters. i like rpgs. nuff' said
23413,"Its been said by me and many others, its a masterpiece. Its the Mona Lisa but digital."
23414,not as good as bl3 but its aight
23415,"The best out of the borderlands series, If youre going to play any of the borderlands series it should be this one. Has the best writing and story out of the lot in my opinion. Looter shooter fun with friends or by yourself. 
Bl3 is buggy and they keep trying to rebalance it, alot of skills dont do what they say they do and its just not as fun. 
Bl1 is good just not as good as 2.
BL presequel is worse than one imo

I hate the money hungry publisher 2k, Gearbox made a dlc to hype the release of bl3 and gave it for free only to people who has the game installed at the time. So even though i preordered this game i brought the season pass and every other dlc. i didnt have the game installed or working computer at the time. I contacted customer support and it was tough luck i have to buy it and according to reviews its not worth it for 23 AUD.

23423,"good game, i enjoy it"
23424,great
23425,it was meh
23426,Very fun co-op game. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good up to 4 player co-op experience.
23427,I only have a few hours.
23428,I played this game because friends forced me to. The storyline switching between groups in South America and Europe was confusing. It also took too long to buy new parts for your arm slaves. I liked that the rape scene was tasteful. 7 out of 10.
23429,Ive only played this game a bit its decent
23430,best fps rpg

23438,masterpiece :)
23439,This game is one of the best games i've ever played. if you've ever played the other borderlands games then play this one because Most people and I think this is the best game out of them
23440,Good game overall.
23441,yes

23451,"I first played Borderlands 2 shortly after launch on my xbox 360 and I was completely blown away. I was i think 12 at the time (20 now) and Borderlands 2 has stuck with me since the first time I played it. It is easily one of my favorite games as it (along with Destiny 1) was pretty much all I played through my teenage years. To anyone who hasn't played it: PLAY IT NOW. It is amazing, but I would also wait for a sale so you can get the game+all dlc and TPS and its dlc for like 10$. 
"
23452,yes

23465,Good game
23466,"Amazing.
Literally game of the century.
Best game ever made.
Destiny is trash.
Goodnight."
23467,Game sucks. Talk about 10 steps back from the first one except for the gameplay and skill trees.
23468,A fun and addicting looter shooter which has a lot of style and personality. Sure this game is a grind but its not as much of a hassle to grind through as the side missions are just as fun as the story missions. Not to mention this game works beautifully on my potato of a PC with a Pentium processor inside. 9/10 would definitely recommend.
23469,"This is a great looter shooter and an okay game.

Personally, I don't fancy the graphics much, but they did such a great job with the variety of weapons, I think that's probably some of the best in the industry.

The classes and RPG elements are kinda shit. Wish they made a better progression system.

The UI / UX is a horrible, horrible console port, like most PC games nowadays.

The humour is fun here and there."
23470,100% recommend you will  love it
23471,"Yea, it's good."

23474,"Absolutely fantastic, with lots of replayability, and able to spend hundreds of hours on."
23475,its good
23476,"The game has a fun mechanic such as an big arsenal, giving such as variety of tasks to complete and entertaining missions with tons of action, variety of skills to unlock and a long campaing which may get boring for some people but remembering all the awesome things you can unlock makes the long gameplay worth it (also the intro is very badass)"
23477,10/10 would loot again
23478,So I got a vendor Legendary and I would actually use it. I couldn't afford it even if I sold my entire inventory (not worth it) but then I checked the parts and its one of the worst variants. But also gud game BL2 is.
23479,"the best of its class if you could even put a game this crazy in a class if not it deserves a class of its own
"
23480,one of the best games you can spend your money on
23481,"I didn't care for BL2 when it came out. Recently I picked it up hoping that it would inspire me to play BL3 and it worked. There are a few substantial flaws throughout the game (which have likely been addressed by others), but otherwise it is a masterpiece and truly addictive. My favorite thing about the game is the wacky enemies and of course the guns. Even at eight years old, it is a pleasure to play."
23482,I play all borderlands and i love them all!
23483,Good game. 2000+ hours on xbox
23484,good game
23485,"Over here, my sweet meats, your prince of justice and genocide has something to say: Gone are the days of the tentacle and the age of the gods and mercy is far away... We are fighters of the middle, the second act in the three-part MEAT play, AND I WILL WIN BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR!"
23486,Uh... it was fun?
23487,PLAYED THIS GAME FOR MONTHS GOT INTO PSYCHWARD. SHOOT ME INTO FACE. IN THE FACE
23488,I love this game. Finding new variants of procedurally generated weapons is really addictive. The level design great. The music is often fantastic.
23489,"Game cool. Shoot man get loot. Most loot stinks bad. 

If this is the case, get Reborn. Fixes most loot sucking really bad. In end game you have to narrow regardless."
23490,Blanao incredibilo de puta madre cabron !
23491,"Hundreds to Thousands of hours on both xbox versions, plus nearly 100 of modded fun on PC, I think I can say that this is one of the best games of all time. Pretty much the perfect looter-shooter, great replayability, amazing story, amazing characters. If you want to have a great couple of hours with some friends, this is the one for you. Especially if you've never played it before, I do suggest playing them in order if you plan to play them all. (BL1, BL2, BLTPS, BL3) all of them are amazing, (besides pre-sequel fight me about it) The game is super easy to pick up on, the ONLY thing I might warn you about: If you have a low patience, get ready to get pissed off, because a LOT of this game is grinding levels, and farming for hours and hours for the perfect gun for you. But if you are able to handle this, go crazy buckaroo."
23492,great game to play to friends
23493,yeehaw
23494,Recommend
23495,I SEE MEAT MUSCLES!
23496,"Ah, Borderlands 2, this game will always hold a special place in my heart as the game that helped me keep in touch with my girlfriend while we were hundreds of miles apart. We are now happily married and continually eyeball our next complete dive through all 3 games. Should be an amazing bonding adventure.

It's a pretty goofy first-person shooter romp as well. I mean, don't go into this game expecting storyline that will change your life in any meaningful way but, the writing and wit is both toilet-humor AND solid gold at the same time.

P.S. Tiny Tina's expansion is unbelievable and amazing. Not to spoil anything but at one point you get a gun that shoots out swords, those swords then EXPLODE into more swords... amazing."
23497,Great game for being made in 2012. Always love Borderlands. Suprising how BDL3 has slower loading screens and more matchmaking glitches than this one!
23498,yeah its fun
23499,It has enemies that try to hurt and kill you. too scary. 1/10
23500,"Hell yeah! Love this game! :D Fun, witty, insane ... it's got it all! The story was immersive. I'm a huge fan of the style of graphics/art! 
Huge fan of this FPS! :D 
"
23501,"I've played through this game a few times, I love playing it with friends. I really enjoy this game series."
23502,",,,"
23503,Out of all of the borderlands games I would say this game is the most rounded and balanced. Between decent graphics and good mechanics to the well balanced gun play and the leveling and enemies balanced to that. You can't beat borderlands 2 it is an amazing game that I have sunk well over the 213 hrs I have on pc alone. I highly commend this game.
23504,"Borderlands is a game of Unending Excitement! I could Play for Hours, Days or even Weeks!"
23505,GRIND GRIND GRIND KILL KILL KILL!!! 10/10 would ride meat bicycle again
23506,"fun w friends
"
23507,Best played with friends... Not too hard...And the beginning is not so good but will be better with better gear and guns..
23508,"I've tried to play through this game almost a half a dozen times now and every time there's just something about it that draws me away from playing it.

EDIT: Played Borderlands 1 and 3 and enjoyed them much more; I now have an idea what is different about this game that causes me to dislike it: the early game mission design is horrendous, with every mission sending you to a completely different area that takes multiple minutes every time to walk or drive to. BL1 and BL3, on the other hand, keep you within the same restricted area for most of the early game missions, and let you unlock fast travel and vehicles fairly early. Although this game does give you access to vehicles quite early, the distance between the early missions is so far that you'll still spend a few minutes driving in between every mission, not to mention the numerous chasms you can fall into that make you have to drive slowly up a twisting path to get back up every time.

If there's one positive thing I can say about this installment in the series, it's that it seems to have a more interesting endgame than the others (although I haven't played it), but I just don't find it worth it to slog through the mind-numbingly dull early game content in order to get there."

- Well-written story with interesting characters
- Variety of gameplay styles
- Fun in both single player and multiplayer
- Smooth gameplay experience (minimal lag), even during multiplayer

Disliked:
- Character power is highly tied to level
- Occasional backtracking was tedious"
23519,"Tries to have the functions of good MMO RPGs without being massively multiplayer online, essentially getting rid of all motivation to grind for rare weapons and levels. If you want to just play the campaign with your friends I would definitely recommend it, however it is like exactly the same as Borderlands 1 in that regard. If you want to play a loot and shoot where your progress feels significant, Destiny 2 is a great game for that because in that game you can go as in depth as you want to."

Edit: my save is good again and i can play the game :)"
23595,"cool game, especially when played with friends"
23596,"Borderlands 2 is a game that shows most of it's value in replayability, even if it has way more than just that, Having a Cast of 6 Playable Characters (2 of those being DLC.), An Amazing Experience all the way, with some weak points with the DLC but overall no major downsides, it certainly is worth the price."
23597,"IMO this is the best borderlands game of the entire series. Has a great story, amazing gameplay, all the characters feel unique and good to play. I would really recommend this game, especially to people who haven't played any of the series yet, as bl2 is a good start. On sale it's like $5, so if you see on sale, get it, it'll be worth it. I have 650 hours and have never disliked the game at any moment. Also duping is in this game and duping is great."

23615,for being an older game (as far as games go) still a good go too.  Love how witty and snaky the characters get. If you enjoy sassy sometimes punny humor you will greatly enjoy the character interactions in this game. definetly meant for a more mature audience or those of us who's humor never surpassed that of a 13 yro boy.

23637,"This series has become my go-to for many moods. When I wish for dark, twisted, and strange humor: This is where I go. When I seek a well-executed First-Person Shooter: This is where I go. When I seek in-depth story that drives me to continue the story: This is where I go. The game is exceedingly well done, and can pull me into hyperfocus like a Badass Psycho on a killing spree, allowing me to neglect my nicotine cravings and work towards my goal of quitting smoking. This game is definitely not for everyone.

If you dislike crude humor, explosions, guns, blood, guts, gore, swearing, guns, more explosions, sexual innuendos, guns, well thought out story arcs, space, explosions, respecting women (it's badass!), annoying robots, space magic, complicated villains, explosions, cars, and the other fine things in life: This game is not for you.

If all of those seem like a good time to you, well... as Mister Torgue would say:

""YOU'RE ****ING BADASS! EXPLOOOOSSSIOOOOONNNNNNSSSSSSS"""

No such thing as the ultimate weapon as you always get more and better weapons. Customization is a fairly limited but it's enough for everyone to look different. Story's good, tons of interesting DLC to keep you interest for several hours, not to mention online experiences (which I can't experience do to rural Australia internet).

Game is good, go buy it.

1-3 second freezing can be fixed by rolling back the game version."

23661,"Easy for beginners like me to pick up and follow. objectives are clear and organizable. Main drawback in my opinion is the amount of time and emotional energy spent on inventory management. Experience running out of ammo and only having guns that use the same kind means enforced diversification, meaning I'm keeping things I don't want ""just in case"" which isn't amaazing for my anxious inclinations. Even that mechanic however, is well presented with comparison features, and reminders from the vending machines that, ""money isn't worth anything if you don't spend it!"" sage wisdom I ignore as I horde things that will never enter my four-gun rotation until the time comes to sell them. Art and voice acting are fun. I would like to see to Claptrap's end however."
23662,"Really funny, combat is super intense, good story, non stop fun"
23663,fun
23664,"Nice story, interesting characters and overall great gameplay with 50 hours story (at least in my case, including all side missions). What else could you want?"
23665,yes
23666,"Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games, with interesting characters, a complex story, and surprisingly good lore. It introduces one of the best video game villains of all time, Handsome Jack. You'll hate him, but you'll also love him. It builds off the previous game and improves on it in every aspect. It creates an amazing story of hardship and struggle to survive on a harsh alien planet, while having amazing gameplay to keep you wanting to play. If you haven't played this game, you are missing out on one of the best games of all time."
23667,Very fun.
23668,I love the game. Its fun and its just a classic looter shooter game. I have fun even though i die a lot. In all i recomend the game.
23669,"Amazing game, there are many quests to do, guns to find, skills to unlock, this game defined the looter shooter genre."
23670,"This game features a good art style, that's the only particularly interesting thing I can say. It's just a game and some fucking guns"
23671,"This is a super duper game, and feels like such an amazing sequel. b1 was already awesome, and b2 just improved every aspect. Nvidia physics also pretty swell

Idk 10/10
I think the sequels/presequels are unworthy"
23672,Realy good game with a good story
23673,Gamers are the most oppressed class in all of Earth.
23674,"this game is good, i played it for a very long time. it may be an older part of the borderlands series, but it is just as good as the newest. it has given me a lot of good times over the year ive had it. Research on the trade of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and Nîmes, France. Gênes, the French word for Genoa, may be the origin of the word ""jeans"". In Nîmes, weavers tried to reproduce jean fabric but instead developed a similar twill fabric that became known as denim, from de Nîmes, meaning ""from Nîmes"". Genoa's jean fabric was a fustian textile of ""medium quality and of reasonable cost"", very similar to cotton corduroy for which Genoa was famous, and was ""used for work clothes in general"". The Genoese navy equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric which could be worn wet or dry.[4][5] Nîmes's ""denim"" was coarser, considered higher quality, and was used ""for over garments such as smocks or overalls"".[6] In 1576 a quantity of ""jean fustians"" arrived into the port of Barnstaple on a vessel from Bristol.[7] Nearly all indigo, needed for dyeing, came from indigo bush plantations in India until the late 19th century. It was replaced by indigo synthesis methods developed in Germany.[8]"

23696,I remember playing this game on my xbox 360 and I thought it was one of the best games I ever played and I still think it is! If i'm gonna be honest it would be better to play with more people but the game is still great either way not gonna lie.
23697,"Literally the greatest looter shooter ever made with an amazing story and cast of characters. Honestly i don't think there's any need for an explanation, if you haven't heard of this game then i question what sort of sad caveman life you've lived and you should just go cry your self to an eternal sleep."

23704,It's a fun to play by yourself and with your friends. I love that you can start over and have multiples of all the characters.
23705,Regarded as the best borderlands game in the franchise and its full of juicy content!
23706,
23707,"Borderlands 2 is one of the first games I started playing on PC, on a 2013 Macbook Pro 13"" screen, running Windows OS, with the game installed on a 7200 external HDD and using a PS3 controller to play. I don't think it seen 30 FPS, but it was when I first came to PC from console so I didn't know the difference to begin with.

The gameplay of BL2 is top tier, I didn't really like the other two pre/post BL2 but this one is a gem. 250 hours of pure hectic shooting, creating insane builds and eventually modding the fuck out of it for even more fun. Tiny Tina's DLC is without a doubt the best DLC out of any game I've played and eventually playing Borderlands 2 on a real PC was a treat. co-op or solo was always extremely fun and the dialogue + NPCs make this game truely enjoyable."

Simply one of the best all around looter shooters to play with friends or solo.

This game has excellent writing from Anthony Burch and stars one of the best villians in video game history.

Get this game and all the DLC and you won't regret it."
23725,yope spots
23726,"At some point they made it impossible to play while connected to the internet.
If I'm online the game freezes for 1-3 sec, every 5-10 sec. When I'm offline it works fine.

I think they deliberately sabotaged a working game, and stuffed adds into so you would give up and buy Borderlands 3. After this and the reports of abused employees I'm never [i] buying [/i] anything from Gearbox again.

This is by all means my favorite game of all time. It hosts my favorite character, Gaige, and has some of the best gunplay and RPG elements in a looter-shooter you can get. The story is one of the bests stories our there for an FPS, and of course has one of the best villians in Video Games, if not ever."

23732,best borderlands game in the series!!!
23733,"If the argument that people who buy video games should get an hour worth of value for every dollar they spend is valid to you, then this game will go above and beyond that. Its very refreshing to play this game and not have to worry about consequences of making bad choices that negatively effect my future game play when i could be rewarded exponentially more for doing a new play through on a second or different character to get up to the point i made that poor choice just for a do over. There's so many factors that will make playing through the same stories again and again have the sense of freedom and versatile variety players rarely get to see in big games that have such rigid scripting that you have to follow to a T or risk crashing the entire game. Yes the game is cel shaded and some people don't like anime or what ever but you cant have everything and good graphics are a sacrifice most people are willing to make for a more fun seemingly endless open world game, Skyrim is a prime example of this. As someone who has over 2 and a half thousand hours I feel that my opinion on the game is well knowledgeable to be talking about it. It is not for everyone though and can be a bit confusing you have to learn the game mechanics if you want to play uvhm or tvhm for that matter. tldr all and all 4.5 outta 5 imo.
"
23734,"A rare gem that has a 5/5 narrative and 5/5 gameplay mixture

The story is GOOD, with jokes put in where they fit rather shoved down our throats. And a villain worth of a bullet to the face (RIP Face McShooty)

The gameplay is just good shoot-bullet-sponge, with a nice varied amount of guns (like, very varied, <3 Maliwan). And getting the best loot feels very satisfying

5/5 (really 11/10)"
23735,yeah

23746,"UMA MERDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
o desenvolver teve a ideia na privada, pq n é possível para quem gosta desta merda vai se tratar seu pau no cu"
23747,"FUN THOUGH WAY OVERHYPED, SMALL MAPS AND QUITE LIMITED EVEN WITH DLCS.

I will give a break down of the game below- Its enjoyable, its theme is top-notch and its go a great sense of humour to it. Imagine the same theme to suicide squad in the sense of art and humour. It says its open world...Sort of-- though its not as vast as fallout games. There are side quests that are optional however these quests are only playable once you complete certain levels of the main story line- speaking of- the main story line is luke warm at best and not very interesting. So for a FPS its great, unique theme and fairly easy to get the hand of. If you prefer more story driven games then I would give this a pass. Also if you think that you get to travel around finding secret vaults (i thought that with the story being about vault hunters- then you will be disappointed. There are'nt any secret locations or vaults to find.)
OVERALL GRADING
Story line- 6/10. Its not amazing and there are not twists and turns- its very linear.
GAMEPLAY- 9/10- Shoot stuff, drive rovers and loot. That is it basically- but its good fun.
TECH- 10/10- Not a single crash!! And I have a low end laptop- its runs smoothly, though it takes about 8 mins to load at the beginning.
GRAPHICS- 10/10- If you like the telltale art work then its great- Some really creative and fun (maybe a little childish) illustrators here. 
AUDIO- 10/10
COST-10/10 or 2/10--I got the handsome bundle for £11.00 (original was £110.00) BARGAIN- and I am ecstatic about that price. HOWEVER-- if I was to pay normal cost for the base game and all the DLC's then I would be livid- the normal cost is waaaaaaay over priced...way.
REPLAY VALUE- 7/10.

In conclusion- Maps are restricting and small so exploring is limited. Not what I was expecting--i was thinking it was going to be more Fallout like but its not at all. DLC's dont add very much and I am not sure if they should come in packs rather than individually and the normal cost is horrific. However if you get this on sale, you like to dumb down and just shoot things and you are not expecting a clever and breathtaking story then its great fun. I really like this game, I am glad I got it, but its not the best game I have played this year and I would not say I am hooked."

The Good
-Elemental weapons have been completely retooled and are now VASTLY more useful
-No more Scythids. They were way too easy.
-There's actually a story now. A really good story, at that.
-More DLC than you can shake a boomstick at.
-The character classes are a lot more fun to explore.
-Weapon proficiencies are a thing of the past. The gunzerker can use exclusively sniper rifles, the assassin can use exclusively shotguns, vice versa, the possibilities are limitless.
-[spoiler]Face McShooty.[/spoiler] You'll know when you see him.
-E-Tech replaces Eridian Weapons. And it KICKS ASS
-[spoiler]MR. TORGUE HIGH-FIVE FLEXINGTON! WOOHOOHOO!!!![/spoiler]

The Bad
-Combat Rifles have fallen from grace: They're either too impractical or just too weak.
-That you can only get 3 more backpack slots for exponentially increasing amounts of hard-to-find Eridium is kinda bullcrappy.
-The occasional cheap enemy, like the giant Fire Threshers or the RPG Loaders
-Too few quests from Dr. Zed. Not really a problem, just thought I'd point it out.
-Artifacts are now confusing to use.

Tip: If a quest seems to difficult, just come back to it later after you've leveled up once or twice. Don't get obsessed with something you can't finish."
23759,Interesting

23763,"Probably my favorite FPS on the PC. Fun gunplay, fun levels, characters aren't *too* annoying, decent story. High replayability because of the various skill trees + 4 (or 6 w/ DLC) characters to choose from + randomized loot."

23775,Essentially an upgrade in every way from its predecessor. Magnificent way to casually kick back with friends and just shoot stuff.

Uninstalled cause it's just annoying me with the crashes and taking up space."

23778,Easy game play. Game not resource intensive. Could do with a little graphics upgrade
23779,"its okay, I say its good for when it was made but most of the bosses were underwhelming. I thought there would be like 1 or 2 stages of the final boss but he just kinda died, wasn't really that hard. I have the goty, I dont even want to do most of the dlc. I could see how you would be able to enjoy it if you hadn't played any kind of looter shooter before-hand."

23788,"Better than 3 by miles. Sad I have to say that. A really fun game, alone or with friends. Amazing story, atmosphere, guns, it's just good. If you don't have it yet, get it!"
23789,I would reccomnd  lots of fun
23790,"It's just great. It's super fun the first time, and even more fun the tenth. All of the characters are fun and interesting to play with multiple styles for each, and the game is super chunky with content with all the DLC that there is for it now, which is also very much a good idea to get. You get more content, more level cap increases, the whole shabang. One of them even lets you skip the rigamaroll of leveling and lets you get to 30, and if that isn't good enough for you there's save editors too, in case you're just that impatient.

Get it. Never played BL1, never played BL3, barely played BL PreSequel, would highly recommend BL2."

23834,I've finished this game before on Ps3 and Ps4. If you are looking for a fun game that doesnt take itself too serious then give this a try. I recommend getting the GOTY edition to get all dlcs etc. which just makes it a fuller experience.I highly recommend playing with your friend/sibling/waifu.Couch Co-Op really enhances the experience.10/10I

23839,Its ight
23840,"These days the combat/loot system isn't anything new or amazing but the humour/story in the game still holds its ground (reason I managed to finish the game).Conclusion if  you came hear looking for gameplay, newer games like gunfire reborn just dives into the action without the needed storyline and if you just like loot shooters then there's always borderlands 3 (however I heard the story is quite dudu).If you want story and an example of a good video game antagonist then look no further than this game."
23841,"I wasn't one for shooters until this game. This is one of the best shooters I have played. It isn't just a shooter though, as someone who enjoys a good RPG/MMO, the game/story as a whole is witty and entertaining with consistently entertaining progression through quests, awesome fast-paced combat, and a lot of play style customization. It's a blast to play by yourself or partied up with some friends. I know that this game won't be for everyone, but to anyone who has been considering it: I HIGHLY recommend this game!!"
23842,its fun its good its now a clasic.
23843,havent played yet on pc but played it on ps4. decent game got some humour you can smack your knee to while mowing lads down
23844,"I don't get it, why it's so acclaimed. I've tried to start a few times and just keep giving up, it's so dull. It's like a first person shooter but you have to shoot the enemies 100 times. Not sure why we care about the story..?"
23845,Spoderlands 2!!!
23846,"The tone is crass, the colors are bright, the gunplay is tight, and the game feels right.Why don't I recommend it?Because this game is a time sink. It's shallow. I've played over 200 hours of it, on multiple platforms and saves, having played through the game multiple times. And I don't remember almost anything about it. You'll be asked to fiddle with numbers and muddle through a bunch of options. The game itself isn't much, but if you've got a good friend you don't mind getting silly with, you can have a very very good time.But I'd advise against seeking it out. All Borderlands 2 will ask you to do is click on things until they die. And that's it, for as long as you can stomach. At one of the most uncertain times of my life, this game anchored my closest friendship. It gave us a simple task to complete. We had a sense of progress that kept us coming back, and it was simple enough that it never really strained our communication, and it was bombastic enough that it kept us from ever having to think about our feelings or our lives. This game, like so much amerikan media, is at its best when it overwhelms your senses and lets you forget who you are.If you're curious about the Borderlands franchise, this is by far the best game. I don't know how to say that except it feels true. The first game is a clunky mess, the pre sequel feels a little stale, and Borderlands 3 is a shameless cash grab. So was this game! But this was before the 'looter shooter' became one of the staples of the shooter genre.My take? Borderlands 2 is safe, in the way that teenage boys going bodies is safe. It's touch without tenderness, violence without impact, reward without attachment. It's an experiment in addictive design, and a terrifying blueprint for what is to come."
23847,Incredible. One of the best games ever! Seriously an amazing piece of art that gives hours of content and things to do.
23848,very fun highly recommended to at least look at it
23849,"Don't recommend for children, but its my personal favorite game."

23852,"Great game, had it since release and have purchased it on every device i've had that's compatible. Is the best game in the borderlands franchise"
23853,"Good game, great story line and one I plan to spend a lot more time on."
23854,Yes very old but good game i like better than the others :D
23855,yes
23856,It is a very good co op game
23857,Great game and unique style! Best of the Borderlands series. Would recommend to anyone.
23858,got jipped
23859,Fun with friends
23860,"TLDR: Great solo or co-op looter shooter. Story is fun, and side missions will keep you busy for many hours. Well worth the money for the base game. I'd also highly recommend the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC. I have 600+ hours so it's been great value for money.

Pros:
-Cell graphics art (I like - ymmv)
-Loads of humor
-Wide range of weapons and other equipment
-Good range of characters you can play as (Don't just select the default Commando - read them all and pick one you like! Siren and Gunzerker were also fun)
-Great story and NPC characters
-'SPLOSIONS!!!!!!

Cons:
-You get stuck on things everywhere. This will drive you insane until you just accept it as a feature and learn to compensate
-No endgame plan, so they resorted to the usual ""prestige"" crap. No, I do not want to play the same story again another X times in varying difficulties.
-There is Normal Mode, True Vault Hunter Mode, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. UVHM is a bullet-sponge nightmare of epic proportions. Guns improve exponentially as you level from 50 onwards, but this also means that you're basically having to change your entire load-out every couple of levels just to keep up with the scaling difficulty of the enemies. It's a tiresome slog by that point.
-Old game so you'll need to organise a party yourself if you want to play with anyone online."
23861,i have played the game for arond 1 hour and im enjoying the funny puns and the cool wepons an fighting this game isnt super easy but isnt too hard i love the game
23862,"Art, Just Art, I have nothing bad to say on this game."
23863,Regret not playing this game earlier because of how much fun I could have had not just alone but with my friends.
23864,"Even to this day I still come back to this amazing game. My steam library says 270 hours but I´ve probably played at least double the amount. Fantastic story but also amazing characters both playable and npc. Can't recommend this game enough, the expansions are all fantastic as well especially the Tiny Tina one."
23865,"Borderlands 2 is Borderlands 2, lots of fun with friends, probably less fun without."
23866,yep
23867,Though i hate art style like this its pretty fun game. I will be honest i wouldnt of bought it but it came free with my GPU.
23868,"Guns, puns, death, love."
23869,the best game ive ever played
23870,"Borderlands 2 is awesome, just buy it and you'll see what I mean."
23871,Best Borderlands.
23872,Claptrap OP
23873,"Fire ass game, worth every penny"
23874,"Like, I'ts a game. You wont solve cancer playing it but time wont drag as much as.. like, Regular ol' existing, you know, without Borderlands. I think.You see, I've only ever had a Life with Borderlands;and now I'm so addicted to it.yeah...But in the good news my Hero-ion icky stuff as well as my magic powder, think's called M.ethamph, Well both those addictions got nothing on my level 70 Mecromancer, so my real addictions haven't been an issue since I started playing;See,Can't interact with your dealers if you never leave the house. *Taps noggin implying intelligence while oblivious to the self destructive nature of almost all pursuits intended to merely ""making the time pass"" as believe it or not, it does that by itself.Listen, If you find yourself seeking ways to make sheer existence more bearable like day by day, I mean it, please, I mean it I'm there with you, you can get help. Seriously, That's 100% me rn too. Currently post mental breakdown living with family while I get my shit together. I didn't think I needed help, but if just living is too much, even just sometimes, I hope you talk to someone. You'd be seriously surprised how not fake everyone is if you think the way I do at least. The love for you truly is bigger than your accomplishments, you're innately worth living.And if that's too hard, too bad PLEASE gimme a call. But also, only push yourself as far as you think you aren't expected to, and still can, as I know how hard the stupid easiest things can be.No matter what we tell ourselves, or think others think about us, you by your very existence, I promise, you are not a failure. You are never a failure. Thats like saying 2 + 2 equals 'my love for dry humor'.You cant be something that just happens, and then time keeps going.That failure will be a ripple in the causal cascade that is humanity, and trust me in retrospect it will be as easily forgettable a ""failure"" as the world see's all your failures. Think about how when someone becomes so successful their failures actually do become things people obsess over, and it drives them crazy. Appecriate while you can how little everyone knows about how to even function as a a human, all while pretending nothing is out of the ordinary. Personally I just find it hilarious at this point.So why spend all time thinking bout the past failures and not what does exist, what you can affect, the future. C'mon.You're a human,we grow,we fail.And that's how we human. Admittedly, It does suck that often the failing is required to the facilitate the growing, but we have a warped view on success and how to be happy that media only worsens. But again, if it feels like your trapped in a loop of failure. Best way to Contact me is prob on Insta @ashergreenwilkins and DM me and we can talk. I'll give my number there but don't want that posted all over the internet you know. Just know It'll be alright, I mean you're feeling better and from reading a review for an old ass game, trust me, there are more than just you that feel this way. I'm not saying this like I know the answer and I know it'll get better, I'm saying it cause I want it to be true. For me, for you, but I wont lie, life is tough and it might get tougher. You just have to believe, not in any specific god or ideology, though that's useful, but without one you have to create your own belief as to what life is to you, for you. Why you're here. Is it to play Borderlands 2?Well for me it is rn so I'll talk to you later when you depressed bro and gals hmu, Again, Insta = @ashergreenwilkins (lol straight sound like I'm plugging merch or something :)O yeah and TLDR: I need to talk to my therapist. (9/10) *would be a 10/10 if I learned something like Pre-Calculus or Differential Equations along the way, just something gimme something 2K. Oh, wait...OH yeah, just remembered who owns 2K, uhhhhhhmmmmm yeah... Never mind."
23875,yes
23876,This game if fire you are gay if you think something else/
23877,Loads of fun!!  The story is funny and just challenging enough.  Best if played with friends!!
23878,Fantastic game
23879,is a good game
23880,"Pog, but 1 thing that bothers me tho: Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is a pain in the fucking ass, even if you have slag weapons, you get fucking 2 shot, even if your playing with other people, its still going to be dark souls difficulty."
23881,fvcking flawless game!
23882,it's still fun in 2020
23883,Love this game but I wish they would have made different classes from the first. The class system was improved greatly from the original and the new Badass rank giving leveling more depth. With the DLC you get some variation from the first and the Psycho class may be my new favorite after playing and the Mechromancer is neat too. Definitely a lot of replayability in this game and it can be fun to play through with each of the different classes.
23884,It's just a great overall FPS game.
23885,"i have a shotgun with a scope that I use like a burst rifle, AND it talks.

what more do you want"
23886,Awesome
23887,"i especially enjoyed the mission ""shoot me in the face""."
23888,best game ive ever played in my life

23891,"Не покупайте, играйте пиратку - багов меньше будет"
23892,"It's a fun game to play with my family in mulitplayer. Me, my husband, and our kids play this together."
23893,"Shoot shoot bullet bullet gun 

Zap pow zap zap pow"
23894,Everything you can expect from a looter shooter game is this and a tad bit more with great story awesome characters you'll love playable and unplayable and shit ton of weapons to choose from
23895,Very epic... :^)
23896,awesome game
23897,"[h1]It's Borderlands, Man[/h1]
What more is there to say?"
23898,It combines elements of different genres into one fun time! This adventure packed FPS is sure to bring some fun to your gaming experience.
23899,"Really solid, even to this day!

If you aren't spoiled by 3 yet, pick it up, it's worth your time."
23900,good game playing it for the third time
23901,"Are you alone? - This game is for you
Are you with friends? - This game is for you
Very good game with no limits."
23902,It's OK to take your mind off things.
23903,Handsome Jackass
23904,"VERY GOOD
"
23905,"dont mind my review time hours, i just got it on pc, but this game built my childhood good shit"
23906,"Dude, it's Borderlands 2 and the game is like 8 years old. Buy the whole game and all the DLC for like $20. Play it with your 200 steam friends who probably all have it too. It's fun and it's famous... get it."
23907,"Very good game. Best of the Borderlands series (BL1 BL:PS, BL2, Tales, and BL3) so far. 
The DLC is also really fun. 
Story is great. Humor is good. Items (gun, shield, grenades, etc) are cool. 
Even better in multiplayer with friends."
23908,Good Shooter. Unique style. Funny Dialogue. Leveling up and boosting stats. Fun game. Play with friends if you can.
23909,It's so fucking good please play it
23910,"Wonderful game, but I'm not sure what happened but I can no longer get it to run. It keeps crashing at bad moments, and then reverting to what seems to be an older build of the game. I say that because suddenly some new features (like skipping the opening cut scene) disappear. Reinstalling again and I'll change my review if moving to a different folder works better."
23911,best played with friends
23912,cool
23913,I've loved borderlands for a long time now but I only played on xbox. This version on PC is so much better in every way.
23914,It's my second platform playing this game.  Definitely worth it.
23915,"i fight hardstyle in this game, like HARDSTYle man come up and i kick hiya killl hima nd take gun and kill his child, i do flip and sometime even kick and then i win the game- im serious when i say sometimes i even kick a douchebag for looking at me wrong way o right way if i just feel like hardstyle fighting
"
23916,Played BL2 on xbox 360 for over 1200 hours and it truly is one of the best games ever made.

23919,"Masterpiece with great story, characters, builds and a lot of replay value! Better with friends but even solo this game is great!"
23920,kinda pog.
23921,"It's one of the best looter-shooters I've played despite the age of the game. It still holds up to this day, especially if you play with friends. What's more, it's dirt cheap nowadays, so don't sleep on it."
23922,gg

"
23935,This game is terrific fun.
23936,its fine.
23937,This may be the perfect game.
23938,better than the 3rd
23939,"Broken crossplatform multiplayer after a couple of years after the final release, just to add new lagging textures, one of the worst dlc and ads"
23940,"Action packed, funny, original, irreverent, and challenging: the perfect concoction for endless gaming adventure."
23941,"great game

23948,game's good.

"
23950,shoot guy hunt vault
23951,its good
23952,"Absolutely amazing game with loads of content and, if i even have to mention that, one of the best villains in video game history.

Besides that, ton of endgame content, so that you can easily spend 30+ hours on a single character, grinding for a specific item not taken into account"
23953,"Guns fun, Game fun"
23954,is best game. is good
23955,"Get friend Joe in game gg ez level 80 ultimate Hoarder kills everything on screen even my game my desktop and my and his pcs rofl too ezy get gud tryhard ninja 360 noscopes crash not only my game but my whole pc not even m,y legs my friend joe has left me cripple With what he has done $19 hyperion card who wants"
23956,"Borderlands 2 is a step up from the cult classic that is borderlands 1, tho I find it hard to suggest if you ever wanna full commit to the end game as it slowly pushes you toward certain necessities to progress and less freedom in your arsenal 

It’s definitely great for casual session with friends through 1-2 playthroughs together and probably offer you plenty of fun moments

Fairly decent 7/10
+’s Fun,Guns and Co-op friendly 
-‘s poor endgame balance, some level spikes and could have improved gunplay

In summary definitely buy as part of the handsome collection as it’s a great value offer"
23957,"Great story, great gameplay. Funny and enticing."
23958,"dont buy if you wanna play multiplayer , cuz it goes on a glitchy loop and never connectsss"
23959,Been a long time favorite.
23960,"very good game
especially good if you have friends
sadly, i dont
8.5/10"
23961,very nice
23962,good game
23963,Absolutely amazing game!
23964,natsaa
23965,great game with awesome story line and amazing guns
23966,"This game is amazing, I love it. It's my favorite game in the Borderlands Series. There are multiple character's to choose from, each character can be customized, so many guns, gun parts are randomized (you could find a pistol that does shock damage and then find the pistol again but it's fully automatic with fire damage) I've played this game for hours on the Xbox 360. I highly recommend this game if you want to have fun."
23967,fuck me everyone gasses this game but its shite. it looks shite too. everymans like omg theres so many guns and the story is great but they just saw it got game of the year in like 2005 and gass it up. its fuckin boring. if you want variety go buy some doritos you sweaty little mountain dew goblin
23968,"chill game, funny"
23969,Loved every bit of it.
23970,Best game in the Series.
23971,"have a RUINED day!

23976,....
23977,"enemy: lives
me: ooga booga, ima shoot ya
[i]*intestines fly around* *shiny loot everywhere*[/i]
oh yeah, story was ok, i think."
23978,"funny, and is some fun to play, but quickly you start to notice its very clunky, somewhat unpolished, and overall feels like it doesnt fully accomplish what it was going for. the gunfights are repetitive and the movement is very simple and floaty and boring, and it doesnt feel like it fits together with the map design."
23979,"An 8 year old game, BorderLands 3 released exactly an year back, but still holds its own. This game does not have PVP, but it has enough fun to keep you hooked. The only thing I hate about this game is that the Legendary Gear is a bit difficult to get and sometimes involves a bit of grind, but overall, a great game with good campaign and neat DLCs. Go ahead and give it a go and you will not be disappointed!"
23980,"Good, yes."
23981,FUN FUCKIN FUCKTASTIC FUCKERY OF A GAME FUCK MY ASS THIS FUCKIN GAME FUCKEN WAS BALLER AS FUCK.
23982,"Pretty fun, pick this up if it's on sale."
23983,"Amazing game, so much fun
"
23984,Best in the Franchise.  Tons of ren playability.
23985,"I played Borderlands 1 into the ground, and I played all the DLCs and enjoyed them alot. With that said, Borderlands 2 blows all that out of the water! BL2 is truly a masterpiece. The added content only makes it even better."
23986,good game play it now
23987,"I’m glad Borderlands 2 got Epic Games Store Integration! Keep politics OUT of Borderlands! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! If Sanctuary citizens knew what was best and really wanted to be free they wouldn’t be so violent. CHINA #1!! EPIC TRULY IS EPIC!!!

24007,good yes
24008,games boring zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
24009,"Funny, violent, stylish. I enjoyed it."
24010,"one of the best story experiences you will ever play. handsome jack is probably one of the greatest characters of all time. Gearbox made a game that shows what all 4 player Coop games should be, making all the classes interesting whether it be the base game characters or the dlc characters. everybody in this game is full of personality as well as the landscape and weapons. the proactive bane is legit one of the best guns in any game ever. having a gun that makes you as slow as a snail and does nothing but scream when you shoot it is just amazing. if you have friends to play with this and the other 2 games are some of the best choices you have. if i had to pick a favorite this would be it. an easy 10/10."
24011,2020 still playing. nuff said.

24017,A masterpiece
24018,Its a fun game with interesting graphics and many different creatures to shoot!
24019,I have so much time on so many platforms in this game. Why are you looking at reviews when it's probably cheap enough? Just get it a play!
24020,An amazing gun game that has a very interesting storyline.
24021,wow girl what those guns do? kill? thats awesomeeeeeee
24022,VERY fun
24023,My favorite game of all time. I've played it through multiple times on multiple consoles. Giving PC a spin now.
24024,best looter shooter out there

24027,great game
24028,Yes. Just yes. good yes. yes
24029,kILL all the things!
24030,"Borderlands 2 is still one of the best games ever developed, but this port of it is pretty rough, and the most current Mac and Linux versions aren't particularly stable. The 4K update pack doesn't work on Mac or Linux. Cross-platform play is still broken after a February 2020 update to the PC version, and Aspyr today announced that the Mac and Linux versions are dead. If the game is abandonware, the page should reflect this. Allowing Aspyr/Gearbox to pretend that the game is actively supported is false advertisement. 

If you're buying for the single-player experience, you'll love it - provided you didn't want it in 4K if you're not a PC, and can handle a bit of stuttering and occasionally reinterpreted input. This is still one of maybe two or three games in the world that made me cry for the beauty of its story. The worlds and the characters are well developed and beautifully evoked. The weapons aren't quite as wacky as (say) Ratchet and Clank, but the upper tiers are still interesting enough to allow fun and unique playstyles.

If you're buying for multiplayer, you'd better make sure you're all on the same operating system before buying - there is not now and apparently never will be again any cross-platform multiplayer. If, like me, you bought it when this was touted as a major feature, you may be rather justifiably annoyed. As multiplayer Borderlands is one of the best things about Borderlands, this is a deep shame, not only on the companies involved, but also for the players new and old who have not been able to enjoy playing with each other for months now and apparently never will again."
24031,"Really fun game, good difficulty, fun to play with friends. The skills of each of the in-game characters are balanced and really fun to use. One of my favourite games despite being 8 years old."
24032,lol
24033,"One of the best story games I've ever played. Rich Story, Co-Op, Plenty of Guns. If you need a story game, you've come to the right place."
24034,get it
24035,Loving it on Macbook 2020. Graphics could be better. lots of fun for a fiver.
24036,"Despite what it says on the product page, PC/Mac online crossplay is currently NOT possible. Bought this on sale to online co-op with a buddy of mine. Based on a general search and the official requirements listed, PC/Mac crossplay was a listed feature. Turns out, Gearbox or whomever they hired put out a patch early in 2020 that broke that. As of March 2020 it's still not fixed with no future patch in sight. If it does support PC/Mac crossplay, that's fine. But that change should be reflected on official pages so consumers know what they're buying and not getting fleeced."
24037,"Its fun, its cheeky, and it doesnt take itself too seriously. A great game for a challenge as well as a laugh
"
24038,"TL:DR: Half Life: Alyx is like an amazing soup with a large portion of ingredients coming from the prievious 2 installments with a dose of Portal 2 and a hint of Bioshock for extra good measure to make the VR experience something unseen to this point. I can't recommend this game enough for anyone the next big thing.

After completing this game for a second time I can honestly recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. Visually on it's own this game is a sight to behold but put it in VR and the world becomes so much more alive. Gameplay while teleport jumping is an odd choice as well as the lack of melee weapons and sometimes slow locomotion the game makes up for it by having new enemies around every corner that make fights tense and panic inducing especially without something like a trusty crowbar to help you on your journey. On that note I can't describe how enjoyable it is being able to interact with about 95% of the objects in the game and while you can sometimes feel that 5% the majority makes up for it tenfold. Achievments and Resin make alternate playthroughs enaging by changing up what upgrades you have at what time as well as creating unique challenges which reminds me a lot of Bioshock especially when combined with the insane horror-esque areas in the game. As for the story well I best keep that hidden for new players but all i'll say is that the humor from portal 2 returns in a more fitting manor as well as story moments which will make your jaw drop or send chills down your spine as soon as the game starts up. As for my more deeper thoughts
seeing city 17 in a new perspective is quite honestly amazing as well as the vorts and righter sunny segments. Jeff is an amazing example of expanding an idea in interesting ways that I haven't seen in a long time. Going up to the vault and seeing it become destroyed in front of you is intense but not as intense as the Gman and the ending giving me pure joy every time I play it.
while VR is a bit expensive right not with a VR ready pc and headset going from $500-$2000 it may seem like a lot but VR is home to hundreds of cool games with 20-30 equaling this game in length and sometimes surpassing it in experience (for half the price no less) Half life: Alyx is a sight to behold and can only be played to believed."
24039,"This game is so much fun, I'm still on my first playthrough and the only issue I have is it forces you to go through the base game like 3 times before is feasible to do the dlc reasonably"
24040,"i fucking love this game, yeah i highly recommend it"
24041,"The selling point for the game is ""phat loot"" but when everything that isnt a Tediore weapon feels the same I loose my drive for the series."
24042,"Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary is not available on GNU/Linux.

Neither is the Ultra-HD texture pack (not that I care about that since I use 1080p).

We're still missing the corresponding base game update too.

Nice work, Aspyr & Gearbox, whichever of you is responsible for the lack of updates.

24043,Well old classic. Loved this game on release and still love it.
24044,"Great game, the first one was better with more weapon diversity and better gore, now they censored it for the pussy ausies.....
I recommend it still, its really fun :)"
24045,"I dedicated this summer to playing games that many regard as classics, and I heard plenty of good things about this game. I wasn't let down.
Borderlands 2 is a wacky looter-shooter set on the techno-barbarian world of Pandora. Fight against the oppressive reign of Hyperion, a clean on the outside, rotten on the inside corporation that's set its roots in every grain of sand on the planet.
The writing can be summarized as hilarious AND profound at the same time, and the gameplay - for an older game - is engaging and fun. A slew of humans, animals, and robots with a slew of guns and explosives on top of that. I totally recommend it."
24046,Guns
24047,ONE OF MY FAVE FPS. NICE AND HUMOROUS GAME. LOVE BORDERLANDS FRANCHISE
24048,One of the Best game on steam
24049,Better than Borderlands 3
24050,An excellent FPS with good story and a great deal of in-game entertainment!
24051,nice
24052,"Used to play this game with my best friend on 360. He had it and I dint so he would beat the game and wed start a new character almost every time I came over. When we pre-ordered the pre-sequel, we binge played this for 3 days straight up to release date. 

I also got the game on a crappy old laptop on a steam I lost long ago. Somehow, I beat the game on that old thing. Eventually, I got it on PSVita. Lets not talk about that one. I played on PS3 ans the handsome collection on xbox one as well. Its rare that a game can make me keep coming back to it but Borderlands 2 has a uniqueness and charm that I cannot explain, but cannot deny. 

The DLC as well, absolutely worth it. All a unique adventure to themselves, and with the surplus of mod tools and the simplicity of making your own save just to explore these levels is part of what keeps me coming back. My friend and I play this game together to this day on occasion, and I think it is a testament to how fun couch co-op can be.

TLDR; Excellent game for solo or co-op play. Definitelly worth the buy at full price, with DLC, but has constant sales as well. A good Timesink and a good time."
24053,"STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUND! HU HA HUHAHAHAHAHA

Original borderlands will always be better IMO, but thats because i kinda feel they went too hard with the internet meme reffs, and although they made Handsome jack a effortlessly hated character, his humor was off, left me in a constant state of ""good god STFU"" all in all its another great game, screw gearbox for originally releasing BL3 on Epic, as if they didnt learn anything from what metro did with exodus, glad they did in a way, gave me more time to knock trophies out in BL2, get it and forget it, play the series and enjoy and grab the DLC while you're at it."
24054,its pretty good aye
24055,"one of the best FPS for its creativity and gameplay.  still fun after 5 years.

THE best co-op FPS EVER"
24056,fuun jame but ther gun

24058,its ok
24059,"fun game is nice
got it for free"
24060,"109 hours on it. 100% recommend this game and it's DLCs. Buy them when on sale since this franchise goes on sale all the time for like 5 to 10 dollars. Story is good, its DLCs stories are insanely hilarious and good.
Pros:
1. 10/10 story, graphics, DLCs.
2. So many WEAPONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3. Didn't encounter any bugs.
4. Comedic characters are sooooo funny.
Cons:
1. Really non. It is not a perfect game by any means but its pretty freaking close."
24061,GOD TIER GAME PLAY TILL DEATH OR UR GAY

24075,h
24076,Great fun. Fantastic DLCs. Get this game.
24077,great
24078,"I have had this game practically since it was released and i have never gotten the only character i play to max level. this is due to me losing access to internet and the cloud so i would be forced to start over and over. This used to not be an issue, but otherwise, i would highly recommend this game. I absolutely love it. Though if anyone could help me find a way to keep all of my progress even when i have no internet access, I would be extremely appreciative."
24079,very good gayme
24080,it be good
24081,"I dont even know where to start with this game. The countless hours and hours and hours ive spent playing this game, yet it never gets too repetetive. Many great memories playing this game ever since i was a kid, and here i am again now 18 years old playing again so i can get to level 80."

24083,"Where do I start with this work of art that i have on record 2100 hours on its a amazing game, this game was my best friend with 3 years with so much to do that i think even if you dont like looter shooters you should play it for both the story and the quirky humor. This game has large and vast biomes if it be the frozen tundra at the start or the deserts later on and moutains, and don't forget all the dlc I think you should buy every piece of dlc besides skins because those are well skins they offer no benefit just scratch that cosmetic you may have. This game also has fun and challenging bosses and miny bosses throught and even secret easter eggs that even a include suprisingly a minecraft easter egg, but anyways if you havent ever played this game just try it, this game has brought me such joy and I want to see others enjoy it. Thanks for reading.

24084,"Handsome Jack makes it fun. Liked the desert setting of the first part better, but it's fine overall."
24085,Very fun and very funny game while also being a game that you can put tons of hours in grinding. Amazing DLC and interesting characters.

24088,"I haven't found borders yet 

Lands either

5/10"
24089,is good game
24090,This is honestly my favorite game of all time the charaters and story are so amazing i lost days on this game man this is a game i never got tired of playing and i still havent done all there is to do if you have a decent pc and are looking for a solid game to hold you down until you can save for another one this game is perfect over the days i poured into the game my steam library grew but i always came back to this game ive beat the game before when i had it on ps3 but i never got the play the dlc until i bought it on steam
24091,Never had more fun looking at orange
24092,"First and foremost, I felt the first borderlands was quite underwhelming and a bit shallow on the story end. But BL2, TPS and TALES, really has me hooked into this series now. BL2 is a complete staircase above the original in terms of fun, comedy and game play. The loot system was a turn off for me in the first game, but I've warmed up to it, and revel in finding new weapons in damn near every container, bandit and bullymong I come across. ClapTrap isn't such a nuisance anymore, which is saying a lot.  I could compare this game to BL1 all day, and I'd have an essay with all of my gripes. To keep it short, It's essentially a more enjoyable version of what I expected BL1 to be. Above and beyond the pale of shooters like Call Of Dookie and Rainbow Suxass. Buy this game while it's on sale right now, or get it before Biden destroys the economy. It's totally worth it."
24093,"My favorite game of all time. I have played Borderlands 2 a lot on console and recently got it on pc. A masterpiece of a game. Great writing and humor, lore, lovable and memorable characters, great story, along with some fun gameplay and amazing co-op. If you haven't played it yet for some reason, play it now. It is worth the full price and it is worth any sale price you could find. Quite honestly $20 is a steal for a game of this quality. 9.5/10"
24094,game gud
24095,all what you want from a lootershooter
24096,cool
24097,I love this game. Hands down best borderlands. 11/10
24098,It's Great!!!
24099,"292 Hours spent playing one game...best not to think about it too much, did nothing to improve the world during this time other than maybe not be present in it....one of the very few games I have played over and over again with various friends and to this day have not got bored of it. Such a shame this one appears to be the pinnacle of their game franchise to date....worth every penny on a deal, time well spent as far as I am concerned."
24100,Yes
24101,"awsome

24123,Hilariously demented fun
24124,I say its a little better than the newest one borderlands 3 and you should give it a try and add ons are cheap and you can replay alot!
24125,"this game is pretty PogChamp
"
24126,"Weird, but fun."
24127,Really Love it! Sniper machine Gun.
24128,if your going to get borderlands 2 i suggest you get the dlc since it increases the joy you'll have when playing.
24129,amazing game...
24130,Not gonna lie at first I hated the graphics but once you get past that and really dig deeper into the story and the world the story takes place in you really begin to see the great game that Borderlands 2 really is. I was looking for a game like Warfare and this honestly felt very close. I would recommend that if the graphics don't really vibe with you at first play the game for a couple of hours before deciding if you want to give it up. I promise it will be well worth it. Also as a tip don't try to hord guns you don't need or think you will need later because you will always find better ones. Good luck
24131,"No inventes pinche juegazo, claro que lo recomiendo, se puede incluso hacer farmeo de items."
24132,is fun
24133,"This game has a lot to bring to the table---fun characters, dialogue, missions, even the flavor text is filled to the brim with personality and references. It's a shooter that plays well and has a fantastic sense of humor. While the game has a plethora of purchasable DLC, the game is more than complete in its base form. I have the game and most of the DLC and I have well over 200 hours on it (even if some of those were me wandering away to get food). The game knows exactly what tone it is aiming for and does it well. Overall, it's a very solid entry in the series and a decent starting point, as knowledge of Borderlands 1 is not really needed to enjoy this game to the fullest. I would recommend this game to just about anyone."
24134,"LOVE THIS GAME! Fun game play, great humor, awesome villain. I highly recommend."
24135,best game ive ever playedperiod
24136,"A lot of stuff to do, a bit repetitive but storyline is great. Definitely play with friends though."
24137,great game for killing time
24138,"Really fun game that I regret sleeping on. Story was entertaining and detailed, all the side quests and missions felt very hand-crafted and not generic, and most importantly the loot was varied and meaningful. Multiple classes to choose from, each with three skill trees that you can choose (and change between freely) each offering very different gameplay and tactics. 

So many interesting weapons and grenades with cool functions and abilities that took a lot of learning. What I like about this is that there doesn't seem to be a ""best"" weapon all the time. For instance, I loved the grenades that pulled enemies together before exploding, because I could then use that to get other AoE attacks out.

Added bonuses: No team damage, no fall damage, skill tree changing is easy and repeatable, vehicle gameplay, lots to explore."
24139,Not bad
24140,.
24141,very good
24142,Changed Gaming forever!!!!
24143,One of my favorite games of all time
24144,"Some of the best gunplay in an fps, one of the best written villian in ficton, and a fantastic settings with 10/10 map design. A must play for fans of rpg/fps (loot/shooter)."
24145,I hate every character. Shooting is fun though.
24146,"very fun well made
"
24147,pft I dunno
24148,This is good gun game yes
24149,what did I like about this game? It sounds weak but Everything. The music was awesome. The enemies are hilarious. I have thousands of hours into this game on multiple formats. it IS that game you must buy it on every platform.
24150,"Worth the money, worth the time! Great game!"
24151,yes
24152,Awesome!!!
24153,good
24154,"I would give this game a positive review if it weren't for one major issue. If you have internet with high latency, like satellite, this game is completely unplayable online. Even if you set the networking mode to offline, it still tries to connect to the server, freezing the game until it gets a response. For me that means a ~1 second freeze every 5 seconds. 

I used to love this game, nearly everything about it was amazing, but ever since they implemented crossplay with Epic and added this always online crap, it's awful. I have to disconnect from my internet just to play single player."
24155,"Such a good game, better then the 1st one, obsessed"
24156,"This game is by far my favorite game. Endless game play, you can make all kinds of different builds to suit your style. The farming in this game feels rewarding and not a grind. Story is amazing.

Edit: playing again after a year and still in love with this game. The DLC is an essential part of the game and I enjoy them just as much as the main game. The head hunter DLC's are amazing too, offering short play missions with a good farm in the end.

Overall, this game will not disappoint, and I would do anything to be able to play this game again for the first time."
24157,"Really fun to play, still has a really big fun factor when playing in a party!"
24158,"I have played this gave since 2016 and i always find myself coming back play, the thing that makes it good for me personally is the comedy the gun play is amazing the combination of weapons is mind blowing. but the game is not meant for all the grind is real for some guns but seeing that legendary pop out is the best feeling in the game."
24159,"ver good
"
24160,"gun go  brrrrrrr
"
24161,fun
24162,this game is brilliant i never thought i would like it from the art work  the rpg style gameplay is brilliant you use skill trees to unlock different  skills that you can tailor to your type of play style its abit odd but its fun just watch some gameplay you will snap it up a written review wont do it justice
24163,It's like if suicide squad was a game
24164,it good
24165,"I you are the fans. Ignore this review.

I don't care what others think.
I bought this game with my own money.
So I can say anything about this game.

I hate this game so much.
Slowly XP gain. None-sense need of XP.
Too long story. Idiot characters.

"
24166,I've played this game through about 3 times. played the first one with my partner at the time twice. that's what got me into this game. never heard of it until then.
24167,Its an amazing game with a great story line and heaps of GUNS!!!!!!
24168,"First game i found for Mac OS that truly turned my ADOBE machine into a STEAM machine. I couldn't use the excuse of ""I own a mac so obviously i'm not a gamer"" after finding this series. Absolutely love the visual styling of the game and the writing is pretty great. Finding a game with humor and a lack of moments where it takes its self seriously was perfect for me."
24169,"I don't see why this game is so popular. The art style looks horrible and the gameplay is quite plain. You just explore and shoot enemies, not really that revolutionary like everyone makes it out to be. The so called comedy is also very cringy and feels more insulting than anything else. I feel like I am losing brain cells the more I play this. No thanks I do not like this game."
24170,Bruh
24171,it is good .
24172,Great.
24173,"I look for 3 things in games: good story, good gameplay and a good multiplayer I can play with my friends. This game excel in all these categories.

Story: The characters are memorable and lovable. Even the villains are characters that one would even love to hate. Though the main story beats are somewhat predictable at certain points, the characters carry it through and make what is usually a slog in other games a solid experience in Borderlands 2. That is not to say that the story is entirely predictable. There are many points throughout this experience that surprises and stunned me, leaving me thrilled and wanting to know more, emotionally invested enough to want to go on and finish the fight.

Borderland 2's humour excel it mixing the incredulous, incompetents and stupid with dark undertones. It is those moment that you stop to think on whether you want to laugh or be disturbed that make this game an absolute gem of storytelling. I cannot recommend the story in Borderland 2 more.

Gameplay: The gameplay in Borderland 2 is not perfect. Borderland 2's gunplay and movements are not as polished as dedicated FPS like Halo or Call of Duty, but it is functional enough. The most balanced and enjoyable Borderland 2 experience in my opinion is on normal mode (because this game got 2 new game pluses modes) where the enemy is on your level. The classic RPG problems are presented in this game: if you are over-level (which I was, because I was doing all the sidequests) then your enemies become a trivial joke and if you are underlevel, then you are level gated to a point that no amount of skill is going to be able to get you through. It is a crying shame that the level scaling of enemies is a feature locked to the 3rd playthrough of the game, because at that point the enemy became bullet sponges that you have to empty your entire magazine to kill one at a time, which reduce your gameplay into a massive slog, equivalent to playing Halo on legendary where all your enemies are those bloody Jackal Snipers. For solo play, the enjoyment of the game peters out with every new game plus you get to. And that is a shame.

Multiplayer: Borderlands 2 shine the brightest when you have a group of friends, creating their own fun and tackling the challenges the game have to offer as a team. Multiplayer in every games tends to devolved into random nonsense and Borderland 2 facilitate this by it endless supplies of loots, guns and ridiculous enemies. Difficulties that would frustrate solo players become something that adds to the enjoyment of team play in multiplayer. Nothing to complain about here. But do note that anything is fun with the right group of friends.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this game for the story telling alone. But if you want to do new game pluses run, please do it with a group of friends. I tried doing some of it solo and it negatively impacted my perception of the game. Though I do understand that they were designed to be done in a team. Great game."
24174,it pog
24175,LOTS OF GUNS GREAT STORY.
24176,Actually bought pc instead of shitty mac so it now works pog

24201,"Баги. Баланса нет. 
Играть в соло не доставляет никакого веселья. 
Постоянно бегаешь по одним и тем же локациям. 
Нет ощущения прокачки персонажей. Игра слишком затянута.
Максимально тупые, карикатурные персонажи за которыми не интересно следить. Сюжет также непонятен, если не поиграть в первую часть. (я конечно понимаю что это типо diablo-like но даже в самой диабле интересный сюжет)

Вообще не понимаю почему у этой игры есть фанаты и хорошие оценки. Видимо дай людям ко-оп они любое говно будут кушать."

24232,good gang good story
24233,good game i like the customization on weps
24234,The best game I've Ever Played.
24235,"First of all, best Borderlands game out there, period. 

Story is far beyond comparison to the first Borderlands game, and I am not even going to talk about the third game. 
Borderlands 2 has in it's arsenal one of the best villains in game industry, making the first playthrough of the game such a complex experience. The story can provide everything you would want from a game. The story very nicely continues where the first game left us off, and expands the idea of vaults, monsters and the most important thing out there, juicy LOOT. 

The variety of guns makes the fights and killing enemies SO MUCH FUN. 
Playable characters are equally built, with each one of them having original features, so everybody can find and choose the one playstyle that they desire. 

Replay-ability of the game is very good, you can easily spend hundreds of hours in the game and you won't mind. 
Coop in the game is very fun and pretty well optimised.

DLC's are fun, adding more content to play and more stuff to kill, with every one of the DLC's having their own story! 

9/10 
"
24236,"as having 47 hours on steam yet over 600 hours combined on various consoles I have had over the years, I would 100% fully recommend this game, if on sale I would definitely encourage you to pick up this game as you are gauranteed to have lots of fun. 100% recommend to anyone no-matter who you are."
24237,"THIS GAME GOT DAT GOOD KFC STUFF
"
24238,Gud game
24239,Variety of FP characters really gives this game legs.
24240,Very Fun Game and im happy to say i Love this game lmao
24241,"It's good fun, but not enough to compensate for the self deleting save files, and a tedious leveling process with a lackluster skill tree. The story is pretty drawn out and the guns are cool, but get tiresome after a while. The rat bandits stealing large portions of your money is also extremely annoying (a big thanks to whoever it was that decided on that genius game mechanic). The respawn fee makes some sense, but the percentage of money you pay is too much to be called balanced. The cost to respawn also always scales to your player balance, meaning no matter how much you save, you'll always lose the same percentage of your savings when you die, and if you get stuck on a tricky boss or area your savings will suffer greatly. Borderlands 2 doesn't provide enough variation in gameplay mechanics to prove worth while over the long term, which seems to be what they were banking on given how long it takes to level up. Upon finishing the game I can say that there's not much improvement from when I wrote this. You pretty much run out of stuff to do without any DLC."

24251,Great shooter
24252,This game is nothing short of a good time. Played it back through shortly before Borderlands 3 released and I think this one is still one of my favorites of the series so far. Played as Maya for this playthrough and it's still so fun getting through the game and figuring out different builds to try. Had it on Xbox and put maybe 400 hours into it and I still find new things to do in the story modes. DLC content is incredible too. 10/10 good game.
24253,best  replayable game ever

24292,This series is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Its a great game to play through by yourself if you are interested in the story line and does have a great multiplayer system if you prefer to take on the world as a team.
24293,goood
24294,"Was enjoying this game for about 5 hours. Waited until the autosave icon showed, quit the game, and when I signed back in to continue the next day, the game shows no continue game option. What is with this game's weird interface and unskippable opening cutscenes? I'm going to get past the opening again to see if I can load my old save after I start a new game.....

EDIT: Maintaining an internet connection is a dumb condition for maintaining progress (especially if you're 5 hours in and the wifi cuts out), but I will not downplay just how fun and funny this game is. Would recommend. Just make sure your antivirus software has your steam app folders as an exception and you have a reliable internet connection so you don't have to start a new game 8 times. :P"
24295,"I believe I've completed this game 15 different times across my Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Steam. It's my favorite game, I anticipate it will be for much of my life if not all of it. 

If you get the complete edition you get probably one of the best values you can get in gaming. There's probably well over a hundred hours of content in just your first play-through of one character if you do all the dlc and side quests. The main and supporting characters are memorable and charming, the humor is legitimately funny, and the game play is best described as a constant rush of dopamine. You're always getting new guns, grenades, and other gear. As you learn what different manufacturers and parts on gear do you start to get even more from just looking at an item. 

The RPG elements are incredibly satisfying and the skill selection is rather diverse, allowing you to develop your own niche and style. The environmental design is top notch throughout the main game and gets even better in the dlc.

All in all an absolutely wonderful game. Very fun and well worth your money."

24303,"In many ways Borderlands 2 improved upon BL1 and, if you are a fan of the first game of the series, I would easily recommend this one.
The gameplay is a bit smoother and the artstyle seems a bit more polished than the original. The variety of enemies is still quite impressive, and the visuals/sound design are also amazing. There are plenty of maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. The combat is well-balanced and challenging without being frustrating. Almost everything I loved about the original Borderlands is also present in this game. I say almost because the only thing that’s missing is some of the charm and humor of the first opus.
Even though the loot system was expanded, it seemed a bit limited and tedious at time. You will find guns that have better stats and they might even have a new skin, BUT they will all have some kind of negative “quirks” (i.e. all Hyperion guns start out inaccurate but gain accuracy the longer you fire). You won’t find THE perfect gun just like you did in BL1.
Also, the weapon proficiency system of BL1 was replaced by the badass points. You will gain badass points whenever you do/farm challenges like ""Shoot x amount of enemies with sniper rifles"". You can then spend these points on upping gun damage, reload speed, etc. On the one hand, this might be a good thing for some gamers who wouldn't feel committed to use a specific type of gun; but on the other hand, you might not feel like you are improving with a certain weapon type, which cuts down on a bit of the RPG aspects.

All in all, Borderlands 2 is a pretty good game. As its predecessor, it is a great multiplayer game to play with friends. I guess it’s hard to match what was an excellent game the first time around, but Gearbox have just about managed it despite not being quite as memorable as the first."

Spoiler alert: If you have played Borderlands 1 (also highly recommended, but looks a bit dated now) you may be able to relate to this: The main thing that was a bit disappointing about this game is how the Vault Hunters from the first Borderlands are being portrayed here. More precisely, one, and that's Roland. He was such a cool Bad-Ass in the first game and now he's meeeh. And they way Handsome Jack deals with him is cheesy as hell. But okay, maybe that's why he is so being made so uncool during the whole game :) Claptrap more than makes up for it, though imo :) And Handsome Jack is wow so funny and cool. Oh and Moxxiiii!!!! <3"
24326,"Well, it's borderlands. Fun and fairly mindless looter shooter...pacing could be quicker and there are a few annoying glitches with the PC port, but overall a worthwhile time killer if there is a good deal on it.

Annoying glitches:
* you have to manually edit an ini file to get PS4 prompts and after that you'll want to customise what the  touchpad buttons do
* DLC management/prompts is weird when you buy the complete bundle. You have it but you get messages about things you have coming soon
* if you install it on a drive other than C is always want to reinstall a VC++ 2008 redist. package"

Went away to college for a bit and couldn't take my xbox with me, so I just bought this game on Steam. One of the best games ever. Highly, highly recommend. It's super fun! Each character has their own unique skills so you can replay the story as everyone and have a different experience every time. Story is very funny but cohesive. Gameplay is amazing. honestly 10/10 even though this game fully came out in like 2012"

24402,decent
24403,A top co op game out there
24404,love it
24405,"Have to say, it starts off really good and quite funny. But by the end, I ended up liking Handsome Jack waaay more that the main and supporting characters. It drags on for way to long on top of it. Story ending felt off too.

I got it on sale for a single playthrough with all DLC for 10 Bucks. No reason to continue once I beat it besides more of the same stuff.

But yea, Would much rather kill supporting characters and team up with Jack, they got so over the top annoying and they feel like a kid wrote them. 

"
24406,"I love this game. The gameplay, the story, the ambience, the immersion, the world, it is all fantastic.
I wanted to buy Borderlands 3 as well. When I learned there was no Psycho class, I just re-installed Borderlands 2. It's actually BETTER. It's even better than the prequel (which came out after 2). Best Borderlands game and an iconic shooter. Recommended."
24407,"HD texture pack looks absolutely fantastic. Great fun with friends, fun story as well."
24408,haha orange gun go brrr
24409,"Awesome sprawling game with humor , great imagery, strong characters.

Borderlands 2 is a 2012 first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. Taking place five years following the events of Borderlands (2009), the game is once again set on the planet of Pandora. The story follows a group of Vault Hunters who must ally with the Crimson Raiders, a resistance group made up of Pandorian citizens and soldiers, to defeat corporate leader Handsome Jack. The game features the ability to explore the in-game world and complete both main missions and optional side quests, either in single-player or online cooperative gameplay. Like its predecessor, the game features a procedurally generated loot system which is capable of generating numerous combinations of weapons and other gear.

With the unexpected success of the first game, Gearbox was able to secure a budget of $30–35 million to develop the sequel. Like its predecessor, the game adopted the ""concept art style"", which features graphics inspired by both photorealistic imagery and comic-book-inspired visuals. The team attempted to address players' feedback from the first game, and recruited Anthony Burch who wrote the game's script which is seven times longer than that of the original game. Among the game's diverse cast of characters, Handsome Jack, the central villain, was created to be a charismatic ""douche"" that mirrors Burch's own personality. Borderlands 2 was released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012, and it was ported to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of The Handsome Collection in March 2014.

The game received critical acclaim upon release. Critics generally praised the game's visuals, writing, gameplay, and online multiplayer, while criticising its mission design and content fillers. The handheld and the virtual reality versions of the game were regarded to be inferior to the console and PC versions. More than 20 million units were shipped upon release and the game became 2K's most successful release. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades by several gaming publications. Gearbox supported the game with four add-on campaigns, new characters and five content packs. The game was followed by Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel in 2014 and Borderlands 3 in 2019.

Gameplay

In this screenshot, Salvador is utilizing his ""Gunzerker"" Action Skill to dual-wield weapons
Similar to its predecessor, Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter with elements drawn from role-playing video games.[1] Four playable character classes are available in the base game, each with their own unique Action Skill: Axton, ""the Commando"", can summon a turret to provide offensive support.[2] Maya, ""the Siren"", can ""phaselock"" enemies by trapping them in a sphere of energy for a few seconds.[3] Zer0, ""the Assassin"", can temporarily become invisible and spawn a hologram decoy to distract enemies.[4] Salvador, ""the Gunzerker"", can use his titular ability to temporarily dual-wield weapons.[5] Action Skills have a cooldown time during which the player must wait before they can use the skill again.[6] Similarly to the original, completing the main story campaign unlocks ""True Vault Hunter Mode"", a New Game Plus which increases the difficulty of the game by making enemies stronger, improves the probability of finding rare and higher-quality items, and allows the player's character to reach level 50.[7]

Weapons can be bought from vendors, picked up from fallen enemies, and found inside containers.[8][9] The game features six weapon types—pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers—with a procedurally generated loot system capable of generating numerous variations of these and other gear.[10] The in-game manufacturers of the weapons provide them with distinct characteristics.[11] Each weapon also has different stats and properties, such as producing different damage and having varying accuracy, fire rate, reload speed, and magazine size. A color-coded scale is used to indicate the rarity of the weapon or item.[8] Some weapons are infused with additional elemental effects that deal extra damage to enemies.[12] In addition, players can collect mods which would alter the stats of grenades and Action Skill,[8] and Relics, which are rare items that can change any gameplay aspect.[13] Players need to manage their inventory regularly as they cannot equip all the weapons they have collected.[8]

The player is protected by a shield, which can automatically regenerate from damage. If the shield is destroyed, the player's health would start to deplete. Insta-Health vials can be picked up to restore health.[8] If they lose all their health, they enter a downed state and must either wait to be revived by another player or attempt to kill an enemy to achieve a ""second wind"". Otherwise, they will be regenerated back at the last ""New-U"" station that they passed.[14] As the player completes missions and kills enemies, they gain corresponding rewards such as experience points (XP) and new weapons. Once they gain enough XPs, they level up, which unlocks new skill points to upgrade abilities.[8] Each Vault Hunter can progress in three different skill trees after unlocking the basic class-specific Action Skill.[15] In addition, levelling up increases the maximum health capacity and unlocks new weapons, some of which cannot be used until the player reaches a certain level.[8]

As the player explores and completes missions, new areas of the game world are unlocked. The game has a semi open world structure, as the world is divided into several sections which can be freely explored.[16] In each area, different non-playable characters are encountered who provide side missions for the players.[17] Players can spawn vehicles in order to quickly traverse some areas.[18] The in-game currency can be collected from loot drops, loot containers, completing missions, and selling unwanted equipment, and can be used to purchase items from vending machines. Players can also gather Eridium bars, a new currency for purchasing storage upgrades and other premium items.[8] A major addition to the game is the ""Badass Rank"" system; completing various in-game challenges award points, which convert into tokens that can be redeemed to increase the base stats of the player's characters.[12] When exploring the world, players can access certain New-U stations in order to fast travel, and Quick-Change machines allow players to customize their avatar's look, clothing and name.[8]

The game supports four-player cooperative multiplayer, though the PlayStation Vita version only supports two players.[19] As more players join a session, the game's difficulty increases along with the loot rewards. Players can trade items and cash, or can duel for the agreed-upon stakes.[8] The game also features split-screen multiplayer.[20]

24418,"The Sequel To The Original Borderlands. Borderlands 2 Is One Incredible FPS Game From The Previous Gen.

24424,Very fun to play but can be a little bit hard if you are doing it solo
24425,"this game is amazing, fantastic story, thrilling gameplay. its a bit crude in humor occasionally but if you enjoy that then by all means this game is wonderful. also its one of the best multiplayer games ive ever had the pleasure to play. just as a bonus"
24426,"Superb game, taking into account the year it came out. Ahead of the curve.

24436,awesome game
24437,"Great game, loved the first, this is more challenging.. Love it!"
24438,It's sexy. 10/10
24439,Its great!
24440,I love this game. Had way too much fun. You play through the game 3 times per character. Lots of fun grinding bosses for rare loot. Use a Siren character with the elemental build to kill bosses in just a few seconds.
24441,Good
24442,yes
24443,Good game
24444,"lost both of my saves when i moved a file back it broke it 

200hrs gone
still a good game i guess"
24445,"Great game, the graphics and gameplay hold up well enough today.  Tiny Tina's DLC is especially great."
24446,"Great Shoot ing mechanics, great story, and memorable characters. My only gripe is that I wis it were more of an RPG, as the linear nature of quests (go here, kill this, return) can get stale eventually. In all, great game."
24447,best game gearbox will ever make
24448,Awesome
24449,"8 years later and this game still manages to keep me entertained, the comedy is on point and most importantly it has one of the best if not the best villian in gaming history (in my opinion).
Bottom line GET THE GAME"

24455,Better than warframe and destiny
24456,"I bought this game and all dlc for 97% off, It is well worth that money, I would say it's worth the original sum but I didn't pay that price so I can not say it is. I have played it with friends and also solo. There is no game like this on the market. A loot n shoot in its purest form. If you have not played this game and you think about buying it stop thinking. Best game I have played in a long time."

24459,OH YEAH MR KRABS
24460,"Best looter shooter ever made, story and characters are awsome. So if you are a grinder or here for a good story to play you wont be dissapointed. Think all the dlc's are worth the money, with that said not a necesseary evil at start."
24461,ye
24462,It's a good game
24463,"Why is this game a masterpiece because sometimes stupid is what we all need. That's why you are looking at this. I am Stupid and this is what you need.

My personal favourite game for just fucking around for a bit of time. In my case a lot of time. It has some of the very best voice acting and story line. The comedy to action is very fun. The combat is nice and for people who like to explore the map of each region there are secrets for everybody. Overall I would buy this game again and again even if it wasn't on sale. And if you go to ClapTrap's Birthday party make sure you stay. That's what real adventures do. 

ON THE FLIP SIDE. The DLC's are a little pricey for the little gameplay. like the christmas one was cool and all but fuck me the snowman was hard as balls to kill. That DLC was like the Dark Souls of this game mix that with the board game one and fuck. Don't get me started on the grandma talking for two hours. I GOT THE QUESTIONS WRONG 4 TIMES, you might ask how did I fuck it up. I AM DUMB i left and forgot my answer.

"
24464,Handsome game.
24465,Great game!
24466,"This game is really good and out of the box, but if youre not a fans of exploring and being corious im not really recommend this game since this game got a really confusing map, but overall, all thumbs up!"
24467,"everything
"
24468,"Just a well rounded and wonderful game. I have fun playing borderlands 2 unlike most terrible games I play. But this is one of the better games that I have played over the years. I understand this game is older but I would say that it still holds up to be one of the best video games of all time, or at least solidifies the spot that the borderlands series has on a list of top game series of all time. It's got a similar feel to any run and gun shooter but while keeping that fast paced game-play, there is also a sense of strategy with the amount of weapons there are in the game and with consideration to what your in-game character level is. Overall... I would say 10 out of 10 and this game can be played for a long time with the additional DLC and extensive side missions included in the base game!"
24469,"This is the game i play when its been a frustrating day at work, and i want to blow off steam."
24470,better than borderlands 3
24471,Good.
24472,Oldie but a goodie. Certainly has a few hours built up
24473,i love Tiny Tina best NPC ever
24474,Support Maya OP
24475,it ight
24476,Its borderlands... cmon! Bl2 is arguably the best in the series and I would have to agree.
24477,the best nostalgic game
24478,i’ve had this game for like 6 years or something and I still don’t have a character at max level. absolute banger of a game
24479,yes
24480,Its a classic
24481,Very fun game to play with friends
24482,"The game fps lags so much, it's making me nauseous while playing.

My computer can run Destiny 2 and FFXIV with high settings and not have fps drops. Can't seem to find a solution."
24483,"Having not played 1st person story shooter type games for quite awhile (think the Half life series) I was a bit hesitant to try Borderlands but jumped in when I could get 1, 2 & Pre Sequel for $40 through the sale. Finished 1 then started 2...now I cant go back to 1! Its quirky, love the humour and story. Definitely recommend  BL 2. I am just a little late to the arty for this series and have quite a bit to catch up to some friends who are playing BL3"
24484,One of the Best Co-op games out there.
24485,best borderlands
24486,"Best Borderlands. Even after completing the story, there's so much more to explore. Handsome Jack is a very interesting villain."
24487,"Do I recommend playing this game in year of our lord 2020? Idk maybe. [i] hard maybe [/i]. I think it's a really good mechanical progression from the first and because of True Vault Hunter mode has really good replay-ability. But the sense of humour is so EXTREMELY [u] online [/u] in 2012. I loved playing this 2013-16, but it definitely got stale. If you want a nostalgia hit in terms of hyperspecific memes from 2012 then damn this shooter is for you. if not...I don't know...play a different Borderlands? Or don't I haven't played one since this one and I'm doing fine. 

OH Real quick before I go, I really liked the Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon's Keep. It was super fun and thoughtful about mourning while also keeping the tone of the base game which doesn't really nail its emotional moments. 

Okay that's it bye bye."
24488,great game
24489,great story fun gameplay
24490,👍🏿
24491,Originally I didn't... really like the game! This was due to being powerleveled etc. But now I love it with the Single-Player campaign! Already grinded around 60 or so hours just doing the campaign. lol
24492,the game is good
24493,"Good game, would appreciate if they add cross platform multiplayer between MAC and Windows."

24514,they killed dave i want refund
24515,Very good and fun game. Highly recommended.
24516,It's a classic. You just have to play it for yourself. Wonderful villain. Joker-tier imo. Great aesthetic as well.
24517,I strongly recommend getting the Borderlands 2 Reborn Mod. Especially for those of us who don't have the required hardware to play BL3!
24518,"I could've been a goddamn professor if I gave those hours to a physics book

24546,Outstanding FPS.  Replayable too!

24548,"I just love the huge world and unending potential for weapons! The replayability is huge, and the player is not forced into certain missions. Wanna beat the story? Cool! Hunt skags? Go for it. DLC?? TONS. An oldie but a goodie, and in my opinion up there with GTASA and Halo in terms of classic awesomeness! 10/10"
24549,Nice game. Play it.
24550,"its first spaceX launch ever

24552,"If you are looking for a game to play with friends this would be it. With up to 4 players you will be able to have to have your whole group in. I would recommend this game on sale for its low low price of roughly $6 in the Handsome Collection. The art style is so creative and unique which will get you out of the grind of the same looking ea games every year. So go ahead add it to your cart, you will not be disappointed."
24553,"Excellent. If your new to fps games, or just looking for a good game, this is an excellent choice."
24554,Have now replayed this game more than 10 times. So awesome!

24563,"Absolutely loved Borderlands 1. And Borderlands 2 really satisfied my inner vault hunter. So much to do, so much to collect! Will most likely keep playing this game until I die of old age."

24573,"es good
"
24574,highly recommended it is an outstanding game all around
24575,gud
24576,Support for the MAC version of this game has been completely dropped. Today myself and anyone playing the MAC version of this game have been confronted with a game that crashes every time you run it!  I have wasted over 182 hours on a game I can no longer play! My friends and I are extremely frustrated at their lack of support. Every MAC user should be entitled to a refund on all their money for the game and all the DLC we paid for. This is robbery!!!!!
24577,"Always fun, funny gameplay, a lot of replayability, and one of the best DLCs of all games of all time."
24578,"""You've played for 1283 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?""

24587,fuck this game
24588,best Borderlands
24589,nice
24590,yes
24591,Whats not to like
24592,played this game for a long time had at on my xbobx 360 and ps3. Loved it since the 1st day i played it and still love it to this day.
24593,"This is probably one of the least interesting and unmotivating games I've ever played, refunded it when i got it for like, a couple minutes then got it free on epic, genuinely one of the worst experiences i've ever had in a game."
24594,"I actually have thousands of hours across Xbox 360 and One. But Gearbox has implemented cross play that is mandatory with Epic, meaning if Epic servers go down you can't play. Not even singleplayer."
24595,"the only problems is delay when you play coop with your friends sometimes, and its always disconnect eventho my connection is okay.

But overall its really good, and i enjoy it"
24596,v
24597,One of the best shooter looter games ever.
24598,SHOOOOOT ME IN THE FAAACE
24599,Amazing game and works on linux!!!
24600,Moxxxy hawt
24601,Funny game.
24602,"Borderlands is my favorite FPS franchise and I've spent the most time playing Borderlands 2.  Handsome Jack as the villain makes this game 100x more enjoyable than any other villain the game could have given us.  Replay value is high because of the random weapon drops, optional missions create more variety in case one doesn't just want to rush ahead to the end battle, and characters like Mr. Torgue provide excellent comic relief throughout."
24603,great game
24604,"This whole franchise is awesome. Even though they're older, they're awesome. I'd play through Borderlands, then the Pre-Sequel (1.5), then 2, then move on to 3. There's not any required plot, but it's good to see familiar faces return and also the UI and gameplay improve slightly over time."
24605,420hours played Blazeit/10
24606,loooove this game
24607,It's funny and fun.
24608,"good

24611,great story and gameplay. plenty to do in single player mode
24612,"One of the best fucking games I have ever fucking played. If I could, I would make love with this game. Props to the team behind this, you're all fucking amazing."
24613,Better story and game than borderlands 3 in my opinion. the third is too gimmicky even for the borderlands series.
24614,Best game ever created
24615,"I love this game, but recent updates have added banner ads for BL3, slowed down the game, and broken PC/Mac crossplay with no timeline to fix it. I regret buying a copy for my friend, even on sale."
24616,"goat
"
24617,"hundreds of hours of fantastic gameplay cool weapons, tons of DLC that feels like the devs actually care about the game and the fantastic community 11/10"
24618,"Vast open world that is different from any other game I gave played. May be 8 years old, but it is better than most games today."
24619,"One of the best FPS Co-op game and series for friends to play together. would 10/10 recommend this, BL1 and BL3 to anyone looking to get into the franchise."
24620,Its fun.
24621,This game is fun sometimes with some corny jokes. My issue is that it always felt like a meaningless grind no matter what I was doing because enemies just kept on multiplying and getting harder. Hopefully this helps someone. Last thing I want to say is the game is meant to be played as co-op.
24622,If your looking at the review for this game your either bored or have never played this game if your the second option may I ask why you have never played this it's a fu**ing blast to play especially if you have the friends to join you
24623,game looks like poop!
24624,One of the greatest game to ever grace any console system.....period.
24625,"Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, spent a lot of hours in it back in the day but lately developers just started shitting on customers.
I used to have a BL2 + Season Pass (full bundle with all DLCs) for this game and I even got all achievements, then I noticed that new achievements were added so I thought, ""cool I will recheck the game"".

What turned out was that these are new DLC related achievements from BL3 (which note I simply refuse to buy due to Epic controversy) which I did not get for some reason (seems that my Season Pass was removed as if it was valid only until that certain point in time). Not only that but from what i traced back on steam, that DLC used to be free and now its like $20+.

So in general, game is superb, hours of fun, used to be great for multiplayer, but publishers/developers decision was to ruin it with greedy actions"

24641,"Borderlands 2 is one of those games I always end up coming back to sooner or later. After first playing this game back on the Xbox 360, and since then every so often throughout the years I feel the urge to return to the wastelands of Pandora."

24706,"Aside from Skyrim, BL 2 is the game I've spent the most time playing in my adult life.  (The 81 hours shown here is only a tiny fraction of the total hours I've played, because I probably have a few hundred hours on the PS4.)  

Borderlands 2 remains, in my opinion, the best of the series.  I enjoyed 3, and I'll probably play it again at some point, but everything about the BL2 just seemed perfect to me.  The game play is fun as hell; the playable characters are the best of the entire series, the NPCs are funny as hell (Tiny Tina, etc.), most of the DLCs were excellent and worth the cost, and I still love the cell-shaded graphics style and colors of BL 2 more than all the rest in the series.

Don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed BL3, but here I am playing BL2 again instead, so I think that tells us something."

24708,YES
24709,Best game ever!!!
24710,"Absolutely LOVE this game! The writing, dialogue, and voice acting has to be some of the best I have ever seen in a game. it makes the game so much fun. So many quests and easter eggs had me rolling. This has been a great game to play multiplayer with the family and friends as well, allowing players to easily drop in and out of the game anywhere. The difficulty scales quite nicely. There is ALWAYS something to do , find, and explore, ESPECIALLY with all of the DLC content. The Graphics have held up very well over time, thanks to its unique art style, so it looks and runs well on both high end and mid-low end machines with no problems. Overall, one of the best bang for your buck games."
24711,If you loved borderlands 1 you will love this game

24713,"When you think of a shoot-and-loot FPS you think of this.  You may not know it, but you think of this.
This game is fast paced.  This game is simple, but with a fair bit of strategy.  This game can be played alone (except for the raid bosses) but is more fun with a group. 
Above all:  This game is FUN. 
If you are tired of shooters that take themselves too seriously with hyper realistic combat, total reliance on cover mechanics, and dramatic deep stories get this.  
While it does have a surprisingly deep plot with several arcs and twists; as well as a genuinely evil villain.  This game is much more lighthearted then it has any right being, considering the number of jokes about mass murder, being eaten alive, and a thirteen year old girl with a disturbing obsession with ""badonkadonks.""
Since I got this game it has only been uninstalled long enough to change my hard drive.  It is my favourite game that I have played on Steam.

24724,i reload the gun by throwing it
24725,"Pretty fun when playing with others. Played the story on normal with 3 other friends over the past couple days, and very stoked to do Vault Hunter Mode! Wish that all the DLC would have been in the package i bought back in March, cause when my friends go up to the level 70-80 area i wont be able to continue but still good game.
"
24726,"Epic game, insanely fun to mess around with friends. The grind is real"
24727,"Only 5 hours on steam so far but put in many hours on both 360 and handsome jack collection after. Possibly one of the best shooters of all time. If number 3 was your first BL, or for some odd reason you missed 2 and have played the all others it is a must you play this. Very few games have come close to the number of hours I've put into this game. 10/10"
24728,"played it with a russian and still enjoyed myself, must be good"
24729,bit tilting sometimes but overall pretty cool
24730,"The stylised look this game went for really works for it, the story may be fairly plain and straightforward with a little twists here and there but the humor of the game is what relly sells it for me. All in all really like it."

24757,"So much action, just guns and shooting everywhere. Gaming masterpiece both single and coop mode.

The best DLC by far is Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. If you don't have it, buy it ASAP. Tons of references.
The setup, the story, the characters and the execution. Everything was perfect, also, TIny Tina is probably the best character in the whole Borderlands universe.

24759,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeverygoodgame
24760,"one of the best games ever, i love this series with a burning passion that all started with the pre-sequel, but really blossomed into what it is now from playing borderlands 2 for the roughly 5000+ hours back on the ps3 and the only adding to those hours on the ps4 and now i've moved over here to pc. if you've never played one of the borderlands games before i seriously recommend starting with borderlands 2"
24761,"Game's addictive, has a fun story, great characters. Been playing for way longer as i own the game on every console it's on as well as on PC."
24762,cool game and good humor

24764,Best game I've ever played
24765,"There's Humor, There's violence, theirs XP grinding, and dont forget the loot. Tie that up with hundreds upon hundreds of quests and a somewhat decent story line- it all adds up to a kick ass game that you'll more than likely play multiple times.

There's a reason why this game is so popular, even after YEARS of being accessible. 
There's bound to be SOMETHING you'll enjoy about it."
24766,this game made me poop my pants and  i'm constipated five stars
24767,"Borderlands 2 is best.
Offline is ok.
But It is more fun co-op."
24768,"One of my favorite games, it's really fun solo listening to music or with a group of a friends joking around, which for me is rare to find both in a game. The antagonist Handsome Jack is very well written, and is one of my favorite antagonist across any game or film. The characters a fun and all of them offer a different experience and play style."

24783,Very enjoyable game played this for the last 2 years. Never had an issue with any bugs. Never bored and always loads to do. Many different playing styles for every character with loads of different set ups for the said characters.
24784,much better than 3
24785,"Borderlands 2 was the first FPS game I've played through. As someone generally used to playing sims and MMOs, FPS was something I'd tried before but never enjoyed, and I was basically dragged into playing this. Yes, I'm aware I'm probably one of the last people on the planet to play this game.

BUT this game definitely lived up to its reputation and was fun even to me, someone who doesn't usually like shooty tooty games. It got a bit repetitive towards the end but for the most part was pretty satisfying and while I probably wouldn't play this in single player (or on a hard setting, having pretty average aim and being too good at panicking) if you're looking for a fun game to play with friends, with a good story, give this a go."
24786,"Tiny Tina, Mister Torgue and Claptrap make this game. Don't ask questions, just play this game."
24787,Great game. Very story driven.
24788,It's masterpiece and the only game i've played so far in which you actually gain more XP by playing with others.

24847,"Co-op FPS/RPG hybrid with procedurally generated weaponry. Borderlands 2 does a lot, but nothing particularly well, and just doesn't manage to entertain me all that much.

Has a native Linux version which they stopped updating, so it now lags behind the Windows version, and runs considerably worse too.

It has it's fans, but I'm not one of them. Still, you might get more mileage out of it than I can."

24849,Very fun and a good plot for a video game. Pretty cool how guns generate and the controls and story makes this game awesome. I recommend this.

24869,"Great game, if your'e looking for a singleplayer game with smooth fps, high detail and non-stop action, this is your game! In just 5 hours,  I shot multiple beasts, rode a mad max-ish vehicles, fought bandits and fought well made bosses. But, the crossplay multiplayer could use some tweaks but so far, good game 8.5/10 better than Portal. Warning! this game is for EPIC GAMERS you normies could not stand a chance against the bosses and enemies."
24870,It is the most amazing game ever theres also a borderlands 3 that means theres an entire game storyline!

24883,its good
24884,"When i got this game (got the idea from a friend). I wasnt sure how i would feel about the game, as im usually not the type to play any videogame for longer than an hour, and even then i usually dont really feel like playing anything except for Counter Strike or roblox type games every so often. 

Well now with 100 hours and on my almost second complete run (going through UVHM) I can safely say that this game is fuckin awesome, i love the gameplay, the perks/bonuses/mods and white crystal things allow you to customize the way your character feels, which is just so fuckin gnarly, the SHOOT and LOOT, god so fuuuun, PLUS the line characters say are funny or just bring life to the game. 

The side quests really make the game feel complete, cause if it was just the main story then the game would be too short/boring, but here i can do whatever the hell i want (for the most part, but you do need to do main story sometimes to unlock quests in specific areas, and that kinda stinks). If borderlands had more RPG elements but still maintain its POW POW BOOOM EXPOLOSION, then i really think this could be one of the best game series ever (oh and the main story is ok, but screw that, im here for the SIDE QUESTS BABY!)"
24885,"I played this game and had fun.


That's it.


Thank you for the reddit gold"
24886,"cool
"
24887,its so cool
24888,"At the time of writing I've only completed the main game to borderlands 2 and not the dlc, but it seems that the dlc is just more borderlands 2 content so I doubt any of it will massively change my review of the game. Additionally, it should be noted that I bought the game in the steam summer sale as the Handsome Collection for only £10, so the value for money may be different if you buy it at full price. 

The first 5-10 (I'm bad at counting so it could be more or less) hours of this game were pure agony and boredom. This was in no small part due to the fact that I've played through the first few areas countless times as numerous people have decided to play the game co-op only for everyone to just give up a few hours in. So take it with a grain of salt when I say, the first few hours of this game sucked hard, but after that it really started to take off. In my opinion, the environment and enemy design becomes better, the cast of characters expands and the comedy becomes progressively better throughout the game.

In terms of comedy, it's a mix of quips/one-liners and entire missions that are just jokes. The individual characters provide most of the humour and I can only think of one or two stinkers that I didn't like, the rest of the characters are absolutely great. 

It's weird that for a looter shooter I found that the shooting was somewhat lacking, but hear me out. I found the entire rifle class a pain to use because they were either crappy single fire guns where you might as well use a sniper, awful guns where the longer you held down the faster the fire rate became or annoying explosive guns which have low fire rates and were not fun to use in my opinion. Also shotguns are my sworn enemies in video games so I didn't use those on principal. Despite this, I spent most of my time with snipers and pistols (as decent smgs seemed to be hard to come across, though admittedly these made up for the lack of fully automatic rifles) and I still had a lot of fun with both of them. 

There were a couple more painful mechanics I didn't enjoy. Driving just felt kinda dull, not really necessary except to make large, open areas. Golden keys you basically need to look up a wiki that will tell you all the active codes so you can grab some free keys and get some sweet sweet loot. This kind of sucks though because you'll just spend about 10 minutes typing in codes so you can get some nice purple stuff. More mechanics I didn't like were the first 5 levels (you only get your ability on the 5th level), I think you should get your ability after a single level up I don't see why they delayed it except that their skill tree wasn't long enough idk. 

Despite this criticism I still thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, mostly due to the comedy, the story and the art style. I might check out Borderlands 3 for some tighter shooting mechanics, but other than that this game is really good and I do recommend it. The one aspect I haven't touched is story, which is an excellent balance of comedic moments and emotional ones."

24901,"After almost 7 years, I’m finally finished with [i]Borderlands 2[/i]. I’ve played this game off and on since I built my first PC back in December 2013. I’ve probably started it 4 or 5 times over the years. But back in the fall of 2018, a friend and I determined that we were going to start it one more time, and that this time, we would finish the game. And we did. We finished up the base game in October 2018. We completed [i]Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage[/i] and [i]Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty[/i] during the main campaign, and then we finished up [i]Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt[/i] in November 2018, but then we got side-tracked by some other games, and it took us until March 2019 to get back around to finishing the last DLC, [i]Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep[/i], which I have a separate review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarthJimbo/recommended/218550?snr=1_5_9__402]here[/url]. 

It feels really nice to finally be done with this game.

Don’t get me wrong, [i]Borderlands 2[/i] is a great game. It’s probably the best co-op experience that I’ve ever had. But I feel like a lot of the level design is samey, and there’s not enough enemy variety to keep the combat refreshing for 40-60 hours, much less the 130+ hours that I’ve put into it in all of my playthrough attempts over the years. 

Also, I don’t think I found any guns out in the world or from any bosses that were better than what I had already from the Golden Chest in Sanctuary, and the Golden Keys required to open the chest are super abundant online. I had so many that the counter broke. (I assume it’s an 8-bit integer and once I had 255, no more were counted.) So, that definitely made looting feel really pointless. I think that was one of the main contributors to the feeling of running from objective marker to objective marker. 

[b]Disclaimer: This review was written in March 2019 and posted in August 2020. 
Disclaimer 2: This was written before the Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary DLC was announced and released. And as of August 18, 2020, I still haven’t played it. [/b]"

The story is great, the characters are phenomenal and have their own special quirks or funny lines or whatever about them that makes them completely unique and nothing compared to their counterparts. The main villain is humorous and is an actual threat, but also not too powerful or over-tuned. The gun play is both satisfying and challenging to control for an average new player, both great for a loot and shoot. Speaking of which, HUGE emphasis on the looting and shooting. You can cause the whole battlefield to explode into many items that would seem cool! There is a huge variety of items to explore, each having their own uses and their own abilities, making them extremely unique. The legendaries are all great in their own way. The shooting is highly satisfying, and you can either play it tactically and snipe the field or use your cover, or choose to run in there guns-a-blazing and cause so much stuff to happen that it's hard to even tell what's happening. There are many gameplay choices, and though some are better than others, you can make use of every single one. The best game out of the franchise, in my opinion. I would highly recommend giving this game a shot."
24949,"I love the game, I highly recommend it"
24950,is this how i get the message to go away?
24951,"This game leaves me addicted and unsatisfied. Every period of coming back ends with my leaving in an explosion of built-up frustration.
I cannot vouch for the gameplay as I play few shooters, but it seems satisfying enough to me.
Buy it if you want to, but know that you're getting into a several-hundred-hour adventure that will, if you're anything like me, leave you begging for much more than it will ever give you."
24952,gaming
24953,It's Borderlands. Good enough
24954,Great Game
24955,guns and migets. i think yes
24956,"I have been playing Borderlands 2 with a friend of mine and I have been thoroughly enjoying it. We started the game off as the friend has played a lot of it previously on console and we wanted to try it on PC (I had never played a borderlands game). 

CO-OP is amazing, but the single player walk-through is equally as enjoyable. There is a huge catalogue of gameplay and DLC.

I look forward to many more hours on this game, and the later versions of BL."
24957,yeet
24958,Very epic and nice
24959,this game is great so many guns and items and so many skills to make OP builds and there are 4 vault hunters in the base game and 2 dlc vault hunters and they each have diffrent skills and diffrent action skills(bassicly abiltyes (bad spelling alret)) so it makes it seem like a whole new game when you play a new vault hunter and theres even mods you can download and you can give yourself a challenge in a new character so overall this game is amazing and even is my number 1 favorite game of all time (10/10) and also this game has a amazing story its only like 9 hours long so a short story but still amazing and also this game is a looter shooter RPG and borderlands 1 is the first looter shooter ever
24960,great game
24961,"low risk, high reward. I'm barely even good at shooty games but i love how this one has no real consequences for dying lol you just have a grand old time with pals"
24962,"One of the most funny and immersive games I ever played, Even one of my fav sagas"
24963,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
24964,"I dont even Really LIKE First person shooter games, at least i dont think i do... Anyway, Really funny and I like it!"
24965,I put 2600 hours into this game across 3 consoles because its so good.'
24966,"This is a fun (and demanding) first person shooter. I'm especially enjoying the wacky characters, crazy weapon options, and the multitude of side missions you can take to build up skills and earn loot. Some solid advice, son: do a lot of those side missions! You'll need the advanced weapons and stronger shields as you progress. And I mean NEED them!"
24967,good game
24968,"Buy it, play it. Won't regret it... Even for as old as it is, still fantastic looter shooter."
24969,super fun FPS for anyone who enjoys guns and comedy.
24970,is good tbh ngl
24971,F
24972,"it no make me poop

24973,Great game!  Like the previous ones I've played in the past!
24974,"Just like BioShock, not fun, refunded."
24975,"it's quite fun but a little bit hard
"
24976,You're Aren't (Epic Backflip)
24977,Overall a solid 1st person looter shooter. Funny as all hell and a riot to play. I love it.
24978,Best $5.00 I spent
24979,"orange gun good

nice"
24980,"Borderlands 2 is a classic looter shooter that is absolutely one of my all time favorite games. 

Characters and Story:
I'm a nut for character development and BL2 is full of that. Hidden behind all the hilarious humor are dark back stories of people driven to insanity by others who think they are doing something right for the world of Pandora. The story and character development make Handsome Jack one of the best antagonists that I've ever had the joy of witnessing, and a good game can not exist without a good antagonist. Thinking he's saving the people of Pandora, he throws it into further chaos as he kills whoever is in his way and becomes a tyrant through his antics. It doesn't sound like you could sympathize with him at the start, but as you uncover more about the world, Jack becomes a character that you can both relate and sympathize with along with the majority of the characters in the game. The literal opening of the game is Jack trying to kill you to eliminate competition for finding the all-powerful vault. It's an amazing story that really, never gets boring. 

The side quests are fun too. They are both humorous and action packed (for the most part). Some of the more story based side quests can add to the character development as well as build the chaotic, corporate controlled world of Pandora. I found myself to feel fairly sad at some of the side quests because of the result. It also solidified my feelings towards certain weapon companies and expands on that in BL3.

Literal Setting:
This game is an early open-world shooter. That means the maps are not as big, colorful, and full of things to do as the sequel, Borderlands 3, but it's quite fun going into random bandit camps and farming loot in different environment like the arctic or desert areas. You do move between places quite frequently and there are enemies everywhere, so it's very hard to get bored in the game if you like exploring and killing things.

Gameplay:
The gameplay has kind of a slow start. So much so that it originally drove me away from the game, but I eventually tried it out again, grew in levels and badass ranks, and enjoyed the gunplay. It is an older shooter, so it can be a bit clunky and jumping puzzles and movement require more skill than modern games. However, that does not really prevent a player from having fun in this very chaotic shooter. Also, there is a crap ton of loot. Each higher rank weapon is very unique and create more funny moments or makes you feel like you can kill God. Very fun.

Final Thoughts:
This game, as I said, is one of my favorites. I enjoyed it a lot from the amazing story, memorable characters, fun gameplay, and good humor. I would definitely give it a try."
24981,Well. I can't say this game is good... it's something more than good!
24982,!!!!!
24983,is nice
24984,shoot me
24985,T'is a blast with your friends if I do say so myself.
24986,good game
24987,"+ Great audio-visuals with
+ Immensely great main villain
+ Cool, badass, interesting and funny characters all over the place!
+ Shooting feels good and precise
+ Well-done storytelling (but often occur in the middle of the fight, which is annoying hard to track what characters are saying)
+ Great variety in weapons

- Loot is not satisfying
- Boss fights are a little dull
- Missions are sometimes too grindy"
24988,vebi good
24989,"A very good game, certainly better than the original ""Borderlands"" and the reviews show that. Good Story with witty dialogues, memorable characters, pop-culture references and little twists that have been memed-to-the-moon by this point. The graphics is ok for 2010 but some might find the bit cartoonish style of art unappealing. For me it was more than fine, in fact it always adds to the zany characters that it has.

I love Co-Op games, and this really is a very good co-op, with lots of fun to be had in single player and co-op just enhances the whole experience. 

Even after Borderlands 3 has been out I think this is still relevant, and if the reviews for the new game is to be believed ( i haven't played Borderlands 3), It is better to consider this is as the only sequel to borderlands.

I suggest getting the Game of the year collection, coz in the handsome collection you would also be handed the worst expansion of borderlands to date (the pre-sequel). But if you want to play the Claptastic voyage, which is, in my humble opinion, ""The Best DLC from Borderlands"", only then go for it."
24990,"Probably the best co-op shooter on Steam. Timelessly designed graphics, good mechanics, funny story lines! 
As a shooter - beautifully satisfying! A must have!"
24991,Probably my favourite game ever. When it first launched I had no idea what it is or anything. It's a game that you really can't get bored of because of how many game styles you can try
24992,"Enjoyable to play on your own, fantastic to play with a buddy. A neat game with simple gameplay mechanics, cool weapons and cool characters. 
Great lore and story, fantastic character development, visual design and sound design. Every detail is paid attention to and is well developed. 
It's colorful and stylish. Easy to stay entertained for hours, easy to like."
24993,"As far as I am concerned this is the last borderlands in the series as all the rest are trash.

good for a group of friends, fine alone as well.

bit excessive to have 3 base playthroughs meant for levels 1-30 31-50 51-72 respectively but after that there are EIGHT MORE with no further leveling but just stronger everything.

so all in all it is fine game that can get really repetitive."
24994,It's pretty good.
24995,"Extremely fun. The Game of the Year goes on sale for under ten dollars regularly.

Only Con is that playing it Single Player can be really irritating. But if you have someone to play with there is absolutely nothing negative I can think to say, and even Single Player isn't impossible."
24996,"ummm ive got this game but cant download it says disk error when i bought it on steam anyone help me out here?
do love the game and have played before so wondering why now its being odd"
24997,Best game

25006,"You play 1 playthough and have no idea what you're doing then you play the second and end up farming for 30 hours for a perfect bee shield, then you play the third play through and just use cheats to spawn in perfect items cause its a 7 year old game and life isnt worth wasting it on that."

25039,Clap trap deserves a fat slap
25040,ok
25041,"Like expected coming from Borderlands 1 , Borderlands 2 is very fun and entertain game where you dont get bored , specially with those thousands of DLCs that they keep updating which makes this game impossible to end :D"

"
25045,BEST LOOTER SHOOTER EVER
25046,"Just simply a great and classic game with lots of variety fun, humor an action."
25047,"I would say this game is one of the classic loot and shooters that me and friends play. You get a lot of fun moments in the story, lots of fun tromping though the badlands looking for that new shiny orange gun, lots of fun to see the crazy character builds that people choose. This is a timeless game for me, one that I have continued to boot up and play from time to time."
25048,"spent two hours farming King Mong for the bee shield because i'm stupid.

11/10 would get a badaboom anyways anyday"
25049,get gun then get better gun
25050,revisiting my old save brings back great memories and is by far one of most fun games ever made.  Plus the art style is dope and millions AND MILLIONS of weapons
25051,"A whole lot of fun alone, or playing with friends."
25052,One of the best games I've ever played.
25053,"This game is SO MUCH FUN!

To preface, I'm no good at first-person shooters, and I hate multiplayer games. But I used the last Steam Sale to catch up on some old franchises I never played like Borderlands, and I just could not put it down! The secret sauce is 2 game mechanics, one within the other.

MECHANIC #1: Loot and Shoot - Probably exactly what you've heard about the game. Kill the little bad guys and take their guns, to kill the medium-bads and take their guns, to kill the big-bads and take their guns, and now you're a badass!

MECHANIC #2: Difficulty Spikes - As soon as you're feeling strong and play a few story missions, every time BAM you get to a new chapter, a new area, and are facing baddies that are rediculously stronger than you. As soon as your comfortable taking out camps full of bandits, boom you're facing mutated beasts that smash you to bits, so you grind. And once you're feeling good about the beasts, boom you're facing giant kill-bots that just take you apart.

Not to mention that its not just point-and-shoot; strategy is IMPORTANT! Its critical to explore your environment and use terrain to avoid enemies' powerful attacks. Its not always best to use your biggest gun, as each enemy has a particular weakess and matching your attack to your enemy is needed. Plus its got a good auto-aim feature that REALLY helps if you play with a controller or are not a FPS wizard, without gimping the difficulty.

Make no mistake, this game is HARD. But that's why its good... over and over again. I got Borderlands 2 on sale for a couple bucks to get a taste of the franchise, and now I'm budgeting for buying all the copious DLCs. Its fun, and I recommend it without hesitation."
25054,"The gameplay might feel dated at this point, we will love the characters are forever."
25055,yuhh
25056,is okey dokey says I
25057,Bigger and better game play than the first Borderlands with a top notch Story.
25058,Great game very enjoyable
25059,"fun, play now

practically impossible to play story without doing missions because the enemies get better and the only way to counter that is to get better weapons"
25060,very fun despite being old
25061,"I love this game.. ""I smell delicious"" -raider. as he is on fire! bwahahaha I love the side quests and all of the npc's in this game! very well thought out and great story line."
25062,"This is so epic, I got epic game for $5"
25063,im electing for president - stefix television 2020
25064,"Quirky and entertaining in just the right way, you can feel the love poured into this game by the dev team and the community. Particular care was put into each of the expansions, each one adds almost an entire new game's worth of content and are highly recommended. One of the best looter shooters I've played to date and, in my opinion, the purest borderlands experience. Although the other Borderlands games are still great, none could recapture the magic of Borderlands 2."
25065,pog game
25066,Its ok.
25067,Played this when I was a child
25068,Fun.
25069,A really good looter shooter with fun gameplay and well written and funny characters.
25070,"can play for hundreds of hours without the game getting old, best game in series. Must have for any FPS fan
10/10"
25071,"Its defo enjoyable, especially for first time players, but if you're a returning player who's playing a new character, you've gotta just sorta play until UVHM until the game really starts and becomes properly enjoyable."
25072,I mean... It's aight i guess
25073,its real fun even more fun with friends and has a lot of missons and is super funny
25074,YES
25075,good
25076,"This game defined ""shoot and loot"" when it came out and it set the standard for years.  Great gameplay, itemization, and storyline with fantastic voice acting.  The primary antagonist (Handsome Jack), the way he's written and voice acted, after about 40 hours of playing, you just want to see the SOB dead.  (This is in stark contrast to BL3 who's storyline isn't well written and the villians are just sad.)  Very satisfying game to play if you enjoy the genre.

The one great failing of BL2 is the multiplayer game.  Duping and cheating are the norm, if you join a game, it's safe to assume that at least half the people in the game are hacked in one way or another.  Kills the fun of this game in multiplayer.  Which is sad because the Single player mode of BL2 only goes so far, and cheating kills the fun of the multiplayer game.

But, for what they are charging for BL2 now, it's a solid purchase.  You'll easily get your money's worth out of it."
25077,fun
25078,only played a couple minutes its aight i guess
25079,O for Awesome!

25096,yep
25097,yep
25098,"very fun looter shooter. great story, epic moments 10/10 would recommend"
25099,I played over a thousand hours on console and how ever many it says above this sentence. i cant reccomend this game enough it has brought me such much joy over the 8 years its been out.
25100,amazing
25101,fun
25102,just a solid game mates
25103,very epic
25104,"This game unfortunately hasn't aged very well and pales in comparison to more modern looter-shooters. Borderlands 2's gunplay is one of the most uninspired ones I've ever seen in a gun-focused game, the abilities are somewhat underwhelming, all of the non-DLC characters are incredibly annoying with the sole exception of Jack, and the story itself is nothing really special, though it is serviceable for its purpose. And the humor... Oh god, it's so bad. It's like they asked boomers to dig up early 2000's references out of their graves, left them rotting under the sun for months, then jam-packed them in a game that came out 7 years too late. Maybe it's supposed to be satyrical, but honestly, I lost so many brain cells playing this I can't tell anymore.

The loot is somewhat fine, but it made me realize that I'm really not a fan of randomly-generated loot. Having to sift through dozens of very slightly different versions of the same gun only to get rid of them all because they all suck is one of the most tedious processes I've experienced in a while, especially considering how limited the inventory/vault space is. Billions of guns? More like 20 different archetypes of super annoying-to-use weapons with weird recoil, except Jakobs. Jakobs snipers/revolvers are the only confortable guns in this game

The DLCs, though, are another story. Their story is more interesting and takes itself less seriously, they are generally more rewarding and have a more original setting."
25105,"Borderlands is a wonderful franchise and they didn't do it wrong like they did with the Pre-Sequel and some of Borderlands 3. Borderlands 2 is a wonderful game with tons of killing, handsomeness, and fun new ways to build up your character. If you're coming from Borderlands 1 then I swear you will not be disappointed just beware the op levels can be unfair especially at op10 if you don't have a great build you will not survive. Farming, a huge part of this game is just straight up farming whether it's for a flying sandhawk or a perfect dpuh most will farm for the weapons that specifically work for there build so if your at like level 80 or you just got to op10 make sure you try to get the best weapon variant and parts watch youtube for guides (I recommend Joltz139 very experienced and will pretty much show any glitch or exploit on his yt). If you're new to bl2 play sal easy glitches easy to learn farming routes and just a fast character. Goodbye have a good time playing I swear you'll enjoy it!."
25106,"Great story, great charracters, the game is working and the joy never ends"
25107,Just buy the season pass FFS
25108,"This game is fun. Or, at least, it HAS the potential. 

Graphics? Awesome. Gameplay concept? Breaking. Actual lines behind the screen? Awful. Unplayable.

Why play a game that's not a game? Lol. 

It's annoying, really. And a waste of time. When you die, you get a ""Second Chance"" to kill someone and respawn before the time runs out. Guess what, they run away as FAST as possible, making ""Second Chance"" not only a fat waste of time, but also incredibly annoyingly waste of time. 

Second, too much bugs. I'm about to kill someone, always 1% HP and i immediately die from nothing. Over. And over. And over again.

I like this game. I love the concept. The gameplay is there, but... expect to waste a LOT of time, because the game decided that it wants to make you wait, or it wants you to not play, or.. who knows. It clearly was put INTO the game, with intentions to make you RAGE. Otherwise, such simple, annoying stuff would have taken out. Otherwise, this game would have been a solid 9/10."
25109,"one of the most fun games. it runs pretty smooth, even on a bad computer"
25110,Awasom game
25111,10/10 replayable value
25112,"Gun looting-shooting adventure. Story, enemy variety, guns - taken to eleven! 

Character driven story, by one of most interesting villains from any video games that I have experienced.
Biggest enemy variety from my experiences - no game I know stands even close.*
Guns. Maybe Destiny 2 is something comparable?*

*Perhaps other Borderlands games does better, at guns and enemy variety departement. 
But BL2 excels at it's story! The BL2 story is long and with lows though, so be prepared for a lenghty adventure. - With tons of sidequests along the way!"
25113,"I've played every single Borderlands game in the franchise to date. I have all the packs and updates for each, everything. This game has the most hours of my life and that is saying something. Not only is it the best game in the franchise, I have yet to find a game, any video game, that can top Borderlands 2 for me. The style, the story, the humour, mechanics, challenges, loot, characters, the class system, the music; all of it phenomenal and all of it replayable. It's very easy to lose yourself in this world. The updates are decent, but even without them this game is a work of art in game play and execution. Small bugs can happen and it's modable! If you're ever lost on any aspect of the game, it's been out long enough to have heaps of guides and tutorials to help you get acclimated. And good news: you don't have to have played the first Borderlands to understand what's going on in the story. They catch you up quickly and nearly seamlessly. Whether you're new at shooters or want a wonderful co-op experience, this game is legendary. I have 1,300+ hours on record so far for many great reasons and I will be coming back to it again soon to add more. I love it that much. Witty, fun, and tons of subtle pop culture references. One word of advice; if you want the most fun out of this game, try and get all the DLC, ESPECIALLY Assault On Dragon Keep. And if you want to be a conductor of the poop train and ride shiny meat bicycles, get the Psycho pack and Mechromancer pack. If you had to pick only one of the Borderlands games to play, make it this one. The rest are wonderful as well, but Borderlands 2 is the leader of the pack."
25114,its a great game with a good story
25115,"pretty slick
"
25116,"I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good loot and shoot with an RPG aspect. There are skill trees, different classes, and is highly addictive to play. WARNING: I would only recommend playing with friends though, otherwise the game gets pretty stale and fast."
25117, For the homies
25118,"I played for 30 minutes so far, and it's a wonderful game. Claptrap's quirky little jokes are quite funny and makes the world of Borderlands much more enjoyable. I recommend you get this game really soon because the sale is making it pretty cheap so if you're unsure, maybe buy B2 before you wanna get the third game (Deadline Until the Sale is gone for Borderlands:   August 20th)"
25119,Games trash
25120,Handsome Jack is a meme. That is all.

25140,Its good
25141,Just grow some and buy it
25142,"This is a fine game. Years ago I enjoyed it for about 200 hours. Some parts, and some of the DLC in particular might even be excellent. I fondly remember Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage as hilarious and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep as heart-touching. The Dragon Keep DLC might well be among my favorite game segments.

Why then am I giving this a negative review? Because I wanted to play a bit of it again, only to discover that in 2019 Gearbox gutted one of the major features for the endgame of this game, OP levels in Digistruct Peak, cutting content that had been available for years and requiring players to buy their new DLC to be able to access it again. 

That's right, they cut PAID DLC content, asking you to pay again for a new DLC to access it. How is that even legal? Who the hell knows. 

F U, Gearbox.

Context: Prior to around June 2019 the ""first Ultimate Upgrade Pack and Ultimate Upgrade Pack 2"" DLCs raised level cap to 72 and allowed you to play through the ""challenging “Raid on Digistruct Peak” map offering even more high-level play"" by repeating progressively harder challenge runs from level 72 to OP8, effectively making the level cap level 80 in terms of gear, but skills were still capped at 72.
Gearbox wanted to sell Commander Lilith DLC and apparently felt this made it awkward for them to sell a new level cap of 80, so instead they gutted this DLC that people HAD ALREADY PAID FOR and made it next to worthless, as all OP levels now require you to be level 80, which requires you to buy the new Lilith DLC.

This is exactly how you burn customers and interest them in sailing discounts for your products, Gearbox."
25143,"A great sequel to a established franchise. Very memorable characters. Unique enemies which you can play off of each other to make them fight for you (i.e. Raging Goliaths, or Bots against the Wildlife at the Exploitation Reserve). And as always, more guns than you'll ever feel comfortable throwing away in your limited backpack."
25144,haha my brain goes brr brr
25145,Excellent gameplay and art style in particular. Overall very good
25146,Epic GAME
25147,"Can't believe it's taken me so long to review this game. The reason I say that is because from the moment I first played it I knew I was going to love it. As the story progressed and I got to know its main cast I fell in love. The characters are funny but also dramatic, the action fast and fun and the main antagonist will make you love hating him. If I had any complaints it's that Gearbox's DLC scheme is annoying with there being so many and a sad case of greed overtaking good game design. That said the only DLC you really MUST have is Tiny Tina's Assault On Dragon's Keep. It's hands-down the best DLC for any game since Diablo II's Lord of Destruction expansion. 

I seriously love this game and still play through its campaign at least a few times a year. If you love first person shooters, love loot and lots of guns and enjoy drama mixed in with your chaotic comedy and a whole lot of action it's well worth the money spent."
25148,"yea its good
i like the little chatty robot"
25149,very enjoyable with friends
25150,best game for linux and for play alone

25155,"This is a dope game, it has intresting and fun characters that you grow attached too. There's a lot to discover and do in the world they live in. By far one of my favoirte games, and its a shooter one too which is even more cool and fits in. 10/10 Jack bad man"
25156,One of the greatest online RPG's ever made.
25157,"If you're new to the series or just want more to play until the next Borderlands 3 DLC, the game offers a massive amount of content with all the dlcs and a fun open world rpg shooter overall :)

25161,10/10
25162,jegg
25163,You have to buy dlcs to continue. What is this EA?
25164,great game for solo and playing with friends
25165,"One of the best games ever made. I've been a fan of this game for years and it still never gets old. The story is great and the crass humor and pop culture references never fail to put a smile on my face. And trying to tackle all the raid bosses solo is a ton of fun. I love the Tiny Tina DLC so much that I actually now own a Bunkers and Badasses T-shirt with her likeness on it. If you've never played it, you're really missing out."
25166,Game that has it's own unique style but also rich main story and funny side quests. Definitely recommend! :D
25167,Pretty good game
25168,It's so fu*king good)

25170,Great Game

25172,"Play it, it's funny. Don't expect a deep, life-changing story but it's pretty funny, enjoy the shoot 'n loot. Can be very addictive!"
25173,Got it for real cheap a good game to play good story but boring as fuck if you got no one to play it with you. Just make sure to have friends unlike me :'(.
25174,meat.
25175,Very satisfying and fast paced once you start fleshing out your build

25182,Very fun my fav game of all time!!!
25183,It's borderlands 2. WHat more can I say. Buy !!! Play!!! Highly recommended. Lifts depression !!!!
25184,"In my opinion, the best Borderlands game story wise. Well rounded characters, great humor and spectacular worldbuilding make this my favorite entry to the Borderlands series. Gunplay is stupid fun and smooth, and the special abilities are really great ideas. I've beat the game twice on console and purchase the PC version just so I can have it on another platform. I cannot recommend this amazing game enough."
25185,"Kill things to get better loot to kill more things, what's not to like!"
25186,"It's been eons since I last played an immersive FPS (yeah, I'm ancient...) Really glad I picked this 'un for my first foray back into the digital mayhem...scads of loot, an obscene selection of weaponry/armor/items, fantastic world design overall. I love it! (and happy to say, the re-learning curve hasn't been too strenuous...s'like riding a railgun-mounted bicycle, it's allll coming back to me now! Semper Gumby!)"
25187,Y E S
25188,yes
25189,"Cannot play without connecting to terrible 3rd party social ""service""."
25190,Always has been a fallback game for me. Easily one of the most replayable games I've experienced.
25191,Really fun game! Even better with friends!
25192,"Basically, the last update and the handover to Shift for online play capability has broken the game. After logging into Shift with my steam account and finally getting on, I come to find out that I can't actually set my network options to Friends-Only/Online. At times, when starting the game, it attempts to connect to an online session, but the network options past that screen are what's holding it back from connecting to the online session in the first place. I came back to this because BL3 wasn't holding me, but screwed here because I can't go back to BL2. I've seen the roll-back instructions, but I feel it's ridiculous to have to go through those hurdles - especially if you're trying to explain it to someone else who isn't rather tech-savvy. Wanted to boot this up to play with an old friend, but I guess it's an uninstall instead now. :("
25193,aA
25194,"i open borderlands 2 chat and say hi

25206,Great nostalgic game.
25207,ok
25208,a great classic. good to pass by the time and overall it feels really rewarding when you level up

This game is very fun :)"
25211,simeaa
25212,"The best coop game I have ever played. It's so much fun to play, the story is really good (even on the 4th playthrough), the characters are really well written. The villain is one of the best I can remember and the I know it's subjective but the jokes are so good. Also if you get this game, buy the tina tina dlc aswell it's just as good as the main game."
25213,"lolll funny gamee
i qwoulf think it would gffunny if there wer emore fart i think"
25214,Krieg exists. Need I say more?
25215,This game is still amazing though 3rd one isnt that fun
25216,Bought this while it was on sale it was worth it highly recommend this game!
25217,FUN
25218,they do go boom
25219,I have nothing else to say but that I love this game.
25220,"it was alright, i only played a few hours"
25221,animation kills all the above about the game keep going
25222,One of those games that I could play over and over again. Not too sure why though.
25223,"To say that I've put a few hours into this game would be an understatement.

I've enjoyed this game better than the first Borderland, better than the Pre-Sequel and much better than Borderlands 3.

Aside from a few misteps this is the game where Gearbox really hit their stride. In game play mechanics, story-telling and even DLC (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon-Keep is commendable). Not to mention the co-op mode is great. I've had a ton of fun playing this game with friends.

They've done a fantastic job.

It's a testament to that stride since I seem to want to come back and revisit this game time and time again. It fits well like a comfortable pair of pants. My only wish anymore is that there are no new horizons to explorer using these same mechanics.

Anyway, I highly recommend this game and would hope someone would give it a chance if they needed something to play."
25224,"Awesome fun giving game, it is an incredible game to spend quality time with quality friends. It's fit for looters as much as speed runners."
25225,yes just play
25226,is fun
25227,"Tried to play with a friend but it appears they released a co-op update a few months ago and it has broken multiplayer. On top of that, it hasn't been patched and it has been months now. It is like planned obsolescense (or however you spell it) but for video games"
25228,"Funny FPS open world game the story of game is epic dont need to say anything more about that,graphic is good,i recommend this game to everyone who love open world co-op or solo fps games you can drive tanks,shoot, upgrade your skill, buy weapons,explore the whole Pandora E P I C-G A M E"
25229,Nice C0cK
25230,good game
25231,coop is fun
25232,Fun game
25233,it's alright
25234,"This game is in my top five, I like the characters, the graphics, the music, the missions and the gunplay...oh the gunplay...tonnes of guns and they are just getting better and better. I have got the DLCs, and Psycho, so it is time to kill Jack, again."
25235,"fun game and even more fun in multiplayer :D
"
25236,yes
25237,Hours of fun!
25238,Awesome ♥︎
25239,"I heard number 3 is better. I certainly hope so but that's honestly not hard to do: Fistful of Frags is a more enjoyable experience. 

First off, a certainly quality of life point that isn't gamebreaking but is supremely frustrating. The pathfinding AI is trash, as is the inability to automatically step up onto a slightly higher elevation. I have been trapped by the edge of a corner many times while trying to back up, or by a six inch elevation change that it wants me to jump onto instead of walk up. Almost unsurprisingly, I die due to lack of movement freedom nearly every time.

This game was also clearly optimized for multiplayer. The solo experience is unbalanced as hell. Enemies frequently have large amounts of health that multiple players could handle but a single person can only barely cope with. Simply adjusting enemy stats based on number of players would make sense and balance encounters. I doubt they did that, though if they did, they failed. They wouldn't even have to count players, because it really only applies to one player games. The tag team fight with Lilith against two badass bullies is very manageable, even though there are two at a time, because a second damage dealer is a ton of help, and acts as something to split the attention of enemies.

Weapons are everywhere and only mildly useful. Outside of a few specific circumstances, sniping isn't encouraged, since enemies don't render/spawn until you are within mid-range most of the time, even at max graphics. Add to that the power of every enemy to lock onto your location the moment you hit anyone nearly every time, and sniping is basically only helpful in multiplayer (again, outside of a few random instances with really good cover). The ideal play style is with a mid-range high power medium magazine rifle. You should have a backup rifle with either a contextually useful element or faster reload as a backup. You should have a pistol or submachinegun that does elemental damage. Fight enemies at midrange to close. That's the ideal and the other playstyles are kind of shafted by a lack of equally viable options. The class options almost feel like a tacked on joke.

Oh, speaking of a bad solo experience, all enemies are brought back to full health when you die. That doesn't sound bad on paper, but there are some instances (the first of which is the assault on the Bloodshot hideout) where you can encounter enemies with good positioning that can take you out with one or two hits. That's not awful for multiplayer since everyone can spread out. For single player, all fire is on you, and you have to hope that you can kill one of them before you die, because otherwise that enemy will be healed upon return. This means you'll spend a good amount of money dying and coming back until you land the lucky shot you needed to take out one of the enemies. Rinse and repeat until they're all gone. Congrats, there went at least half an hour.

I have never played multiplayer on this game. I cannot imagine it would be so much fun that it would justify this games existence. Maybe for some people it's unbelievable and the greatest game ever for multiplayer and that's fine. But do not buy this game if you want a well-made single player experience. Or money."
25240,Very re-playable!
25241,"Has always been a favourite, and always will be!"
25242,"Awesome game, awesome story 
in the late game community mod as the perfect thing to enjoy the game even after the official game ends
Great for Coop!"

Very AWESOME game, it takes hours and hours just to complete the story but before that EVEN MORE hours to complete the side quests AND EVEN MORE hours to complete every single DLC, this game has hundreds of hours worth of action packed game play single or co-op up to 4 players. And literally millions of guns in the game, it is graphically amazing especially the ULTRA HD textures, definitely worth it."
25245,"its a good gam,e"
25246,"It's a very good game, it doesnt get boring. so play it"
25247,yes. worth money and time
25248,the best
25249,cool
25250,Gun go boom
25251,Still rocks in 2020. Great way to kill time during quarantine. It can run on wood pc 10/10

25253,nice
25254,"Guns are awesome, story is fine, comedy is unparalleled."
25255,"Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games. it's fun and enjoyable. I like the story and this game's villain, Handsome Jack, is the best villain ever (In my opinion of course). Handsome Jack is the epitome of these realistic villains. ... It is not his prominence that makes him a good and realistic villain, but rather the way he acts, and what is revealed about him. THIS SEQUEL DOES IT RIGHT."
25256,A good game to play when you have nothing else to do.
25257,It's free now?
25258,!@#$%^&*()_
25259,bruh
25260,"haha yeah man
"
25261,Best Borderlands.
25262,"A sequel that does it right, taking what works from the original and making it bigger and more varied. Aside from the millions of guns and variations available in the game, the wealth of vanilla content and dlc make BL2 a game with hundreds of hours of content to play. Can be enjoyed solo or CO-OP, you'll have a great time either way."
25263,gg
25264,Fun

25268,"Fun, easy to pick up and play with lots of loot to find. Most PCs can run this game and it way better with friends"
25269,i mean its old but its fun to play with
25270,this game is my favorite game of all time just because of the fact how much replay value is in the game.
25271,haha little girl big rbot :)
25272,"This game is tarnished by the fact ive restarted it 10000000 times with friends who stop playing after a couple days. 

I will say i streamed this game, it crashed on me, and i ended up losing my entire save so in the end i haven't picked it up since. 

Its not a terrible game, i just know terrible people i guess. 

10 cell shaded pixels out of 10.   

-zero or bust."
25273,"It's not great, but it's enjoyable when you just need a distraction. Don't binge it, but come back to it over time."
25274,yes
25275,Its an amazing game but dont take my word i only have 400hours of playtime
25276,i like the looting system and the story line is descent.
25277,"The game's story is just all over the place and hilariously extreme, Like i consider it a rather chaotic and explosive piece of artwork."
25278,"very poggers, handsome jack very good villain, probably the best game in the series"
25279,"I don't really get the praise for this game. Guns feels janky and inconsistent, rarely do you get a gun that feels good to use, and when you do, you've gotta abandon it an hour later when you find something better. And the humour is really hard to sit through. Though tbf Handsome Jack is a brilliant character, it's just a shame the game was so shit I couldn't be arsed to stick around and see where the story goes."
25280,this game is shit
25281,"Hilarious dialog is worth whatever price you pay. Gameplay is great, as well!"
25282,"dumb graphics fortnite look-a-like ,not my fav story ,sorry but shit agme"
25283,Just enjoy the different characters you can be.  An awesome way to relax on a rainy day.
25284,haha vault hunter go brrr
25285,It is a good game plays well an dosn't screw up in any way. An if u guys want to see it in game play then go over to Slipperysammy7 on facebook gaming an check out my stream.  I play call of duty warzone an borderlands an other cool games.

If you get the GOTY edition you're set you have AT LEAST 60-70+ hours worth of gameplay MAYBE MORE if you play the dlcs, this is mostly because of the different modes you play in. I've played the game so many times that I've lost count and ITS STILL GOOD. If you want a fps game with A SHIT TON of guns to choose from then this is a game for you."
25322,Really took my time in finishing the normal mode. Highly enjoyable. I'm 8 years late in playing this game yet feels like this game just came out a few months ago.

This is why:

+ It's fun to play. Solo or with friends
+ You can spend a lot hours playing this game
+ This main squad is probably my favorite from all Borderlands games
+ For me, this game has one of best villains ever. Really
+ You can play it more than one time
+ The story is the best in this part
+ A LOT OF GUNS. Loot! Loot!
+ DLCs are great. I love that RPG one

- It's kinda hard when you play in full squad
- Some quests/moments are boring
- It can be also hard if you don't want to do side quests

Worth to play anyway"

25350,"By far, one of the most OVERRATED games to come out in the last decade. 

The dialogue is unbelievably unfunny, with the boring and unoriginal story essentially acting as background noise for Handsome Jack's jokes, which could've been written by an 11 year old. Despite this, Jack's dialogue is still superior to the rest of the cast, with claptrap probably being one of the most irritating and cringe characters to have ever been written in all of entertainment media. I get that he's supposed to be a dork, but the degree to which the writers went out of their way to beat the player over the head with his dorkiness was not a show of good writing. It was the equivalent of sh1tting in a hamburger and calling it an ""Artisan Sandwich"" and then proceeding to sh1t all over the customers face to show how much of a good cook you are.

The game-play is one of the most boring and formulaic that I have ever experienced in an FPS. ""ZOMG GUYZZ WE ADDED LIKE, A BAJILLION WEPONS WOOO"" Half the weapons all function in the same way and are just different colors. You have around 6 types of guns, and the million or so guns in the game are just reskins of those 6 guns. The game-play itself is just a grindfest of shooting at mobs. Not innovative or creative in the slightest. Not much more to say other than that, mainly because the game itself is enormously shallow.

Recommended IQ level for this game: 60 - 85"
25351,"Couldn't get into the game play, story, or art style. Friends hyped it up and it was a let down."
25352,"Yes Steve very sexy

25353,I like all the small funny details in the game! Very funny! And unique guns!

25358,One of my favorite games of all time.
25359,"I played this for like 390+ hours when it first came out, now years later I am playing it again before I start B3. If you like fps's, and have overlooked this in the past, get the hell in their and buy the mega pack. You will be busy for the next year of so!!!"
25360,"Jogo bom demais, para zerar 100% do jogo se vai ter q amar ele msm, pq se vai ter q zerar sa bosta (a historia principal) 3 vezes para chegar lvl max, se vc gosta do jogo n é um problema fora isso n vejo outra coisa q possa enjoar ou atrapalhar sua gameplay"

25368,Played this game on like 4 consoles. It's fire
25369,Really fun played way more on on console 100% recommend it so fun
25370,Good game its a good time sink if you wanna mess around people never are very serious and there are lots to experiment with bugs weapon builds ways to get out of the map bosses with huge amounts of heath (seriously soloing raid bosses with intended equipment takes at least 3 hours of running gunning and getting lucky) all in all take your time focus and shoot!
25371,Its fun
25372,"Epic Games has fucked me once again.

Windows players cannot currently cross-play with other OSes without a convoluted downgrade process, due to a breaking change to add support for the EGS."
25373,Pure fun and mayhem.

25378,eeeeh not that good but worth trying out
25379,god damn it the bees are back
25380,Best shooter ever!
25381,"This game was really fun.  I've got over 400 hours in it.  I would not buy it now.  They've uploaded a patch that attempts to force a sign in to their servers, runs advertisements on the launch screen, and broke multiplayer for many people by switching it to their servers instead of steam.  Stay away from Gearbox games."
25382,i just love this game man
25383,"If you haven't played this yet...Why? it's worth it

25402,"God this game is so good, and I haven't even done everything I could do (OP8 raid bosses really kick my ass). If your looking for a fun looter shooter that you can waste your life away on, this is it. I also recommend the follow up Borderlands 3, although not as good storytelling wise, the gameplay is almost as good as this, and that is saying something. If your new to this game take my advice and don't touch the OP levels unless you are Salvador with a grog nozzle and a DPUH. Great game, fun classes, your gonna have a good time"
25403,best game ever made
25404,This game is the classic looter shooter
25405,i love this game

25413,gud
25414,Ive owned this game on every console its released on minus xbox one and I definately reccomend it on every platform. along with all of the rest of the series.
25415,"I'll make this short, this game has an amazing story as well as great game play. If you do not want to spend $60 on bl3 and want a better story, get this game. Only downside is the game is old so graphics are limited."

25421,I have the shiniest meat bicycle.
25422,This was my favorite game from my xbox days so it is nice to play it with all of the dlc on pc.
25423,"Love this game! Like the story just as much as the Prequel and Borderlands 1! The whole series previous to this game has been building upon the individual who is antagonist of Borderlands 2... and it all comes to an exciting conclusion. Character skins are unique and fun in this Borderland game. Borderlands 2 has a nice weapon customization aspect built into it as well... the amount of weapons and equipment is endless, as with all BL games, giving the game an exciting spin. Play solo or play with friends through crazy FPS gameplay!"
25424,One of my all time favourite games when i had my Xbox 360. I recommend playing with a friend ( it is 1-4 players) as its more fun but still very enjoyable by yourself. Love all the characters abilities and skills you can unlock. 9/10
25425,This game is my childhood on my terrible HP laptop on rainy days. Will always love it.

25439,good shooter
25440,"Probably THE best looter shooter you can find

25441,"""Look out. Badass Loader.""

- Roland 2020"
25442,"Yes very good, DLC's too."
25443,No Ava 10/10
25444,nice
25445,"Has a strong sense of humour, big NPC characters (like like Moxi and Claptrap or new like Mr Torgue) that are mostly for humour but often having something darker and sadder behind the jokes, an enjoyable baddie for the main game (DLC big bads can vary). Story builds well, cartoon graphics hold up well even now. The action remains enjoyable throughout with constant loot rewards with always hope for the next great gun with some having personality behind them, pace never drags.

The DLC is varied, you get an extra character, you get the headhunter packs which are short but usually fun one map adventures themed around a holiday and the main DLC campaigns. These focus on adventures with certain characters, have their own settings and bosses, they do differ greatly from each other, they retain the sense of humour. Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is a grind and feels slow but the others keep the usual quality, can get weapons at a set level so the loot rewards feel under-powered for the DLC campaigns. 

All in all, a fun time with plenty of humour and enjoyable over the top characters."
25446,pretty good game about overthrowing the richest capitalist in the world
25447,Fun. good game to unwind and just not focus for a while
25448,This game has a matching grip
25449,after 150 total hours there's still things to do
25450,"nice nice
"
25451,For an old game it sure freezes a lot
25452,"Great game, definatley worth the few bucks you can get it for today, 10/10 would get again."
25453,Eh. Its alright I guess....
25454,"Got seriously motion sick playing this.
What's with games and walk wobbles... Let me turn that shit off."
25455,"""Borderlands 2"" is perhaps the most enjoyable ""looter shooter"" out there, and even if it comes with its own waves of tedium and aged qualities, I am inclined to stick with this interpretation.

""Borderlands 2"" is an experience that I feel many have tried to capture, but failed miserably. Although not perfect, the game balances action with humor to make an engaging open-world that isn't afraid to make fun of itself and the many tropes of other games, even if it does retain some rather undesirable side content that many games of this same genre employ. Often, mission vendors will have obnoxiously blatant fetch quests for the player to do along with the main content. Although not all of them are bad, a fair amount just ask the player to go get whatever desired amount of something it wants and to bring it back to them. It would be better to leave this sort of thing out of the game, as less that is quality is better than quantity that drags the game down. Although, these are optional and you don't have to do them, they help towards leveling up your character, which does help with progression, so either you end up doing them to get that extra edge or likely go in unprepared with weaker stats, weapons, and so on.

Though rather critical, the rest I have to say about this game is mostly positive. I really enjoy the style of this game. The cell-shaded graphics help it to retain its visual quality years after its release, instead of lending it to age poorly. The character design and their often witty characterization is welcome, as it's nice to have a break from the many games in this genre that take themselves too seriously, even when they are just as ridiculous in a sense. The many other things, such as the menus, areas, and small details also work towards this game's excellent stylization. The developers seem to have had a lot of fun making this game, and in turn, it is a lot of fun experiencing the many things it has to offer. The world and the main story that accompanies it is a surprisingly intriguing one, and this is thanks to the characters, especially Handsome Jack. Few games have had a quality antagonist in the vein of Handsome Jack, and this is thanks to him being the most developed character in the game, as well as one of the first you encounter. 

The questions of morality and the like are what make your position so questionable, and also has you wondering whether you are ""right"" in your actions. Though, again, this game doesn't take itself too seriously, therefore these moments of self-reflection, when presented, are usually more impactful when you don't expect to have them. Anyways, ""Borderlands 2"" is a lot of fun to experience, and surely even more so when played with four friends, as that seems the most enjoyable way to play through the game. Though, fun is still to be had just playing it on your own or with one other person, even if not intended. Though it holds tedium and you must replay the game to get the most content out of it, it is still one worth picking up to try out at least once, as nothing really nails what this title embodies as well as ""Borderlands 2"".

[RATING: 8.0/10]"
25456,This game is very good i enjoyed all my 163 hours and see many more to come. Its a game that lets you play over and over and still mantain fun. You can do so much with mods and stuff a game worth its price.
25457,"Disclaimer: My scores/reviews are almost always based on having bought the game at close to the ""lowest historical price"" on steam at time of purchase.

Quick score: 5/5"
25458,It's a great game.
25459,THIS IS THE BEST GAME
25460,Bro it's fucking borderlands 2.
25461,good game play now
25462,"Great game, great sense of humor! 
Even if you aren't the best at shooting games, or have any sense in what weapons are good or not. You can still enjoy this game :)"
25463,"This is a very fun game. Personally I think it is the best in the entire franchise. I have a little over 200 hours on this game so I think that speaks for itself, but If you need any more reason the characters are charismatic, the main antagonist is one that you love to hate, and the story line is interesting, but still easy to follow."
25464,salt the wounds
25465,best game. much loot. very fun. buy on sale for 5 bucks n always come back
25466,Yeet
25467,Good game with good gameplay and good graphics

25476,"Truly destiny's cooler older brother. I also love the cartoony style and the stupid NPCs. Overall a great game, can't wait to play more."
25477,This shit is straight gas no cap
25478,super fun me an my friend play all the time and its just amazing!
25479,i lost my virginity to the first boss. it was pretty mediocre.
25480,"so many guns,


so many"
25481,amazing
25482,"gameplay is fun, and you meet a lot of really interesting characters!"
25483,Best thing ever the one thing that i don't like is that i don't get the newest dlc with the hansome collection
25484,"[h1] Looter's Paradise [/h1]
Want guns? Want lots of em? Want to mow down everythin while listening to some badass soundtracks? Then what are you waitin for?! Try this super loaded box of awesomeness! Enter the world of BORDERLANDS!"
25485,always had fun playing it
25486,"This game is by far one of the best and most adventurous 
games out there. i really enjoyed this one."
25487,"'Borderlands 2' is better than its predecessor (Borderlands 1) and so much better than its successor (Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel). I can't compare this game to the newest game in the franchise (Borderlands 3) as I have not played it, however, it would have to be near perfect for it to be better than this game. The gameplay is amazing, the graphics are unique, the story is good, and the game has great replayability value. If you want an open world story game this is a great choice. 

If you're not into grindy games and you want to play but don't want to stick hundreds of hours into it to get good items, you can download the 'Borderlands 2 Save File Editor by Gibbed' online or by using the following link: 

https://mentalmars.com/guides/borderlands-2-save-file-editor-by-gibbed/

The save editor allows you to manually edit your characters levels, weapons and skill trees. This is a pretty good software for if you've run out of things to do and you just want to mess around. I would recommend you complete the game at least once without cheating first for the sense of accomplishment, but you do you. 

I would highly recommend you get this game, however, retail price of £20 is a bit high for an 8+ year old game so I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale."
25488,great game
25489,Haha gun go brrrr
25490,"its borderlands 2, you should buy it for handsome jack alone tbh"
25491,"Je, good game"
25492,"Better then one and handsome collection
"
25493,"A tedious grindfest with eye-roll-inducing ""humor"" and difficulty primarily in the form of numbers climbing ever ludicrously higher. The shooting feels fun enough that playing with friends can save it, mostly, but even then, being called to run all over the big, bland map to do repetitive quests is AT BEST merely not enough to ruin the time spent socializing."
25494,is nice
25495,"Explosions, GUNS, great story, LOTS OF GUNS, comedy, BIG GUNS, fun to play with friends, COOL GUNS, fun characters, and  did I mention the guns are great and come in plenty of variety!"
25496,Is a very good game. Would highly recommend.
25497,Literal best game
25498,Yummy loot
25499,Love the game play its even great to stream on twitch!
25500,"fun, fluid, crazy and artsy. its a great game with some cringy humour and story but I mean are we realllllyyyy here for the story? its a fun shoot em loot em game."
25501,cannot get past downloading updates left it on my computer for 2 hours and nothing. I have good internet and run a 3900x paired with a 5700xt please give me feedback on how to fix or patch this bug
25502,"""Light the fuses bitches"""
25503,"great game
"
25504,I like the loots and I like the shoots.
25505,"This is a great first person shooter. It's not the usual... like Battlefield 3 or 4, where you just play online. It has a really interesting and funny campaign mode, where other players can even join you and help you in your mission!"
25506,"Latest update added a click-through EULA that appears every time I start the game, despite declining it EVERY TIME, forced me to sign up to an online service to even START the game I have already paid for and played for years, forced me to change my character name and added in-game ads for Borderlands 3. Congrats guys - I will never buy another Borderlands, Gearbox or 2K product again."
25507,This game is incredible.
25508,The Best Borderlands Game
25509,Iz really gud
25510,"A total classic. A must have fps. Have more than 1000 hours and always keep coming back for more. I have yet to discover all weapons, I think I will never get to. Great dlcs, lots of humor and added content. I know there's the 3rd one now, I got it and I love it, but this one was and is imho the best borderlands ever. I would love it if they would make a new dlc for this game. One can dream, right? Also, great to play wirth friends, it's so much fun. If you don't have it, get it, it deserves to be bought."
25511,"One of my favourite games ever. The amount of content is absolutely huge, locations, guns, enemies, so more guns, a lot of interesting and well made quests and side quests, and obviously some more guns. The story is a 6/10, but it's not that important. The DLCs are totally worth it, and you'll miss out on a lot if you won't get them."
25512,I got this game when it was like 5$ on steam. So far it has been one of the best games i have had and do recommend it to other gamers.
25513,It is a great game it also has a good story line
25514,"It's ok I guess.

46 hours later.
I still think it's okay"
25515,It's a great game !
25516,"fantastic game, holds up, can't recommend this game enough
"
25517,"I previously played on my old Xbox 360, then a lil on my Xbox one. Put many hours on my 360, beat it once and got high lvl for multiple characters. few complaints, really good overall. One of my dislikes is how bad the progression with the ""Badass ranking"". You get miiscule upgrade t0 stats, like.2%, not even 1% sometimes! I would use 50 pts just to get a stat +5%, crazy!"
25518,Amazing game with like more then 10k guns and fun combat.
25519,"In my opinion, Borderlands 2 is a thrilling sequel to the looter shooter series. Although it is not as good as the first game, the loot was kind of meh. Story wise it's good, DLC's are even better. Should you get this game? Yeah obviously."
25520,this game has to be the best game i have ever played its so adventures and it never gets boring
25521,its fun funny and amazing story
25522,Masterpiece
25523,game is sick
25524,"Game that can keep me playing for hours. I have this game over two years and always happy to come back and play again, single or coop. Also the story is long and interesting, reccomended."
25525,I'm not gay but Handsome Jack lives up to his name. 10/10 would sma.. uhm I mean play again
25526,Just a damn good game.
25527,Amazing.
25528,borderlands is borderlands
25529,"-Got a free Rainbow sniper from SHIFT codes
-Ended up creating another toon just to use it
-Sniper moans and says sexy lines whenever you aim or kill something.
-Welp, gonna have to play the whole game again now.
"
25530,its ok
25531,"not really my type of game but its well made I guess, get it if you don't mind a fuck ton of tutorials like holy shit"
25532,i found it really fun to play
25533,Fun.
25534,"Borderlands 2 is short but an amazing game This game is a fast-paced FPS with mindblowing combat mechanics, and the massive gun variety makes this game even more intriguing. Every mission and side quest have their own uniqueness which makes the gameplay feels more challenging. Of course, this game is worth playing more than once."
25535,a family that slags together stays together!!
25536,the people who made this game think the people who play it are idiots.
25537,"I'd never gotten a chance to play this game until recently. Everything I'd heard of it made it seem like it would be a REAL fun time. It was undersold, this game quickly became one of my favorites."
25538,yes
25539,Yes
25540,"Game was great, never had a problem with it until it started needing to connect to Steam and now it never renders properly anymore."
25541,good
25542,Yeah it's ok.
25543,its gun sex
25544,its fun
25545,"I mean steam asked me ''you played 236 hours would you recommend this game to other player? ''
 what! steam you ask me your seltf."
25546,very fun and very replayable ! the storyline is the best in the franchise so far
25547,Loot. Loot. Loot.
25548,Good.
25549,Ez4Fun
25550,Borderlands 2 is a super fun game although claptrap makes me want to rip my head off.
25551,yay fun
25552,Even though the game never fully clicked with me there is no denying how fun and lighthearted this game is! Its a fun time especially for fans of looter shooters
25553,5/5. Great loot shooter with interesting and fun character and solid DLC.
25554,One of the best games of all time.
25555,"Great looter shooter, and best if you can play it with some friends. When it goes on a sale, you can get it REALLY cheap, so I'd suggest keeping it on wishlist until you get the sale email."
25556,"Interesting, different and addictive gameplay!"
25557,Everything
25558,"SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!!!!! NOT THE LEGS, NOT THE ARMS, IN THE FACE!!!!!!!!!!! SHOOTMESHOOTMESHOOTME IN THE FACE!!!!!!!"
25559,A classic
25560,The overall raw action in this game does not let you down or get used up this game never gets boring
25561,
25562,"A very good game from Borderlands series, recommend to anyone that has played Borderlands (1) and to anyone new to the series."
25563,"The whole game is pretty good, the game is time killing, there are variable types of weapons, there are different skill tree that extend the character and shaping their playstyle, but the balancing is terrible as hell
The skill tree is just the difference of good and bad, some of the legendary or pearl weapons are worse than a green even with the best possible parts, and grog is stupidly broken
luckily theres community patch that makes a lots of weapons and skills worth using and overhaul mods, worth a try i guess"
25564,"NO, THIS GAME  VERY  BAD, PC CRASH NOT GUD  EXPERIANCE 0/10 NO PLAY AGAIN"
25565,"This game is gud, 11/10, would recommend but handsome jack should be called right toe Jack because he ain't that handsome :c"
25566,The best Looter Shooter. Hands down.
25567,Unable to cross play between Mac and PC due to the incompatibility of game versions. They need to fix this quick.
25568,It`s probably the best looter shooter out there
25569,pretty addicting story line of the game
25570,"Great game, especially if you get the handsome jack collection while on sale. Fun to play with friends or solo."
25571,Very fun fast pace gameplay and has a a lot of personality and an amazing art style
25572,I played the game almost 9 months now and I am still hooked every time I play it. Truly a recommended game for casual gaming
25573,"Genre:  
-AAA First person looter shooter

Fit for me:  
-Very poor fit, I don't play this type of game frequently

Pros: 
-Very unique, creative aesthetic 
-Tons of guns w/ different attributes
-Several characters make it easy to pick a character that suits your playstyle
-Playing w/ friends enhances the experience

Cons:
-The open world feels quite empty at times
-I never felt like I was selecting a gun that I liked, just whichever gun had the highest stats
-A lot of repetitive uninteresting enemies early on
-A lot of grinding to upgrade your character and weapons 
-Poor driving mechanics w/ in vehicles
-Walking around to find your next objective can feel very tedious and slow
-Need to put in a lot of hours to enjoy the more interesting, dynamic experience

Thoughts:
-So this game is just not for me.  It's always tough to judge a game 8 years after it was released, especially a beloved franchise like Borderlands.  I was told this game was a hilarious, innovative, fps w/ hundreds of cool guns and boatloads of content.  It's possible that all this is true but I don't have it in me to spend enough time to find out.  Early game there were tons of bullet sponges, lots of wondering around aimlessly, and killing a few random baddies here and there. 

Consensus:
-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and make up 25% of my reviews).  There are about 150k ppl on steam that absolutely adore this game, so if you like looter shooters, then this is probably worth a try.  I personally didn't enjoy my experience, so I will not be recommending this one."
25574,Fun with coop.
25575,Awesome game
25576,Fun
25577,gud
25578,I love this.
25579,its fun

25581,better than bl3 eden - 6 thats for sure
25582,"Very good

makes me want some big badonkadonks to blow my mind back so I can play this game again for the first time"
25583,like
25584,terrible
25585,"Always a good time, but can never keep a team together long enough to get through it all"
25586,hell yeah!!! x2
25587,"I've played this game since it came out, I had originally played on my xbox 360 but to this day, it is still an incredible game. Definitely hands down one of my favorite games. The game really never gets boring, if you play with friends... It's 10 times better! WE NEED MORE F***ING EXPLOSIONS!!! The main DLC (not those little missions that take like 20 minutes to beat) are absolutely worth it! Great job gearbox!"
25588,Amazing 10/10
25589,Yes
25590,it's the sauce
25591,"If you own a PC and are new to gaming, this game is a MUST try! One of the best games ever made, one of the classic masterpieces that everyone talks about ( with one of the best Villains ever made I would add) ! I bought this game without knowing a single thing about Borderlands in general and I was so surprised by how fun and enjoyable this game is. 
If I could add something else Id suggest buying the GOTY edition since it comes with some DLC's that are a must have to this game! 
Without any doubt I would 100% advise this game to everyone! 
Game on Vault Hunters!"
25592,
25593,"Was supposed to play the game with my friends, ended up playing alone, which was still a good game"

25600,"very fun game, played it on console a while ago. coming back to the game with crazy settings and MnK is a wonder to behold. My only complaint is that i bought the bundle with all dlc, and only half of them read as installed in game even though steam says they are all there. All in all a 5/5 star game."
25601,"incredible story and characters, all of which have personality. the guns have a lot of variety so its fun testing all of them out and the abilities are really cool.

4.5/5"
25602,Good game yes
25603,"This is one of my favorite games and an old classic. The replayability of the game is great and I have yet to get tired of this game since owning it on my xbox 360, to ps4, to now pc."
25604,"Played this with a good friend of mine. The story is fun, fast and flashy gameplay.

25607,"This playtime is not true to my actual playtime as I've played many hours, possibly days worth, on my PS4. I recently got this so that I could mod it and have something new. But even without the mods this game is worth it, having hours of gameplay and fun with plenty, and I mean plenty of replayability."

25619,Good Story Telling. Humorous. High performance
25620,"It's a fun game to play, from someone who enjoys the looter shooters but haven't experienced other games of the genre outside of this one. It's fun to experience cool weapons"

25634,"This game is so much better than borderlands 3, Bl3 isnt even making extra characters and krieg in bl2 was an amazing character. Plus Bl2 also has the community patch which also makes everything wrong with the game amazing. This is more grind heavy than Bl3 but whatever is a grindy game"

25671,"Über 100 Stunden auf Linux Mint 19.3 mit Proton. 

[h1] System,  Technik & Performance[/h1]
- Linux Mint 19.3
- CPU/RAM: i5-6600@3.30x4 / 16GB
- Grafik-Karte: Nvidia GTX 1070@8GB mit Treiber-Version 440.100
- Auflösung: 2560x1440

Installation: Da ich mit eine Gruppe von 3 anderen Freunden (Windows-User) spiele, musste ich die Proton-Version installieren. Die native Version ist nicht (mehr) Cross-Plattform fähig. Installation ist ansonten einfach, mann muss aber wie auf ProtonDB zu lesen die EXE umbennen.

Danach in 100 Stunden nur 4 Abstürze, in etwa genau soviele wie bei den Windows-Kollegen. Also kein Linux/Proton-Problem sondern vom Spiel.

Das Spiel ist gut gealtert. Durch den Comic-Stil wirkt die Grafik nicht veraltet und läuft auf älteren Rechnern noch gut. Frames stabil und keine sonstigen Performance-Probleme.

[h1] Spiel [/h1]
Süchtig machender Loot-Shooter mit Comic-Grafik und speziellem Humor.

Man Spielt es ähnlich wie Diablo um seinen Char immer weiter zu entwickeln mit neuen Skills und neuer Ausrüstung. Wenn einem der Gameplay-Loop gefällt kann man zig Stunden reinstecken, der Umfang ist meiner Meinung nach sehr hoch. (Ich bin jetzt nach 100 Stunden noch lange nicht durch)

Humor und Grafik-Stil sind sehr speziell, hier muss muss sich jeder fragen, ob einem das gefällt oder stört. 
"
25672,"A good game is one where a single bullet will do 35 million damage, and still not leave a dent in the boss' health bar. Of course this is end game stuff, the game scales such that playing it over three times is still fun; collecting better gear, exploring new parts of the map, and completing hilarious side quests keep you going."
25673,great
25674,butt stalion
25675,Loved it :)
25676,verr guud
25677,doesn't have a fishing minigame
25678,not fun
25679,Best game.
25680,Fun Game
25681,still getting me laid after 25 years. This game taught me how to feel again.
25682,Its a great game. I come back to it from time to time. Its perfect. It also has alot of replayability with the mods and patches. Definitly worth the money.
25683,good game
25684,yes was good would recommend
25685,"Played the first one, so decided to try the second game with my SO. I really like the continuation of the story and the villain. It was engaging although some parts were a little bland,  nevertheless you definitely want to know more and towards the end,  you would definitely want to kill the villain. Gameplay-wise, I don't think the formula changed from the first game. It was really grindy  and alot of back and forth that makes you feel bored and tired. Gun looks mostly the same just with different skin and stats. Enemies are also a little boring. They always come rushing out. Voice acting is really enjoyable and has alot of character.

If you really like a looter shooter,  then I guess I can recommend this game. But if you have restricted time in your hands, and prefer a less grindy  game, then this game might not be for you ."
25686,lit
25687,this game is my life
25688,Big fun.
25689,It's a banger. Especially with mods.
25690,raj
25691,"Its borderlands, if you've never played a game where the guns drop fast and furious, or if you've never played a game where there's a lot of developer content, and a absolute ton of player created content and a cult player following.  Then this is the game for you, after all this time and 2 borderlands type games created after, this is the game  I still come back to for fun."
25692,One of those games you have to play to experience it's own unique style.
25693,yes
25694,"good
"
25695,"There's nothing I can stay that thousands of other reviews haven't already covered. This game rocks, and still looks great 8 years after release."
25696,I've bought this game from the first release back on 360 including all the DLC's and ended up doing the same thing on both ps4 and pc and beat the game and sped ran it multiple times i honesty think the borderlands franchise has a lot of replay value in a series.
25697,YES
25698,ok
25699,Highly recommend it
25700,"Pretty good game, not guna lie"
25701,"He got rich in six months, how he do that? (How he do that?)
"
25702,thare is a pritty gril in here : )
25703,Has got a bit of guns.
25704,You have guns and its funny
25705,So crazy awesome
25706,The game might be a few years but it´s still a really great game. The achivements are pretty easy but there are a few tricky ones too. If you have all the dlcs you will have a lot to do before you have finished everything.
25707,Hilarious and a good way to blow of steam
25708,"Why not?
JA ENOT?"
25709,good game as much as the rest of the franchise ! :)
25710,vf
25711,10/10 must play
25712,Played this for years on console love this franchise grew up on it and im waiting to buy bl3 every game is worth the the buy
25713,"Pretty solid game for single player and Co-Op alike. If you're playing co-op, make sure you both go in with minimal pre-knowledge, as it can ruin the fun to get slurred around by someone who's played the game already."
25714,"Its an iconic game of the looter shooter, it is the best in the series. Pick it up and have fun till you have to TRY and put it down"
25715,So many fking guns!!!
25716,"This game might have the most satisfying combat out of any game I've ever played. Not only does your character run incredibly fast, but there is so much to do in terms of upgrading your abilities, your weapon, levelling up in general etc. There is a huge sense of progression in this game and due to the fact that there are 4 classes (6 if you include DLC) and each of them having 3 skill trees AS WELL AS having true vault hunter mode once you've completed the game gives it endless replayability and is definitely worth the price if you ask me. My only complaints about the combat is that 99% of the guns you come across are shit but seeing as how there are like 17 million of them this isn't a huge issue. the other complaint is that a lot of the boss fights can feel incredibly tough due to the fact that second wind can't be used in most of them, but strangely enough I found that the final boss was piss easy as by that point I had maxed out a skill tree and had weapons that were capable of killing all of the side enemies in a single hit. As well as this the game can feel a bit dragged out at ties due to the plethora of side missions. The main story missions alone would probably only take about 10-12 hours but the side missions easily shoot the length up to over 30, I mean it took me 38 and I didn't even complete every side mission available. But overall this is a solid game with incredibly addicting and replayable gameplay, and one of the best villains in video game history."
25717,Like loot? Like witty humor and boistrous fun? Like guns and insanity? Borderlands is the game for you.
25718,"Decent game, same bland Gearbox writing, with stiff toddler level humor and characters as deep as your stoned friend... But honestly who plays a Borderlands game for the story! The guns are great, the legendaries are legendary! And the shooting is incredibly fun!

This is a great game, would recommend if you A: can't afford Borderlands 3, B: can't run Borderlands 3, or C: simply want more Borderlands games, but don't want to suffer through 1 or the Pre Sequel.

otherwise just play 3, a much more refined experience overall."
25719,i have played htis game since i was little and have loved it everytime
25720,excelent
25721,"borderlands equal good game
"
25722,Pretty good.
25723,Greatest Game of all time!!!!
25724,Buy it
25725,nice game  i recommand it
25726,"Great game with a fun story and humor often at it's own expense.  I also love the graphics, as they make the game look like a comic book in some ways."
25727,
25728,BADASS PEW PEW PEW KABLAMOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
25729,"Millions of guns, but only about 10 you'd want to use"
25730,Never a dull moment!!
25731,;.
25732,ll
25733,"well at least for who can't afford bl3 i recommend this one better, and it's quite a good game since i played it for 106.9 hours"
25734,"Pros;
The Loot

No Ava

there is no cons


"
25735,Shoot! and Loot! The original accept no substitutes.
25736,fucken amazin'
25737,Yes
25738,"Awesome game as a continuation of the previous story and build up some brilliant characters as well. Love the variety of weapons that drop in the game, love some of the awesome combinations that are possible and the power that can be gotten in the game."
25739,this game ruined my back
25740,"Love the attitude, style, and action."
25741,"i'm never playing this ♥♥♥♥ing bullet sponge trash ever again
I hate how every ♥♥♥♥ing weapon feels like an airsoft gun but with recoil
and every enemy is just so ridiculously buffed that even high damage weapons dont do a ♥♥♥♥in thing.
the only reason i have so many hours on this is because my cousin held me at fucking gun point to play this trash when i was 14."
25742,"So it's another borderlands game deliver the silly and stupid humour that the first has.

The gun play is decent and delivers what it promises."
25743,AMAZING GAME
25744,ok
25745,good game.
25746,Slot machines are the best things in this game.
25747,"Great game, well worth it!!!! :D"
25748,Mr.Torgue make me coom. oh and its fun or something idk
25749,it's good i guess
25750,Greatest game in history
25751,"Easily the best game in the series, I've ran through this story so many times and it never gets old. Definitely a need to play for anyone who enjoys fps adventure games~"
25752,Pretty Tasty
25753,"I wish the bugs (super speed turret man, gun merging, etc.) weren't patched out though, they added to the replayability imho."
25754,i found this game to be very fun to play with others
25755,"It's Borderlands, but the second one."
25756,It was a great grind
25757,Great Fun!
25758,"Played it awhile back on a free weekend, from what i remember it was pretty good"
25759,its alright i guess
25760,"The combat in this game is fun, minus the fighting versus creatures and robots, it's an improvement over the first borderlands game.  The choices of playable characters could be better, I felt kinda forced to pick which PC was least bad, which was the siren for me.  Otherwise, Great action all around for some mindless fun."
25761,"This was one of the most fun experiences I have had in gaming, the story is a blast to play and the graphics are so distinctive and unique. One of the strong points, can be seen in the characters who are amazing from the annoying Claptrap to Lilith but the best is no doubt Handsome Jack. He is without doubt one of the best villains in video game history, the voice actor does such a good portrayal and Jack's voice lines are the highlight of the game. 

I would definitely recommend this game even more so when at the time of this review, the Game of the Year edition is 80% off. 

Score: 4 out of 5 stars"
25762,fun to play with my friend gavin
25763,buy this game if you are og
25764,"This game is crazy ammmmmazing. Simply in love with it. Was kinda irritated at the beginning but then after some time I was stuck. The guns the enemies. It’s funny too. Never felt tedious there was always something new. First game yet where I enjoyed side quests more. Amazing gameplay. 
I have only praises for this game. Looking forward to playing borderlands 3."
25765,"its nice to play with friends but nothing more than that, alone this game is just boring"
25766,yes
25767,GETCANCERXD
25768,"its soooooo good
"
25769,The Community Patch is essential in 2020 tbh.
25770,Such fun.

25774,This game has been my absolute favourite game since the year it came out. It always has been and always will be. Borderlands 2 will always have a huge role in my life no matter what. (I've played it on every system there is <3)
25775,Simply one of the greatest games ever made.
25776,yes
25777,"Its just not that fun. Progress is slow, the map seems a little redundant.  I know they were trying to do something different wit the graphics, i'm not sure what it was, more comic style. Not really for me, but at least they tried something different."

25788,"Great game, with amazing story.

[h1] Story [/h1]
The game presents the characteristic humor code of the Borderlands franchise, and with the introduction of characters from Borderlands 1, it presents a great chemistry between new and old characters, as well as character development and growth. (e.g. [spoiler] Seeing the process of Tiny Tina grieve the death of Roland [/spoiler]). This installment has also presented us with one of the more likable villains in gaming history (personally). The DLCs were as enjoyable as the main story, with humorous insights to a characters daily life with greater detail. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Considering it's a game from 2012, it plays surprisingly well. It could hold up to some newer games, in my opinion. I love the fast paced action, as well as the versatility in gameplay. It does, however, have some aspects that could be vastly improved, but then again, it is nearly 8 years old now; which in context, makes it surprisingly good. There are, however, minor bugs and balancing issues. Some gear are much more prominent than others, which makes many enjoyable guns obsolete in higher difficulties. Drop rates are on the lower side, which makes build experimentation kind of hard and tedious at times. Grinding is a core aspect of gameplay if you desire specific guns and gear throughout your gameplay.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
It is a great game, with great story and some of the most hilarious moments I had so far. If you don't mind grinding for gear, then you should definitely go for it."
25789,10/10 GOOD GAME BRO OMG ITS LIT
25790,"[h1]It‘s constantly switching between fun and frustration, joy and tedium, love and hate. yeah, borderlands 2 is one of those games.[/h1]

at first glance there is seemingly no big difference between borderlands 1 & 2. the improvement of the cell shade grafics is barely noticable, the core gameplay mechanics are completely unchanged and the humor, which alternates between beeing stupidly childish and downright sick and twisted, is present again as well. so, within the first ten to fifteen hours, borderlands 2 leaves the almost exact impression as it’s predecessor: it’s nothing grandiose, but it is certainly something special and puts one or two interesting rpg-twists to the otherwise painfully average fps gameplay.

when you start to look for things that actually have been improved significantly since borderlands 1, the decent first impression gets a serious damper, because there is hardly anything at all. the gunplay feels a little bit more meaty and the story and characters are a bit more fleshed out this time around. but when it comes to naming the points where borderlands 2 really surpasses it‘s predecessor, we are already done now.

instead, after said first fifteen hours you will eventually start to really notice the things in that borderlands 2 is actually inferior to the first game. on the technical side, it really lacks polish here and there and i encountered a couple of bugs as well as the occassional crash once in a while. the music, while certainly decent is not so great, that you constantly want to listen to it all the way through. in fact, i just turned it off after a while and listened to some KoRn and Slipknot records while playing the game, to distract myself a bit from the repetition and tedium that started to become obvious around the ten hour mark. the rest of the about 100 hours i invested in the game so far were often characterized by exactly that: dull repetition, tedium, boredom and more than once: frustration, may it be because of some incredibly annoying enemy designs that respawn every 10 minutes or so (don’t get me started on the stalkers and the threshers), the fact that your inventory is way too f****** small to carry all the loot to the immensly sparse shopping machines in order to sell all that useless sh*t, or the game‘s biggest fault, namely the extremely inconsistent difficulty and leveling system. you just breeze through some areas, while in others you plain simply get your lower back body part handed to you repeatedly. add to that the extreme amount of filler content (the base game alone has about 100 side quests minimum) and it‘s not very surprising that i was already really fed up with borderlands 2 around the 30 hour mark.

and then there is the end game, which finally turns the game into an infuriatingly unfair and frustrating, p***-poorly designed piece of donkey d*ck. by the time i came to the last dungeon of the main story and the final boss fight, i completed ALL the available sidequests of the main game so far, so i was around level 33 and had some pretty decent gear, but nevertheless died countless times just to get near the final boss. everytime you die, you loose about 6 or 7 percent of your currency as a penalty and by the time i finally beat the final boss my money was reduced from around 180.000 to around 50.000. Feel free to do the math and calculate how often i died just during that final quest. Then, about half way through the first DLC campaign, there was this extreme shift in difficulty again because at around level 36 or 37 the enemies seem to just stop scaling. Apart from a few boss fights, i did not encounter enemies that were above level 36 or so and by the time i reached level 40, i was basically unstoppable. The game went from tediously hard to ridiculously easy again within the blink of an eye. 
so, after finishing the main campaign and maybe one or two DLC, it is literally pointless to play the campaigns of the remaining dlc unless you are really into the story of the dlc or, for whatever baffling reason, still want more borderlands 2 after already having spend about 50 hours or more with the game at this point. There is zero challange left, because the enemies just don't pose any threat whatsoever anymore.

in the end, borderlands 2 is one of those games that you love in one minute, than passionately hate in the next. it almost never lets you get into a steady flow, but rather accelerates your progress with lightning speed, then brings it to a screeching halt, feeding you nothing but dull, mindless, tedious repetition. often, it is like a traffic jam. it rigorously dictates the pace and everytime you think you can finally accelerate, it makes you hit the breaks again. one minute you kick all kinds of butt and enjoy some of the really creative aspects of the game, the next it just annoys the living crap out of you. it drags on and on forever (the base game alone is about 40 to 45 hours if you complete all the sidequests, not counting all the dlc that comes with the goty edition), but you have no choice, there is no turning back and you gotta see it through.

borderlands 2 swings back and forth between a 4 and a 5 out of 8 but fortunately, just like in borderlands 1 the positives narrowly outweight the glaring problems. the game still looks very distinct and fresh due to it‘s creative grafical style, the combat is fast-paced and satisfying for the most part and the humor is good enough for two or three hearty chuckles. all those factors combined elevate borderlands 2 slightly above the average, albeit it often trips and stumbles. if you enjoyed borderlands 1, chances are that you’ll love it‘s sequel, too and even if you haven’t played the first game, there is no real reason to not checking this one out, at least if you‘re a fps fan. 
if you decide to not only play the main campaign but also finish all the dlc included in the goty edition, this game will take you at least 100 hours to complete and not all of those hours will be pleasant. you may be left in a state of „borderlands trauma“ after pushing through the whole thing and you will maybe start to scream in terror everytime somebody mentions that there is still borderlands the pre-sequel and borderlands 3. but ultimately, there is a positive side to this: in terms of sheer content and playtime, you‘ll get a lot of value for your money here, and if you are really into looter-shooters and don’t mind the constant spiral into dullness and repetition, this game just might be your favorite game of all time.

BORDERLANDS 2
Genre: First-Person-Shooter / RPG
Release: Q3 2012

( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made. Don't waste any money on this.
( ) 1/8 Bad. Seriously flawed with barely any redeeming qualities. Worth a couple of Cents at best, if at all.
( ) 2/8 Sub-par. Only for hardcore-fans of respective genre / series. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.
( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.
( ) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.
(X) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.
( ) 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.
( ) 7/8 Outstanding game, a milestone of it‘s respective genre. Definitely worth its full prize.
( ) 8/8 Simply one of the best games ever made. Get this, the prize doesn't matter."
25791,"Quite possibly the best looter shooter ever! Skill trees are versitile and fun, and not to mention the story and side quests are fun and entertaining."
25792,this is the only borderlands game
25793,shit
25794,amazing
25795,"Firstly it's very good and you should get it and play it (after doing Borderlands 1 first).

    Secondly get the GOTY edition with all the DLC.

   I actually reviewed this ages ago and Steam gobbled up the review and I couldn't make a new one.

   Downside is a couple of years on I'm kinda fuzzy on the details.  Bigger and better than the original.  Notable main villain that you don't understand fully until you play the pre-sequel (check out my review).

   Borderlands has one of the best scaling systems in gaming to keep the challenges on an even keel.  Tip - do all the side quests.  1) You've paid for them 2) The extra experience and kit will make story progression easier.

   The adverts obsess about the number of different guns but that's a minor part in what makes the game great.  Strong story lines, strong NPCs and a large variety of different combat opponents and environments is what makes the game.

    The DLC is essential.  The Pirate quest is good fun.  Mr Torgue's campaign is a bit ""meh"".  Mr Torgue - Hulk Hogan on too much cocaine - is the most annoying and least interesting of the NPCs in my view.  Sir Hammerlock's campaign is poor.  A by the numbers expansion outsourced to different developers it has clipping graphics and wastes someone who in the Presequel is an interesting NPC.  Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is a revelation.  Brilliantly inventive, strong use of the supporting cast - perhaps better than the main campaign.

   Borderlands revolutionised the PvE FPS.  Play Borderlands 2 and see why.  But play Borderlands 1 first.

S.x."

自从上次更新了十几个游戏就一卡一卡的，估计是联网要和2K服务器对数据，对不上让你卡一下，离线模式确实有用，开加速也可以解决。对中国玩家极度不友好，为了和epic联机，加了个服务器验证数据。

Since the last update of more than a dozen GBs, the game has been very lagging. It is estimated that the network needs to communicate with 2K servers, which is extremely unfriendly to Chinese players. In order to connect with epic, a server has been added to verify data. Solution: offline mode and VPN."

25848,"Im a massive fan of the borderlands series. one of my all time favourite games! Lots of fun and lots of laughs to be have while mindlessly running over skags and jumping the gorge or missing the jump, your choice"
25849,"Borderlands 2 is an first person shooter with role playing elements built around scavenging new weapons from defeated foes and chests. I am the type to usually enjoy solo games so I advise people who like single player games to seek out other options, it is not a terrible single player experience though. With lots of guns, nice cel shaded graphics, good music and an okay amount of abilities you will have a hours of fun with a small group of people or if you are like me, find something that keeps bringing you back."
25850,its ok.
25851,I'm gonna [strike] say the n word [/strike] refund this doo doo game
25852,"The hours speak for themselves for a game that should only take 20-30 casual hours to complete. First played this in 2013, and now coming back to it in 2020, playing with new players. There's certainly re-playability through various classes and specs within each class. Great art style with a comprehensive narrative. 

In short: a comical Mad Max game."

25864,10/10 the better one out of the 4
25865,Played it a bit. It's ok.
25866,You don't play a game for nigh on 400 hours if it's just mediocre.

25873,Fun game
25874,it good
25875,"I normally would of recommended this game before the previous three patches. As you can see I got just abit over 500 hours of game play at this point. But ever since they updated and added the ""Shift"" crap and the ad for Borderlands 3 this game has been broken. As in you cannot cross play anymore with your friends on other platforms like Mac. Would not recommend you buy this game unless you got friends all on the same platform or they fix the current issue and drop the ""Shift"" thing they added."

I originally played this game on the Xbox 360 so my actual time with the game is about 2-3x what it says above. This is the game for anyone who enjoys fun FPS combat, wacky humor and characters, and a game that doesn't take itself too seriously; with six characters, five extra DLC campaigns, and three difficulty modes to collect even more ridiculous guns and cosmetics to kill a variety of bad guys with, this game is a great investment and is definitely the best in the series so please pick it up for yourself and learn why its so beloved."

25887,best coop series ever
25888,I can recommand that game if you have dlc you have more hours of fun. Rng on loot's okay but sometimes you need to graind boss to get better stuff. Very dynamic shooter with awesome story line. What can i say more Enjoy!
25889,"Fun with friends
"
25890,"Imma play this because I am broke atm(cant afford bl3), still pretty good game though 69/10"
25891,"Played it when it first came out and enjoyed it (more with friends than solo, really) and although it's been a while, it's aged surprisingly well, all told.

Playing it again to refresh my memory before grabbing the third one."
25892,"Muy buen juego, da muchas horas, tienes que ""farmear"" un poco si quieres que sea mas facil pero la dificulta que da mantiene siempre entretenido."
25893,"The game that started it all with the Looter Shooter craze. Its campy dialogues and flushed out characters makes a good experience to slog through the story and side quests but only recommended if you've got friends to play with. Also the game has a massive arsenal of weapons and gear that you can grind for to get better at killing enemies. Finding newer better loot is always a good dopamine burst that gets addicting.
Personally i found this game to be a bit grindy at times so i could not sit through the whole experience but i was having a blast when my friends came around to play with. If you are a fan of the looting and getting better gear mechanics then this one is definitely a must own. 
Would recommend getting it on sale though. HF looting !"
25894,gun shoot look pretty sometimes gun shoot look poop but brain make happy juice anyway
25895,very entertaining!
25896,"Bruh, this is a staple game"
25897,"The borderlands series is like the marvel comic book movies of video games; inexplicably beloved for it's 'quirky' humor and by-the-books gameplay. There's really nothing new here relative to the first game, save for more content, and by that I mean you'll spend more time pressing E to collect garbage off the ground to sell than you will shooting enemies. 

If you think Robert Downy Jr.'s quips as Iron Man are the peak of comedy, and love a game that won't challenge you more than bowling with guard rails up, then this game is for you."
25898,game gud

25901,BLOOD! MORE BLOOD! I NEED TO FEED MY MEAT BICYCLE!
25902,"Borderlands 2 is not bad. I'm not too much into the 'kill everything you see' kind of games, but its not horrible. If you are a person that does not care for character development or story line, then this is probably the game for you. This game is still getting a positive review for having such a unique art style and comical characters though!"
25903,good
25904,Imagine wanting to play a game with friends but it loops you trying to connect and failing forever

25917,"This game is like an acid trip, a good bowl, and sleep deprivation hallucinations all in one. It's a BLAST to play through (even better with friends). It's hilarious, touching, and has an EPIC storyline with villains you just love to hate. I've been playing this off and on for a few years now and it's just an amazing game all around. I highly recommend getting the expansions and addons as they are ALL just awesome!"
25918,yasss bitch
25919,you need friends to play this game that's why i only have 7 hours. because i have none.
25920,It's okay.
25921,"Better than the 3rd one, I can say that"
25922,"Bought the GOTY ed(worth every penny) before HC became free on epic games. Played for over 100 hrs and I'm not done yet(too many DLCs). Story is not the best, but not the worst either. Every character you'll encounter as the game progress are funny as hell especially claptrap. Classes and their respective skill tree are simplified, variety of weapons are available. Only downside is, it gets ""grindy"" later in the game :( 

Oh yea, you can play the story with your friends!"
25923,Action very shoot shoot
25924,absolutely love this game. So many hours of gameplay and so much to do with fun characters. Even more fun when playing with buddies. What are you doing with your life if you didn't play this game yet?

25941,"I don't know why you would trust the opinion of some random people on the internet, but if you do, here is mine.
  The best thing I can say about Borderlands 2 is that it transformed an action/rpg/strategy player into a FPS fan. Well, now I'm both I guess.
  The second best thing I can say about Borderlands 2 is that it actually lives up to the old gaming cliche of ""The more you play, the better it gets"". 
  The last thing I will say is that for those I have played enough to have an opinion, (Maya, Gaige, Zero, Krieg) the characters do have, once you get the action skill, different play styles. A lot of games which let you play multiple characters have different looking PCs which still play more or less the same. Anarchy Gaige and Sniper Zero are about as opposite play styles as could be.

 The really last thing I will say is :
""Don't worry, Shotty, I'm fine."""

25961,Very entertainment! Handsome Jack is a very compelling and well done villain and the shooting /looting system keeps the game fresh. Definitely give it a go if you enjoy shooters.
25962,haha gun go boom
25963,SHUT UP DAVE
25964,Good game baby
25965,fun with fren

25968,THIS GAME IS REALY FUN
25969,nice
25970,"The storyline for this game is one of the best, and Handsome Jack might be one of the most iconic video game villains. Even though gun play isn't the best the characters and scenery make up for it."
25971,AMAZING!!
25972,"A really fun Shoot and loot game! funny and serious side of the game, lots of Content and lots to do, iv played multiple hours on both console and Computer in the past and is always a game i can come back to."
25973,"good
"
25974,"Much better on the ps4, but overall a great game that will get you hooked for days."
25975,"Lot of content, great events, not too complicated... I love it"
25976,One of my top 3 of all time.
25977,"This game is really an epic game!It was regrettable that I didn't find it earlier.But for the pandemic, I would have never noticed this masterpiece.
Anyway, the game is fun.It has great plots, open world, and interesting characters.It may take players a huge amount of time to finish the missions and fully explore the world.At the same time, our enemies are many, which makes this game kinda hard.
On the whole, it's a nice game that deserves being played!"
25978,nice
25979,Good Game

25982,yes

25993,this game is amazing.
25994,Fun
25995,Good game
25996,its good
25997,"Usualmente no juego shooters, no se porque este si.. tiene gran variedad de bosses y las misiones se hacen en un tiempo copado. 
La verdad lo recomiendo, aunque tiene un humor sumamente extraño y chistes algo duros.
En resumen, gran juego."

26006,"On XBOX I've played probably 1000 hours +, this game is mostly multiplayer orientated, but can be fun on your own too (especially if you know where most of the legendaries are). There are really fun missions like the mission where a guy pays YOU to punch him in the face. The characters are really cool as well such as Mister Torgue, Tiny Tina and Handsome Jack (one of the best villains of gaming in my opinion). Best part is you get to shoot some bitches"
26007,real good fun game and good to play with a friend
26008,"Andr0id g0 p00f,
Bandit g0 die."
26009,"I love the writing of this game. It's so over the top, campy, funny. The weird zany characters are unique and properly crazy and I was ententained from start to finish and even played the game multiple times and still laughed at Handsome Jack's jokes and Claptrap's stupidity. I really wish Borderlands 3 focused on the same things rather than on the weird looter-shooter gameplay, which is stale and done much better in other games, but this isn't a review of Borderlands 3, this is a review of it's much better predecessor and it just has to be a positive one."
26010,good
26011,awesome game
26012,Very NIce yes? Ok
26013,"Fun with friends, writing isn't terrible. Just a good time."

26015,It is very easy to play this for long amounts of time
26016,"good game, good humor, good art, great storyline. My favorite video game"
26017,"What can I say? It's Borderlands. It's like the first game but with an even more fleshed out story, better graphics, more missions, and more features. If you plan on completing all of the side missions,  be prepared to die a lot and go through plenty of frustration."
26018,10/10
26019,bordeblands eeee
26020,borderlands 2 fun
26021,"BL2 is my fave game of the series and of all time, made some wonderful friends along my vault hunting journeys over the years had alot of laughs, alot of Rage (When loot fell of the map) and heart breaks but i will put my hands up and say this is worth buying because the storyline was amazing, the guns where amazing to find/ grind for the charecters make the game whole

If you have not gave this game a try your missing out"
26022,is fun game.real big cool
26023,"Put a ton of time Into this on ps3, ps4, 360 and xbox one. Good times."
26024,fun
26025,Borderlands 2 has the best story out of the borderlands series so far. Grinding in this game is super fun and the amount of guns you can collect in the game is insane!
26026,Lilith is waifu
26027,Wonderful game
26028,bee shield + infinity + gunslinger + gaige anarchy = weeeee
26029,this is one or the best games ever made the character the story and the gameplay even the visuals are some of the best in video game history
26030,"this is good dame
"
26031,this is the best game ever. it's super fun. it has the prettiest sunsets. also claptrap is very cute especially when he dances and i love him
26032,This game is harder than Dark Souls.
26033,best borderlands ive played since it came out
26034,"Good shoot and loot FPS. Not appropriate for all ages, but enjoyable if you can play! Easy to use button layout, appropriate difficulty progression."
26035,"I could write for hours explaining what I love and dislike about this game, but am I going to do that? No. So play it for yourself."
26036,I liked it
26037,"Overall pretty fun game. Despite being pretty expensive, it's well worth the money."
26038,epic

26057,Delightful.
26058,"I used to play this back in the Xbox 360 days (with that horrible console FOV and 30fps cap), then on the Xbox One, and now on PC. Honestly, an amazing game with an awesome loot mechanic (GUNZ)! If you want the MMORPG looting mechanics with regards to the Rare and Exotic weapons, without all the BS that stuff like Destiny brings with it, Borderlands 2 is pretty good example of a little tiny thing i like to call FPS Perfection!"
26059,"Fuck off randy, with your shift bullshit. I'm not signing up to your shit."
26060,"amazing rpg. I love the bandits and the dragons. sometimes i accidentally shout gaurds and i have to go to jail but thats okay cause i did it to myself. the mehrunes razor is a great dagger and the ebony blade with a fewe fixes is an  amazing weapon to use 
"
26061,pp
26062,"This game is absolutely great I have crashed it 5 times in a row and i cant open it again
"
26063,its good for people who likes open world games with a bit of shoting
26064,iz reel gud
26065,654 Hours played. Enough Said.
26066,GUNS GUNS GUNS
26067,it`s good
26068,still best game ever
26069,it is fuuuuuuuuuuun
26070,yes
26071,very good game
26072,Great game but if you really wanna enjoy the game you should have a team to play with.
26073,"good
"
26074,"Good game, better with friends!"
26075,veri noiceeee
26076,nice
26077,Good game friend bought so we could could play together and we both enjoyed it
26078,"Its the best in the borderlands series so far, Handsome Jack is also one of the best game villains of all time. Welcome to Pandora kiddos!"
26079,"yes
"
26080,yas
26081,"Borderland 2 was not as good as the first one for me,i lost the hype i got when i played the first one,the only thing keep motivated me to finish it just because of how cool Zero is,and then i saw the characters of Borderland 3,i removed it from my wishlist,not interested anymore."
26082,One of the best games EVAH
26083,"I would recommend the game Borderlands 2 for anyone who is a fan of shooter games as well as loot and experience point influenced game-play. The base game provides an impressively large amount of content, having a large selection of items, quests, and playable characters (each of which act as a different class, and are better with certain play-styles and equipment). However, it's important to note that if you like to invest large sums of time into singular entertainment products, then this particular game is best played with the purchasable add-on content. This is because two (2) characters, a large amount of maps, and an even larger amount of items are only accessible via add-on content. Overall it's a fairly well made game with a large amount of base content and add-on content."
26084,funny game
26085,when I see an orange gun my brain releases the happy chemical
26086,"Even after all these years, game still looks great. Extremely funny, great story, so. many. guns."
26087,"Very fun, first person shooter & RPG with futuristic ambiance"
26088,"Arguably the best Borderlands game out of the entire series. Decent humor, memorable villains, and great (and bazillions of) guns. I love this game, it was the first one I bought and it got me into the series and lore. Gaige is still the best character.

26089,"It's... fucking borderlands 2. If you haven't played this game, you're living under a rock
"
26090,yes
26091,because why not....you would not be smart to not buy this game
26092,Overall amazing looter shooter.
26093,"Do you like laughing? If yes, then this game is perfect for you. turn up the dialog volume and turn on subtitles and prepare to laugh at psycho's screaming completely random things like ""I'M THE CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN!"". there are far better ones, but I'd rather not ruin the surprise for you just keep an ear out for them.
yours truly,
A bored person waiting for slow internet"
26094," good
"
26095,"Great game, absolutely hiarious, I stopped playing for a while but I've gotten back into it!"
26096,Can't play with my friends on ps4. FUCK YOU!!!!!!1!!!
26097,"awesome shooter where you can just dive in and just play the game easily, but holds enough challenge that you cant always brute force your way through
"
26098,yes
26099,"I mean game is cool. Awesome in fact. Maybe the best looter-shooter of all time.

But weak DLCs and terrible boss designs makes it hard to give 10/10.

Also played these DLCs;

-Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty

-Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage

-Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt

-Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep

-Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary

I mean they don't actually add much but this is Borderlands, so if you don't expect anything new you can enjoy 20+ more hours."
26100,"fun
"
26101,Not playing would be a Pepaga move.
26102,THIS IS AWESOME GAME ;)
26103,"Fun and chaotic with strong personalities, interesting outifts, and a good loot system. It also has good variation between character types with decent skill trees, tons of side quests, and tiered achievements for your tiered achievements. I don't know whether to mourn or congratulate completionists for finding this game, but I suppose that's for them to decide."
26104,"Excellent looter shooter that has a plethora of content while also going on sale often at a low price. Handsome Jack is an interesting villain and there are also plenty of guns to collect. I definitely recommend picking up this game along with all of the DLC, especially if you have friends to play with."
26105,its fun
26106,d
26107,Great Game
26108,You're missing out. (You can even play with friends on different launchers)
26109,is good
26110,VVV good
26111,"The writing is insufferable. BL1's writing was annoying but tolerable. This game? The gameplay is good enough, but the writing hurts me almost physically. They say cringe culture is dead, but if I do say so myself, it's pretty dang cringe. I couldn't finish the game. I couldn't stand the writing. Absolutely intolerable. Please save yourself and play BL1 instead."
26112,nice
26113,Amazingly fun looter shooter with a great storyline. Great game to purchase when on sale for like 10 bucks!
26114,"gun go boom boom and shoot and pwoooh and bam
"
26115,"Great game when it works. Which is rare. Nothing but crashes despite all attempts to fix. Placeholder textures are still apparent in some areas of the game despite this thing being out for about a century now, which further proves Gearbox's lack of interest in their own games. If you like Borderlands like I do, trust me, play it on PS4 or XBox."
26116,Is a very nice :)
26117,Chaos
26118,"Played since the game came out on back on the xbox 360, then went to the xbox one and now onto the pc. The diverse amount amount of character creation and guns available in the game is what keeps bringing me back, along with the all the amazing quests in the game. I still haven't played all the side missions!"
26119,Gud
26120,"""its cool and difficult mechromancer op"" - my dad"
26121,"This has always been a great game and now with B3 out its always on sale and that makes it an easy buy. This game is a first person looter shooter. Even better than that its the kind of  shooter you can just mindlessly run through blasting things and the guns keep the experience different with each mob. So if you actually have not played this game, grab it you wont be disappointed, especially for the price."
26122,SHOOT SHOOT LOOT BOOM BOOM
26123,you know sometimes i wish todd howard would luv me the way he loves ripping off syrian children in my basement. i want more vbucks. thanks activision
26124,"Borderlands 2 is one of the best looter shooters i've ever played!

The story is very funny and the DLCs are great!"
26125,"Quirky, and you get to kill people.  10/10.  Great world and story building."
26126,Yes
26127,"In depth characters, fun upgrades, and hilarious bandits make for an awesome game!"
26128,"Immersive world, fun and interesting NPC's to interact with, solid gameplay, and the seamless integration of RPG leveling mechanics with an open-world FPS.  What's not to love?"
26129,"Great game. absolutely huge and full of interesting mechanics and loot, if you haven't played it yet it's a must buy."
26130,"I have about 10,000 hours on borderlands 2 accross xbox 360, ps3, xbox one and PC and to this day i find this game enjoyable to replay. One thing thats kindof annoying are people that stat edit their badass level and 1 shot everything but you can always kick them so no biggie"
26131,I Played it and it was fun.
26132,gud gam
26133,"Very balanced and co-op friendly game even after 8 years
Worth every buck"
26134,Very Good Coop Game. Had much fun playing.
26135,this game will give you much more hours of content than it looks i played this when i was 14 thousands of hours in the xbox 360 good times
26136,"Amazing game super fun crazy game to  play with friends :D
I highly recommend this game to all gamers :)
"
26137,brilliant as a 1 person pass time or multiplayer
26138,good.
26139,very nice game
26140,i love this game it is so much fun the dlc's add so much more to it as well
26141,i played this when i was a kid now came back to it with a mate and this game is really good and very worth it
26142,"GUNS, GLORIOUS GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
26143,Is CL34P TR4P Is Good
26144,"gearbox now publicly supports a racist hate group. dont buy or play this crap any more
"
26145,"Very exciting game, but since it was updated a few months ago,there have been BL3 ads,and since then the game has often been stutter"
26146,There's no Ava in this one
26147,"its funny, and the gun play is really fun"
26148,"Boring, repetitive and painfully unfunny, im not sure how this game franchise got popular or how it still gets sold today. The gameplay is mind-numbing and it seems built for people with minimal attention spans. This game probably got popular with the younger audience when it came out."
26149,One of the best local coop games on consoles :^)
26150,"i love this game
\"
26151,fun
26152,"Goood product, buy this fun game. I have enjoyed it."
26153,"8/10
Very good"
26154,"Excellent game. Lots of fun, great story and great humour."
26155,love the game at just a bout 500 hours of play and still have fun playing
26156,love this game
26157,no.
26158,"Pretty good, took up a few hours of my time for sure."
26159,Get off my lawn
26160,This game.... man. If [REDACTED] didn't [REDACTED] then this would have been the best game iv'e played.
26161,"I have always been a huge fan of the Borderlands series, and I've gotta say, Borderlands 2 has to be the most fun one yet. So much options, replayability, and friendly rivalry that can ensue just from playing this game with friends, or even alone. Not to mention the mods that can be added for diversity in each playthrough, like BL2Reborn or even Exodus. I've played this game on old gen for well over 2000 hours, and even still to this day, I'm not bored of it. Amazing game, would definitely recommend if you're new to the Borderlands experience."
26162,this game fucking sucks
26163,One of my top 3 favorite games of all time. Ages incredibly for a game from 2012. Holds up in 2020!
26164,Badass
26165,"One of the best RPGs of all time, fun game, play it play it play it"
26166,this game was really fun :) had a fun time playing with my friends :) yall would too! much love

slot machine experience 10/10"
26171,It's a really  addictive game. I like the graphics and the funky details.
26172,"Super goddamn fun, even more so with friends. Get the Handsome Collection if you want all the DLC (excluding Lilith's Fight for Sanctuary, but I've heard that DLC isn't good anyway). I put 24 hours into this game in my first 3 days of owning it, and I expect to get dozens, if not hundreds more hours of fun out of this game."
26173,why the fuck dose my game keep crashing for no reason the only why to fix it is by unstalling the fucking game and re-installing  this goddamn game
26174,Shootin and loot dropin :)

26176,"stop thinking so hard
just buy it"

26178,"I mean, what can I say that anyone hasn't. This is the great sequel to the true brutal, comedic bulletfest we all love. There are some silly glitches I found myself getting inconveniently fucked over with but most games have one or two of those anyway. Becoming a pure bad ass and putting every bad guy in their place is just so satisfying and the game seems to always have something to do. I merely finished the main story but I have plenty to do in the future."
26179,my wife loves this game!!
26180,Loot 👍
26181,Yes
26182,Like Borderlands but newer

26185,Funny
26186,pew pew pew
26187,fun experience
26188,"Did you played BL1 and you want to loot more and more and get more and more crazy weapons and blow up everything? Then this is your game and welcome to the best RPG, Shooter, FPS and CO-OP game ever made, trust me, you won't get bored from this game, cuz it have a huge content and a lot to do and a lot to loot and to have a lot of fun (but sadly 2K was ------ and ruined the saga by adding BL3 to Epic Shit as exclusive and putting all their franchise to that shitty store but don't worry about that cuz BL3 is finally on Steam so don't mind this comment at all).
L00000T and BL000W UP your enemies and ofc have fun!"

26191,CORROSION!
26192,epic
26193,"Each play through goes one of two ways. Either you plow through every mission and stop once you beat the game. Or you spend half of your entire playtime grinding for that one legendary.

Most of the time it ends in the latter."
26194,Great game with a storyline that keeps you invested as well as the loot system making you want to continue to play again and again
26195,it's ok i guess.
26196,"A quote from one of the characters as to why you should play:
""SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!!!"" -Face Mcshooty"
26197,"So much LOOT, GUNS, STORY and most of all, HANDSOME JACK.

26203,"The one and only, Borderlands. A fun game, with a new story, and incredible enemies, and factions.

Graphics: The cell shaded graphics look stunning, the colors pop, and is an amazing looking game.

Sound: The game has a nice soundtrack, the game sounds feel good, and enhance the moment, and add a layer to the game.

Overall: A gem of a game, incredibly fun, good story, smooth gameplay, and stellar graphics."
26204,"I'm going on 23 hrs for my 3rd playthrough - 1st time on PC. 
STILL the best looter shooter by far, no nostalgia felt. 
Catch a ride."
26205,"A lot of fun. I went through the game solo so there's a few spots I didn't reach but I finished the main story fairly quickly. Had a great time, loved the mechanics."

26210,Best game of all time
26211,"This is hilarious! The graphic style is excellent, it's that entertaining and hilarious that the story doesn't matter, you play this game for a good time and that's exactly what you'll have! The voice lines are amongst my favourite out of all the games I've played, they'll have you laughing aloud for sure! A must play!"
26212,Yes
26213,"Pretty fun, a nice intro to fps. Had to turn off the gore because it made me a little sick, and even still I sometimes question whether or not I actually turned it off."
26214,"Very Fun, Very Enjoyable!"
26215,"Borderlands 2 Is such an iconic masterpiece in recent video game history, and has stacked itself so well against other major fps titles. Ever since the release of the first Borderlands game, Borderlands 2 has gotten so much better (obviously) while sticking true to its roots, which is a rarity in a game franchise lasting for so long. The replayability, the story, the animation, and the art style all makes it feel so realistically cartoonish which makes it feel truly like its own expirence. I owned this on Xbox 360 since launch day back in 2012, and the amount of love and affection 2K put into this modern masterpiece is truly astonishing. The only complaint I have about this game is that the majority of the DLC was a cash grab and nothing more. It was all recycled missions, predictable plots and overall not interesting. However, the best dlc was Tiny Tinas's Assault on Dragon Keep because it was a hilarious gag that was a true rendition of what Borderlands is and should be. The funny comedy to it all, the constant 4th wall breaks, the originality to it, it's all their. In total, this game and the entire series was a master piece and it is 100% worth every penny."
26216,Yes
26217,"Despite me hearing a lot good things about the game, I don't recommend it. It felt empty, repetitive and without enough interesting events to keep playing. The vast majority of the characters and general jokes were either unoriginal, cringy or unfunnny. Controlling car's direction with the mouse seemed like a joke made by the developers. Shooting enemies with most of the guns feel unsatisfying too. 

Bought this game with the handsome collection bundle and forced me to play 7 hours until I gave up. I actually wanted to stop at 3 hours, kept going hopping it gets better but it didn't. I found nothing that would hook me or come back for more.
"
26218,"i love the story but why am i still playing this? i have things to do...
game-play can be frustrating at times
you get stopped mid sprint because your character doesn't know how to step 5mm higher to clear the metal plate lying on the ground
enemies range from oblivious of you standing right in front of them, to hyper aware as they perfectly track you sprinting behind cover across the map.
janky ai movement makes trying to track/predict shots challenging but not unreasonably so.
if i can edit reviews ill prob edit this at some point... comment to remind me

"
26219,uhhhh pew pew spam E like a loot goblin and repeat
26220,"Totally funny story, great gameplay and diverse characters. This game features one of my all-time favourite story arcs (the tiny tine rpg)."
26221,Just play the damn game. You'll enjoy.
26222,So fun!
26223,dope
26224,"Great game with great style and cellshading really defines the game. Funny voice lines and overall just fun to play around.  Very chaotic, but in a good way."
26225,this is so cute.
26226,"Okay if you see this, it means you are contemplating buying this. ignore that feeling, trust me this game is incredible! once you think you're done you're not there are hundreds of extra missions a crazy story. the game feels so rewarding its unbelievable. not to mention the 17 MILLION guns. yes thats not an exaggeration, there really are so personally i would buy this ASAP!"
26227,I really love this game as it has a great story and good mechanics. The variety of loot can create may different play styles and the different skill trees and abilities creates a new way to play every time you play.
26228,8/10
26229,good game
26230,"Playing this to prepare myself for BL3. Beware of screen tearing on newer systems. Ensure that you have the Ultra HD Textures Pack installed. If you experience issues with automatic resolution resetting, your desired resolution can be written manually into the game's files."
26231,I am having fun
26232,"79 hours in and have no regrets of buying this game. I may be a little too late to the party but I made it either way. I've been grinding and finding out what made BL2, considered by many, the best of the series. 

""Stairs??!?!?!?!! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"""
26233,One of my favorite games
26234,A classic
26235,I pick up gun and shoot man in face
26236,"The game gets stuck on ""creating an online session"" every time I load it, even when I'm playing offline. :\"
26237,"One of the greatest games ever made, in the history of anything. It's a little bit dated now, but that doesn't stop it from being as fun as it used to be in the slightest."
26238,this game  is best RPG gaME   EVER     then rest
26239,Amazing game! Huge fan.
26240,Solid Game. Hella Looter. Hella Shooter.

26245,Maybe playing this game without a friend talking with is a little boring
26246,One of the funnest and replayable games i have. The DLC content is fun as well especially the Dragon Keep one
26247,"fun game
very funny
gunplay is good but gets meh at higher levels"
26248,Much much more awesome than I anticipated.  May be the best fps I have ever played.
26249,Its good
26250,"After my fourth attempt to play through this game, I have finally made it. After 39 hours and 16 minutes I finished the main story and the first four DLCs and about 85% of all side quests.

A great shooter!

[h1]Story[/h1]
Borderlands 2 plays on Pandora about five years after the events of Borderlands 1. There is a rumor that a new, even bigger Vault is hidden on Pandora. This event attracts Vault Hunters to try to open it. The game starts with escaping an assassination attempt by Handsome Jack, who wants to get rid of Vault Hunters. Handsome Jack wants to open the Vault and use the content to bring ""peace"" to the planet. Ok... He wants to oppress Pandora and take control of it, to get to the point.

Soon you meet Roland (former Vault Hunter who was a playable character in Borderlands 1) who is building up a resistance against Handsome Jack and his Hyperion company in the last free city of Sanctuary. 
From here a wild journey through different areas of Pandora starts, where the players shoots wildly around and blows up a lot.  They meet some crazy characters (you're kind of one yourself) and try to protect Pandora from Handsome Jack. Or just follow one of the over 120 side quests and go hunting, start a gang war or have a tea party with lovely guests.

The game has it all and moreover a great sense of humor that is aimed at adults. Not for nothing the game has an R-rating.


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Borderlands is a so called Lootshooter with some RPG elements. 

Lootshooter means that you can find many different weapons. There are pistols, revolvers, SMGs, rifles, snipers, shotguns and rocket launchers. Also the weapons can have one of four elemental damage, which are different in different situations. A character can have four weapons equipped at the same time and switch back and forth to be always well prepared. The weapons can vary a lot and rare weapons have unique abilities that are sometimes very useful and sometimes very funny. Oh. And there are grenades. 

RPG element means that the player can choose one from four different characters. Each character has a special ability, which is available from level 5. Correct. The characters level up like in an RPG. From level 5 on, the player can turn on point for each level into an ability. Every character has three different talent trees, so the player can specialize and individualize the character. Furthermore, the character can be customize by using two items (class mod and rune). Finally, there is an achievement system where the player collects points which and uses them for small passive improvements of the character.

The game is well polished. Waypoints work well. I never had a crash or any other problem. The gunplay is very diverse due to the different weapons but always feels technically very good. The game has a lot of options and the graphics and key mapping can be adjusted very individually.

There are two tiny little spots where I was a little frustrated with the gampley. The first 10 levels I found the weapons to be really bad and it was no fun to play with them. There are hardly any elementary weapons. Weapons often don't have a rear sight and just don't play well. The first 10 levels are over quickly, but I didn't enjoy them. 
The second point is the problem when you can't find good weapons for a while. In the main game this hardly happened to me. But in one of the DLCs I was unlucky with the drops for a while and the opponents became real bulletsponges.

I just can talk about playing the story in one rush. I did not go into the ultimate vault hunter mode or somethine like that. I am just not interested in pushing my character even further. However, if player are they can be called lucky because they can play even more Borderlands 2.

[h1]Graphic[/h1]
I love the graphics. It doesn't surprise me that Borderlands 2 was developed with Unreal Engine 3, which already convinced me with the Batman Arkham series, Bioshock Infinite or the first three Gears of War. On top of that Borderlands 2 is heavily celshaded. 
This brings two advantages. On the one hand, the brutality of the game can be pleasantly exaggerated and the opponents burst, shatter, burn or even dissolve in acid. Secondly, the game ages incredibly well and even after eight years it still looks fantastic.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
The sound is good. I like the western music that plays when you move around on Pandora. The soundtrack of the characters are of high quality and I will remember some of the voices for a long time.

I had a little problem with on detail on the sound. My character was the Gunzerker and after a short time in the sprint he breathes really heavy and loud. Since you run a lot he also breathes a lot hard and loud. Sometimes this was anyoing. However, he stops breathing if you run without sprinting for one or two seconds.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Well... The negative points I listed are already whining on a high level. 
To me the game is great fun. I have enjoyed the almost 40 hours and I would say it is one of the best shooters I have ever played. Especially the balancing act between the RPG and shooter elements is great and the many very funny side quests and crazy characters you meet along the way."
26251,very sick styll
26252,Its just fun.
26253,"it is just fun
"
26254,One of the best looter-shooters ever.
26255,its a really fun and good game for all types of people and i think you will enjoy it
26256,poop
26257,Without a doubt the best FPS action RPG + BL2 is the best one among the series
26258,it good
26259,good
26260,"i mean, theres not much for me to say, just buy it u want it trust me, best fps out there (there are sales for borderlands handsome collection for 8 euro which i got)"
26261,"Es un gran juego que siempre me encanta recomendar por la versatilidad que tiene. Como dicen en mi pais, sirve para dar bala (shooter), para sandbox y caminar haciendo secundarias, para aquellos que nos gusta completar todo el juego al 100% y por todos los secretos que ofrece. La rejugabilidad por si quieres conocer otra clases y last but not least, online. muy recomendado por si te gusta alguna de las anteriores."
26262,Very Nice
26263,Borderlands 3 is basically Borderlands 2 - 1 + 1 + 1 honestly
26264,Simply one of the best!
26265,tis fucking awesome but connection and shift servers are kinda wack
26266,pretty good game
26267,"This game right here is the king of the looter shooter genre. No competition!

This game will have you spending hours trying out new legendaries and new class builds with tons of combinations of weapons you can try with different shields and classmods. 

The writing in this game keeps you attention for the entire time during your first playthrough and the Villian of the story will blow your mind as everything is carefully thought out during this game.

This game also has mods like the UCP (Unofficial Community Patch) which rebalances the game and adds quality of life options you can toggle on for the game.

This game runs smoothly even on older systems and its not hard to get at least 60 FPS during even the most intense parts on 2010+ gaming PCs

Gameplay: Addictive
Dialog: Interesting
Art Style: Pretty Unique

Final take: WHY THE F*CK have you not pressed ""Add to Cart"" yet!?!"
26268,THIS GAME IS BROKE AS HELL THANKS EPIC GAMES AND THE DUMB CUNT RANDEY
26269,"Definitely worth playing through, even if you haven't played the first one. The story is great, the combat is challenging and fun, overall it's a great game."
26270,This game is funny as shit and super fun
26271,WHY DO I NOT HAV A ACCOUNT??!?!?
26272,Its neat.
26273,"I only made it partway through this one. Like it's predecessor, it just felt like the game that would never end, and there wasn't enough interesting stuff happening in the game to keep me playing. But I generally don't like games that are essentially ""grind your way to victory,"" where one enemy or boss is much like the last. Even the funny robots weren't enough to keep me invested."
26274,its alright once you farm good weapons it gets fun
26275,"this game is still great in 2021 if you need a single player and co-op game that has a lot of content then this is a top choice you can play with your friends or even offline on a couch with a second controller via split-screen or on pc with friends its got it all.  and this game is a old game and thus its a low spec game it can run really well on pretty much anything and its on this gen consoles ps5 / xbox x/s and past gen and this gens consoles aka ps4 and all the x box consoles after the original and its on ps3 its not on the wii or the wii u but it got realesed on the nintendo switch and if you had it on console you can move your save from console to pc or to another console for free and easily and the handsome collection is a better deal than the GOTY edition because not all dlc is not included the hc has all the dlc except fight for sanctuary and the op levels and some head hunter packs witch you dont really need to buy that are not included on GOTY and if your lazy you can download game saves online or use gibbed save editor to get perfect gear and max level in 5 minutes and you can mod the game 2 great mods are the comunity patch witch makes the game more rewarding and buffs bad weapons and the second is reborn witch ads alot of new weapons and updates enemy loot pools there both free and overall this is the best borderlands game and people still play it to this day its really worth your money and time but fight for santuary is not that good but op levels ad a huge amount of replay ablity and make the game harder and your character deal millions of damage a second to enemies that have billions and ammo cost a fortune.

note: split-screen co-op is not there buy default on pc but you can make it work but is pretty complicated and when you do get it to work you are gonna be running 2 instances of the game so it's quite demanding but after that it works flawlessly."
26276,yes
26277,YEAH
26278,yas
26279,Korea
26280,"Not gonna lie, its actually a pretty good game. But its defintly not a game you can play for more than 15 hours a year. It gets really boring sometimes and generally the game sucks without any companions to play with."
26281,bl2 in bl3 engine pls
26282,is cool ig
26283,this game is so much fun
26284,cool
26285,i love the story
26286,Game very good fun game shoot and loot fast kills and things LOOOT
26287,A looter shooter that provides a decent amount of humour and special weaponry.
26288,"First off--The dialogue makes me want to kill myself.

Through the dialogue, bland color scheme, sub-par music, there is great gameplay. Whether it be in the form of variety between different characters and play-styles of those characters, or the loot some strive for to be Jesus Christ himself, it is good gameplay. (If you like looter shooters.) [b] You can supplement the music with your own, and turn subtitles and voices off, which I recommend. [/b] 

One of the high points of the game for me was the dlcs, in which you finally get to look at something other than shit brown and semen snow. It looks like a completely different game! The only bad thing about them is they are pretty short. 

The side quests are quite often better than the main quests IMO."
26289,"vault hunter go brrrrr

would have preferred brrradadaa"
26290,Game sucks and fuck giovanni
26291,good

26295,"Supermarket's Review of Borderlands 2

 	-[Story and Setting]: [●●●●●]-
I've always found the story and setting of the borderlands games to be part of what makes them so great. Tons of dialogue, lots of personality in the characters, and a long story that keeps you invested throughout the game!

 	-[Graphics]:  [●●●●●]-
Dude.... Borderlands games have their own distinct type of graphics, with bold outlining and cartoony illustrations that really pop out. The graphics are just awesome. 

 	-[Audio]: [●●●●◌]-
Awesome voice acting, and really good all around audio. 

 	-[Difficulty]: [●●●◌◌]-
Accurate difficulty slider included, so you can make the game as difficult or easy as you want. 


	-[Additional Info:]-
[Game Time]:     Super long. You'll get plenty of hours out of this game. 
[Replayability]:     YES. You will play this game until your fingers bleed.
[Bugs]:     Not many. I didn't run into any
[Multiplayer]:     Super fun, super awesome multiplayer
[Was the Game worth it?]:     YES"
26296,"An older game with a newer version, but it still has a TON of DLC and lots of replay value. A cheap way to get together with friends and see if they like it before taking the plunge with BL3."
26297,Is good :)
26298,the forest look alike
26299,it nice and fun
26300,This is like my 5th time playing this game since like 2012 with hundreds of hours spent. Would you like to help me?
26301,One of the best games ever made. no doubt.
26302,its pretty good and thats all i have to say
26303,"This game is great fun solo and even greater fun with friends. It's one of the best sequels ever made.

Plus:
The variety of guns are great. There are so many 5 types of weapons: no effect, fire effective, electricity effect, corrosive effect and slag effect. Each elemental has an effect that works best on different enemies. This variety is fun.
Playing with friends enhances the experience, but you can also have lots of fun solo.
The variety of characters you can pick from makes the game replayable. 
It's an older game which means it's easier to run.
Overall it's very easy to get the hang of. As you progress you're skill improves.
The story is epic and contains one of the best villains in all of video games.
The music is really good and the cut scenes are pretty cool.
The story is satisfying and you'll probably want to play Borderlands 1 and 3 afterwards.
The DLC characters are AWESOMETACULAR.

Minus:
The game is fairly old now. Some aspects of the game are dated and will feel jarring.
The multiplayer is a bit weird and to this day I'm not entirely sure how it works.
It's replayable but if you haven't played it in a while and play with DLC's it'll feel like there's way too much to do.
Can get fatigued after playing for a few days in a row.
You may feel like the graphics are just not there for you. The art style is unique and not everyone likes it.

Rating:
I'd rate this game a 8.5/10. Bonkers gameplay, incredible story, fun action. You'll enjoy it!

26310,"It's good.
Better if you play with friends."
26311,"best borderlands imo
"
26312,"On a whim I decided to pick this game up, so I could have a new co-op shooter to play with my spouse.  We were not disappointed.

I am writing this review post-Borderlands 3 for reference.

While the gameplay has been improved in many ways with Borderlands 3, we found Borderlands 2 to be the more enjoyable experience.  The writing, the memorable characters and moments, the story overall for the base game and Tiny Tina's DLC were all excellent.

The game has one of the best villains I have seen in quite some time.  Borderlands 3 was never going to top Jack, but man is he leagues above the evil streamer twins.

Aspects of the game feel a bit archaic, and so does some of the humor, but if you like low brow humor, a memorable villain, a robot companion you want to enable friendly fire for, and tons and tons of loot, then you can't go wrong with Borderlands 2.

PS: It has a form of New Game +, so you can take your beefed up character to new heights!"
26313,Randy Pitchford is a terrible person
26314,"A lot of quests to follow, but also the ability to do more open world play.  Great for multiplayer.  Violent shooter, but the graphics style is more comic book."
26315,graphics are great and it has a great story line.
26316,"loveit 
"
26317,yes.
26318,"If always feeling under powered is fun for you, then this game is for you. I’m glad I got this game for 5 bucks, no way would I ever spend more on this piece of trash. The game is grindy and enemies always 2 shot you. I wish claptrap left my vault hunter to die so I wouldn’t be able to play this trash."
26319,"THE original looter-shooter, at least the first one I played, and man was it an experience.
GUNS, MODS, GRENADES galore assaulted my senses, but finally after owning this game for 7+ years have I finally replayed it. Again. For like the 7th time... ok maybe the 9th ANYWAY...

This game is made for and by its internal characters. The unchanging story still finds ways to make me laugh, even if i have heard that line at least 5-6 times already. Its designs are unique, its graphics are charming, the story is witty, daring, and gol-dern badass. My only issue with this game is certain parts of the game are extremely grindy or just downright time-consuming to complete.

DLCS add some much-needed story variety, as well as just straight up adding new content for high level play.

TLDR:Yes Yes Yes buy this game, even just to play it once.
"
26320,"Such a fantastic game, would absolutely recommend, worth every cent."
26321,Eh its okay
26322,the person im playing with is stupid and gay
26323,big shooty
26324,Pretty good aye. Tiny Tina DLC is one of the best DLC's around the industry imo.
26325,"Fun game, it can get a bit repetitive sometimes, but if you find it for less than $15, and you have the option to play with a buddy, this game will surely be a fun time for 30 or so hours.

I picked up the Handsome Collection for $8 a year ago, so keys online are cheap for the game. It's on sale regularly aswell, so please don't buy it for $20. You will regret it when you find it for a much lower price, when the refund period has expired."
26326,ok game
26327,
26328,Good game
26329,"High quality loot-and-shoot.  Played it on the 360 solo when it came out, replayed it on PC co-op with my husband, and it's a great time either way.  The tone and difficulty are both improved over the first game.  Have run into some connection issues but it's hard to tell what's the game and what's my husband's PC slowly dying."
26330,w
26331,"This game is thoroughly entertaining. Hilarious dialogue, hours of amazing content, inventive DLC, loot for days, and fun gunplay make BL2 one of the, if not the best, looter-shooters of all time."
26332,"it's a great game
"
26333,"Good game, many hours of gameplay"
26334,epic game
26335,lol
26336,"I found the difficulty unacceptable. Am I just playing wrong? Maybe. Maybe my guns are not powerful enough. But, in the game, I went through about 4000 dollars in one part. Then there was another boss, and I was not making a dent in it, and I kept on dying. So, I decided to play another game that was not going to frustrate me. Maybe I will give the game a chance again. But I doubt it. I was underlevel, I think, but I was playing a bunch of missions, and then hit one where most of the enemies were stronger than me, and I found no easy way to back out, and grind some more."
26337,good lol

26341,good game
26342,pretty good

26344,"While not super bad, there are just a bunch of issues killing the game.

-Half of it is designed for a single player, the other for 4, giving crappy balance no matter what you do.
-Multiplayer likes to crash for whatever reason.
-Some of the design makes you want to punch the devs. Like a quick travel in front of a boss, but no ammunition. Doesn't sound so bad, huh? Just quickly go to the base and come back. Nope. Turns out it's a one-way travel, without any hint or warning about it. Can repeat the entire big dungeon that takes 2 hours. NICE.

Also. Just in general. If I buy a game, the last thing I want when I first boot it is advertisement for another game. Seriously. Be happy to get some money for this underwhelming game.
Not recommended for sure."
26345,"Great story, great characters, great gameplay, great loot. This game has it all. You should wait before it's on sale to buy this. Buying the handsome collection on sale gets you more bang for your buck."
26346,Yes.
26347,"The game is absolutely fantastic, even though it's quite old now in 2020. I come off of it, then find myself back, playing away. To me, if the game is able to draw the player in without unfair tricks, it's definitely a classic. 
The only warning would be -- highly addictive, can devour hours of your time in a blink of an eye."
26348,engaging and very different feel from the xbox360
26349,"to a depressingly poor guy like me, this game is great. Being unable to afford a pc or having consistent connection, this game solves both of the problems, it runs great on a laptop and works in offline mode."
26350,it gets better after the 80th boss kill
26351,save quit
26352,yes
26353,I can not even begin to describe how many times I cried while playing this. It is and will remain one of my all time favourite games.
26354,click your mouse on head of enemy. colorful guns come out of corpse. pick up more powerful gun from corpse. repeat for hundreds of hours. memes. great dlc. endorphin addicted brain makes playing other games difficult.

26363,"A great 1st-person experience centered entirely on variance of sweet guns! Coupled with an engaging story, multiple different characters to play, and tons of DLC, Borderlands 2 is a staple to anyone's Steam account."
26364,"Its really fun when you start to get into it

26365,"yes

26366,the game is fun for down time. 9/10
26367,this game is awsome i cant say enogh of how fun it is
26368,"Probably nostalgia talking, but this is my all-time favorite shooter. Super fun gameplay, interesting characters, and a fun, engaging story. Grinding gets old pretty quick, and the end-game is literally just replay the game, but it's still fun so I would recommend."
26369,it gud
26370,"I bought the handsome collection when It was on special and it was worth it.

An FPS-RPG Hybrid that has stood the test of time. Still fun to play even this long after it's release. Unfortunately the handsome collection is not on special anymore, and multiplayer is difficult to set up if you don't have friends. However, if you have time, money and/or friends this is definitely a good one to check out."
26371,<3
26372,it's damn good fun
26373,"[h1] First Impressions [/h1] 
Before playing Borderlands 2 (BL2) with my friend on his X-box 360, I'd heard promising things about it. He played it with greater enthusiasm than I did, based on how he beat the game with all but 1 of the classes. Regardless, based on that positive experience, I got BL2 for Steam a while ago, and I'm glad I did, especially with the Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary DLC that was released for free June 2019. On that note, my review will be based on the idea you have the upgrade pack DLC. Aside from Tales from the Borderlands, I have all the main games, though I haven't played the initial game yet. 


[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
BL2 fuses FPS gameplay with RPG elements, which sounds really obvious, but hasn't been done as often as you'd expect. As you kill enemies and complete quests, you'll earn XP and level up, with every level-up giving you a skill point to spend on your character. There are 6 classes to play as, each with 3 skill trees based on different strengths and playstyles. Some focus on damage output, while others are centered around coop play by boosting your allies' stats. Guns drop in abundance, with stats that'll vary widely based on whether it's an enemy drop, boss drop, quest completion reward, prize box loot, or a coveted golden key usage. RNG makes it so that you can never be certain when you'll get a great weapon, though you can be fairly certain they won't generate from a basic enemy or random crate. You can also try your luck at Moxxi's slot machine or buy a deal of the day from vending machines. Not like there's much use for all the money you get otherwise.  You'll do the same for grenades and shields. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2161669378
[h1] Controls [/h1] 
Sticking to my guns, I used a controller to play, and it works very well. However, it's also possible to play the game with a mouse and keyboard. Movement and aim is controlled with the 'L' and 'R' joysticks respectively. The 'L trigger' brings up your gun sights, 'L bumper' activates your character's special ability (if available), 'R trigger' fires your gun, and 'R bumper' throws grenades. There's a healthy amount of platforming in BL2, so you'll jump with 'A.' 'X' reloads your gun, holding down 'B' will crouch, and 'Y' will switch to a different gun. I should mention that the best way to switch guns is with the 'D-pad,' as over time you'll unlock the ability to assign a gun to each cardinal direction. 


[h1] Story [/h1] 
Continuing from the first game, Handsome Jack is the jackass people love to hate.  There are 6 playable characters, all of whom are willing to run around Pandora, helping familiar characters with their bizarre objectives, all in a bid to take down Jack.  Spoiler alert, you won't be seeing him in BL3.  Although the game fuses RPG elements onto a FPS, and has serious moments here and there (looking at you Roland), the world is comically indifferent to violence and death.  

As a personal theory, I think death is widely a non-issue.  After all, when you die, you just pay a fee and respawn, and when you return to places that you cleared of enemies earlier, they'll spawn in again, including bosses.  It's only when the developers want to use someone's death for story purposes that it becomes permanent, which makes me think of FFVII and Aerith.  Anyways, to be honest I don't pay much attention to the story.  It's too flippant for me to take seriously.


[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
BL2 is 8 years old, so the graphics aren't anything to be blown away by, though there is a free HD texture DLC available.  I'm not an artistic person, but the BL series has an aesthetic and style to it that's easily recognizable.  It's one of those factors that helps a franchise stand out, without requiring the most cutting-edge graphics.  I've never been put off by the visuals, even when opening a port-a-potty, so it must not be that bad.  

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2161670090
[h1] Sound Design [/h1] 
Honestly, I've never really paid that much attention to the music in the game. However, when looking up the OST, it's surprisingly atmospheric and somber, instead of being wacky or oddball. I think the game is better for going with this kind of music, which has a Space Cowboy vibe to it. You'll be hearing lots of gunshots and explosions throughout the game, and though they likely lack in realism, I've played BL2 enough that it sounds recognizable and correct. 


[h1] Pros [/h1] 
🌟 Between grenades, shields, special abilities, and multiple firearm types and elemental effects, you are well-equipped to battle against enemies. They don't tend to mix disparate foes together, IE there won't be enemies resistant to multiple elemental effects at once. 
🌟 The game can get repetitive over time since what you do early in the game is what you'll be doing at the end. However, the gameplay is rather fun, there's a lot of content to play through, and it's geared towards coop play. 
🌟 As long as you don't blindly rush into the thick of a flock of enemies or go in under-leveled, the difficulty should be palatable to most players. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2161671564
[h1] Cons [/h1] 
❌ If you play all the way through the DLC content at the levels where they're worth anything to your character, you'll wind up over-leveled for the main game for a while. As they increased the level cap and added these optional areas, they didn't adjust the game so everything shifts with your level. 
❌ This would be a contentious point, but the classes don't seem to be equivalent to one another. For instance, Zer0 seems to be weaker in contrast to Salvador, though specific set-ups and skilled players can still excel with him.  
❌ If you play with 3-4 people, since loot isn't shared, it can be tedious and annoying determining who gets high-level items. 


[h1] Tips [/h1]
🔍 If you plan on doing multiple playthroughs, go for the weaker, less satisfying classes first. That way it'll be an improvement when you get to play as one of the better classes. 
🔍 Unless you already have the different BA unlock requirements memorized, having a guide up as you play is worthwhile, especially for the vault symbols. 


[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] 
It is disappointing that BL2 doesn't have local coop (unless you're willing to mad scientist it), as it'd be a great way to kill time when my friends come to visit.  I'm able to play with them online though, and in the long-run that's the better feature to have.  There is occasional lag or stutters, but I think that has more to do with my friends' internet connection (small town) than the game.  

That issue aside, I understand why BL is so popular, as it's a great example of what you want out of fusing two styles of games together.  The two shouldn't clash or work against each other, but should build upon and support the other, making something greater than what either would be by itself, and BL has done a great job of making a FPS/RPG hybrid.  Plus, there's more than enough post-apocalyptic games that are dark, gritty, and depressing, so it's nice to see a different approach to it.  BL2 has been bundled and on sale multiple times, so if you don't have it already, wait until you find a solid deal before pulling the trigger.  However, depending on your take on BL3, it might be worth skipping over in lieu of the latest entry.  It'd be hypocritical of me to scold someone for doing so, seeing as I have yet to play the original BL.

26380,"Any review pre-dating 2017 is irrelevant.

In terms of gameplay, Borderland 2 is GARBAGE. The standards have changed. It is no longer acceptable to have a player clear an entire area, only to send him back for some BS, worthless quest in that area, tens-of-hours later in the game's progression.

Unless you enjoy going from point A to point B, then from point C to point D, THEN from point E to point F; only to get a useless ""reward weapon"", avoid Borderlands 2. It is dated and completely stupid."
26381,yes
26382,"Good fun, not totally mindless, and is playable by semi-elderly newbs."
26383,LOVE IT
26384,"I never played borderlands, as I didn't like the game until I gave it a chance....

One of the best games I've ever played. Played borderlands 3 just after I finished 2 and I wanted more of 2 for some reason.

The single player is already insane but the fun just multiplies as you go co-op. Best is, your mates (or you) doesn't even need a super computer to play the game.
Recommend 10/10"

26395,"Got this on sale couple months ago. Needless to say, this game still looks pretty good in 2020 and definitely packs many hours of gameplay. 

Personally there are some things I liked and some I did not like about this game:

Liked
- Iconic style
- Humorous dialogue and situations
- Interesting characters
- Dramatic irony

Disliked
- Gunplay feels slightly lacking in impact (perhaps the sound design? or animation?)
- Some objectives were incredibly hard to find (circled the map for hours trying to figure out how to jump across an unjumpable gap, only to realize I was supposed to circle through the other way, but it was still a very long walk.
- Couldn't quite get into the elemental system... Yes I understood what each element did. But I ended up keeping just a lot of different versions of the same weapons in order to diversify my elemental damage.
- Character progression felt slow and perks/powers weren't that significant early on. It takes a number of points to get up the power curve.

Overall, bargain bin adventure shooter, but doesn't quite hold one's attention as the gunplay mechanics get pretty samey after a few iterations."
26396,good gameplay mechanics
26397,GUNS! GUNS! GUNS! GUNS!
26398,It's fucking garbage.

26404,a lot less guns than the first borderlands but still a good fun game
26405,One of the few games that have managed to make grinding fun.
26406,love this games humor and loot haha
26407,"There is no amount of alcohol to make this game fun or funny, don't waste your time with this"
26408,"Bot was funny.

Handsome guy was a Douche.

Most people were Psycho.

Except this one group which were the robots friends, and they convinced me to kill the Douche and the Psychos.

Overall game was good. Would give it a 10 out of 10. 

Bot I would give an 11 out of 10, best bot ever."
26409,"Coming from someone who played this game for 200+ hours on Xbox One and now completed it twice over again this is in my belief one of the best games ever made and my personal favourite game ever.

15/10. buy it because on sale its like £5 and a complete steal at that"

"
26436,"Borderlands 2 is, in my opinion, one if not the best looter shooter. I have spent around 4000 hours on a pirated version of this game back when I was a poor student and I have to say they were the best moments of my life, having fun with friends, breaking the game, going in solo to shit on raid bosses and things like that. If you don't want to play Borderlands 3 because its story is complete garbage, give Borderlands 2 a shot. It's a lot of fun, the DLCs are outstanding and it costs jack shit now."

26439,"Owning this game means I cannot purchase the Borderlands Bundle on Steam. I wanted to buy Borderlands GOTY, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel + DLC, and Borderlands 3. Getting it through the Borderlands Bundle would be cheaper even if Borderlands 2 and its DLC weren't subsidized in the price. However, I cannot purchase it, because I own this game already; I can only send it as a gift.

Steam can let people purchase bundles of games, a few of which they already own. The Valve Complete Game Set will subsidize the cost of Half-Life 2 if you already own it when you purchase the bundle.

It [i]is[/i] an issue with [i]this developer.[/i] Every other bundle allows you to do that. It [i]is[/i] an issue with [i]this game.[/i] If I did not own it already, I could purchase other games for cheaper??? That makes no sense."

26480,"I've played borderlands 2 over many different gaming platforms/ editions and I must say, this game just doesn't get old, Especially when you play it through with friends. If you enjoy grinding/ farming loot this is a great game for you. Since the game did release in 2012 it does have some old game mechanics/ physics but in all honesty the great story, the greats dlcs and all the loot you can farm really make up for it. The borderlands universe has such engaging lore to it, for example the sirens, the seraphs, the vaults etc.
I may be looking at this game through rose coloured glasses as I have played and enjoyed this game for many years over many platforms and have many fond memories of it but the reviews speak for themselves. This is a great game, especially if you can pick up the season pass or grab the handsome collection and get all the dlc for free... that is a lot of free content for the price of 1 game :)"
26481,2hard
26482,"What a game!

I decided to buy the handsome collection during  a summer sale because of all the amazing things i had heard about this game and they were all right! I was instantly addicted to the loot aspect of the game always searching the next best gun!

About the story, i never played BL1 so i didn't know the backstory but still managed to understand everything, all the characters are great Claptrap is funny, all the npcs are great, main quests are great, Handsome Jack is one of the best Villains ever in video games, he is effing hilarious, has amazing dark humour and will never stop making you laugh!

The main quest line story and characters is what makes this game good but what makes it amazing are the side quests! I will not spoil any of them but the side quests are Amazing!

DLC's - now i got the handsome collection so i got a bunch of dlcs some of which i still haven't finished but the dlcs that i did play were amazing my favourite is the one with the dragons, but otherwise i would not have bought these many dlcs.

Overall 9.5/10"
26483,"I may have have discovered and started playing this game a little later, but I have to admit. It's a huge amount of fun, and the graphics are decently timeless, you can play it anytime."
26484,Ah hell yeah its a nice old but amazing
26485,GREAT STORY AND GAMEPLAY ISNT BORING

26509,very nice
26510,is gud
26511,"WARNING!!! THIS GAME CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT GRINDING!.
But if you are ok with killing a boss over and over so many times for just an item you already have but with wrong element/low level. Then this game is just the thing for you"
26512,its an amazing game
26513,"This game is simply amazing, the storyline is great, the map is fun. Only thing that keeps confusing me on every playthrough is the way driving works in the game. But you get used to it fast. Def 10/10 would play again. Oh wait, I did play it again :D"

26515,pretty fun
26516,"It's 2020 and Borderlands 3 is already out even in Steam, so what's the point in playing outdated Borderlands 2? 
Alright, let's be honest. It's not a Borderlands 3 review, but still I'll compare these two games a lot. Let's go point by point.
1)Graphics. Ehhh......Borderlands 3. No comments needed
2)Visual style and aestetics. Yup, surprisingly it's not the same thing as graphics. Moreover, Borderlands 2 is so much better than the third part when it comes to style. Sometimes it seems to me like the designer team for Borderlands 3 went straight for ""let's go add more annoying flashy high-resolution textures"". See, the visual style is pretty much the same in the whole Borderlands series, but Borderlands 1&2 is aware what they coul not possibly impress anyone with the graphics these games had. Instead, they went for aestetic use of this style. And oh boy, that's where these games shine until this very day. The graphics isn't the main thing if you use good graphics just for attracting casuals. Borderlands 2 went for using PhysX quite too much in my personal opinion though. Ah,yeah, you still remember it's my personal opinion,right?
3)Music. It's...functional in both parts. Nothing impressive, far from Hotline Miami level of immersion, but still just enough to make the fights feel better in dynamic. I'd love to say it does the same outlining for drama moments, but let's be honest, the whole Borderlands...Ah,right,to next point
4)Plot. I'm not good at writing so I'm only capable of valuing plots from average gamer's position. And let's be honest, Borderlabds was never about the plot. Yeah, yeah, we got neat,cool, dramatic and slightly overrated (YES I SAID THAT) Handsome Jack arc, but really great plot isn't why we play Borderlands.
5)Gameplay. Because it's 2020 so the gameplay only goes as a fifth part of review. Such a horrible times we live in...Okay, I doubt anyone would read this SLIGHTLY outdated review to this point, so I'll try to be short. Borderlands 2 isn't a perfect game for everyone, but it's basically a culmination for all the positive gameplay features we love the whole Borderlands for. But Borderlands 3 does all of that worse and the only major thing what you'll notice among changes is unnecessary expended customization and pleasurable but underutilized parcour. The rest? Shooting feels better in Borderlands 2. Map design is better in Borderlands 2 (even despite it feels too flat sometimes). Farming in Borderlands 3? Only if you can get used to the thought what legendary weapon are now trash too. Eh....I'd like to tell you about how better Borderlands 2 in it's balance, but Garold+Grog Nozzle can speak for me. Anyway, the final conclusion is...
Borderlands 2 is something about 7/10 when we count the small game outdateness and something about 8.5/10 if we dont. Much and much better than Borderlands 3"
26517,When I play this I feel like I'm taking a overdose of some good shit!

26530,great game to help new players into the  looter shooter genre
26531,"Can spend a lot of time running around shooting things, finding legendaries, loot chests, join a gang"
26532,"Awesome single shooter play -  I've never played with other players, but I'll bet that would be phenomenal as well!"
26533,My favorite game of all time
26534,Better than 3...
26535,"funniest shooter, open world game i've ever played"
26536,Free game best game
26537,"Pretty cool. Fix the fucking ground collision or what ever its called, I got stuck so many times it's ridiculous. And why the hell do you have to jump to get over small sets of stairs? Like literally jump to get up one step, only to bang your head on the door frame. This was in the main building in the sanctuary so why the hell did no one notice? Is it just me? Some of the missions are just impossible even at the level your supposed to be, like the enemies had ridiculous amounts of health and did ridiculous amounts of damage. Or maybe my gun sucked but I tried many approaches, even grinding down the enemy's heath stealthily but the health bar barely dropped at all with each shot of the pretty decent sniper rifle I was using at the time.

Yeah aside from that, it's a good game and I recommend it."
26538,FUN

26541,Play it. Great game
26542,"Really loved the game and the story. The style is very unique and eye-catching. Frustrating at times, but over all I really enjoyed playing through this game 3 times. Never gets old!"
26543,Borderlands: The Handsome Collection buy on discount. worth it.

"
26548,"One of the best games i have ever played, so much fun in every aspect."
26549,it's borderlands.
26550,"I never thought that I would have tried these kind of games and I really haven't liked the first person genre even from all the YouTubers supporting it and it's overwhelming positive reviews I still didn't think i'd like it, but last steam summer sale, the game and the all of it's dlc for less then 5 bucks i'd be an idiot not to buy it. What I got out of the game and what i'm still getting is hours of fun, entertaining and smooth gameplay. I really like this game and all of it's characters and all the abilities and guns and i'm still playing this old game to this day. One big reason I love this game is because this game is able to play on most computers hell I was able to play this on a dell home computer and it ran smooth on low settings, then I bought a cheap Nvida graphics card and it runs great on high settings so no matter what computer you have i'll bet you'll be able to run this game with a high success of it running smooth. The game isn't perfect though like many others have said the game does get repetitive and I end up taking months apart from playing this game because of it but the thing is I can't stop playing this game. My advice is this game is worth it but I would advise to wait until it goes on sale because while i got it for cheap overall the price is a bit high. Overall a great game and the series in general is great (ignoring the pre-sequel) and would hope you'd give it a shot too."
26551,"Its borderlands cant go wrong
"
26552,Borderlands 2. 111111/10
26553,"better then first, better then third, better then pre sequel, but we all know that Borderlands Legends is the best"
26554,I enjoy quest based games.  Borderlands 2 is a team/solo game and fits my play style very well.  Love the different graphics.
26555,"I am not gonna hurt ya, I am just gonna buzz your brains in.

I just killed myself, HALP!

--Krieg"
26556,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who like FPSs, RPGs, or has a working brain and computer. 

PROS:

+ Good story and lovably hate-able villain
+ Good playable characters (especially Krieg, Zer0, and Maya)
+ Memorable NPCs 
+ Pretty good graphics
+ Nice map
+ Tiny Tina
+ Bazillions of guns (I think it's actually closer to about 17,000,000, but come on, that's a ton)
+ Lots of fun to be had

Disclaimer: the cons section is longer only because I feel I have to explain myself more in order to make a valid point. Imo, the pros faaaaaar outweigh the cons; they are just easier to explain.)

CONS:

- Humor can be really good at times, but some of the time it just sounds like a 6th grader wrote the script
- The Fight For Sanctuary DLC is not included with the Handsome Collection anymore (not really the an issue with this game, but still, in the words of Scooter, ""Uncool, bro, uncoool."") This bars you from what I think is a basic feature of the game: creating level 30 characters once you have beaten the story once. Anyway, I digress. 
-  Random AI bugs (enemies getting stuck in place, not shooting at you even when you're right in front of them, and so on and so forth).
- An annoying amount of unbalance (TVHM is not great at times; I can only imagine what UVHM must be like).
- The game randomly breaks (at least for me). Let me explain: I began experiencing this issue after about 100 hours of playtime. The game would boot normally, but when I tried to load my character (regardless of which one), the game would start seizing up on the loading screen and crash after popping up a window that said something about a fatal error linked to a faulty or missing config file. I had been playing just earlier that week, there had been no Windows updates, no driver updates, no major steam update, and I had never even gone into my BL2 game files. I looked it up and apparently this is a somewhat common occurrence that has plagued the game since launch. Whether this is an issue with the way Steam installs/launches the game or the game itself, it was an annoying issue to have, especially since I could not play BL2 for over a month (horrors lol). It eventually kind of resolved itself. I have no idea how. I uninstalled, reinstalled, and verified file integrity (before even launching the game after the reinstall). There was already one file that was corrupted or missing so I would assume this is at least partially due to the way Steam installed it. Either way, very frustrating. 
- Constructors, Threshers, and Stalkers (anyone who has played this game knows what I am talking about)

Overall, this is a simply amazing experience that any FPS fan will want to play. The gunplay is satisfying, the characters are great, and the graphics are unique. Never gets old 8.7/10"

26560,"Now thats something unusual. A game with exceptionally beautiful graphics, good gunplay and dark and specific humour. How much I love the two first gamemodes (normal and true vault hunter mode), the ultimate vault hunter mode is a joke, dont bother playing it. It has a replayability potential, great DLCs worth the while (torgue, fight for sanctuary and dragonkeep dlcs being the best). Love this game."

26571,This game is just perfect in every thing
26572,Massive replayability and lots of fun with multiple groups of friends
26573,"Classic game that execute styles perfectly. On certain difficulty, the gameplay can be mindless yet fun. And that's perfect for an after hours game. Sometimes the writing and characters can be annoying, but at least I can shoot some bad guys after that."
26574,yes
26575,like it !!!!!!
26576,"It is certainly a good game, but not for me."
26577,I haven't really undestood what a little masterpiece I was playing until I finished Borderlands 3. Now I see that something priceless was lost.
26578,"I've been playing this game since I was in high school. Is it the best game ever? No. Is it a good game? That's subjective. It is, however, my favorite game, and I keep returning to it every year or so. It's comforting, like a warm blanket of stupid cartoon-y violence that I know like the back of my hand."

26593,"Pick up gun, shoot gun have fun time. 

Replay the same mission 12 times because you only play with your buddies and you can never remember what it was you were doing or what character you were using.

Get transported back to the early 2010s as you laugh at jokes that haven't been relevant for nearly a decade.

10/10 will continue to not play this game on my own."

26600,"Borderlands is absolute mayhem that you share and enjoy with friends. The best shoot'n'loot on the market. If you like guns, Borderlands 2 has 3 million unique guns and what's not to like about that? Apart from the never-ending loot tables, you have rich/funny storylines and sidequests to your heart's content. Visually, the game is beautiful. The unique cartoon like art style further adds to my love for the Borderlands franchise. In short; many guns, many story, many pretty, many fun. 110% recommend."
26601,"[b] All reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive [/b]. 
If there's one game on the steam store capable of encapsulating the same amount of pleasure shown on the review page; then this would be the one. The base game alone is a thousand hours of game play, the DLC adds thousands onto that and don't get me started if you play with friends. My review ours are 193 but I've spent thousands of hours on the PS3 version without even playing ALL of the DLC. This game arguably has the best DLC ever made in a video game especially with Tiny Tina's Assault on castle keep which is my favourite and Borderland's peak. King of Looter shooters, this title will still hold up for another 8 years without a doubt. Its sequel however is a let down and won't last as long but this game will always be in my heart and will always be that one pub you always come crawling back to."
26602,video game pew pew
26603,"0/5 this game isn't about crossing a border
my immsersion is ruined"
26604,"Fun gameplay in general. Good to play singleplayer for the first playthrough, but the replayability dwindles afterwards. Multiplayer with randoms via the matchmaking is not recommended. Playing with friends makes for the best experience, as you can combo your skills and abilities to become potentially overpowered, plus it's simply always fun to just play games with friends."
26605,"The new update made the game unplayable, stuttering fps drops texture glitches and can't connect online anymore. Hey Randy you pedophile, I WILL NEVER BUY BORDERLANDS 3 SO GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!!!!"
26606,This is literally the best game ever created.
26607,i hate claptrap please let me kill him.
26608,Um game 100% delirante e sufocante!
26609,Yes
26610,"Probably on the top 10 of best games i have ever played. the art style is really unique and nice to look at. I love how there is a lot of humor in the game, and that the game can balance it with more somber tones at points in the story. there is, of course, the usual enormous variety of guns, similar to BL 1 and 3. The enemy variety is incredible, ranging from nut jobs who run at you screaming to an enemy that gets more dangerous if headshotted. overall, this is a highly unique and fun game that will keep you busy for a long time. 

PS. Dont buy the base game. wait for The Handsome Collection to go on sale, you will get the pre sequel along with all the dlc for pretty much the same price as the base game.

overall rating - !0/!0"
26611,"it still holds up, even in 2020"
26612,It's a really fun game and the humor they put in this games is hilarious.
26613,"What can I say? Borderlands 2 is a excelent 1st person shooter with a lot of content to discover and explore, even when you have played the third and you're still crying when playing Maya. 10/10 would fap to a siren again :,)"
26614,"I bought this game on ps3 originally and it definetly made my childhood so i bought it on pc to play with friends. Great story, humor and for its time great ai and open world. Its a great multiplayer game and couldnt reccomend it more."
26615,"So i played borderlands 1 and felt asleap then woke up then again slept. This was so boring that i slept whole weak. Then i bought borderlands 2 and i was better way way better, turns out in borderlands 2 u get to play the game without falling asleap, awesome. This game rocks like the story is fuckin great, not yakuza lvl, but still good. U have 6 classes 4 pussy ones and 2 good ones gunzerker and psycho, y the fuck u play this game with badass music like a pussy when u can fuckin murder everybody and more. 10/10 delete pussy classes"
26616,Great single player campaign so far!
26617,"Borderlands is one of those game series that you pick up, and you give it a shot, and then you're glued to the screen for several hours. I own it on console already, and now that I own it on PC, I've been doing a Full Team Playthrough of it with some friends. It's been fun. I recommend this game, to mostly everyone, because you never know what might do it for someone. But if you like shooters, RPG's, Dungeon crawlers, funny (and purposely dumb) writing, blood and gore, shooting robots, or throwing your gun like a grenade, this game has something for you.

10/10. Good game"
26618,cool shooter game
26619,Great game
26620,Very good
26621,"gud game, like it"
26622,Fun Game
26623,"The best Borderlands game. Infinitly replayable, moddable, full of content. Its unique graphics, physics and AI system, although considered flawed, compose a most enjoyable combat. Do not turn the music down, the good majority are incredible."
26624,eh işte
26625,"I believe that Borderlands 2 is one of the best pastime games on the market, an infinite number of missions to do in co-ops and weapons, not to mention the many weapons and the price of the game that is almost given.
like its predecessors it never disappoints, I highly recommend buying the complete dlc package that unlocks numerous maps and as many missions to do.
it is a really good game I highly recommend it."
26626,shooting & looting are so much fun
26627,"Bloodshed, heroic story, humour... what else do you want?"
26628,"sarıyor
"
26629,"Not sure why steam says I've only played 4 hours; I have completed the game multiple times and enjoyed it thoroughly!

+ Excellent Co-Op experience
+ Funny story, characters, writing
+ Runs well

- Nitpicky, but at times, can feel like a bit of a grind. Also holding the ""W"" key to move for such long times results in wrist soreness and such. Definitely not enough to put me off playing it though."
26630,Kinda liked it
26631,Nice
26632,Handsome Jack fanfic plzz
26633,"the mission is aight in the begining but when you're deep in, the rescue mission is pretty intense but fun at the same time"
26634,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!?! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY!!!
26635,What isn't there to like!
26636,A̶i̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶N̶o̶ ̶R̶e̶s̶t̶ ̶F̶o̶r̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶ ̶W̶i̶c̶k̶e̶d̶  Ain't No Place For No Heroes
26637,"great game
"
26638,"Ok. Let's be honest, this is one of the best games out there. Story is great, gun-play is great, weapons look great, bosses are great, the characters are great and so on. The only major problem is that the beginning is boring as crap, but once you get past it, you are in for a ride my friend. Oh. Right. SAWTOOTH CAULDRON. Ok, so most of the game is great after the beginning. Now the question is: Should you buy it? My response? Do it, it changed my life and perception of video games as a whole. You will not regret it from all the great story and comedy and characters. Speaking of characters, Handsome Jack is like one of the best villains in video games, up there with GLADOS and Vaas. If Jack wasn't the main villain and it was your everyday corrupt company owner, the game would be 1000 times worse. Killing Handsome Jack after all you've done and all you've seen is like reaching the top of Mount Everest. You did it. You accomplished what the main goal the whole experience was made for after all this time. I mean, he totally wasn't the best character and G-box Softies aren't going to bring him back in cliche ways to enhance their game because they ran out of creativity heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-HEH-HEH-HEH-HE-AAAAAAAAAA -



Point is: Buy this game. Please just do it, you won't regret it like i said earlier."

26648,I Recommend.
26649,"After 10 failed attempts to make a SHIFT name so I could play my single player game, i gave up. A perfectly good game got uninstalled, ill go play something else."
26650,all time classic grab 4 friends and have a blast. great and funny characters and alot of uniqueness.
26651,This is a fantastic game. Be ready to laugh. Be ready to cry. Just play it.
26652,"remember, no refunds!"
26653,"Sometimes it's feels a little silly for silliness sake, and sometimes it bogs down with sorting through weapons. But lets be honest, It wouldn't be Borderlands without that, and the excellent game play more than makes up for any slower notes."
26654,Late game is just a mess. The DLC's are so unbalanced they are almost unplayable.
26655,"Basically the most perfect FPS RPG ever made!
Massive following, fantastic DLC, brilliant art style and story writing, Great replay-ability.

If you can Get the Handsome Collection when its on sale then your winning at life! As it contains ALL DLC!

PS: Game can frame dip by a lot at points due to old DX9 standards. Particularly on more modern cards like 10 series. But don't despair, its still completely playable with some ini file tweaks and settings changes in Nvidia control panel.

Have FUN!"
26656,One of the best Looting games ever.
26657,Easily one of the best games ever made.
26658,"A big map, many missions, many weapons, a particular graphic."
26659,good
26660,It was very good after 8 years.
26661,if you are looking for a great co-op game to play with up to 3 friends then this is it.

26663,"It has so much to do, and I first thougt what many people thought. That it was a gory inapropriate game made for mature kids. Its actaully not. Very kidish graphics, and gore is like none. I encourage you to buy this game!"

26669,git gut ?
26670,very good game
26671,"Borderlands 2 everybody
A game that truly defies cartoon gore, and since the third has arrived, maybe i'll give out an opinion on why i recommended this game.

it doesn't have much to do, and the missions can be boring sometimes but the enemies are the most fun and challenging to kill and there's a lot of enemies, there is so many loots and cash scattered around the whole map that you can collect.

so many guns that you can't even decide which one you'll use. literally. cool ability for each character that you choose, and you can play alone or either with friends. you decide 

Still not interested or scared that you'll regret buying it? then don't buy it. if this game is not your type of game then don't buy it unless your friends are playing it because its more fun with friends (anything's more fun with friends).

This has gone on long enough, thank you for those who actually wasted their time reading this review. and i hope you can actually have fun with this game ! oh and one more thing, get it on sale because its cheaper (duh). alright that's it ! happy Playing everybody ! check out my YT channel Qyu Siahaan !"
26672,shit game poop and shit and bad and shit
26673,I've played borderlands for several years on console but i decided to get it for pc no regrets
26674,idk how i got above 100 hours in this game but hella fun its worth a try if you dont want to buy/dont have enough for bl3
26675,loved it
26676,Its a good game i guess.
26677,"this game is brilliant, from the art development to the co-op modes. a must play shooter with an awesome story line.
"
26678,"company behind are making the older Borderlands games this one included run into problems to have people funnel over to their new Borderlands 3, Their CEO is a problematic person who doesnt care about his workers. The use Epic store exclusives to have us "" lesser "" people wait months and years for their game releases which they release for more or less full price minus a short period upto launch, where you can not be sure "" WHAT "" state of game you getting, so cautious persons who wait will have to get an old game for full price. 

Their latest games are woke, their DLCs are pricy and woke.

PLEASE DO NOT support a company like this!"

26685,Just do it.
26686,Never gets old... The random loot and wacky dialogue is very nice and the gameplay is awesome. 10/10 very fun game

26701,"Amazing game, played this on so many different platforms and still love every new playthrough!"
26702,I'd say it's shoot shoot loot loot but I play the melee class so I run around with a buzzsaw axe and wipe the floor with enemies so its more like wack wack loot loot {Insert Insane screaming}. 10/10. get it
26703,UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES FU
26704,I personally think this is the best in the series.  Absolutely high fun factor game.
26705,"If you get it on sale, it's an entertaining shooter. Controls much better than I expected. 
If you like driving the warthog in Halo, you'll probably like this as there's a good deal of vehicular shooting. It's not really my thing, so this is not a ""go to"" game for me. The shooting and sniper shots are very satisfying so I do come back every now and then."
26706,"The game is really AWESOME.I recommend it to anyone who likes co op,shooter games,looter games and all that is AWESOME."
26707,gud gam
26708,"Borderlands 2 is a game that I can easily recommend to you. Whether you are familiar with looter shooter games or not. Unless you've tried Borderlands and haven't really liked it, I don't think Borderlands 2 has a great deal to steal your interest.

It also includes simple but good storytelling compared to games of the same genre, graphics although not as good as realistic games but with its own charm, fast and rewarding gameplay or loot that make for an excellent gaming session."
26709,"Silly, funny, gratuitous. Most fun when hooning around with three friends in multiplayer. Mac-Windoze crossplay for the win, too!"
26710,"This game is a lot of silly fun.
How fun? Am on my third playthrough with a different character (Gaige the mecromancer this run).
Haven't actually finished the entire game (about 98% done); it's just too much fun to start from beginning with a new character (with different skill sets) and engage in some looter-shooter chaos.
Take a trip to Pandora, you won't regret it.

26711,A s s h o l e sex
26712,"Like other Borderlands games, it's got some fun dungeon crawling rogue-like rpg elements mixed with cringy high-school nerd humor.  Overall a fun time though.  7.5/10"
26713,"""How hilarious / You just set off my trap card / Your death approaches"" for 100 hours.
Would do it again"
26714,"I liked the game while I was playing with a friend, but alone this game is a f-ing nightmare. The balance is utterly retarded, not designed for solo play, sadly. The drops are shit, they have 1000000000000000 weapons but 99.99% are useless except at level 1, to kill level 1 mobs. Anything above level 1 is hard or very hard to kill. I finished the game, playing in two was again awesome, even if the weapons are shit, or the drops are shit, but the story is good and some of the recordings are pretty awesome. But again... playing this game alone is the biggest shit ever designed. At level 50, every mobs does 10-250 times more damage than you, has 50-500 more armour than you and the elites are utter shit. Some mobs are level 55, with 1500-2500 more health and armour than you which is retarded but well... it wasn't me who designed it. A shitty spider with 50k life, does 25k damage, one lame skeleton destroys a 35k shield in a hit. 50k is like... being a leaf. And wall I was trying to finish was achievements :P I am not sad that I played it, it's an awesome game with a friend, but alone... it's just a nightmare. I don't have 5 years to finish a level and a lame achievement, I just gave up!"
26715,"Well, you can't unhear Clap-trap's annoyingly fun dialogues!"
26716,almost 60 hrs after only 3-4 days? 5 days tops lol. that alone says a whole lot is it? very worth it esp in summer sales :)
26717,A little big boring. i vote neutral. because not very aesthetically pleasing. and the gun mechanics are meh.
26718,play for loot and guns
26719,"Amazing ammount of content, good story, great gameplay. I can't even think of something negative to say about this game, it's just great"
26720,"For those of you who know me, you already know I play this game too much
"

26722,"cool story, intense gameplay and very fun with friends"
26723,very nice game
26724,"Gunplay is fun, story is good, and loot is everywhere. What else is there to ask for?"
26725,eh
26726,i like  borderlands 2 great story better then 3.  3 at first seem fun new guys to do then it starts to feel really grindy
26727,great with friends. krieg is my fav
26728,"I play this more as a social game i have friends that are really into this, visually it's not the best regardless of which graphic card used."
26729,Still fun in 2020.
26730,final boss dropped a bunch of grays 10/10
26731,"If you dont like the new borderlands 3 with his main story and dlcs. BL2 is made for you.

You have a good vilain with his own personality (since blps)

6 characters included dlc characters with their own abilities and passives/actives

DX9 so performance will be a + even on low end pc (unlike DX11 or DX12 lol)

some graphics content you wont see in bl3 and some details to the game

Mods community (BL2 Reborn, Exodus Beta, 2.5, FFYL, etc...)

PC cross platform between Steam and Tencent Malwares store (Epic games store for fortnite fanboies)

And thats it :D

Its way funny with friends !"
26732,cool

26735,ufgu
26736,"Totally got rid of crossplay so if you have a mac and wanna play with friends who have PC, don't waste your time. Spent an hour trying to get it to work before we realized it wasn't even possible lmfao"
26737,"This game is amazing. Not to say it's without flaws, but it's truly incredible and a must-have for major gamers.

Pros:
Great both singleplayer and multiplayer
Wide variety of loot for different playstyles
4-6 playable characters for more game versatility
Nice cel-shaded artstyle
Plenty of amazing DLC for post-game content and loot
Amazing villain (Easily one of my favorites)
Good humor

Cons:
Unskippable cutscenes (The Community Patch fixes this, but that's not actually part of the game)
Known glitches (including: gear falling through floors, speech overlaps, rarity bugs, and more)
The late game. (When you're lvl 80 OP 10, you'll be limited to a lot less gear than in NVHM and even TVHM, though this is debatably not a flaw)
The Online play. It's old and more or less barren when compared to other games.

All in all, the pros absolutely outweigh the cons. You should totally pick this game up if you haven't already.

26748,help
26749,It's probably good if you enjoy the genre. I don't like FPSs and this didn't change that.
26750,I shoot and they go bye bye
26751,"Great game! Everything from the story, to the combat, is great!"
26752,"The humor in this game makes it the best in the series, but my family enjoys playing all of the Borderlands games cooperatively together."
26753,Good
26754,"There's really only one conclusion to be made with Borderlands 2. 
Despite its flaws it really is some of the best co-op gaming you're likely to see in recent years."
26755,Hát szuper!
26756,"This was one of the first games I really got interested in, and I've put almost 600 hours into it since I started playing. There's really something special about the mix of humor and gore in this game that gives it a unique charm. Jack, as the villain, is spectacular, and you'll love to hate him so much that every other villain in the franchise just won't live up to his wit and undeniable charm. I loved the game so much I bought all the other Borderlands games, and all the DLC, and basically left my soul on Pandora. 

If you like shooting things in the face- this is the game for you. If you like being able to customize your character's skills- this is the game for you. If you like to pewpewpew and absolutely wreck big, powerful bosses with an over the top build- this is the game for you. 

Ontop of all that the story is impeccable, the humor is unmatched, and there are characters here that you'll fall in love with all over again every time you play. 

I literally cannot overstate my love for this game."
26757,its gud
26758,"Great Game, Play Borderlands first.  Still a great game also."
26759,Fantastic game
26760,"Guns, glorious guns."

26763,e
26764,"The pinnacle of the borderlands series. Great game play, story, and even the side quests are a blast. If you wanna lose a couple of days in your life to some really great game play, I highly recommend this game."
26765,"Cured my mega-cancer 

"
26766,fun
26767,i love it
26768,"Great game with a lot of funny, memorable characters. Especially fun if you play it in coop mode. Probably the best looter-shooter game ever made. It gave me many many many awesome memories (and few moments of rage :-) ). I never played more than 2 playthroughs with one character, because i generally don't like the item grind that is needed for higher levels, but that's just my personal preference."
26769,GREAT single player mode and now the multiplayer mode has been revamped making the game even more fantastic.
26770,Awesome and fun game. The pretzel's suck tho
26771,It's alright.
26772,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE EVER PLAYED!
26773,"Its an amazing experience for a game, its my favorite game of all time for a reason."
26774,good
26775,best game on the planet if you disagree you are wrong
26776,"[h1] Highly overrated [/h1]
Look, I [b] really [/b] wanted to like this game. I explored every bit of it apart from some of the DLC's, tried reading wiki and listening to Echo logs or whatever they are called but... It just doesn't work out
[h1] Pros [/h1]
+Saying that the range of weapons is wide is an understatement. Each weapon is generated procedurally from basic presets. Damage output and special gimmics depend on weapon's level which means size of your arsenal is nearly infinite
+Artstyle is great. [strike] As far, as I know Gearbox were the first to use 3D graphics with black outlines to create cartoony effect, which would later be often used by Telltale (including Tales from the Borderlands) [/strike] EDIT: [strike] wrong, ""XIII"" did that 6 years before the first Borderlands [/strike] EDIT 2: Actually Jet Set Radio did this all the way in year f*cking 2000
+While not complimenting gameplay at all, soundtrack is also of very high quality
+There is a lot of content to discover. If you ignore all of my upcoming complaints, and judge playability only by how long the game is then go on
[h1] Pros [/h1]
-The plot is high on my list of worst videogame scripts if not on the very top. The statement needs more explanation, but in short, according to the creators entertainment comes from loud noises, senseless explosions and toilet humor..
-... which, to put it lightly, remained consistently mediocre throughout main game and every DLC I played
-Characters are also written sloppily without any depth or development. Their backstories, while sometimes dramatic, ultimately come across as more edgy than touching (with several exceptions)
-Backtracking is a pain in the butt. It's hardly surprising Vault Hunters don't take any fall damage, since their legs must be harder than diamonds from all that walking
-Level design is atrocious, I can't count how many times I couldn't reach my destination because it was on a different floor, or had an entrance hidden in completely different part of the map
-While designing guns, Gearbox definitely put quantity before quality. Majority of them feels like plastic toys you could buy on a street market with some of them even talking (!), which I know is deliberate but only adds to the overall insanity of Borderlands - not in a good way
-EQ relies heavily on RNG. Because I got lucky, I was granted weapons of absolutely OP nature. This is when the game's difficulty dropped to absolute cakewalk. I know that there is something called TVH mode, but this just makes enemies spongier, with no improvements to braindead AI
[h1] I must be missing something... [/h1]
7 years. That is how long I had been waiting before I finally put my filthy hands on this curiosity. I knew my rig was not powerful back then though, so I didn't bother. I don't know if my expectations were elevated too high because of this, but I was left severely disappointed. Every enemy works the same way. Shoot at it until it dies, shoot critical spots and use elemental damage so it dies faster. It would be fine if the game was A) shorter and B) gunplay was better
[h1] Level layout [/h1]
Borderlands 2 length is estimated to be around 100hrs. My experience tells me at least half of that time is sacrificed on walking from one objective to another fighting hordes of low-tier enemies, which no longer pose any challenge but instead are a nuisance. Wouldn't it be better, if the world was more compact and had more setpieces that aren't just copy-pasted bandit camps? There are many areas you perform one task in, but later pass dozen times while travelling. It wouldn't be as bad if there were wehicles in every map, but there aren't. And those that have them are even bigger, filled with 90% empty space. Side note, vehicles handle like a*s. You turn with mouse and there is no option to change that to wsad. Apparently, there was at one point but they broke it in one of the patches and didn't bother to fix it.
[h1] Gunplay [/h1]
When you have so many guns a lot has to be randomised. This means you will be going through dozens of useless guns with idiotic accessories like smg's with x8.7 scope or sniper rifle with 6 shots, firing in 4-bullet burst. Why not allow players to customise their weapons? Also, apart from few presets, guns feel powerless. They don't kick well enough and sound like they are firing peas instead of bullets.
[h1] Story (no spoilers)[/h1]
By this point I am fairly certain that Gearbox developed some sort of hypnosis technology, which they sneaked in the intro or something. Otherwise I don't find any explanation to why the story is so widely praised. All of the characters are either one-dimentional and act like psychopaths, but for all the wrong reasons. Everyone keeps screaming like they had too many candies for their dessert. [b] Especially, [/b] Tiny Tina. Paradoxically the only character I liked was the Handsome Jack, who was written as a heartless maniac and it works out perfectly. Still, it would be better if every other character wasn't sharing these traits with him. Also, why not let the player do something badass instead of thelling them that they are badasses. Game's obssesion with being cool made me wince more times than I could count. It tries to be edgy but in a very politcally correct manner, as if they were to pitch the script to Nickelodeon. Another sin of Borderlands 2 is its humor. Wake up, people, demand from your entertainment! When every joke is just referencing character traits, now prehistoric memes or fecal and sexual innuendos it is just embarassing. You can't create a compelling narrative with just jokes or otherwise no event will have any weight to it. The only time throughout my 73 hrs playthrough I was genuinly content with the writing was a short segment of ""Assault on Dragon Keep"" DLC. But it makes me even more angry, knowing that they knew how to write a better script but chose not to do it. If you have any objections to what I said, please tell me, I am genuinly curious"
26777,"Play this game, it's a perfect waste of your time"
26778,good game. always has been always will be
26779,"Back in the days, me and few of my friends downloaded the cracked version of it just to experience the so called ""Co-Op"".So the next day we all sat in my room with gears equipped(nothing but mouse and keyboard xD) and decided to choose characters.Obviously I went for Zero(I guess you did the same :P) and then we kept playing for days. We were so involved in the game, that we bunked our classes and missed our exams to play the game since we dont have any other coop(i know there are lot of games at that time, but i didnt have them :P). One day one of my friends room mate saw us playing the game and he was like i will aslo join us. Here comes the sad part, that guy who joined us later wanted to match our level, So what he did was he downloaded the cracked profile where you can unlock every chest and unlimited money. So after watching that, who wouldnt want that free money and guns in a game like BORDERLANS2, and then even we started asking to drop the guns for us, So that we can sell them and get money.After that it felt apart, we started loosing intrest on the game X( and left that. But now as i saw the game was on sale,i just go the vibes of it and will start the game again from scratch B) 

I didnt know if i sounded right or wrong xD
[b] FINALLY [/b]
10/10. action packed, with heaps of funny moments with missions and cool things to look at!!"
26780,"Borderlands 2 is a really underrated game. It's one of the best all time looter-shooter games out there. The campaign is amazing, including one of the most memorable video game villains out there. Borderlands has hundreds of different types of guns, getting more with each DLC. The games has 4 main classes, with 2 DLC classes, all having their own skill tree. The skill points you gain when leveling up can be used in the characters skill tree, each skill giving the player a buff to attack speed, damage or reload speed and more. Some skills give you new abilities, attacks or buff your abilities. This is one of the best games i have ever played, with its cartoony art style."
26781,really good game
26782,great game played it with on my ps4 but is sooooo much better on a pc 100/10
26783,Fun game

26785,"One of the greatest games, ever. Well, if you like shooting stuff, humor, comic strip graphics, and...loot. Lots and lots of loot. I know it's all been said before, but hey, I wanted to add my two cents and you can just keep on scrollin' if you don't like it! :P"
26786,This game makes me want to kill claptrap
26787,"[h1]Borderlands 2 preserves the best parts of the franchise while also making numerous, much needed improvements to areas like narrative and class skill design. Additional visual customization options make it even better, and overall this is an excellent shooter no one even remotely curious should overlook. Prepare to level. Prepare to loot. Prepare to get lost in the hilarious, bizarre and wonderful world of Pandora."

26808,"[h1] Borderlands 2 [/h1]

Borderlands 2 game, which was released 5 years after the first game, takes place in the world of Pandora. An army under the control of the crazy villain Handsome Jack took control of the area to exploit the minerals in the mines of the region. Handsome Jack, who tries to digest the local people, is very strong. From loyal murderers to an army of robots and creatures, there is only one sentence he says when declaring his invincibility: ""Come and catch if he's bored"".

In this case, we are engaged. Our characters gathered under the name Vault Hunter seem to be the only power that can stop Jack. Different characters from other games come into play in this game. We have the chance to control 4 characters named Axton, Maya, Salvador and Zero.

You start watching an animation on your first login after installing Borderlands 2. All of the 4 characters you can control in the game are present in the animation and are on the same team. In a raid on a train to catch Handsome Jack, the train blows up and the screen goes dark. After this moment, you have to choose your character. These;

Axton: Our character, who is a commando himself, never takes his support away. What we call support is not a friend and a pet. Turreti, which can be installed very quickly at any time, is a great advantage for him on the battlefield.

Maya: Maya, who is good with guns, does not only use weapons unlike our other 3 characters. At the same time, thanks to his ability to use some kind of magic, he shows that he is a gear for his opponents. Maya, which can create small black holes, becomes very strong in the future.

Salvador: This character, based on firepower, is a class that can use weapons with both hands. Sniper in one hand and rockets in the other hand, Salvador is becoming painful for his opponents.

Zero: Acting as an assassin, he is the most mysterious person among the characters. Thanks to its ability to create illusion, it is perfect for confusing enemies.

When we open our eyes to the game, we open our eyes to a world where Handsome Jack hides Vault Hunter and his dirty work. A small robot guides us through a snow-covered piece of land. Our character starts the story this way. Our first task is to find the stolen eye of our robot by a creature that suddenly appears. After successfully completing this task, a different task and story is waiting for us for each class.
Different abilities are waiting for us as we level up. Each class has 3 skill tree distributions.

In our World of Warcraft style abilities, we can give our points to different branches upon request. The new system also gives us the chance to make different combinations. In this way, we can have different gameplay styles with the same character. For example, with the character of Salvador, you can increase your life and survive for a long time, or you can give weight to your weapons and damage very quickly. How do you determine your style of gameplay, it does not concern us, but there is only one rule in the game that everyone can accept: ""Kill everything that moves"".

Unfortunately, 2K Games firm has left the game lovers face down this time. Although the game is a really cool co-op mode, the deathmatch mode is unfortunately not available. Unfortunately, when you have such a wide range of weapons, fighting only artificial intelligence on these maps has been a pity. Meanwhile, when you say artificial intelligence, your enemies who are developing compared to the other game are still around, saying ""hit me"".

To put it shortly, it seems that Borderlands 2 will make its name for a long time with its gameplay and graphics for FPS lovers. The game, which is by far the first in its lane with its different linear graphics than we are used to, should definitely be in your archive.

For a long time there was no game that got me so attached. Obviously as good as I expected, Borderlands 2 had the features it should have in a good game.

26809,"save system stopped me from playing the game. sometimes i have to log off,"
26810,Cool! Funny! Cartoony style is not for everybody but it actually works well with everything else in the game.
26811,"Great game! Best played with others. If you play by yourself it just becomes tedious and repetitious. I love how you can easily tell how the makers of the game found all the flaws from the first game and improved upon that. You can easily compare weapons and sell them. Better and more challenging skill progress for you character. they also have these badass tokens that you can redeem and further upgrade your character! Overall, very fun to play with friends/family!"
26812,Describe
26813,I love the art gameplay and character's
26814,"I may be late for the party but,

Pros:
I LOVE this game! Playing with friends is fun! The Story is a bit funny, dark, but a little cliche sometimes but it still has it's unpredictability.
I LOVE being a Mechromancer! Your robot can be literally 5x stronger than you
I LOVE the Slot Machines, even though it's scam
I LOVE the soundtracks!

Cons:
One element weapon is OVERPOWERED enough to neglect the other elements... which is unbalanced but understandable.
You become overleveled once finishing a certain quest line which may or may not be fun to others... it's not to me.
Some enemies take a thousand bullets to kill... or maybe my gun is just underpowered.
There are wonky and clanky bugs but it's not game breaking
The controls for driving is confusing for me
The DLC isn't distinguishable enough. I had to search it on the net where to find it.

This game is great! 7/10
Definitely gonna spend atleast a few hundred hours on this (since I have no better thing to do)
"
26815,its pretty good looks just like real life
26816,"Beautiful world and cool characters. I love the car rides, too."
26817,Shiny!
26818,gamer
26819,fun and epic
26820,"Fun, you have to put time in but at the end it is all worth it. You can play online or by yourself you can also play with a LAN party. The more people you have the harder the enemies, but the higher loot chance. Over all this game is fun and there are four (six if you get GOTY version) that you can play."
26821,yes
26822,Apparently I've played this game 129 hours...
26823,Always online no no thank you.

26825,Borderlands 2 is and will remain one of my all time favorite games.  having now bought and played it on every platform it has hundreds of hours of content tons of loot to be found many different play styles to try with it's build diversity.  this game is among the best even with its flaws as perfect as a looter shooter can get.
26826,yes
26827,"It's just the best game ever
"
26828,"Awesome
"
26829,"Incredibly enjoyable and a great experience for gamers in every faction of enjoyment, to shooty shooty, to story, its got what I like in a game. 
Good Stuff"
26830,"Borderlands 2 is the best game in the series and a great one to get started with.

oh and by the way.......Gunporn at its finest!"
26831,its rly good
26832,"One of the best shooters of all time. The story is very gripping and the gameplay is fun and engaging. The amount of DLC for this game will keep you entertained even after you beat the game. The real fun is when you play with friends. That's when the game goes from great to amazing! If you are gonna get the game, I highly recommend you buy the Handsome bundle. Not only does it come with Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequal, but it comes with all the dlc for both games, ensuring you'll have 10's of 100's of hours of fun."
26833,WHAT FUCKING UPDATES TAKE 7 HOURS THATS LIKE A FULL PLAYLIST YOU DIRTY SHIT STUFFING UP YOUR MUMS DIRTY HAIR PUSSY TRAMPS
26834,"Boring-Lands 2 is the definition of a mindless, money-hungry, tediously repetitive shooter. The gunplay feels unsatisfying with no impact, the characters are unlikable with terrible humor and the main story is lost in portrayal. I'd rather go work in the mines and slave myself to death. 

Gearbox Software has made 0 great games."
26835,looter shooter gameplay loop no ludo
26836,"Enjoyable game , campaign is 15 hours. DLC and grinding is forever"
26837,shoot me in the fACE
26838,nice
26839,"Fantastic game, amazing story expanded on everything the first game did and topped it"
26840,"God this game is good. I love the basic game loop and the storys pretty good. Not too serious, but also not trying too hard to be over the top. I just wish i could get my lvl 50 smthn character off my laptop to my new pc, but steam cloud backup cant find my old files and when the game was installed in the d drive the files are different than they were on my c drive of my old comp. If anyones got any help hmu im begging"
26841,MAAAASTAAAPIECEEE
26842,"Likely the most fun I've ever had in a video game. The humor lands nearly every time. The weapon and play-style variety are virtually limitless. Definitely pick up the Game of the Year, because once you complete the main story you will be engrossed in the world and characters.    9.2 / 10"
26843,"A good continuation from borderland 1 where the fun continues. When it comes to gaming experience, it is still of of the best fps looting shooter game. Now compare borderland 2 and borderland 1, the second instalment added better graphic, more variable scenery and maps, and countless of new weapons. 

However, the constant respawn of enemy defeat the purpose of exploring the map , which is what makes borderland 1 fun. The weapon also wont last long as even a good weapon drop will only last for 3 or 4 stages before you will need to find better armoury. The enemy also seems to be able to hit you with precision even if you manage to dodge them. 

6/10 . If you like looting / shooting / grinding for great gears , and exploring places, then you must get Borderland 1."
26844,It's basically Diablo with space guns. So yeah...
26845,"Best example of an offline/Multiplayer/online Shlooter franchise that's not published by a greedy company
+Amazing characters side characters
+Fun characters to play as 
+Loot matters enough 
-Some Worlds are too big that are empty stretched lands 
-Cool skills come way later

"
26846,dope game
26847,Mostly mindless fun
26848,"Gameplay is very fun and engaging, my overall take.

The guns and aiming have some getting used to, maybe for me as it is an older game and I've become accustomed to newer shooters like Apex and COD.

The story is just something to carry you forward, but its nothing to really talk about i guess.

Jumping in this game is annoying, its like floating but that's just something I don't like.

A ""feature""? i don't like in games like this is when you fight through an area to get somewhere and for whatever reason you have to pass through that area again right after, all enemies have respawned. I mean I understand it's the nature of the game but for me it was just annoying, I usually just try to run pass everyone. If there were a little less enemies to fight on the second pass, it might have been less annoying.

Did not end up completing the story, the hours I played was enough and I couldn't do any more."
26849,good
26850,"Very good game, played on both console and PC, great loot system and campaign, good way to blow some time"
26851,The better shooter/looter ever made. Period. End of discussion.
26852,"its is so amazing thats why i have played this game for 7 years

"
26853,"Already played on PS3 and PS4, back at it again on PC. The most surprising thing about it, is that it's an actually funny game. The jokes are primarily hits, and the gameplay is fun as hell. Looting is kind of irritating because you have to play the same bosses over and over and over, to the point that it's just not fun anymore. 
I play solo, but this is definitely a game you'd prefer to play with friends.
Each character has a different playstyle due to their abilities and what they can (or can't) do in terms of self-healing, damage, sustain, etc. Definitely worth a buy. i would personally recommend the DLC, at least mechromancer if you plan to play solo."
26854,"Its F****** Borderlands 2. What else is there to say? Its probably one of the most fun, most replayable games ever made. If you haven't played it yet, you are doing yourself a disservice."
26855,Meh story is good but i hate the low level combat and the later gampley just barely gets better.

26872,"Its perfect, long game with huge replay value"
26873,"[h1] Wow, what a game [/h1]
I know I may not look it from my pc hours but I've played this masterpiece a LOT on other platforms and here is what I can say.
[olist]
[*]The voice acting is spot on and makes the characters come to life
[*]The characters themselves fit perfectly into the chaotic world of Pandora, weather it be a maniac raving about riding a meat bicycle or a mechanic telling her brother to stop setting her customers on fire, it makes the game so rich
[*]The art style is so unique and it makes the entire game interesting to look at, from the backgrounds to the characters everything has some borderlands visual flare.
[*]No spoilers but the story is phenomenal, it builds off of borderlands 1 without necessitating a playthrough of the original, charms you with the previous games npcs and pcs with an addition of some new ones. Handsome Jack is one of the best villians I've ever seen.
[*]The dlc is outstanding, with some being small sections with a boss or two and others being full blown campaigns, the addition of fun new playable characters also gives playing through the game a new spice.
[*] The looting system is great, allowing you to grind a boss for a particular weapon or letting you go with the flow and loot as you play. The variety of weapons is also astounding. Different manufacturers and weapon types let you mix and match to suit your preferences.
[*]The boss fights are so great, each and every one with a unique design or gimmick and potential loot makes it fun to play and fight, especially the incredibly difficult bosses.
[*]The gameplay itself is simply a joy. Each character has 3 skill trees that you can go down and build, each with a particular theme. This allows for so much customization in how you want to play.
[*]The co-op is great, you can group up to 4 people to loot and shoot your way to victory, be it friends or strangers the increased difficulty also comes with increased loot. So party up and arm yourself to the teeth.

26893,"I played borderlands 2 after i played destiny still on the ps3 and i cant think of a way of saying this but, borderlands is so much mor fun, the story and character design is amazing and amuzing im never tired of it, each dlc is like a whole other game with so many things to do, i dont just recommend this, i think everyone should try it it just feels great and with friends its even better."
26894,If you don't enjoy this game you're sad
26895,LOVE THIS GAME
26896,Patch Required :)
26897,"my previous save game was deleted for some reason, then i play again from the beginning. poor gun, hard enemies at the beginning level, what the hell?! and i couldn't even shoot the enemies while there is invisible wall blocked all my bullets..

idk its getting boring, i can't even stand it..."
26898,Отличный шутер в стиле RPG. Обсидианы молодцы и сделали прекрассную игру.
26899,"My first time playing this game on xbox 360 was not really fun, I ended up dropping the game after like 15 hours even though I forced myself to play it. Now that I have played it on PC with friends I still didn't enjoy it, even though I have played Destiny and actually somewhat enjoyed that game, this game just felt tedious, the comedy to me came of as just unfunny teen edgy humor and the story was so boring that the only thing I had fun with was hearing my friends making jokes about the characters, but not the characters themselves. 

Characters where very uninteresting especially since I felt that the developers where just trying to make the characters look badass, instead of trying to write a good character. The soundtrack was also very forgettable. The combat was a little fun at first, trying to unlock abilities and guns and fighting the different types of enemies, but it became very repetitive fast, since the game turned out to be very similar to Destiny with the whole slowly seeing your gun damage increase and the guns changing their shooting effects slightly. AI either just kinda stands there waiting for you to shoot them, they charge after you in a straight line or they slowly move a little bit from side to side which is also very similar to Destiny, the game only gets more difficult since the AI starts to use aimbots and their guns have increased damage the more you progress.

If you like looter shooter than you might like it but if you don't care about the looter shooter genre, you don't care about good story and characters than I would recommend Doom instead."
26900,i like this product 999%
26901,"Wait, what? Where am I? Has it been this long already?"
26902,its awesome!!!
26903,this game is really cool i play it with my friends all the time and they think i am cool for playing this so play it and you'll be cool too
26904,Favourite in the series!
26905,a masterpiece. thats it.
26906,The best Borderlands game and the only game I quote daily. 9.5/10
26907,"After all the time the game has been out I'd like to believe that everyone who is a ""gamer"" has atleast heard of the Borderlands series in some form. I will say that while this game is not for everyone I still believe it to be one of the greatest fpsrpg (or whatever you'd call it) games ever made to date. While Borderlands 3 has better and more fun gameplay, Borderlands 2 has more unique characters, better story, better acting and more fun and unique weapons and items making for a much more fun and diverse game compared to Borderlands 3. I won't say one game is better than the other, i will say they each have things they do better than the other. After everything i've said here i'd like to say that I would 100% recommend this game to anyone interested in games about shooting and looting or if you just want something kinda casual to pass the time. Borderlands 2 is a master piece and I have been playing it for a long time, i've even gifted the game like 10 times to people so I could play it with them.

All around a solid 8/10, the only improvement that could be made would be fine tuning the movement and fixing some bugs but outside of that the game is incredible!"
26908,yay

Overall worth it for handsome Jack alone."
26916,Very replayable
26917,graphics are like cartoons and the atmosphere is nice you can try it
26918,"Yes, I would defenetly recommend this game to others,
It's a great game, with an amazing and long storyline. Everything is great except for one thing:
The Co-Op update that lets you play the singleplayer with your friends, with crossplay, doesn't work.
I thus can't play with my friends, even tho I payed for the game, and they didn't, because they have the newer and better windows version But it's a free one from Epic Games, which means they can't play together with me, and they can play with each other.
Fix this, PLEASE! (It's not free anymore on epic).

26950,"When a game is almost 8 years old, usually you have to take the graphics/gameplay/etc. with a grain of salt. BL2, however, is still a masterpiece. It is easily one of the first games my friends and I boot up for co-op. The humor hits you in the right places, the environments still create the immersion, and the absurdity in the game seems to draw you in even more. This game still ranks among one of my absolute favorites. Tiny Tina and Mr. Torgue are easily some of my favorite NPCs, where I've found myself actually laughing out loud at some of their comments or antics. If you haven't picked this game up already, make sure to do so"

26958,one of the best games of all time defintly get the best in the series
26959,"I really can't stand the story, dialogue, humor, and or any other part of this game. It is like it was made for teen aged boys by teen aged boys. I find the characters super annoying to the point that I cannot play the game any further. Only buy this game if you appreciate superficial one liners and silly catch phrases. I would avoid this game series like the plague. Not worth playing even for free."
26960,"Whats not to like, this game has a ton of content and is really fun to play especially with friends"
26961,Awesome Classic Game Plenty of offline content
26962,What can I say? I just simply love this game. Get some buddies and its a blast. I'm still playing in 2020
26963,"This game is amazing. All of the characters are likable and charismatic. Especially Handsome Jack. He is fucking hilarious. The story is a blast to play through co-op, and although the game can start off knacky, and the enemies can be tricky to deal with, learning the ropes with a couple friends is one of the best ways to spend the first 10 hours of play. I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you aren't that much of an RPG guy like me. There is something in this game for everybody. Absolutely worth the $20, but plus 50 swag points if you buy it on sale for $5.

+extra fun because when you visit previous areas you feel like a god because you rip ass even when you are one level higher than the enemies"
26964,"Randy Pitchford and other company stuff aside, this is a great game, especially with it's DLCs. The best part is you can find the regular game and the GOTY version with all of the DLC REALLY REALLY cheap quite often (less than $10), so this is pretty much a no-brainer."

26993,"Borderlands 2: What if the weathergirls but NRA
Intro:

Gearbox Software’s reputation in gaming circles is...mixed to say the least.  Even after the chaos that was Aliens: Colonial Marines, the publisher has been involved in controversy and bad releases ever since.  The less said about Randy Pitchford the better.  But Borderlands 2 is something of an exception rather than the rule.  It was well received and sold over 22 million copies at the time of release.  Truth be told, at least for me it’s a perfectly fine game.  Nothing particularly mind-blowing but not particularly bad either.  I had fun with it while it lasted. 

Story:

Six Vault Hunters are betrayed by corporate overlord and tyrannical ***hole Handsome Jack, when he discovers a Vault (larger than the previous one) hidden away on Pandora.  This soon turns into a race against time as the Vault Hunters try to reach the Vault before Handsome Jack get there.  Along the way the Hunters free Pandora from Jack’s rule while doing odd jobs.  The story is light and extremely quirky. 

Sacred 3 and Book of Demons seem to show a reoccurring trend in comedy games.  There needs to be term for this so I am going to call it “The Falstaff cast”.  A Falstaff cast is defined a cast completely made up of comic relief.  When everyone is goofy all the time it sucks all the tension out of the story.  As a result the player stops being engaged and just more or less ignores everything.  If the characters do not care about the plot, then why on earth should the player?  You could have the best plotted story out there, but if everyone is quipping or lightheartedly bantering with each other, players will stop caring.

Unlike a number of other games set in Sci-Fi or fantasy worlds, Borderlands 2 has a gives you access to a single ability.  At first I was very disappointed by this, as I was used to having entire keyboards worth of abilities to play with.  However, (I played as a Siren) I was impressed by the versatility of that single skill (phaselock).  Depending on how you mod it, you can either turn that single skill into an instant death button or a party wide heal.  The latter encourages cooperation between teammates as heal only actives once the target dies.  So with some simple communication you can survive even the toughest of encounters."
26994,"Pretty cool, although I dunno if I'd bother without the coop."
26995,"Multiplayer doesn't work as of march 10 patch pls fix between pc and mac users, otherwise great game. but if u are on mac do not buy this game until or if they fix this."
26996,"[h1] Introduction [/h1]
Borderlands 2 is a co-op shoot 'n' loot game which allows up to four players to come together in one session at a time and progress through levels, quests and enemies. It's a beautifully made game, having an art style different to most shooters which really makes it stand out and give it's own flavour which is very refreshing. To truly get the most from this game, simply bring a few friends along and go through it together and it'll give you a great laugh.

[h1] Why should I buy it? [/h1]
The only question you need to ask yourself is if you like shooters. In this genre, Borderlands is a defining game and no other game can provide a similar experience. The look, the feel, the different systems, it's Borderlands. They've kept this style and experience the same throughout the Borderlands series which is honestly such a nice feeling to be able to come into the next game and think ""It's great to be back, let's do this again!"". This is especially true if you go through each game with the same set of friends. There are also four different classes with great customisation options and skill trees which are exciting and it's great when you've got a session where each player is a different class. Borderlands offers so much content for such a small price when it's on a sale and I can't stress enough how much of a required game this is if you enjoy shooters. If you're typically into competitive games, it will be a nice relaxing break to play alongside your competitive shooter and if you're typically into these laid-back shooters where you go through at your own pace and progress as you're ready then you'll fit right in.

[h1] Notes [/h1]
This game will take a lot of your time and this is brilliant!
There is so much different loot which you can collect from each boss.
Oh, and your friends will hate you for taking all the good loot I just mentioned!

TL;DR - It's Borderlands, just buy it... and hopefully as Marcus says, NO REFUNDS!"
26997,Is good
26998,It's pretty good. Best of the Borderlands series. I have this game on every platform that I own and for a reason. This is kinda the only grind type game where I don't feel like I am grinding loot.
26999,Best looter shooer ever no further comment needed
27000,"Really good. The writing makes it though, genuinely funny."
27001,Good game
27002,"Graphics Quality, amusing storylines, hilarious psychobandits.... and the satisfaction of shooting someone in the face."
27003,I played it before and bought and play it again
27004,Handsome Jack more like ugly jack
27005,yes
27006,great game what else can I say :D
27007,"just not fun.
dont see the point.
cringiest humor ever.
ugliest art style ive ever seen."
27008,good
27009,My first experience were on ps3 and been spending hours of gameplay and grinding. love this game to much unfortunately i sold my console and switched to PC gaming now and had a chance to play this game again so i bought it in 2020 June Sale & No Regrets !! Hours of gameplay and lots of story + DLC Mission to do.
27010,This game is most likely the best game I have ever played. I have been playing this for over 3 years now and there is still so much to do. I recommend Borderlands 2 to everybody even if you don't really like FPS games. It's cheap now as well so grab it while you can :)
27011,"Best played with friends, cool gameplay and graphics"
27012,Is good
27013,a
27014,Love the Characters and I just have a lot of fun playing this game.
27015,"kanye west he likes




fingers in his ass"
27016,BOOM BOOM!!!!
27017,Over 250 plus hours and I haven't even finished maxing out my first character. Can't even fathom how much time it will take me to max out the other characters but I'm really looking forward to it. Really fun gameplay with a good story and a well written villain who always manages to make you hate him no matter how many times you play through the story. The endgame content is also really good and never gets boring.
27018,hi
27019,Really nice game. Love the characters
27020,"I played this on ps4 and it was so much fun. beat the games multiple times, beat all the dlc's a lot, so much fun I mained zer0 and it just so much fun, it was made somewhere in the early 2010's but it's still pretty popular, great story, awesome characters, but what are you doing? play the game fam"
27021,"One of those classics that everyone that plays games should have at least played through in it's entirety once. The amount of times it's gone on sale or even free, just get it and play it. A masterpiece."
27022,it's pretty good
27023,"if you hate this game, you cant be my friend >:("
27024,gud
27025,i love it
27026,"I would rather farm BNK3R looking for a perfect 94% Sham for 20 hours than suffer through the Borderlands 3 story a second time. Borderlands 3 proved that story and characters are important, and shirking those aspects of a game for a few QOL improvements is ultimately a downgrade. Play BL2 instead, you'll enjoy it more.

P.S. Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is the greatest game DLC ever made"
27027,"Amazing game. Unlimited amount of content
"
27028,it's alright
27029,fun time
27030,no.
27031,Awesome game. Best DLC is Tiny Tina.
27032,"Decent story, but i came for the gameplay."
27033,"Lots of options for guns and not too difficult most of the time.  Bosses get pretty tough, you might need a friend to help you out.  Great looking and suspenseful.  Vehicles ride very well."
27034,"A fun experience from start to finish regardless of playing it solo or multiplayer, definitely worth a try."
27035,"Call your friends who never played this ""handsom jack"" garentee they will think your complementing them when in reality... MWAHAHAHHAAA

pros-

rpgfps with lots of guns to pick from
lots and lots of more guns to pick from
core game is made for multiplayer! invite a friend and then slap them in the face when they say NO!
comedy
claptrap

cons-
for those who love iron sights good luck finding any
claptrap..."
27036,This is easily the best game I have ever played. It is so well made and has so much to offer. I absolutely recommend this game.
27037,"Played this game since 2013-2014 and it is still one of my all time favourites. I  recommend it to everyone who wants a fun and relaxing adventure. If you can spend some additional money on the game you should definetely buy the GOTY, because the dlcs are just as good as the base game."
27038,good
27039,"If you haven't played the best loot shooter released yet, what are you even doing with your life...?"
27040,Highly recommended if you're looking for an FPS game with some RPG elements to it.
27041,"Apparently people are now randomly giving awards for one-line meme posts or other troll reviews in every popular game for absolutely no reason, so I'll just post this sentence as well that makes no sense but follows the same logic, along with the usual honest Yes/No that doesn't really explain much but apparently is currently much more worth the time than writing an actual nuanced review that would actually be helpful to others."
27042, This Game Amazing
27043,fun it goo gme 100% goty forver
27044,psycho go boom boom
27045,This game is a masterpiece. It's well worth the money spent and i highly recommend buying the game.
27046,"a once in a lifetime experience, guns, guts, glory and loot abound on pandora the most violent place in the universe."
27047,"Oh boy. Borderlands 2. I love this game so much. It's a classic and a great choice for experienced and newbie shooters. The story, if somehow you haven't played this game yet, is simply quite amazing. The playeer's relationship with Jack near the end is really memorable, and is done in a spectacular way. Shooting is satisfying, and of course, many, many, MANY guns are available. The artstyle is admittedly outdated, but still wonderful. I love this game, and you probably will too.

P.s bl2 is better than bl3"
27048,This is my favorite game.
27049,"30 hours and I'm still not close to completing the game, before playing on PC i was on PS3, most of my childhood was on this game with my friends. this might just be nostalgia but this has been one of my favorite games for so long, i hope whomever gets this game has as good of a time as me."
27050,"This game is...








































...AWESOME"
27051,fuk of
27052,"Awesome game to play with friends, especially now that it's cheap because of BL3. Easily worth it's price tag nowadays."
27053,..
27054,yes yes yes
27055,dank
27056,"Русская версия игры не обновлена до последней версии, из-за чего невозможно играть с друзьями у которых игра в Epic. Зачем было делать отдельную версию, если они не собирались её поддерживать?

Russian version of the game isn't updated to the latest version, making it impossible to play with friends who own the game on Epic. Why did they make a separate version if they weren't going to support it?"
27057,fun
27058,Gud.
27059,good game
27060,"Very nice singleplayer/co-op expirience. 
Would recomend.
Has good replay value."
27061,So funny and crazy.
27062,pretty good but framerate is bad on a 3.0 core 2 dou :(
27063,"A class based loot shooter with tons of content and ways to engage your enemies. Borderlands biggest strength is its variety in weapons, almost every weapon you find(and there are a lot of them) is unique and functions a bit different. From rocketlaunchers that function as grenades if you emptied your magazine to semi automatic pistols that somehow get more accurate the faster you fire them, the weapons in this game are creative and fun to use against an equally rounded roster of enemy types. Classes have their own gimmicks but that is only there as support for the shooting and looting.

A fun game, sadly a bit dated, the cel shading didn't age well in my opinion and there are times you have to back track long distances with a sprint that is barely faster than your average running speed. The story is... well it's there, you have to decide yourself if you like super goofy characters doing goofy things and then becoming serious all of the sudden is for your taste. At least Jack is entertaining as villain, even if he isn't as threatening as the game tries to sell him to you. Still, the story is not as bad as some people like to make it and some of the side stuff can be quite funny.

I recommend it nevertheless, it also goes on sale very often and for like 10 bucks you get your moneys worth."
27064,great
27065,Easily my favorite game to date.  So fun to re play and try new characters or different builds!!!
27066,I love the whole franchise.  They can be played over and over..without getting bored!
27067,play it now
27068,"[h1]♥♥♥ The Gothesis ♥♥♥[/h1]
W-T-F-O-M-G I absolutely love this game and been playing it from day 1. Even with BL3 out, I still come back to this, it's just that good, it ages so well and even after all this time, it still feels fresh and new. I adore the Devs still adding content to this, please o please, keep it up!

27072,"This game has beautiful environments,great soundtrack,good story,large variety of enemies to fight,a memorable cast of characters,a ton of randomly generated loot and very high replaybility....but that's just the cherry on top.At its core Borderlands is a very solid shooter,the guns feel and sound powerful,the animations,ragdolls,particle and explosion effects are very well done which makes shooting a lot of fun.By combining this with RPG skills you get a very fun and unique experience which no other game on the market can provide."
27073,Awesome Game!

27080,Amazingly lighthearted fun.
27081,"BL2 still the best one so far, they should have stopped on working on the following part. A new IP would have been a better idea at this point. Humour, Story & Gameplay is in a perfect state."
27082,10/10
27083,"very unique and stylish game, the whole series is just amazing, would recommend any borderlands to anyone"
27084,yes
27085,It's cool
27086,"If you're looking through reviews to see if you should buy this game, this is your sign, buy it. Classic phenomenal looter shooter with hours of fun and tom foolery. If you've got friends, bring them along. If you don't, hit up the borderlands discord and make some new friends and then play the heck out of this game. Single player's fine, too. But there's nothing like laughing your ass off with some new people."

27095,"Hands down one of the greatest game I've ever played. The story is great and the characters are all amazing to play with unique playstyles. The loot system is fantastic with Legendaries, Seraph, and Pearlescent to farm."
27096,"Borderlands is a very good game, the first is so cool but when I played at second Borderlands for the first time, I realized that it was one of the best game!

The story is very good and sometimes it's funny, hardcore, difficult, cool ....

She start with a robot, named ClapTrap, he need help for a lot of things, and he will follow you everywhere, it's like Lester in GTA V xD. As things progress you will meet new characters who will also ask you to solve quests vs rewards. In addition to the quests, Borderlands have a inventory system, when you finish the quests, you could find chests containing : armor, shield, weapon. And after find them you could be equip them to your character.

I really recommend this game to the people who want to play solo or with friend, because yes! This game is not only in solo, you can play with a friend in duo, and it's more fun !!

Now i have to play at the third borderlands...

Thanks guys to reading this evaluation, have a good day !"
27097,very good game
27098,One of the best games of all time
27099,Make crap go bang! Wonderful game to jump back into when you get burnt out on the new stuff.
27100,"Borderlands 2 is the first game of The Borderlands Series that I bought. At first I was like ""What's with those cartoon-like character design?"". The story is interesting, with clear plot and objective marker on map that you won't miss the lose your way to proceed further.
The game is well-optimized that my 2012 computer could run this butter smooth back then, so PC gamer nowadays shouldn't find hard time in playing this game. Although some minor bugs still exists, but it don't ruin the game itself.

A little discretion for non-English speakers :
This game consists of tons of jokes, jargon, etc. in English that you might find subtitles helpful for you"
27101,The best of the best. it very worth to buy it
27102,it's an uwu game to play with friends
27103,"Borderlands 2 is a game that made me laugh and also drowned me in guns. So many guns. Gameplay is great, the DLC additions are nice (aside from the seemingly thousands of costumes I've never used), and the quests are fun. A nice, entertaining open-world game to relax with, a rarity in the corona times."
27104,This game is fun and i like to play with my dad and if you guys can get it i think you should.
27105,One of my all time favorite games. Had it since it came out on xbox 360 and I got it again on pc. 9/10 would play forever.
27106,good run and gun
27107,VERY ADDICTING :)
27108,bomb ass game yup
27109,cool
27110,this shouldve been borderlands 3
27111,I played Borderlands but this was too frustrating for me.
27112,"i really dont know how this game is popular 

the story is nothing above mediocre i dont know if its just because i played solo but it was hardly enjoyable 
the gunplay is bad  and the crosshair  is pure crap 

and i know the games whole thing is that it has loads of guns but dont expect to be using them long because as your ranks go up most weapons become obsolete fast. not like weapons matter once when your pumping your ammo into 50ft bullet sponges of a boss where your real problem is not trying not to die because its very easy to camp in the corner and become immune to most attacks  but wondering if you will have enough ammo left. most of my deaths didint come from actually being bad at the game but it came from either running out of ammo and having to purpously die so i could make the long walk back and refill my  ammo at an overpriced vending machine where you sell your obsolete guns for literal pocket change for a chance of being able to buy a small amount of ammo or the game crashing and having to also reload the save in short you will die alot when it really isint your fault 

the fancy shell shaded graphics are nothing special they dont look nearly as nice as theyre all made out to be and really it adds absolutly nothing to the game 

this game is choc full of sidequests that are repoetitve its mainly just 'go here and get me this or go here and kill this' just with different names on them. also good luck trying to beat the game without grinding them out or your going to get shot by god knows what into next week  

the charachters i must admit are quite good, handsome jack is quite annoying untill endgame where you can slowly hear him breakdown and grow fearful of you before that it just relies on potty humour

in short this game is a grindy mediocre written game with bad gunplay, if people say that this game is the best in the series i dread playing the pre sequel wich i also stupidly got on another platform please dont get this game and if you want to play an actually good shooter try doom2016 or eternal 

3.7 out of ten

"
27113,great game!
27114,It's Diablo with guns. It's pretty rad.
27115,Best in the series! Get the bundle for all DLCs and all 4 games!
27116,"Great shooter with a few little aspects.
Comic shooters like Borderlands have been doing great in the past years. Especially with their new added DLCs that you can also get in the GOTY edition (at least most of them). However the gameplay is quite good and amazing, sometimes even too extreme. But the game engine unfortunately struggles a lot with its own configuration for your system though. The graphics also have been improving since the first title of this series came out. It looks great, sharp and gives it a pretty great comic look. However you may get lots of framedrops while more and more effects have to render at the same time. However in my case it's also fun and playable at 30 fps with vsync enabled (as we call it the ""console"" feeling) which will avoid the framedropping during the gameplay. But the effects and explosions are also quite amazing to see. 
The economy is not really for everybody. In my case it gets harder and harder to level up more which gets pretty annoying for some time. Mostly it's not even worth the afford to kill enemies as you'll just get 1 xp per enemy unfortunately.
Otherwise this game is great with its DLCs, even in 2021. I've been spending lots of time to play this game with some friends and have to admit that it's quite amazing to play this game with multiple players. 

Recommended!"
27117,Big PP game
27118,"Borderlands 2 is a VERY special game. 

Imagine this:

- A Looter Shooter
- An Open world
- A Slick FPS
- Theme Park-like areas
- More guns than you can fathom
- Funnies
- A Skill Tree worthy of playing the same character twice
- Great Optimization
- and so much more

That would be a really cool game. But for now, Borderlands 2 is alright!"
27119,good game.
27120,"Game is really well made. I recommend watching some videos to see where are hidden boxes and stuff. Quests/story are good enough, gameplay is really good (There are different characters try playing all of them so u get idea what fits you). Overall I would rate game 7/10. I had good time playing."

Great game. I had it on my wish list for so long and the comics-like graphics was really preventing me from trying it, but once you start playing it's really not that visible."
27147,YES
27148,this game is great 10/10

27151,"A good Game to play toggether, a Great villain, Moments to laught and a after all great Story line to follow, including smoll as also big DLCs to continu playing it. Also trying out each Vault hunter gives some more time to play it and search and finde the Weapons you love and like."
27152,"a classic of the 7th generation consoles for sure, a pretty good FPS RPG."
27153,"This is definitely the best game in the series! It has amazing voice acting, funny lines, lots of stuff to do, and the soundtrack is alright. I got almost all the DLC on sale at a very low price, too. It's a bit grindy, but I don't regret the hours I've put into it. 8/10 I had a great time playing on my own and with friends"

27194,This is probably the best Borderlands game.
27195,"The characters, storyline, side quests, DLCs are all very engaging and makes playthroughs more fun than they should be. The farming for loot is also designed so that you always feel like the next item is going to be awesome - there are plenty of things, bosses, items, areas to farm. The community also helps make this game a resounding success. Kudos on the upgrade on the graphics too!"
27196,One of the greatest games I have ever played
27197,Grinding game with too many items
27198,"Despite being an eight year old game, Borderlands 2 is still an incredible looter shooter and co op experience. Cannot wait to play the third game later in the summer."
27199,Buy it
27200,"Could spend hours for the first time playing but then get bored of the repetitive gameplay.
Playing with friend -> fight for loot xd pretty fun though
8/10 for me"
27201,"ITS SO DARN FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i've never played or watched any borderlands gameplay, and it gave me all of the backstory!
the graphics are good and everything!

10/10 will definatly play again
worth your money, especily when your reading this during the summer sale!"
27202,"One of the best game to play with friends, if you have any. You can have a great time until you go for the invincibles."
27203,Better than borderlands 3...
27204,best game ever!!
27205,"great classic game, even runs on linux.
"
27206,"for those who already played Borderlands 1 I highly recommend this one, the graphics got a little more life which makes the game more alive besides an experience in online matchmaking really the game was better than expected and of course an awesome experience in story line terms. and then you’ll have to try 3, it’s also a very good game
"
27207,"Hilarious, fun, and timeless. Still looks good after all these year due to the art style.

Also, a random white-grade trash mob gun that's dropped in this game has more personality than most games. And it's always the best personality, like the girl that you dated but got away. Come back Emma. I miss you."
27208,literally one of my favourite games of all time i went from xbox 360 to xbox one to right here on pc its been a good 8 year journey and if you want to play the most influential looter shooter of all time then play borderlands 2. 10/10 yes i am incredibly bias.
27209,good
27210,"By far the best game from the franchise, and if you can get behind the minor bugs and the moments of repetition, than you have a 10/10 game. By repetition, I mean running through the same area potentially a dozen times, the same item retrieval quest over and over, and the main characters voice acting, where you will probably hear the same jumping noise about a thousand times. The gunplay some of the best I have ever seen, the story is great and the characters are hilarious.

Easy 10/10"
27211,Hell yea
27212,I love this game. It is my favorite game of all time.
27213,"Most of the DLC is mediocre but the game as a whole is fun as shit even when playing super casually and not going for legendaries. The golden chest is a little OP though if you have a good amount of keys. 9/10, top five FPS of the decade."
27214,I spent 45% of my playtrought looking at Moxxi's boobs 10/10
27215,good game
27216,"Awesome continuation of the Borderlands story with many improvements and new gameplay elements. My only complaint is the enemies. Some areas have way too many enemies and fighting them becomes more of a chore than a challenge. Also, whenever you’re fighting Hyperion, the game just keeps throwing loaders at you and it gets stale very quickly. Other than that, Borderlands 2 is a super fun, hilarious experience and I absolutely recommend it."
27217,Borderlands 2 is a game that you will never get tired off
27218,Masterpiece
27219,Master piece. One of my favorite games

27221,I didn't have a great experience with this game. The shooting is well done the loot is nice but the grind just sucks all the fun out of everything. Because in this game grinding is a big part of progressing and if you're not at the missions level or above it you're going to get one shot by everything and it's not going to be a great time. So you go farm for exp but nothing gives you substantial exp to level up so you're just spending hours to level up so you can just progress the story. It just burns you out after a while man. This game's pretty fun with friends but I just can't recommend it.
27222,prty spice. claptrap was lel
27223,JUST EPIC
27224,"buy it, it's 5$ rn"
27225,"It's a good game, no doubts about that. Great and hillarious story with excellent writing. Fun environments and much more. I do however have a lot of issues with it. The level design is absolute trash. Sure they look cool and are mostly functional but that 1/10 time that the level doesn't work, it really doesn't work. Some levels are too drawn out or repeated too many times and other levels have shit maps that make it very hard to find anything, most often due to the elevation of the levels. 
This game is definitely best experienced with friend or a crew but the multiplayer is very bad. Not Nintendo levels of bad but there is frequent disconnecting, problems connecting to friends or other issues within the game. 

If I could I would probably take a neutral standpoint to this game but since that's not the case I'm leaning a bit more towards recommendning it. The devs are passionate and have made a good, fun and exciting game that is weighed down by many issues."
27226,"The game is good, story is also good, and also oversized boobs"
27227,I believe this game was based on the real event that happened during the end of 2020
27228,pre sequel was better tbh
27229,Funny with friends <3
27230,poggies!
27231,nice game for co-op
27232,It's aight.
27233,"Saatlerce oynıyabileceğiniz bir oyun, ilerledikçe zorlaşıyor fakat geçmek için daha çok hırslanıp oyundan çıkamayacaksınız silahlar ve onların özellikleri ile mükemmel bir oyun almanızı tavsiye ederim."
27234,"this game is absolutely incredible, the whole concept of this game is perfect, the characters are brilliant and engaging, the PvE is satisfying which makes you want to level up more and more and you just get lost in the world of Borderlands 

i only have one problem tho 



cant run it lol
"
27235,Excellent game. Would recommend playing.
27236,".

"
27237,its really fun
27238,"You could play this game for Tiny Tina alone..
Best character in a video game :') crazy child..
Moxxi hot too.. Claptrap is stupid, everyone hates him..
Yeah you'll fit right in, go try it! 10/10 experience."
27239,good game
27240,Yeah it's alright I guess
27241,"Fun game, bosses are funny and so is Claptrap
"
27242,w
27243,COOL
27244,If  you want a good long game with lots of quests to do. This is your game to play. Easy to start on but if you are looking for a good story play through start with the first game then move to the second.
27245,Very good game
27246,THAT'S AWSOME
27247,Good game with friends :)
27248,"too many variants of similar guns, but oh well, it is enjoyable af"
27249,tits
27250,I like FPS Games
27251,I love this game
27252,Amazing game for those who love guns guns guns guns!
27253,gud gam
27254,"Ridiculous how they try to charge for a dlc that was free so I cannot play with friends because this should at least come with the handsome jack collection 
"
27255,"
good"
27256,"Before Gearbox jumped the shark, some of their series were alright."
27257,"Awesome Game lots of fun especially with friends, handsome jack is the best video game enemy ive ever seen game wouldnt be the same without him. 10/10"
27258,"One of the best games to play with friends, even after when you're done the game!"
27259,its a classic.
27260,Heavy game
27261,"Best game in the series, cant recommend enough"
27262,BEST GAME!!!
27263,"fun, good story"
27264,i mean. its borderlands 2. at this point who doesn't know this game is amazing. play it.
27265,Very good
27266,"I bought the game out of Curiosity last summer, thought it was a post apocalyptic fallout-like game. Didn't know anything about the Borderlands series at that point.
Turned out to be a very fun Shooter with Rpg elements and allot of loot, but not at all tiresome like other games of this type. Works like a charm under Windows and Linux/Steam OS, very well optimized.
Haven't tried the DLCs yet but finished the base game and it is a solid experience.
Some people may not like the Dark and over the Top Humor in this Game.
The Graphics have a distinct style and are very nice to look at especially when maxed out.
All in all would recommend if you are searching for a fun game which you can play more than once."
27267,justslushy
27268,i like the part where you shoot things
27269,good game
27270,Great game and still worth playing in 2020.
27271,Classic.
27272,Undisputedly best fps game ever...
27273,"really fun experience if you play it with your friends.
overall average story but has interesting weapons and great humor."
27274,EPIC !!
27275,This was an amazing game but i lost all of my porgress
27276, good game
27277,it gud
27278,Great game for anyone looking for a looter-shooter! Story keeps you on your toes and interested!
27279,It was on great and crazy game to play!!!!!!!
27280,Awesome game when playing with friends. It doesn't take itself too seriously which makes fun. Can't get enough!
27281,When you get it for basically free it's an amazing game. Other than that thought it's alright.
27282,It's aight.
27283,this game has nothing bad about it. other than cutscenes.
27284,E
27285,"Well, it only took me four years after playing TFTBL to get around to it, but I'm finally here. Looters and shooters are not typically my thing, but this game has so much personality and life to it that I couldn't stop playing. It's colourful, it's funny, it's easy to get the hang of, and it's fun! And I played it years and years after everyone else did, so I bet it's even better with friends!"
27286,"Best game
"
27287,good.game.
27288,very good
27289,I have this game on PS4 Xbox 360 and PS3 From Release and all I have to say is this the game is quite different from any you'll ever play this game is The Beginning of the Genre loot Shooters And Sadly it seems people forgot how to even make these games correctly anymore cause the progression on this game is perfect cause there's always something to do in the end game and after all of it there is still more end game then What I had from Destiny Year 1-5 and its sad to think that this game came out almost a decade ago now. This Game is Perfect for someone who likes the Grind and likes Big Number Damage If you can get that done you can get through the game with ease. This game isn't Hard But the game isn't truly easy either mastering this game took me since Release. I suggest this game to all my friends and I think you should too. also PS When I was 13 I bought Borderlands 2 Exactly 12 Times Cause of me losing it and more this game is my childhood.( The game at the time of me getting it from Gamestop was $4.35) It took me also Another 2 years To get the season pass for all he DLC
27290,It's solid that's all I can say.
27291,I'M GUNNA MAKE YOU MY NEW MEAT BICYCLE!
27292,man iz a gud GaMm
27293,"Would recommend to play this game with your friends instead of alone, its 100% better.
Its just fun, the humor is on point, just a blast."
27294,loot and shoot yes
27295,Gun goes pow pow haha
27296,An absolute masterpiece.
27297,"Good game, good replay value"
27298,"Great game for grinding and decent game just for story. The story is fine and no DLC are needed to enjoy it. The grinding part is really fun and enjoyable, DLCs add many things and I would suggest that every grinder should buy them, my own suggestions are ""Headhunter 3: Mercenary Day"" and ""Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty"" If you want more challange from the game, Ultimate Vault Hunter Packs will increase difficulty and level capacity of your characters. The DLC that I would not buy is ""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep"" and that's because the final boss of the DLC has the same drop pool as the regular final boss, but is slightly easier to kill."
27299,better than borderlans 3 tbh
27300,Bl2 is life.
27301,no good
27302,great game
27303,"love the series
great fucking games"
27304,"This is the perfect FPS game for me. Quirky, fun, has a rich story and gameplay is actually engaging rather than just click and shoot. This game has nailed the both artistic part and the technical part of what a game should be like."
27305,Is game. Play.
27306,"I've played this game on and off for awhile now.  Just picked it back up and I really forgot how fun it is.  Small amounts of strategy depending on the character you pick, and fun gun fights.  The dialogue is pretty funny as well."
27307,borderlands 2 is a amazing game with endless hours of very good story with some jokes refrences to other things.its a very fun game if your on the fence about getting it you should for sure get it
27308,yems good time
27309,"Definitely not buy this game, it freezes alot, causing you to manually shut down your system. And no matter what you do, its unfixable."
27310,"enjoyable game, with a good story and good gameplay, would recommend, thou I did play it alone.

5/5"
27311,an all time classic
27312,Amazing!
27313,"This games is very fun and suggest people should give it a try 

Ps - installing mods and the community patch (speeds up the game a little bit) makes the game even better
"
27314,Love the Game!
27315,good game
27316,Happy play!
27317,An incredible solid pickup especially when it's on sale. I've played through the game numerous times and the game still has ongoing modded support :)
27318,"Very good, worth the price, but wait for a big handsome collection sale anyways to get like 15 bangs for your buck"
27319,this ia an amazing game !!!!!!!!!
27320,This is a Certified Hood Classic

27338,good
27339,"Borderlands 2 is a fun and extremely addicting game to play which still holds up after eight years. Once you beat the game including the expansions, there is no reason to go back and play this again. The game will bore you and feel monotonous. Playing with a friend will be fun but if you're playing after ending the entire game, you'll get bored with it quickly. Meaning the game has very less replay value. The technical issues I noticed while playing were lack of DualShock 4 controller support, textures would load at a very poor quality, despite downloading the HD texture pack and the Steam/Epic Games crossplay only works sometimes.

If you want purchase the Borderlands 2, buy The Handsome Collection otherwise you won't get the full experience of the game and make sure you buy it during a sale or you'll be spending a lot of money."
27340,Noice.
27341,This game is a masterpiece and probably my favorite game and 100% the best in the borderlands series
27342,Yes
27343,Borderlands 2 is simply very fun.
27344,big pp
27345,The best Borderlands game hands down. I have bought this game like 4 times on various devices and played it countless times. I was hyped for it before it came out and it lived up to it. This will always be one of my favourite and most cherished games. Wish I could've said the same for BL3
27346,"yes
"
27347,"the guns shoot stuff, damn!"
27348,"Hands down the best game in a franchise i really enjoy.   This also has some of the best DLC the franchise currently has to offer.  I could recommend buying this whole thing simply for the Tiny Tina DLC alone.  Even better, 2K has come out on record saying they have nothing against the use of trainers.  It's kept this game alive way past the expected life of it.  So play it through and then give yourself some crazy OP weapons and shields, bump up the difficulty and enjoy it again."
27349,This game be pretty good. They really ought to release a 64 bit version maybe with dx11 so that the game doesn't run like a slideshow when using conference call.
27350,ye
27351,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The best thing is that is FPS with RPG elements it has one of the best stories ever,good sense of humor , tons of content,constantly beeing updated with new stuff and a lot of EXPLOSIONS. Seriously I'm trying to play it less than 12 hours per day but its not happening :D"
27352,"Enjoyed the writing/dialogue, particularly for its gallows humor."
27353,is gud
27354,"This game is amazing, Bl3 was a good game but compared to Bl2 it is nowhere near as good. (granted, Bl2 has all of its dlc's released) I recently came back to this game and how happy i am that i did. The game can be an fps looter game but behind that there are class builds, weapon combinations, (mostly Gunzerker) raid bosses, etc. This game has so much and it's different vault hunter modes makes the game 10x better."
27355,"- Awesome Graphics
- Can run on a potato
- Fun gameplay"
27356,Honestly one of the best games ever made.
27357,This is an excellent and entertaining game full of unique weapons.
27358,great game for its time

27376,"Highly recommend 
Great game and gun play, Play with 2 or 4 friends for the best experience 
Get it the handsome collection when its on sale. Best time to buy"
27377,Very nice game to play with friends or alone.
27378,"Very fun game if you have friends to play with. the voice lines are amazing and funny. just wish it would have some things from borderlands 3, such as the toggle favourite or trash for items"
27379,This is my fave game ive played it for most of my life very good story good side missions and the best villain I have ever seen i have seemed to love every character and what makes this game amazing is the fact that you can okay this game six diffrent ways 6 times over with a good new experience each and every time I play
27380,game is good!
27381,"has enough interesting mechanics to differentiate itself from a generic shooter game without being unapproachably complex; the story is fun and funny, there is a gun that negs you 10/10"
27382,"An amazing experience. I have no clue why I never sought to play this before now, but I can honestly say after only 20 hours of playtime at the time of this review Borderlands 2 has become one of my favourite games. Insanely addicting gameplay, easy to understand yet exciting mechanics, an insane collection of interesting weaponry to find and use, all coupled with a gripping main storyline makes for an incredible time alone, or even better with friends. I actually don't have anything negative to say about the game whatsoever. Sure the graphics could use an update, but that doesn't matter too much seeing as BL3 is out. 10/10"
27383,w
27384,"One of the best games of it's time. Multiple GOTY awards winner. What could go wrong, right?

Well, quite a lot actually. I've never played Borderlands and while playing this for the first time in co-op, I felt confused a lot of the time. Biggest issue was for me that I never got into the story or lore of Pandora. It was average. Moreover, the game felt a bit of a drag rather than feeling fun. [i]Best character was definitely Claptrap.[/i]

I guess, what I should be saying is that the game has not aged well. But that's more than okay for a game from 2012. 
[b]As far as recommending it to other people to try it goes, I'd have to say NO.[/b] It just isn't modern or worth playing unless you have played some other game from the franchise and want to try this one out.
Final thoughts : Loot Porn is DEFINITELY [b]Not my cup of tea. [/b]"
27385,"Great and fun single player campaing, but even more fun in co-op. 
Borderlands, Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel and Borderlands 3 are all great games and i can recommend it to everyone :))"

Keep up the good work!"
27407,Very Epic the rats are a nice touch
27408,Want to kill something over and over until you get a cool orange weapon? yeah you do. Story is also pretty nice. Very good DLC too don't leave those out
27409,much guns many shoots
27410,One of the best loot focus games available
27411,This Game is super fun with all of its unique features of game play. Even years later after it was originally launched it still impresses me how someone can come up with such a unique story line and game play. I would encourage anyone who loves a good story and first person shooters to try this game out. My only complaint is that it is realitively complicated to do cross play and Constructers are WAY to overpowered.  (idc if i spelled something wrong)
27412,"If you're looking for best action, shooting and looting game. You've come to the right place. Just fuckin hit hte download button."
27413,really good game
27414,"Classic FPS looter shooter that brings you a mind boggling amount of unique guns. Standard selection of 4 different characters, standard Borderlands skill trees. New Badass ranks are a thing. Colorful and bloody as always, tons of fun especially with friends but not a must. Worth every penny you own, it's an evergreen... meaning you will always find a time for playing some Borderlands 2."
27415,One of the best shoot and loot games on the market!
27416,"For me It quite boring at first if you not interesting about story of game (For skipping person like me), but when you know time to grinding. It's very fun game."
27417,Gearbox is a one hit wonder
27418,y e s
27419,quite the game ive played for a few years difinetly worth it and also the 3rd one
27420,love this game

27437,Fun game! It's more fun to play with friends!
27438,"i have had this game since around the beginning of the week and it's so fun i have already logged 60 hours in it. i'm sad i haven't tried this before now honestly. it is one of the most fun games i have ever played, it might even be in my top 5 now, it's just that fun for me. if you like stuff like infinite ammo pistols and talking fucking shotguns that call you boss and scream murder and make gun noises this is the game for you, just like it was for me. i can't say enough how much i love this game, and i don't even know if i'm halfway through yet, it has that much content, and i have barely been bored once even through all the side quests! In other games i always stick to the story but bl2 has a way of enticing the player to want to do side quests for the chance to get better loot and lots of xp before moving on with the story. All in all, I highly recommend this game, and hope my review helps some of you decide to buy it. Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and have a nice day!"

27444,fucking great
27445,"Amazing game but it's just too repetitive. This review might get A LOT OF HATE but it's just my opinion and opinions are subjective. 

I like the concept of the game but the character development in the Borderlands Franchise is almost non-existent. I initially started off with 1 and I was anticipating a story to rise at some point in the game. But... It never did. BL2 however did improvise on the story department. However, the story could just be so much better. I personally would give up some of the gameplay elements for a better story. I don't think anyone in the Borderlands community would ever agree to this. Killing loaders, constructors, skags, stalkers, etc might be fun... But I jus got bored of it way too quickly. Every mission involved you killing a bunch of guys and saving someone or collecting something for someone or deliver some letters. I mean the devs could've invested more into cut scenes and they could've just let players live in the universe rather than asking them to go out there and kill a bunch of people. I would've loved to have just had the time to drive around the planet of Pandora without any enemies and just explore the land for what it has to offer. 

But again, I'm a person who loves to chill while playing games without try harding too much (unless it's a competitive multiplayer game of sorts) and hence my opinion might be biased. 

To give you a perspective, I totally loved Tales From The Borderlands. I loved the story and the character development and everything about it. I would LOVE to see a Borderlands game that merges the story elements from The Tales From The Borderlands and the gameplay of Borderlands 2.

Overall, it's an amazing game to play once. But I don't think I'll ever come back to it."
27446,endless fun as long as you have friends. just avoid the company though.
27447,"Allow me to start by stating that this is my favourite game of all time, though I've wasted more time on the console editions than on PC.

If someone is recommending that you play the Borderlands series, START HERE. You don't need the knowledge of the first game to enjoy the sequel as it pretty much tells you what happened in the intro, and you pick up little tidbits of information during the story and in the side quests. 

Gameplay is fairly decent, you actually have a minimap in the second game and there are tons of new enemies to fight, with some of the older ones mixed in there. Gunplay is pretty outdated, even in 2012 it was pretty bad, though its not a major detractor and all the manufacturers are unique with the guns they produce. Orange weapons are the rarest (and most fun to use since they all have different effects usually referencing something) and white being the most common, randomly generated guns galore!

Won't talk about the story here as its something you need to experience first hand, though Handsome Jack is one of the greatest antagonists in gaming in my opinion, friends I've talked to about the game usually claim they play just for Jack and I'm inclined to agree. Shame they couldn't catch that lightning in a bottle again in 3.

So should you buy Borderlands 2? Yes, yes you should. Though if you're patient, you can snag it in a steam sale for a bargain lowest I've seen it go is £5, I'd grab the dlc if its on sale too, not as great as the base game but still fun regardless."
27448,Fekking cool
27449,"I always hear about this games humor/story being good and apparently I am one of the few people who disagrees entirely. The only decent character that was even remotely funny was Jack and he's rarely even in the game. I found Tiny Tina to be utterly annoying and juvenile and Angels/Rolands supposedly serious melodrama to be beyond over the top.

That  being said, this game gameplay wise is an improvement over the original in every way and is arguable one of the best fps's ever made. The weapon variety, the character abilities/build options and the challenging enemies all make it a classic and worth it in the end."
27450,jjjjjjjjjjjjjj

characters and weapons have level system and can level up 

The weapon is random generated so you always get different weapon with different stat each time, each character have their own ability, skills, and stas. so its better to play with your friend and use different character and make a good team

This is old game but since the graphic is ""cartoonish"" it will still looking good for a long time

And the map is like a lot of small map with transition like dark souls or code vein but with loading screen
and it has new game+ which is nice

27491,I suck at this game but I still love it.
27492,"Borderlands 2 is a compelling and action-packed first person shooter. The world is one of a kind, with maps and characters that make for a vibrant setting for the action to take place in. The story is also interesting, and drives the action forward in a way that makes sense. The art direction is singularly unique, and a hallmark of the franchise. The cell shading concept provides for something which is visually striking and memorable. The sound design is professional and the music often does a great job setting the tone over the shouts, explosions, and gunfire that comprise the game's abundant violence. The gameplay is high-energy and engaging, and with friends it gets hard to put down the controller. One minor incongruity is an equipment and stat mismatch between friends, but if you like playing the game at all then this shouldn't be an issue. Overall, Borderlands 2 is a solid FPS with tons of personality, and for the reasons discussed above gets a 7/10 from me."

Short story however there are tons of side missions and dlc to take part in.
Only problems I had were the limited number of enemy types and map variations, however this game was released so long ago that its shortcomings can be forgiven.

Just note that Borderland 3 is an entirely better game with improved mechanics, enemies and map variations, so I would recommend playing Borderlands 3 first."

27521,"Very fun, interesting, first time through is amazing.  Replayability is limited, I think, as playing as other classes you go through the same scenarios and quests.  Perhaps I'll enjoy it more when I max out one class and then start another.  Shame that there (apparently?) isn't a way to have more than one character going at a time."
27522,ez good game
27523,this game is quite goodness
27524,good game you just shoot the people and the people are funny.
27525,This game is the tits. cant imagine many people still play it though.
27526,Amazing game. Gradually builds up beginners to first person shooting games. Defiantly recommend this to everyone.
27527,"Stupid humor, comic-book graphics, a lot of weird post-apocalyptic enemies, and a myriad of randomly-generated guns to shoot them with. Oh, and you can (and really should) play it with friends."
27528,"Linux version is intentionally restricted. I could not play it public online, LAN, or see any friends inside the game. I set up a Wine Steam version using Lutris and voilá, a bunch of content just stripped from the Linux version. Same game, same price, but looks like developer thinks one OS-type user does not need to play with more people."
27529,I've heard so much about this game and damn I wasn't disappointed.
27530,Awesome
27531,It is better the second time you play it.

27535,"I bought the handsome collection pack on sale and i don't regret it, the game is well done, i like the story very much. It's full of fun moments and sad moments. It's one of those few games that have a likable, charismatic, funny and intelligent antagonist ( Handsome Jack). It's clear to me that they put more work in developing the antagonist than the protagonists and i love that. Usually the antagonists are given poor back stories and motives for doing what they do like being simply insane, no further explanation, but not Handsome Jack and i appreciate this a lot, it's a nice change. They even made a whole game about Handsome Jack (Borderlands the pre sequel).
The protagonists(vault hunters) are given short back stories through some echo recordings that you have to find by exploring, but not much else. 

The guns are many and varied, more than enough to suit anyone's playing style. The enemies are many and well armed so be careful when you start a fight, you're gonna find yourself in a tough spot quite often. It also features boss fights. classic.
Weapons are either dropped from dead enemies, found in loot containers or bought from vendors. The best weapons are either quest rewards or you have to farm bosses to get them. Each boss has a unique drop with a fairly low chance of happening, so you have to be patient, but it's worth the hunt.

Each playable character has 3 completely different skill trees in which you can spend your skill points however you want, giving you complete freedom to develop any way. Also you can reset your skill points if you feel like spending them in a different skill tree or spend them in all 3 skill trees; a casual touch to the game, i like it. This is the kind of game that doesn't want to get too serious even when it is serious so having the option to reset skill points makes sense here. Also having so many weapons to choose from goes very well with this option, being able to mix it up any time, any way you want. 

Gameplay is fairly balanced in the beginning, but as you get closer to the end you will be almost  invincible, provided you did the side quests and got some decent equipment. The game also features co-op for up to 4 people, with each player joining your session making the enemies stronger and increasing their chance for better loot.

Quests are many and most of them are funny and entertaining, even the traditionally boring fetching ones are a lot easier to go through when it's about something funny, that is if you appreciate comedy in video games (sometimes even dark humor, which i love), otherwise you will just see them as the usual boring fetch quests or go there, kill that quests. Probably that is why they put comedy in those in the first place.

Map is huge, split into regions with loading screens, mostly open ended. Some regions are locked until you reach certain points in the story and some of the regions that are open from the start are populated by powerful enemies that you can't defeat, forcing you come back later when you become stronger, thus making it feel more rewarding and natural. Each region has it's own easter eggs that reward the player with hero tokens that can be spent to permanently increase the stats, actually making it worth searching for those achievements and not feeling totally worthless.

Obviously the game is not perfect, it has some technical issues with modern systems, specifically physx when set on high crashes the game for some reason. Besides this there's not much to tell, just a few minor bugs that won't ruin your fun in the long run.

I didn't bother looking too much in  depth at it's story and character flaws because i don't really care, i've had a lot of fun with this game to let a few minor things ruin it for me, but if that's for you, i'm sure you can find some very detailed reviews about this game on youtube explaining every flaw this game has.

I like the game, i recomend it. Be sure to get the dlc's too, they make the game that much better."
27536,"This Review is posted as a WARNING If you have played any Borderlands game off Epic Games -- With one of the newer updates, Borderlands 2 now requires use of the SHIFT Account System (Due to every company wanting their own log-in service for some odd reason), and as such if you have a profile name you use across systems and have already logged into a SHIFT service through Epic Games, I wish you luck in trying to link your Steam account to the same SHIFT account. If I find a way to do so I will update this review, but until then be warned. If you have a way a comment would be very much appreciated and I will give credit in the update on how to do fix it.

Edit: So apparently it's not actually making a Shift Account per-say despite using the same name, its more-or-less just a username...On-top of requiring programs to run that require usernames....It's strange, but you can just change the name on one program with ease then run the others."

27579,ok
27580,"This game was bought for me by a friend of mine and I had NO idea what it was beyond that it was a shooter, and had a cool art style. That was literally it. After some prodding though, another friend of mine finally got me to the point that I was more interested in playing it because the story is honestly pretty great. The characters are the biggest selling point to this game and I've been told that this is the best Borderlands in the franchise.

Its just got a vibe to it all of its own! Not only does it feel postapocalyptic, but its also scifi in some ways as well, especially with it being on a whole other planet named Pandora. You get to stick it to the man (Handsome Jack) and you get to help your friends, and the characters you would play as in Borderlands 1, which I found interesting.

Every character has their own distinct personality, and more often than not an exaggerated southern accent. It's honestly beautiful. The characters, even the villain, are incredibly well acted, and well written. The game is just fantastic.

The gameplay itself is very rewarding, you either run in and die almost immediately, or you run in and shoot something in the head. There's a lot less penalty for dying because if you kill something in the 10 seconds or so you're down, you get back up with a percentage of your health back. Additionally, if you do die fully, the enemies you killed dont respawn on you, you dont have to reload, you just start back at the nearest respawn site and whatever killed you gets its full health back (that's really annoying for larger boss mobs, but managable) This makes it extremely rewarding to be a crackshot, while also maintaining a sense that you're never really losing ground, everything eventually respawns though so dont take too long. You can also play with other people and that makes it even harder to die since they can pick you up. There's never a dull moment playing it."

27582,"Great game, but fuck 2K and Gearbox for adding the 'Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary' DLC; it's literally the biggest piece of shit, and you have to pay for it. Now I'm forced to purchase it if I want my OP ranks back.

27606,"My first introduction to the Borderlands series was with Borderlands 2. Up to the is point I had played other looting type games like diablo and I wasn't crazy about it. However, there was something about this game that made me want to grind out bosses for weapons and I enjoyed it for the first time. The game is at its best when you are playing with friend or in Co-op. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes loot type games like diablo, path of exile, or destiny etc. I even bought this game again on console so I could play with my friends."
27607,yes
27608,Fun game
27609,"This game rocks. 

To be more specific... this game rocks for me. I am not an automatic fan of shooters or. I take it one game at a time and tend to be drawn more to role playing games. This game has won me over due to a variety of reasons. 

The cell shading is across the handsome jack collection (and BL 3) is fairly unique among franchises and adds to the atmosphere and the wonderful silliness of the game.

The story is overflowing with comic relief and does not take itself too seriously, after a fashion. I love equal opportunity offenders in comedy. Gearbox and everyone who worked on the story/ characters really went all out in creating an atmosphere of desolate, charming and irreverent humor in pretty much every aspect of world building.

The gameplay is what hooked me. I have CP and my coordination is impacted to a degree. Accessibility in gaming matters to me. If the control options are not where I need them to be, I cannot, will not spend my time on a game where the controls are not right regardless of whether that game is compelling or not. Aim Assist in this game crucial for me to strike a balance between accessibility and challenge.  Aside from aim assist, the sheer variety in gunplay and leveling, progression systems in BL2 are incredibly well done.
Lastly, video game shooters are simply cathartic. BL2 and the series so far seems to recognize it’s own potential to be a stress release and goes the extra mile to build toward a sense of releasing the inner barbarian against video game evil. 
It’s just good.  Pick it up, have fun. Be safe.

27632,"Certainly a contender for best game of all times. The game is fun, beautiful, good skinner box mechanics, infinite replayability, and has tons TONS of humour! I can see why the reviews are so high for this game."
27633,"Obnoxious beyond belief. Downloadable content bullshit required prviacy signing.. and a loooong unskippable movie to even start to play the stupid thing. Which you will probably end up watching multiple times if, as for me, it crashed immediately afterward. Buy something else."
27634,"Fun as shit, love the company, love the gameplay, love the story and the characters are the best. Ive played this game for a long time over on console, have all borderlands game on ps4 and xbox one, played em for multiple hours and still find the way to have some fun, whether its making a bandit fly by blasting em with lead or making stupid melee builds."
27635,Fun loot and shoot game mechanics with interesting characters and funny voice lines.
27636,hella good

27661,"I spent a lot of time in this game, with the constant hope of getting that one better weapon every roll, and hoping the next mission would let me serve a cold one up the arse of that damned Hyperion Jack-ass. God that fucker annoys me XD. It's a fun and funny game, and perhaps more fun with friends.

I've only ever tried the Siren class, but let me tell you if you're not a super pro nutcase gamer who's wife is still with you, you'll not enjoy New Game + or whatever it is, once you've clocked the game. You'll be eaten alive on the first level XD

Truth be told, this game died for me once I picked up a trainer so I could test some of the elusive special guns that I never seemed to get. Then it was really meh for some reason. Even more truth be told, I really only did that cos some of the levels seemed to be never ending. To the point I kinda got sick of them. I still recommend the game, perhaps buy only on sale as a collection, you'll get your money's worth. 

"
27662,"I'd say the best (if not, awesome) looter shooter you can play! Though I don't have a beastly PC to play this on, I can still enjoy myself, whether I'm blasting bandits with my guns, or blowing up skags and stalkers with the Sky Rocket grenades, or just playing Slots at Moxxi's. There's a play style for everyone and I can safely say this game is a must have.

The sad part, however, is the fact that multiplayer is laggy as heck, the only way I know to play with others is only through LAN, which means same Wi-Fi connection. Since Borderlands 3 is out, I don't know if they're going to work on this other than bug fixes, but regardless, there's still fun to be had in single player."
27663,It is very funny with a friend
27664,"Played it for a bit, seems fun"
27665,This gaym gud
27666,Yes!.
27667,Love it!
27668,DICKS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT....DICKS.
27669,amazing game
27670,Salvador Rules!! Just love everything about BL2
27671,"guns
"
27672,Love it
27673,"wacky, extreme and wonderfully pleasing.. insanely engaging graphics with fast paced gameplay .. love it"
27674,Incredibly mediocre gameplay which is the pinnacle of looter shooter but the false absolute zero for entertainment.
27675,Best game of 2018 so far
27676,"an amazing game that has a wonderful story and a great villain, and has some wonderful and funny moments here and there"
27677,"Btw I have completed this within 30 hours of playing this game. But I haven't yet completed the game on harder difficulties.

The story of this game is a little muddled. One of the first characters you meet in the game, Sir Hammerlock has no roll in the rest of the story. The quests get a little repetitive after a while. As there is not much variation in tasks, it's either find items or shoot things. I have found myself getting bored playing any quests without co-op with friends. And nobody wants to farm bnk3r for the amount of time I did. Now Maya is a siren but somehow doesn't have nearly the amount of power as the other sirens. She should be a least able to fast travel herself and others to wherever. And to be able to teleport anywhere in the characters line of sight. But apart from that with friends this game is amazing, it is fun, challenging. The character's skills give access to heaps of builds. The art style is creative and unique. The cars are fun. The number of guns/items as well as the item names is well thought of. 

All and all I would say yes you should get this game but you'll be able to have way more fun if you play with friends."
27678,is good
27679,yes yes muy gusto
27680,very epic
27681,"In my opinion, the best Borderlands game.

The shooting system is great, though a more refined sensitivity slider would be nice. Pretty much everything about the game is amazing, except for one thing: it's incredibly grindy.

Some of the guns, like the Unkempt Harold, are incredibly powerful and you can get it near the start of the game. However, some of the guns are stupidly rare, and aren't even that good, like the Cobra. You need to be prepared to sit through hours of grinding bosses to get the gun you want. 

Another thing is that I really liked the fact that you could get hybrid guns in Borderlands 1, and I think it's a thing Gearbox should introduce to all their games. Also, the way that body parts exploded in Borderlands 1 was really satisfying, in a gruesome way, which is not present in Borderlands 2, which is a real shame.

Overall 9/10 from me, but keep in mind that it's a very grindy game. If you're not into that, maybe look elsewhere.
"
27682,Its a good game
27683,everything
27684,is good game yes
27685,OH YES melhor looter/shooter ever
27686,Yeah.
27687,AMAZING
27688,"Its a true classic
"
27689,"The game is full of madness, cool  and bad jokes, unique characters. The story in this game is probably the best in the series. 

The bads: driving is still absolutely terrible, the open world feels empty
The goods: the art style ensures the game looks decent even with new-gen graphics, the story is amazing, cool characters, absolute madness.

If you like shooters with a cool story, the game is highly recommended."
27690,good game.
27691,Very fun lots of gameplay
27692,epic game
27693,"Diverse set of characters, each with their own unique quirks and playstyles.  Allows for lots of replayability."
27694,Absolutely - complete mayhem
27695,"I used to be a pirate and played this game had fun playing solo and lan and when it was on sale in steam, with the little money i had and ended up  buying it, just to support the dev. 
The problems is, due to the new shift thingy, the game fails to create an online session for me to connect with others, thus starting it in offline mode. 
So not going to talk bad or something, not much people play it around my lvl 31 atm completed bunker.
dayum lyfe is not dejabu."
27696,good team game
27697,"Great story, fun gameplay, the definitive looter shooter."
27698,"One of my all time favourite games. 
It's aged well, the DLC's are what made the game in my opinion but the campaign is perfect also. 
10/10 would recommend any gamer to play this in their life."
27699,good game if you geyt good
27700,im having fun so far
27701,is fun game
27702,fire game
27703,i just love this game the DLC's all awesome the story line borderlands 3 is awesome also the final boss here was really good also i am not going to spoil but i did beat the game on ps4
27704,good game
27705,AWSOME game keeps me busy for hours had it on console but rebought it i love it if ur looking for something to keep u REALLY BUSY this is the game for you only thin id complain  about is the fact once awhile my 8 gig vram 2080 super isnt enough for this in 4k its crashes now and then
27706,"This game is amazing and super fun on PC!

The issue is the devs don't care to keep it that way. If you join your friends game and they're NOT at sanctuary, you will get a fatal error that force closes your game. You have to join their invite, while they're at sanctuary. Now, given this info: you can still randomly get ""Fatal Error:XXX"" during co-op.

It is ridiculous how the higher ups for this game are too busy getting angry at people's feedback of BL3, that they won't instead focus on fixing the Steam version of BL2. Just check steam forums... this game has had issues long before BL3's announcing. They won't fix it. Works best on Console souley due to this error. If they fixed it, then it'd be a top 5 steam game. easy."
27707,good game
27708,pog
27709,very cool
27710,BEST GAME EVER
27711,.
27712,no.
27713,"Honestly an awesome game. From the personalities of the cast to the thousands of different guns, there's nothing that you can't enjoy about this game. Lots of areas to explore, interesting enemies, and Handsome Jack in all of his glory! 100/10, would recommend to anyone"
27714,"While I will stand by my opinion that BL3 is a better looter shooter. This game was a massive installment in not just the borderlands series but in all RPGs in general. This game was the king of looter shooters and inspired countless other titles. It has one of the best villains in not just all RPGs but in all video games in general. Must buy if you are a fan of any of the following in video games:
- Good Stories
- RPGs
- FPSs
- Games with rarity systems
- CO-OP
(I could go on but you get the point)"
27715,its fun very fun so fun even funner than taco night on monday
27716,Amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27717,By far my most favorite game of the series. The content in the game was so good looking and the re playablity of this game is superb.
27718,Guns go pew pew
27719,good game for coop
27720,Great franchise and so far my favourite game of the franchise
27721,"Been playing Borderlands since part 1, it just keeps getting better..multiplayer...SHIFT keys...a bazillion guns...very much replayable..good wholesome fun for the family to enjoy lol"
27722,top tits
27723,very good.
27724,"i like claptrap especially his dick i looked at it for at least a solid 4 hours of my game time when it showed in the beginning of the game

so hot"
27725,Best of the series. Amazing villain. Vibrant areas. Super fun gameplay.
27726,great game
27727,is good
27728,Runs well on Linux
27729,"Loved this game for the ease of being able to just hop in and play. No specific quest line you need to follow, just hop in and go blow shit up!"
27730,"Played for a little bit. Pretty fun with friends, but can get a little stale after the 500 hour mark"
27731,"gamer

27732,very good 10/10

27734,No Matter How Good You Get You Will Never Have The Shiniest Meat Bicycle
27735,is good
27736,"Borderlands 2 is by far the best of the 4 Borderlands main games. The gun-play is so tight and satisfying, the humor is at its best and rarely seems stressed as some of the newer titles suffer from. It has so much replayability its unthinkable, and holds up much better with age than its predecessor or 1.5 do."
27737,The game is worth playing
27738,become piss baby incarnate in burgerlands 2
27739,"w huj zajebista gra
xd"
27740,VERY NICE
27741,Great game play it at less once
27742,"The game is a very long and rewarding game which features 6 unique and in depth characters,team play which makes any situation fun and engaging, and lots of content so you can play over and over."
27743,"good game, keep in mind that it (moreso than BL1, I'd say) is a multiplayer game with optional singleplayer, not the other way around"
27744,Good game!
27745,"Get the handsome collection when on sale/free, is worth investing your time into"
27746,Love it
27747,"it is shit now ill never play it again on steam gotta play borerlands the pre-sequel bye bye everymate! 
"
27748,yes
27749,Very nische
27750,Yes
27751,This game is loads and loads of fun with a good learning curve. Love the dark humour throughout.
27752,still good
27753,a god-tier influential game with the best villain in gaming history
27754,"Game is good, I shoot good, good loot then shoot then loot then game. Yes nice game."
27755,good game
27756,"my favorite borderlands game and is fun but if you dont like what is now called ""shooty looty"" games then this game will not change your mind. but its essentially crack to my friends so thats why i have 200 hours in it. honestly i am not the biggest fan of these games anymore but i liked it when i was a child back in the day.

jk steam i was over 18 when i played this hahahaha dont hurt me"
27757,Gaem gdoo
27758,This is the greatest game of all time. It's is so good I had to buy it on steam after thousands of hours over xbox.
27759,Was fun. Great writing. Beautiful environments. Good story. Maybe it's because i chose sniper but gameplay got old. I'll just watch the ending scenes on youtube.
27760,"Pretty much a must play game for anyone that likes fps/rpg/looters/story.

As time goes on and newer games come out, it keeps sinking in that this is indeed a masterpiece of a game.

I loved this game when I first played. I downloaded it on whim because it was 7-8gb of space and it was a free weekend. I probably never would of bought this without playing it. I've grown to love all the dlcs and the headhunter packs, even the main story that I've played so many times now.

Fast forward to today and borderlands 3, while I do enjoy it I keep thinking how are they going to surpass the story and the great dlcs that this one had. I'm on the handsome jackpot dlc and I've lost interest in playing until the new dlc 3 drops and the ultraviolet event stops. I have high hopes for dl3 as it looks good. I wrote a review for bl3 main story so I won't get into that here.

All in all this is a game you should play through completely, especially dlc 4. If your not hooked by then, then you must not like the style/gameplay."
27761,game
27762,good game f
27763,Great game. Best in the series. Satisfying.
27764,s
27765,gamer time

27767,fun
27768,i like every thing great game
27769,"If you call yourself a gamer and haven't played this yet, I don't know what to say..."
27770,buy it on sale when you can get all the DLC and get some friends to play it with
27771,izz goo
27772,"After all these years, it holds up tremendously well and still plays amazing. Co-op mode is where its at, and the DLC are 100% worth it. Must buy for looter-shooter fans"
27773,IT IS SO BADASS!
27774,"Bought BL2 when it came out on Xbox 360 and I've been addicted to it since!
I love FPS & RPG games and this was such a great combination of the two.
The graphic design is great, has that comic book vibe going on, fantastic game play and witty humour thrown in just to round the whole game off!
Cool characters, nice story campaign and co-op is an absolute blast!
Certainly not your typical shooter but if you're looking for something different to play, definitely try this!"
27775,"Quests with a sense of humour, a strong story, one of the best villains in videogames and tons, tons of loot. Totally worth buying."
27776,"Graphics: 10/10

Storyline: 10/10

Quests: 10/10

Voicelines: 10/10

27777,SO FCKIN GOOD
27778,Very good game with some obvious issues. Lots of Fetch quests
27779,Just buy it already you know its good.
27780,One of the best games ever made a must need for your steam library
27781,Boom Boom
27782,nice
27783,im gay
27784,Pure. awesomeness.
27785,yes
27786,"I've tried to play this game a few years back, but it was a bit dull in solo.
Recently me and my beloved decided to play it through in coop. It definitely changes the pacing and adds fun :)
Story and people you encounter are almost as mad as those in Saints Row.
Visually even now it looks nice because of the cel shading visual style.
Borderlands is best played in a group of friends, jokes are nice, plot is almost making a joke from itself. :)
The only 2 downsides I see:
- it gets repetitive after a while, but not boring or grindy in any way;
- A lot of dialogues or messages can start playing during the fight, which is a bit annoying, you can't concentrate equally on fight and info.
Overall get it, play it through with friends, have fun and a good mood :)"
27787,Its coo
27788,nice old classic game
27789,haha funny game
27790,'twas good
27791,Best Shooter hands down
27792,"The Commander Lilith DLC bars people who don't own it from playing the addons of the District Peak DLC, the OP levels.  I mean it would be fine if it was still free, but now the fact that it used to be free and is more expensive and arguably wrose in value than any other DLC.  Further more, it is not compatible for Linux, so the game is broken for anyone who owns Linux.  I honestly am not going to get another Borderlands game.  Borderlands 2 is literally my favorite game, but I cannot give it a thumbs up on this one."
27793,"7.5/10 Outdated writing but it's a solid, fun experience. Better with friends, bit of a trudge by yourself."
27794,Dope
27795,Poopy?
27796,Best looter shooter
27797,"This game is fun, dude, like, I can't explain it. This has it's own magic, it is such a unique experience. You really do have to play it to get that feeling. It takes cliche feels and puts it in such it's own way, making it a wonderful experience, even for those who are playing it as their first game, like me."
27798,Crazy talkative robot: Checked. Nutty lovable Villains: Checked. Ridiculously-out-of-this-world-guns: Checked. Get in and get blasting!
27799,yes
27800,"Really fun game, played all the way through by myself and am coming back to play with friends - still super fun

27805,bang bang skeet skeet loot boom shoot shoot
27806,"It be good

27807,1000 % recommended. I really like this game.  I've been playing this game for almost 90 hours and there's still lots of funny content.
27808,"Good gameplay, worth it for a looter shooter"
27809,Yes very much so
27810,VERY NICE
27811,Very fun game and a great community.
27812,Fun
27813,"IT GOOD , YOU BUY NOW!!!"
27814,"i love borderlands 2 and everybody else back in 2012 did also so, yeah if you want to buy this then i hope you find ultimate levels of fun and epicness, as well for some neato jokes from there and there not only does the game have incredible gameplay and story, but the one thing that always bring me back is the reward and unique gear the game has to offer to not only for shift users but for newbies also like explosive shotguns,fire pistols, & good ol' fashioned snipers which are all different,randomly generated,& are all useful no matter what rank there at green,blue,grey's whatever. but what really makes them unique is who makes them, like when you use a malawan not only does the elements have different effects but are effective when you use them right like use fire against bandits,corrosive against loader bots, and E.t.c. the different guns are all unique on what manufacture made it like i not only do the guns have there strengths but also there weaknesses like hyperion is good for range and medium to long range combat but the cost is less fire rate and you have to fire long enough to stabalize the rapid fire, which are all up to you like go all cowboy like with zero and be a ultimate nightmare to the enemys' using jackob's weapons, or go all gunzerker with salvador and use valdof weapons. and the vault hunter are nothing but absolutely outstand like a physco that's a high risk but high reward type of guy, and a engineer with a companion robot which like i said are outstanding in design and gameplay. i hope this is all i need to say about it and is enough for anyone to agree with me that the borderlands series is nothing but unique and i hope we go all the way and go to a borderlands 4 & 5 and like marcus ""good hunting""."
27815,"Lots of fun to play through, great humor, interesting and creative weapons. No fall damage!"
27816,"Innovative, fun and well made."

27825,One of the best borderlands games.
27826,"Genre-defining. Absolutely entertaining writing. Enjoyable drop-in, drop-out co-op. Timeless. The games that came after pale in comparison. Certainly Gearbox's best production so far."
27827,only fun to play with friends not random players
27828,"This fuc**ing game is awsome, i played for 60 hours and i love"
27829,"Great game! Highly recommend.

27833,"SHOOT ME IN THE FACE. SHOOTMEINDAFAAAACE. SHOOT. ME. INTHAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"
27834,best fps looter
27835,Essential looter shooter. My favorite FPSRP of all time.
27836,"The world is great and interesting, some characters are really good, but holy shit the game play has some major issues in my eyes. Its horribly balanced, the damage you are able to put out is nowhere near to the damage your opponents have, not to mention their aim where even while running they have perfect aim, there are several collider issues all around the levels, getting stuck on a stair or a small elevation, and for a looter shooter most of the guns you find are absolutely terrible. Most of the fights in the game dont come down to skill, but rather just dumb luck. Most of the enemies are annoying instead of challenging, not to mention bullet sponges. I know its supposed to be, but some of them are just overkill, and moving around the level during a fight most of the time is a terrible idea, resulting in instant death
Playing it with a friend helps a bit, but not much. I personally cant understand how did this game get its cult status. Its not a terrible game, but its not a great one either. Slightly above average at best."
27837,"An alright Looter-Shooter without much variance in gameplay and forgettable story and characters.

The main themes this series has going for it are 1. the art style, 2. the crude humour and 3. the amazing loot.

An abudance of different weapons with their respective quirks is sure to offer a gun-set for most everyone. It's fun to experiment around with different elemental types od damage.

The bosses are well-designed, the action is fast-paced and colorful. This isn't a cover-based shooter, since on anything but the highest difficulty you'll find the AI to be dumb as bread. But hey, at least Borderlands 2 and it's siblings aren't pretending to be a serious hardcore-shooter. 

It's mindless fun to kill a couple hours. Sidequests are usually bland and don't help make the world feel any more alive.

6/10 - Play this if you're hungry for a run-and-gun shooter that doesn't take itself too serious."
27838,"Use gun to beat enemy who drops new gun that you use to use to fight bigger enemy who drops newer gun that you use to fight biggerer enemy who drops newerer gun that . . . .

27841,one of those games you can play casually or intensely and its great either way
27842,headshot lol
27843,Its decent :3
27844,i like
27845,"A game that cemented the legacy of Gearbox Software. With the fun characters, gameplay, and bringing the looter shooter genre to life, it's no wonder why this game is so highly regarded as a classic."
27846,great co op.
27847,"awesome
"
27848,im a big fan of left clicking
27849,"It's one of my favorite games, and one of my favorite sequals!"
27850,one of the most ambitious games ever. absolutely amazing!
27851,just yes
27852,"Probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Story=great, Characters=great, villain=among the greatest of all time, gameplay holds up 8 years later, graphics will always hold up due to the unique art style, most of the comedy=gold, RPG-lite elements=damn-near perfect. When this game goes on sale for $8-ish or less, it's one of the best values in gaming. Buy it. And don't look at my hours played on here. I spent most of my game time on X360."
27853,cool
27854,Great story line for a big cock havin ass nigga
27855,It's BL 2.
27856,Borderlands is the game what everyone need to play once in their life!
27857,It's Great!
27858,epic
27859,"Game is unplayable.  Will only run about 5 seconds at a time, then freeze for 1-2 seconds then run again for 5 secs, etc. etc. etc. Audio plays fine during the freeze. I ran out of things to try."
27860,"A really good game. Would recommend. Good item farming from bosses, good boss fights and a good storyline."
27861,PLAY IT YOU WONT BE UPSET
27862,"good game that has a open world,loveable characters,interesting world,ok story,good gameplay but sometimes it feels quirky and MOXXİ
"
27863,One of my favorite single player/Co-op games that has a ton of replayable content and overall possible game time
27864,"Running great with the new updates
"
27865,its fun it definently isn't my most played game
27866,"shooting, crazies, guns that make big booms!! What more is there to say?"
27867,Matei macacos gigantes de 4 bracos pra fazer um moicano foda pra um robo que parece uma lata de lixo 10/10
27868,"Borderlands 2 has a pretty stale late game experience, but the journey to that point is worth the investment. The writing on side quests is usually pretty good, or at least funny. The main story line doesn't do Borderlands 2 any justice, and gets repetitive as you do 3 runthroughs per character. Grind for some gear and blast some cartoon antagonists for a while, and marry Ellie."
27869,its good
27870,"Was never in to Borderlands, but decided to give it a go and 10/10 would recommend."
27871,"By far the best game in the series. No SJW overtones, funny as all can be. Enjoyable gameplay and of course loot galore! If you and a couple of friends just want to have a laugh and play a game this is for you."
27872,"ITs great, play it"
27873,I guess it's alright. Haven't played it much though.
27874,"I love this game it is a masterpiece, I bought this game back on release on PS3 and have probably amassed over 100 hours in this game. So in preparation for Borderlands 3 I decided to buy this gem, playing it again made me realize how funny and like able each character was, how fun and addicting the gameplay was and most importantly how interesting the story was. Though when I bought Borderlands 3 on PS4 I was severely disapointed to the lack of a great villain such as Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2 , and how generic and boring the story was. Playing Borderlands 3 made me appreciate this masterpiece even more and in a way Borderlands 2 is the best of the Borderlands games and worth even full price."
27875,really bad game
27876,wtf
27877,Best looter/shooter ever. Has a LOT replayability
27878,"""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" - Gaige, probably"
27879,great gunplay and amazing story + dlc stories
27880,Good fun coop shoot em up to play with yer mates
27881,love
27882,it is chill.
27883,col
27884,I enjoyed the parts where you shoot the badguys with guns.
27885,Ever been killed by a girl and her robot?
27886,"This game is cracked out as fuck but you're gonna hate your life the first 3 hours then the last 200 hours. If you are depressed and your gf left you after realizing your dick is too small, then this is the game for you. If you don't, get some pcp and enjoy. Tiny Tina rule 34 is recommended for best performance"
27887,no shit
27888,Like cartoony games with  a funny story line? Crazy gun fights? Insane bosses and enemies? Ridiculous looking guns with amazing names? This game is for you!
27889,yes
27890,"In hindsight, this game did not deserve the time I gave it. The gameplay loop is just shooting things (which is find if you're into that sort of thing), but it becomes very repetitive for me."
27891,i fuck with it
27892,"At the beginning I was afraid I didn't like this game, it was my first time buying the Borderlands franchise, I have bought the Handsome Collection and no regrets!!
Absolutely recommended!!!"
27893,good shootin good lootin
27894,"funny and exciting combat, super good time."
27895," My favorite game of all time, what else there is to add... Actually, ""for my only lover got a lot of nice things to say"".

 It all started in late 2014 when I got gifted a disc copy of the GOTY edition for my XBox 360, back then my English was incredibly weak, when I think about it, and, as the game wasn't dubbed or anything - I had little-to-no pleasure playing it and gave up soon after dealing with Boom and Bewm.

 A couple of months later a new console came into my life, that very console being the controversial PS Vita. Bundled with - you guessed right - a terrible port of Borderlands 2, which would run at 15FPS, provided I got lucky. But taking the little wonder of a handheld device on the train rides and such with me forced me to play it more and more.

 I should state right here and right now, I still believe that this game initially helped me step up my English a lot. Mostly because of the incredible voice acting behind the characters such as Handsome Jack(probably my favorite videogame character ever). I would play it for hours, slowly soaking up the new vocabulary and getting used to using grammar in a split of a second.

 Hundreds of hours of playtime were brought to me with the PS4 port and, well, here we are now, on the most comfortable of them all, the glorious PC version. 

  Borderlands 2 will always have a special place in my heart, as it is one of the cornerstone pieces of media that have defined my teenage years."
27896,YEE
27897,Guns
27898,"Played it once, it's pretty good."
27899,"Borderlands 2 great writing, fun mechanics, great dlc."
27900,Most overhyped game ever!
27901,"Probably the best ARPG of all time. Why? Because; 


+ Great story

+ Even greater characters

+ Impressive cartoonish graphics (With HD Textures nowadays)

+ Massive Open World to explore and loot

+ Enormous amount of DLC material

+ Infinitive weapon variations

+ Upgradable weaponized vehicles

+ Multiplayer

+ And so much, much more...




Cons are  insignificant to me compared to the Pros, to be worth mentioning at all.

From me [b] 9.5/10! [/b]"
27902,"do you want a game that is loved by many hated by a lot and played by me ?
well you found it  borderlands 2 is one of these almost perfect games 
the main enemy jack is so well done you love to hate him
dlc are plentyful and almost a loveletter to fans 
the game is hardest the first playthrough 
so i advise a friend to play with or carry you 
but it is almost infinitly replayable because it is simply so much fun 
if you debate about BL2 or BL3 pick BL2 its better in al ways for me but bl3 wil be good in a few years when they stop changing so many damn things"
27903,"fun with the right kind of people, but gets bland after some time."
27904,it a fun game
27905,"This game is, by far, the best game ive ever played. It has a fantastic story and hundreds of hours of gameplay. 
I originally played this game on xbox 360, and have about 2,000 hours on there.
Anyways this game is a 5/5 and i highly recommend to people who like story games."
27906,"one of the best fps looters games 
"
27907,"Very good, very yes and very fun"
27908,"Me like, you will like too"
27909,Borderlands 2 is good game. Many hours of fun and good story.
27910,EXPOLSIONS
27911,"AWSOME!!!!!!
"
27912,Amazing Game! Looten and Leveln all day long <3
27913,"Borderlands allways a favourite.
Had multiple hundreds of hours on PlayStation in it.
Borderlands is just a must play."
27914,I like this game. I will suggest other players to play this game.
27915,"[i]Borderlands 2[/i] has the same desperate, juvenile writing, the same bland, barren locations, and the same clunky, sluggish vehicles that made the original so frustrating to get into. It also has the same spectacularly fun shooting mechanics and weapon variety that ensure that no matter how many other ways it falls flat, I can’t hate it.

Sometimes I feel like I want to, though. Most egregiously, the biggest problem with the original game is also once again along for the ride. The game opens with a pre-rendered cutscene in which the four protagonists engage in an exciting gunfight with robots on a train that ends with that train exploding. It [i]shows[/i] us this, but I only got control of my character after she was launched from the train into a featureless frozen wasteland, where I spent several hours shooting hairy yeti animals. I wanted to be fighting robots on a train. In fact, I would even have settled for fighting the yetis on a train. Or fighting anything at all, train or not, if only those gunfights were interesting.

And really, after things get going, the gunfights [i]are[/i] interesting. Each weapon once again comes with a very satisfying set of audio and visual effects, and I do like how the four playable characters, despite being largely analogous to the first game’s, do have different abilities and their own unique skill trees so it doesn’t feel [i]exactly[/i] like a retread of the original.

Honestly, though, the upgrade here is one of quantity, not quality. It’s fundamentally the same game as the original, except now with potentially hundreds of hours of playthroughs instead of the solitary hundred the original offers. It’s more [i]Borderlands[/i], and as long as you’re willing to put up with annoying writing and a not insignificant chunk of the game that just spins its wheels without going anywhere, the game is so fundamentally fun and engaging that I can recommend it to basically anyone who’s ever enjoyed a shooter.

27920,👌🏻
27921,Yeah its alright I suppose.
27922,"Play with your friends or on your own, but just know that you will have an immense amount of fun playing this. Fight your way through the vastly different biomes and areas of Pandora, held under the reign of the Hyperion Corporation, lead by Handsome Jack.
Choose from 6 VERY different Vault Hunters, each with their own amazing abilities for destruction.
Loot unique, interesting, and fun guns from the bodies that lie in your wake.
Make your vault hunter the biggest bad*ss Pandora has ever seen.
Beat challenges within every map area of the game, easy or hard? you choose.
Go forth and defeat other bad*sses in the multiple headhunters and DLC maps.
Last, but not least, SHOOT SHOOTYMCSHOOTFACE IN HIS FACE!"

27952,YEET
27953,"I'll admit it, it's a little dated these days. But if you can look past it, the story is as good as ever and the writing has yet to be topped in both the pre-sequel and BL 3. You can try your hand at the community patch to solve some end game grinding and balance issues if you dare. 
My only dislike is lack of being able to modify the sensitivity when scoped and the scoped fov of weapons like smg's and pistols (for snipers its understandable it keep it as is since its a multiplier based zoom and not all that necessary)."
27954,Nice experience with the family ! Everyone on my side's a big fan. :)
27955,One of the best games I've played with my friends. There is never a moment while playing this game without laughter.
27956,e
27957,"I love this game although it has it's flaws. I played more than 200 h. 

pros
- intersting characters
- reappearence of characters of the first bl
- nice humor
- many weapons with different abilities
- interesting villains
- interesting main villain 
- fun dlc
- unique playable characters
- unique, comic-ish graphic
- map diversity

neutral
- music is pleasant but nothing new
- holy shit some mobs are super annoying but thats part of the game and its good but holy shit its so annoying

cons
- side missions are basically the same (get this, do this)
- arena
- (im not a multiplayer friend but i guess people will like it ) -> cant finish dlc mission by myself
- some achievements cant be done due to the thing thats needed being random"
27958,good game
27959,So fun with friends and alone a bit of a grind but its your choice if you want to do it you can complete the story without grinding that much . Honestly well spent money and fun times .

27970,"[h1] Borderlands 2 is a fun multiplayer game. [/h1]
Though the humour might not be to everyone's taste I still think the simple gameplay mechanics fit everyone. It doesn't take long to learn how to play so I definitely recommend it to those who wants to play with their siblings who might not play as much."
27971,"Game i fun! but u will get bored about in 1,5 hours"
27972,"I'm not really a fan of FPS games.

But as they say, there are always exceptions.

WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. Infinite replay value, especially with co-op buddies."

27984,fun during pandemic time
27985,"I had a severe problem with eating small rodents and other vermin, mice, rats, chipmunks, you name it I ate it. It was such a visceral feeling of tearing off their little heads and drinking their blood. But after borderlands 2, I can limit the rodent eating to 1-2 times every other week. 10/10, would recommend."
27986,"Your Nuts if you think BD2 is boring 
"
27987,"I bought it one time it was on disscount, with all the dlcs with 0 expectations. 175 hours later into the game, it's one of my favourites, and will forever be.

TL;DR .- Stop reading this and buy it."

Dialogues in game are brilliant and hilarious. Lots of non-sense events (in a good way). Various enemies, boss fights, maps, playable characters are available. DLC are all good in general, some are even outstanding i.e. Tiny Tina's one.

I got the handsome collection in a really good deal. Don't miss it when it's on offer!"

challenging sometimes for beginners

28007,is fun Y E S
28008,"Just play this game already. It's 8 years old and still holds up as one of the best games to come out in this millennium. 
If you like: 
-Loot
-Guns
-One liners
Then please buy this game and play it

Also: get the GOT edition. The DLC is FANTASTIC"
28009,"Borderlands 2 is one of those games that you have to keep as it is a classic, its fun, its familliar and i always come back to this as something to just play when i get bored!"
28010,"very gud game however my mother not allow as it involves shooting :(

28011,it is very good game if you are into single player games

28014,yes
28015,IN THE FACE!
28016,i've played this on ps4 and i had a great time! l
28017,"Extremely good game. The plot is the star of the whole game. It's simple and straightforward yet intriguing and hilarious. The plot enabled that game to have a lot replay value as u won't be bored playing the same thing over and over again. It also has A LOT of weapon for u to choose, facilitating every playstyle. All in all, it's one of the best FPS I have ever played. It definitely worth your money to buy the game since you be spending hundreds of hours in this game before getting bored."
28018,ee
28019,"It's a great game, but I'm giving it a bad review because of how STEAM is poorly handling the many issues I have trying to run this 8yo game.

It's very very buggy. Even if I ALT-TAB and try to come back, the game will hang with a white screen. I have to reset the game every single time this happens. 
Also, if I modify the Physx quality effects, the game will hang again, just when the map loads.

Maybe have your team look into this game a bit more?"
28020,Highly recommend this game.I  have been playing it for years its one of my favourate games of all time.
28021,"Make sure you have a Siren in your party if you wanna survive big bad bosses who are thicc af. 
Not an immersive story line but I love the gunfights and graphics."
28022,would fuck siren
28023,"I like the game but multiplayer on steam...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash...crash

28048,"I dont think much needs to be said here. One of the best looter-shooter games Ive ever played, if not the best. Most Borderlands players can confirm that this is the best installation of the series and I have played this game multiple times over without ever getting bored. Story is amazing, handsome Jack is one of the best videogame villains of all time, and the art style is one of my favorites. Although the character models can be a little wack at times (who can blame them, this game came out in 2012), it doesnt hurt the game or art style at all."
28049,"Excellent writing- great sense of humor, interesting characters. A little repetitive. Visually amazing. Really fabulous soundtrack. Very good multi-player interface. 9 of 10, have gone back to replay several times."

"
28059,"Recent update of March 2020 has broken the game. It added nothing notable except a lot of very intrusive advertising for Borderlands 3, as well as apparently trying to force you to sign up for yet another unnecessary online service to even play.

Worse than that, it has made crossplay between Mac and Linux stop working. I only play the game with a Mac user and in order to assault me with advertising for their far worse sequel, they’ve made this game literally unplayable in coop. There is no option to revert to the previous version offered in Steam either, as some titles do when they introduce things like 64bit support.

It’s been many months now and no change in sight. They haven’t yet added their extra layers of pointless hoop jumping crap to the Mac version so the only thing to do is a workaround where you download the files from an external site and revert it manually. But then Steam constantly tries to ‘update’ it and break your game again.

Honestly, it’s a decent game, kind of repetitive, but I can’t recommend it in its current form. You made a bad sequel, Gearbox, and punishing those playing your previous good title isn’t exactly making me want to try Borderlands 3 any more than I already didn’t.

Wait til it’s either fixed, or on GOG, or something if you really want to play it. Personally I’m ready to just move on to a better game rather than put up with this nonsense,"
28060,It is fun... and that is all I want in a game.
28061,"Great game offline or with friends, I strongly recommend this game to anyone."
28062,I don't often play shooting games and I've played this twice. Really fun!
28063,ye
28064,EXPLOSIVE!
28065,good
28066,"You shoot things.

10/10, would play again."
28067,"Solid Game Worth every penny
"
28068,"Better than BL3 but still not as good as the pre-sequel. Just kidding, the pre-sequel is shit."
28069,I always loved this game i played it on the ps3 and ps4 it always was a great time.
28070,yes
28071,"353 hours in and I'm starting a new playthrough just to do it all again, 10/10"

Infinite Replayability
Fun and Different Playstyles
Only downside is Ultimate Vault Hunter's Balance
One of my all time favorite games."
28076,"very nice game
"
28077,the game is great fun and it has lots of stuff to do especially if you have all the dlc
28078,"its borderlands, you know why its good"
28079,"Great game, highly recommended. Its better with friends but you dont need any to have fun"
28080,"yes
"
28081,"good game
"
28082,Nice
28083,could not recommend enough
28084,"Borderlands 2 remains to be one of my absolute favourite games ever! It has the right balance of humour, fun and serious situations, also Tiny Tina! If you haven't played this yet then you must! Everything about it is amazing. It has many hours of game play in the base game plus side missions. Add the DLC on top plus the difficulty levels and you have a game that you can play over and over!"
28085,Loot Shooter. Boring af.

28087,Great game

28092,What... you are telling me you still have not played this game? Get it now!
28093,CORROSION!
28094,"why people say claptrap is annoying? theres nothing annoying about him. he is wise, he is smart, he is cool. tell crazy hacker ai lady i said hi"
28095,Best MMO RPG I have ever played
28096,best game i ever played
28097,A classic game of loot and shoot.  The storyline and character options are improved over Borderlands 1.
28098,Lots of fun and fairly easy for none hardcore fps players
28099,been playing this game since 2013 on my Xbox 360 where i did 100% with every character. great game
28100,Better than I expected
28101,haha gun goes brrrr
28102,"game good, there you happy stream?
"
28103,Amazing FPS gameplay and crazy guns
28104,"A really good sense of worldbuilding and visual flair, but the gameplay sucks for solo play. The guns are definitely the highlight."
28105,Favourite co op game on steam.
28106,"the primary cheat bDemiGod Mode is in the ini file for this game BUT DOES NOT WORK..
I contacted 2K but they game me the run around.. in the end do update as of yet to fix this issue...
i.e. I die way too often in this game.. making it near un-playable..."
28107,Good Game.
28108,pog champ
28109,"2020 patch update includes thought police ToS and BL3 advertisements blocking the interactive homescreen. Thanks for reverting to max settings and crashing my computer because you wanted to ad a ""buy BL3"" menu button you fucking bastards"
28110,yes
28111,"Not a fan at first (thx clap trap)but then the story became more and more interesting with a lot of difficult moments that made me come back to the game, Totally worth it!"
28112,"For me it has been crazy, insane, fun"
28113,"Interesting game with wacky characters. For a FPS, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would!"
28114,is nice
28115,"I love Borderlands 2 but this is stupid, forcing ads for Borderlands 3 a game that has been out for a fair length of time and people are well aware is out is pointless. Since the update my game now no longer runs, this is stupid I bought a game several years ago thinking I'd paid for it and it would work, it now receives pointless updates that make it unusable. I would steer clear from 2K and Gearbox at this rate and would make a habit of not supporting them."
28116,"Super entertaining storyline and characters! An endless array of guns/shields/loot to hunt for while engaging in well designed combat. Absolutely hilarious at times, infinitely replayable."
28117,"epic

28118,"boring, dollar store destiny"

28124,One of the best rpg shooting games around.. I've been playing this game since xbox 360.
28125,Explosions and guns! 'Nuff said!
28126,I love this game so much it is probably the best Borderlands game in the series. It has my favorite vault hunters and favorite villain Handsome Jack. This game also has the best story of all the Borderlands games. The whole Borderlands series are amazing games.
28127,if you don't own this what are you doing with your life? wait for a sale and get the handsome collection for $6 or $7 so you get the whole game because the dlc is a little expensive on its own.
28128,People in this game are flipin nuts
28129,Very fun
28130,"great story, amazing guns, a lot of playable characters each with countless ways to play them, and good mod support for those who have played the main game enough and are asking for more!"
28131,love it
28132,Fun
28133,yes
28134,Epic win!
28135,Last patch added borderlands 3 ads to the game. They ruined my game experience.
28136,veri gud
28137,"Bad writing, can't turn mouse sensitivity below 10 without hex editing. What a terrible idea that was, and it's still an issue so many years on from the original release date. Getting people to buy DLC and recolours were more important, clearly."
28138,Imagine paying for this before it became free 4head
28139,"Used to be fantastic. Ever since the SHIFT code update got introduced I am not able to launch the game or play with my friends. It crashes every time I launch. Before this, I was able to play. I feel like maybe a DRM is responsible for this, but I could be wrong. Also, I do not like the advertising of the epic store on the main menu. I won't buy from their store.  If there is a way to revert this newest update, that would be great."
28140,Crashes constantly without saving. Very annoying
28141,"A great game. Only one thing I can think of that might be better, the next Borderlands game."
28142,"Great fun single player or online co-op, good characters and storylines"
28143,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
28144,this game is so fun to grind loot yes epic
28145,Very good shooty gun game
28146,"A game using cartoon graphics is not acceptable in this day and age very lazy if you ask me.Overall was boring dont like the overall system, gameplay etc."
28147,pretty high grsphics and good gameplay
28148,why is borderlands 2 giving me updates about the epic store? i am on steam id like to see updates about games on steam not on a platform owned by the CCP
28149,"very fun game i shoot stuff and it shoot back

28163,"One of my favorite games I own, I've bought this game 3 different times on 3 different platforms and I enjoy it each time. The gameplay is a bit dated, but still fun. The story is really fun and well written (which I wish I could say about the later games), and the overall experience is very worth it."
28164,It's ok I guess
28165,one of the best games i have ever played.  so much content.  there is still things i haven't completed.
28166,"awesome
"
28167,"After playing the absolute crap out of Borderlands 1 and its DLCs, I did the same with BL2, which expanded and improved on the formula. Get it"
28168,Amazing and timeless game that makes singleplayer stay relevant.
28169,"Good game, lots to do!"
28170,"Although at first glance I thought this game was absolute trash and found it quite boring, it turned out to be very fun to play, online being even better. So, if you are like me and find the beginning hour total trash, I encourage you to play until you go out of the icy region to experience the true game and enjoy lots of bullets and the ass-fingering screaming game style."
28171,"This game has awesome and unique graphics, simple gameplay, humor and a great story line."
28172," Great story telling! Lots of humour. Compelling characters. 

Ridiculously hard to beat at higher difficulty levels."
28173,ok

28183,kmh
28184,"Good fun game, even to today's standards, and works good for some lower end computers. Kinda wish all games were this wacky and fun while being less taxing to lower end computers, and equally rewarding to high ended ones..."
28185,"Really good game, The character's are fun, the story is interesting that when i do side quests i want to do main. Really worth buying if you haven't already :)"
28186,Really Good!

play mortals"
28207,"too much to say about how amazing this game is, if my friend never introduced me to this game, i dunno what i would do."
28208,"For what it is Borderlands to is a fairly decent shoot and loot game. The action sequencing can get repetitive so, if games with mechanics you have to utilize consistently are not your thing, than this may not be the game for you.

The only demerits I consider for the game
- Repetitive dialogue
- Repetitive game mechanic (Bit cumbersome but I'm used to it)
- The lack of originality with boss or even named enemies
- Only slightly re-skinning characters for use in DLC content rather then new models."
28209,Its fun
28210,"sucks

28215,"I've played every borderlands game through the third installment each getting better and better. However, borderlands 2's story line and extras make it fantastic. The borderlands has been my favorite video game series for a very long time."

28227,"I have 30+ hours on my old account. With these 13 hours, I can clearly say that this game is the shit. I love Borderlands, and if you're a fan of good fps and story games, you should love this game too. Also the DLC and mods are awesome!"
28228,Fun and rather exciting.
28229,is gud game 13/10
28230,Lots of mission that will make you smile. Lots of enemies that are unique in how to kill them.
28231,"Def recommend. Quite fun with friends, and a lot of replayability. It's also one of the few games where I remember each area distinctly, mainly because of how many times I've died there. Be warned tho, the multiplayer with friends can get quite laggy."
28232,gg
28233,I have beaten the game twice and it's still really fun! All the people are fun to play as and it has great sales I got the game and all the dlc for this and the pre-sequel for five bucks! It makes a great gift and easy to learn.
28234,It good.
28235,this game is so pp
28236,Best
28237,great game great graphics tons of fun still playing
28238,good game
28239,Good story line and side guest.  Mods such as Borderlands reborn make the game very interesting.
28240,"Repetitive subtraction simulator as you shoot your geek gun at geek cartoons and are rewarded with geek red text popping up beside them.  On the other hand it was ambitious to attempt a triple AAA title with so little imagination, innovation, or creativity on the team."
28241,it good
28242,its fun for friends and its also a solo game
28243,it gud
28244,"is gud

28246,S
28247,"GUNS GUNS GUNS AND MORE FUCKING GUNS!!!!

half of this game's charm is it cel-shaded look and pseudo frat boy toilet humor, but the rest? the gameplay and the universe of customization specs and various gun models and their abilities and stat effects. it's been nearly a decade since i picked this up and i still love it."
28248,Greatest game of all time
28249,"Very much enjoy the game! The UI is rather outdated but then again this game is getting to be fairly old. I find the graphics still look fine. Gameplay is lots of fun even if some mechanics can feel a bit clunky compared to much more modern games. I've haven't played many shooters, but the ones I do play are generally looter shooters or story heavy stuff. I find that this actually blends the two quite nicely and being able to play with friends is awesome! Definitely recommend this if you're looking for a fun looter shooter that's not too demanding for your computer or if you played Borderlands 3 as your first Borderlands game (like me) and you wanna catch up on the story and the universe!"
28250,it good
28251,"its a really fun game i reccomend to people willing to play this game for fun
"
28252,You. Will. Die. (Seriously.)
28253,"Do you like guns? Do you like explosions? Do you like good story, well written dialogue, villain focused narratives? Do you like epilepsy? 

If the answer was yes to even half of them, then buy this game and by GOD BUY THE TINY TINA DLC YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
28254,i loooooooove this game it's the best one!!!
28255,sick game
28256,you should play this game so you can know the pain of getting a good drop only to have it fall behind in levels
28257,"Update just added advertisement for the EPIC-gamesstore and BL3... 
Get that epic crap out of my game"
28258,"awesome, hours of fun"
28259,I love borderlands
28260,such good game
28261,"Looting and Shooting, and Dying. Laughing and Winning, and Crying. This game is good, that is all."
28262,yes
28263,"Yes, if your even the a tiny bit interested, play this game!"
28264,Among the best and most replay-able games of the last decade.
28265,"Well borderlands 2 is a fantastic game, but i stress with the release of new DLC Commander Lilith & The Fight for Sanctuary, some of the games content is locked that many players were able to access prior to the release. For a company to release a DLC that locks content which was paid for is an outright piss take and i would not recommend purchising this game until the DLC is made free like it was originally released. Such a shame Gearbox done this to such a great game in an attempt to boost Borderlands 3 sales and squeeze money out of an 8yr old game. #sigh..."
28266,great gam
28267,This game is still great after all these years
28268,"Amazing game! Didn't expect to get so hooked on an FPS game! The game design, storyline, and overall experience is just mind-blowing :) Keep it up creators!"

10/10"
28288,Lots'a bamboozle 10/10
28289,I play this game with my brother.  I really like the team player aspect of the game and how we can help each other and work on the missions together.  There is much tongue and cheek humor in this game as there was in the 1st one.  I'm really enjoying the game play and I feel that this game is a little bit smoother to play as well.
28290,Good shit
28291,shoot boss good give op gun. op gun goooood

28293,Hours of fun

28298,good stuff
28299,"I am about to play this through for the XXth time. This is my number 2 fav game of all time. Buy it, you wont regret it."
28300,Best Borderland game period. The DLC make this game even better and are enjoyable to play.
28301,"Have to say, the BL2 is a best FPS I ever play. The hundreds of weapons can let u feel surprise all the time, especially when u find a legendary weapon or mods in a chest. And because it is so easy to learn, so any of your friend can play with u, if none of them buy it, just go to public game or discord group to find someone hang out."
28302,PENI S GANG!!!!!!
28303,Verry fun game with lots of content and more importantly LOOT!!!!!
28304,get guns and if they dont work get more gun game good
28305,"Just a solid game overall and perfect for playing with friends, family or your partner. Been playing this game with my wife and she's never played any Borderlands game before but I think we'll be diving into all the others ones now since we both really like the game."
28306,YES
28307,e
28308,"It's very fun, the start is slow but it scales well. 9/10"
28309,well its borderlands what else to say
28310,BAD ASS game
28311,"Yes
"
28312,everything
28313,Just a dang good shooter.  Tons of fun.
28314,I really like its is a fantastic game
28315,"Really hard to imagine anything more uninspired and dull. All you have to do is some very primitive and repetitive stuff in utterly empty locations with no level design. Quests do not withstand any criticism, shooting mechanics are also very poor, millions of weapons dont make any sense in terms of gameplay. Are unfunny jokes and cheap-looking cel-shaded graphics the reasons it is so popular?"
28316,"Really fun game play, great for one play and four players. My friends and I play this for hours on end. Doing old school LAN parties and it is great for times we can't hang out as well."
28317,Awesome game. Very fun. Graphics aren't the best.

28320,"Hands down, this is the best Borderlands (Borderlands 3 is the latest as I write this).  All the good things from part 1, plus better missions, better weapons, better quests... story is awesome.

Mr. Torgue is the best thing to happen to this game.  If you only pick up one expansion, get that one."
28321,fucking awesome
28322,"This game hasn't aged well, if you are new to the series and haven't played this game I wouldn't fully recommend, Play it with friends"
28323,good game with no demanding graphic!
28324,It's a good game

28332,"beğendiğim yönleri 
görevlerin birbirlerini tekrar etmemesi.
silah çeşitliliği olması.
görevlerin hiç biri sıkmıyor buda bir artı bence 
karakterinizi paralı dlc ler yerine oyunda bulduğunuz ücretsiz şeyler bir artı 
beğenmediğim şeyler 
araba sürüşünün kötü olması"
28333,Best game ever!!!!!!

28338,yeah its alright
28339,almost as cool as me
28340,"Buy this if you like playing a fun, co op FPS, that has tons of unique guns, looks well, feels well. The gunplay is good, the customization is badass, the story and sidequests are wacky and fun. Why not

Also, randy pitchford is a lying little eunuch that should be obliterated
F**k 2K too
F**k Epic"
28341,Want to learn Lots of Slang Words..this game is for you.
28342,"a story:

the second year we were dating my partner got me this game for valentines day. he said, maybe, i could give it a go and see if I liked it. You know. I might be keen on it. It had some neat characters and I did like shooters. 

.....

700+ hours later, he's never actually ever going to be able to get me a better day gift ever and he knows it."
28343,Yes
28344,"Honestly out of every game iv ever played this is a top 3 games of all time for me , I played when it first came out and now i STILL play this game to this day . The amount of DLC and amazing story / free open world is amazing , never fails to make me interested and i cant wait to play borderlands 4 comes out . Would recommend to anyone who loves open world and getting da loot , def worth the low price they put it at on steam"

28347,"Highly recommended game, but definitely not for all ages. Very unique art style and gameplay. Story is excellent and there are a plethora of side quests to do, as well as skins/guns/variants for you to be able to acquire."
28348,HIIIIIII
28349,Good.
28350,Borderlands 2 is an awesome game you should definetly play. The story is amazing and you'll love the characters. The game itself is fun and hard at times but it's more than enjoyable
28351,"One of the best games I have played to date. The game play is incredibly well done, each class is well thought out and unique, each bringing something new to the team. The bosses are fun to fight (although difficult in many cases) and drop amazing loot. The playable DLC's are very well done and add hours of gameplay and lots of fun new loot to snag. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, comedic, story-based, loot-filled, and lengthy game that has incredible replay-ability."
28352,Good game
28353,"I love the multiplayer on this game, seriously amazing. Def should play this with your friends!"

28358,i like it
28359,"Buy GOTY, downgrade it to Version 1.8.5 (Make your friends do it too to play together) to avoid the mandatory broken SHiFT ""matchmaking"" and just have a damn good time with plenty of laughs and fun moments.





Also suck a fart outta my behind Randy and Tim Sweeney."
28360,"Really fun and difficult, the best way is to play it, is with 4 players xd"
28361,the next best thing to fallout!
28362,i have been been missing out on a great franchise
28363,"IF you like literally any of the Borderlands games, you'll like this one too. If you think the trailers are funny for any of the games, you'll probably think the game is funny too. ETC.

Until recently I thought I didn't like the Borderlands games. I played with a few friends throughout the years and it was always a bad experience. Then one day I turned off multiplayer and started the game at my own pace. I played it my way, and took my time about it. I realized that I didn't hate borderlands at all. It's a great series, with an entertaining story. I just hated being rushed here and there or pushed to do this and that instead of just doing my thing a while.

Before jumping into this series, turn off your wifi and play single player a while. Discover the game yourself instead of being thrown into a group and expected to already know everything. I learned more offline than I ever learned in multiplayer, and I enjoyed it much more as well. No offense to my friends, but I am not into multiplayer just yet. 

If you're looking at the games and wondering where to start, don't wonder... Just get whichever one and it'll be fine. Or get all of them and do them in order. It won't matter, because it'll be fun as long as you do it your way."
28364,One of the best FPS game I've ever played.
28365,"Good story, funny characters and great jokes"
28366,It's such a fun and funny game. Would get your mind off of things if you're having personal problems. GGs gearbox.

28395,"Even after so many years, this game is still fun to play now and then. So far my favorite part of the entire franchise. And even more fun with friends, as it's also one of the few good coop multiplayer games out there."

28397,yes.

28399,gud game. but gets boring.
28400,fun game ! worth ur money !
28401,too many bullet sponges
28402,"What sets this above a mindless First Person Shooter is the continuing storyline between game releases.  Each character has a history revealed as the quest develops.  Humour  and cultural references treat the player as a thinking person.  Shakespeare and Haiku among the Dystopians.  Problem-solving to advance demands thought.  

Of course the effects improve too. among Bdrl1, Brdr2, and BrdrPreSequel , but keeping ties back to previous games is smart."
28403,very epic would reccoment

28418,"Incredibly fun fps game with beautiful graphics and many hours of gameplay. The story is long and decent but the side missions and dlcs are even better. I recommend playing with friends. When you complete the game you can start 2 other modes that makes the game harder but lets you level up further. I really enjoyed borderlands 2 its worth trying out if you like fps or shooter games. Amazing game with interesting characters, action, humour and plenty of customization. I highly recommend it. My favourite dlc is Tiny Tina's attack on dragon keep, it has to be one of the best dlcs ever made. 9/10"
28419,Great game. One of the best games to bring friends.
28420,"Good story, fun gameplay, and really great dialogue between most of the NPCs in this game. Especially fun with friends."
28421,"Guns, Shooting, Psycho, Jack, Rainbows?

Ye that's sums it for Borderlands 2

Intended for playing with friends. Fun = 2*(number of friends)

One of Craziest and Funniest Villain i ever killed.
9/10 would shot Face McShooty to face again. Glad i find this game and spent many ours playing it"
28422,Nice
28423,Great story both in the base game and in pretty much all the dlc areas. Great gameplay with plenty of options to use. Only downside is the games scaling can get a bit high fast once you get into Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.
28424,"k
"
28425,this game is simply FUKIN EPIC!!!
28426,Is a lot of fun to play with another person. Is an interesting game and the graphics are pretty cool. Following the map to get around in order to complete missions can be confusing and it is fairly easy to go the wrong way and get lost.
28427,"I actually got turn off by the game when I started it for the first time. In the start menu, there's a huge ads banner on top of the screen promoting Borderlands 3. I bought the game and haven't even started playing, and the developer is telling me to get the next series.

This game seems like a combination of FPS and RPG, but I think both of those elements are not very good in this game. From FPS viewpoint, the weapon accuracy seems inconsistent. I started the game with good accuracy, but after a certain point, my accuracy seems to drop significantly. Even at level 20 (max lvl is 50 without DLC), and with weapon accuracy of 90+, my shot still miss the center of the crosshair most of the time. As my level get higher, the newly acquired weapon seems to sway more when I shoot.

I dislike some of the RPG elements as well. Character skills seem pretty boring. A lot of the skills are just passive skills that cause higher damage, better accuracy, faster weapon swapping/reloading. I'm pretty sure some enemies on the map level up as your character level up. I hate this kind of game mechanic, because it sometimes cause certain missions to be much harder to complete once you level up too much.

There are stuffs that I like from the game. I like the graphics, the music is good, the story is pretty good, there are some funny moments although sometimes it seems like they try too hard to be funny.

I am giving this a negative review because the game seems repetitive. Lots of enemies have the same attack/dodging pattern. The map looks boring after a while cause they look similar to one another. There are a lot of side missions, but I don't think it matters if I don't feel like doing it. I'm bored of the game halfway through, and just do the story mission to see the ending."

28438,"My unbiased verdict of this game is that it is fun to play & very immersive.  I play for short bits at a time as I can't really afford to sit & binge or marathon through the entire gameplay (I'm a bread winner).  This is my second playthrough of the game - the 1st was in 2015.  I highly recommended buying & playing this game i.e. quality graphics , great storyline & script, voice acting, etc.  It'll keep you busy and interested to progress in the game.  No major bugs, after all this time one's expectation is that the game will almost be bug-free - which it basically is.  I picked this up on sale which made it well worth it too.
I'll probably get B3 seeing that I've played all of the titles thus far.  Toodles!"
28439,"Obviously not the prettiest graphics wise, but still packs in a lot of fun from 2012"
28440,Nice
28441,A must buy.
28442,it's like pew pew but like pewing with pews
28443,Used to be a good game till cross play and advertising just totally broke multiplayer. Can't play with anyone else anymore.
28444,Great Game
28445,"This, in my opinion, is the greatest Looter/Shooter game of all time and it's not even close.  There are so many different aspects of this game that make it a personal favorite.  The guns are insane, the characters are memorable, the humor and atmosphere is one of a kind, and the gameplay is very satisfactory and replayable.  I have put way too many hours on this game.  This game is suited for casual gamers or gamers who want a game to grind and replay over and over to reach the highest levels.  I highly recommend this game even if you don't like first person shooters all the much, and pretty would recommend it to anyone who would listen to me for more than 5 minutes without me scaring them away with my raving about this game.  5/5"
28446,Fun loot and shoot action. Much better with friends.

28457,"The humor, the writing, the characters, and overall design of the game. This took everything I loved about the first game and added EXPLOSIONS!  Sorry, my inner Mr. Torgue came through . If you're looking at this and at Borderlands 3, play this. BL3 is a *hit show that I can't recommend, so stick wth 1 or 2."

28470,"DON'T BUY TILL THEY FIX ONLINE YOUR GAME WILL CRASH EVEN IN OFFLINE IF NOT CONNECTED AND WILL NOT SAVE THEN AND YOU'LL LOSE HOWEVER MANY HOURS OF PROGRESS

I played this game back during 2012 when it first launched it worked back then in multiplayer it would actually be a game to play back during the Xbox 360 days I remember the friends I made the good times i had the we had laughs but now anymore I don't even want to touch the series everyday I tried desperately the trying to connect to a friend to do something with the same may be old but i'm not made of money either one of the few games we can both play and it's just made our relationship worse every time from the frustration trying to get it to run and before all this update everything was running smoothly that's getting used to never have a problem I really don't want to give it a negative review but 90% of my time is me desperately trying to connect versus actually playing the game and I vowed to this day I will never buy another gearbox game till this is fixed for this shows this company only cares about greens and not actually anything"
28471,IT SUCKS
28472,cool bro
28473,F****** EXPLOSIONS
28474,I've played about 130 hours of this game and it still brings me joy. Highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to burn off some steam by shooting guys in the head while listening to a maniac complain about how much these pretzels suck. 10/10
28475,;
28476,Man these pretzels suck
28477,"Now that it's out on epic for free I decided to review it for my steam account as I already did for the pre sequel.
This game is amazing, it has an insane amount of content if you get the GOTY edition, good sense of humour, the best villain i've ever seen in a videogame and has a lot of replay value since the story never gets old.
In the later modes the game can be grindy and the gunplay isn't the best but it's still a must play for FPS lovers."
28478,quality
28479,So much fun after several years of release.
28480,Best looter shooter on here
28481,yesth it is a lovely game
28482,"Utter garbage. Enemies are just bullet sponge tanks and the game gives you zero ammo so you're just stuck in a cycle of dying and respawning to get more ammo and whittle down the health of enemies. Online co-op sucks, laggy as hell and continuous disconnecting. Not to mention recoil on guns is godawful"
28483,E
28484,"Sort of fun with friends, but its just a dopamine drip, really. 

Gunplay is ok, weapon accuracy is generally quite low, putting a premium on rate of fire for non-sniper weapons. Unfortunately you'll then spend 60% of your time reloading while running around trying not to get shot.

Gun variety is actually really good, though, so you'll likely find something you enjoy to come degree. I stuck with the starting gun for my first 3 hours, then found a rifle with explosive ammo.

Only tried one character class, the Siren. Expected more from the upgrades; you only seem to get one active special skill, and all the upgrades are slight tweaks to it, or boring passive upgrades to critical hit change/reload speed/badger affinity or whatever. Missed a trick, really.

Voice acting is good, but the writing is obnoxious for the most part. I found Sir Hammerlock pretty funny, the others were infuriating.

Get it if its on sale for less than £6 and your mates have it. Otherwise, naah."
28485,I have 200+ hours on the xbox 360 edition 10/10 game to play with friends or solo
28486,Best of the Franchise!

28493,nah
28494,great game
28495,"Got this game some time ago but only finished the story a few days ago. I'm playing a second walkthrough, now in TVH. This game is amazing.  A downside would be the saving system (it sucks). Other than that, this is a unique first person shooter."
28496,Just go check youtube if you think this game is bad and it will prove its not
28497,"Even with the new Borderlands out, the second installment (which still holds up graphically) is still able to dish out hours of amazing gameplay with plenty of content that will keep you and your friends hooked for hours. Not to mention the different ways you can customize each characters will encourage replayability. All in all, one of my favourites.."
28498,"The gameplay is shіt, the worlds are lifeless, the guns are nice in concept, but every enemy is a bullet sponge, so none of them end up particularly useful or fun to use, the characters are boring, the writing is shіt, the humor is cringe, claptrap is fuсkіng annoying, and Randy is a goddamn faggоt.

28504,"Is actually a really good game, dont under estimate it"
28505,"Probably the best Borderlands. In my opinion, spent way more time in this than 1,pre or 3"
28506,"Note that the game does not reward game skill, how quick you can aim, game sence, positioning. Due to 95% of the weapons being inaccurate as hell the game does not reward players for being good at games which is a serious downside, but if you are not fantastic at FPS games and enjoy working out what build you want to use then it can be very fun and addictive."
28507,yes
28508,"This was one of the lonliest feeling games I ever played. Even with other people it wasn't fun.

The way the loot, combat and upgrades work are all bad, imo. I didn't care about any of the story or people in the game.

Its not a bad game just because I don't like it, but I wouldn't even want it if I got it free (now that I know). I'm forgetting this series completely."
28509,yes
28510,boring
28511,gud
28512,"Great game that has a ton of weapons to choose from, can spend countless hours doing side missions with friends, never gets repetitive, becomes challenging and all in all is a timeless game that holds up very well for 8 years old. A must play."

"
28529,Now free on EPIC games store
28530,I never got bored of it and there is soooo much content
28531,"Oh, man. After playing the almost complete dud of a game that was the original Borderlands last month and feeling that belt sanding my moles and freckles off would have been a more entertaining alternative, I’m happy to report that Borderlands 2 addressed nearly every issue I had with its predecessor and increased the quality by at least 1,000%. Dude – this one was actually fun! I can’t believe it!

Well, actually, yes I can. This series has turned into a multimedia franchise and that couldn’t have been based on the liquid fart that was the first game. One of them had to be good for that to happen, right? I’m just glad the series has already improved this much in just one game.

Just about every complaint I had about the first installment of the series was addressed in this game. The glitchy, frustrating driving segments that made my blood pressure spike in the first game are actually fun this time around, despite the only obvious changes being a new vehicle, more enemy variety, and, most importantly, some much needed polish. Speaking of enemy variety – this game has that! Where the first game shoved so many skags down my throat that I wanted to vomit, skags are actually pretty scarce in the second game and replaces them with bugs, robots, sandworms, soldiers, six-armed apes, etc. Plus, each of these enemies require different tactics to beat them. And, while I’m on the subject of variety, the environment isn’t just a bunch of trash deserts anymore! There are so many types of environments in this game that no theme is repeated more than a couple of times. In fact, some of them are kind of unique. I don’t know I’ve ever explored an acid swamp factory in a game before…

In fact, this game even improves the first game by fleshing out my favorite part of the original Borderlands: its enticing, though severely minimal, story. Without going into too many spoilers, it turns out that what seemed like an innocent treasure hunt in the first game was actually orchestrated by a sociopathic power-hungry narcissist and the players actions actually led to the devastation of the planet that can be seen in Borderlands 2. On top of that, the main characters from the first game return, this time with actual personalities that make them interesting.

Basically, this is a sequel that is so good that it made the original better.

It’s not a perfect game, even though I’m making it sound like it is. I wish I had gotten to know the villain better throughout the game than I did. I think he could have ended up being one of my favorite villains of all time if the writers had just fleshed him out a bit more. I also had the feeling while I was playing that it was taking a really long time to finish the game – and then I did the math and realized beating Borderlands 2 took roughly three times as long as it took to beat Borderlands 1. I don’t know whether to attribute that to bloat or my own expectations for the length based on the first game, but it did affect my experience, either way.

Still, if you’re at all interested in this series, you need to play this one. Actually, you should just start the series with this one. Skip the first one and read a wiki or something to get up to speed on the story."

28563,"100% recommend one of best open world with story shooter but the game is so hard you cant play is simply like anyother games and you can't ignore the side missions you have to play in order to get the level and defect the thugs, the last two to three levels took like 2 and more hours which, at some point i used some of the game glitchs like hididng somewhere forever and getting the kills. and now after playing something i got 45 skill points, i dont know how the skill points didnot spend while i was using it so that saved me in the last levels i was COMANDO."

28578,"I got it on ps3 when it first came out. I many years later when i became a pc gamer got the handsome edition for 10 euro. I really love this game. Its is a great combination between RPG looting and FPS shooting. The story is really fun and still cracks me up today. It was sad to see the humor got dumbed down in later games because it was a big part of what made the story fun. This game has one of the best villains in gaming. Handsome Jack is there with you from the beginning and even though he tries to kill you, i just can't hate him because his dialogue is so funny. If you are a gamer that doesn't care about the story or just want to oneshot bosses and loot all the legendaries this game is still for you. Together with all the dlc there are an extreme amount of bosses you can fight with your friends or solo if you want a challenge. The 4 main +2 dlc characters(yes my gamertag is a reference to borderlands) that you can play each have their own skill threes with their own playstyles, giving the game even more replayability. You get the options to keep upscaling the difficulty of the game each time you beat the story wich can delivere even more challenge. Hell i don't even enjoy the most difficult mode because it is too difficult. I don't play on overpowerd levels, but i know there are gamers out there that do enjoy that kind of difficulty. This game is great for people who like grinding, story with comedy, doing hard challenges, playing with friends. I recommend buying the game with the handsome edition for 10 bucks when its on sale (or download it on epic games today(28-5-2020) for free)."
28579,buy this
28580,"Borderlands 2 takes its predecessor's formula and makes it larger yet quite more boring.

+ This game has its unique ART STYLE which isn't really groundbreaking but still decent nonetheless. The diversity and colorfulness of this game is awesome! There are so many different cool-looking areas.
+ SOUNDTRACK is decent, there are some really good songs in certain areas in the game world. Voice acting is a bit immature and humour influenced but still alright.
+ PERFORMANCE was really good, I encountered just a few crashes and fps dropped rarely.

• STORYLINE isn't that interesting, I only remember certain memorable characters and events but mostly it's just boring and repetitive. Side quests don't really bring much more to the table, they are focused more on grinding than being interesting and fun. There were some great boss fights and encounters with characters but it kinda ends to that...
• LOOTING MECHANICS aren't that rewarding in this game compared to the first one. Most of the loot you find isn't useful so you just loot ammo. Overall the amount of unique and good weapons I found during the game was much smaller than BL1. Since the loot is just mostly useless, I rarely bothered to fight enemies but rather just run past them.
• LEVEL AND WORLD DESIGN in this game isn't that good compared to the first one. Some levels feel just so repetitive or linear and the open world is kind of empty. There are some secrets and enemy encounters but they didn't really make me that interested, rather bothered. The first BL had some of the same issues but BL2 hasn't taken action to improve them but rather made some aspects even worse.
• CHARACTER PROGRESSION wasn't implemented that well in this game compared to the first one. There were more unique abilities and skills ( which I enjoyed ) but most of them proved to be just not useful or unbalanced (sometimes I stopped using regular weapons as they did no damage compared to ability). BL1 offered overall more practical use for skill points as this game had many skills that didn't really matter at all in-game.
• COMBAT is pretty okay but not particularly rewarding since the loot isn't useful and most of the combat doesn't feel satisfying. Because of that I found myself just avoiding combat as it didn't offer value in neither loot nor fun.
• CO-OP brings much more fun to this game but there were just so many constant issues related to that ( ping problems, disconnects... ) Also the story progression wasn't saved to your character so you couldn't continue yourself the story you played with someone, even though your character had leveled up.

- This game sacrificed quality for quantity in my opinion compared to Borderlands. There are much more quests but they feel forced and repetitive so I didn't really bother doing too many of them if not required.
- This game features much more additional DLC content compared to the first game but again, it doesn't really feel that interesting even though I liked the look of the new areas. I liked the BL1's DLCs much better since they kept me interested to play for longer as BL2 DLCs were mostly running around and random and ""funny"" plot twists.
- LEVEL SCALING in this game is awful, some enemies are too easy because of level caps and some enemies are just too hard even after you progress. Also the weapons are level scaled horribly, you don't really find any good weapons since most of them have too low stats to be useful. I found that BL1 did much better in scaling the levels.
- GENERAL FEEL of this game is much more clunky and rought. Hitboxes, vehicle physics, player actions... all those feel much worse than in the first game.
- DIFFICULTY in this game is sometimes just awful.. Enemies are often either too easy ( low level cap ) or too hard because you can't find good weapons anywhere. Borderlands (1) was more unforgiving but I still enjoyed its difficulty more as it forced you to try which BL2 doesn't do. Dying in this game isn't that big of a deal so you just don't try anymore and hard enemies just feel more annoying rather than a fun challenge.
- QUESTS sometimes require much grinding and just running around which I didn't really enjoy that much compared to the first game. Some quests were too unclear so I couldn't continue for a while as there weren't much hints. In this game some quests are just so random and the story turns around a lot. I would enjoy this but the plot twists feel a bit forced and try to be too funny.
- There are BUGS, like seriously there are. Some are minor and some require you to restart or enter an area again. Getting stuck the objects and things not working as they should is pretty common.

This isn't a particularly bad game by any means but doesn't really meet my requirements to be a good and fun game to play for long as it only kept me interested for 20-25 h and after that just felt like a weight rather than fun.
Borderlands 2's best aspects are the good look of the game world and quite a nice soundtrack overall. There are some great moments story-wise but mostly I don't feel the story that good. However the aspects that I feel like should be the core of this game are a huge step down from the first game: looting, shooting, movement, quests... everything feels so clunky and scattered that it doesn't really please me compared to the first entry. I don't consider the flaws in this game to be huge but there are just too many bad design choices compared to the good so I didn't really enjoy playing this game in the end.
Even though I didn't like this game experience, you very well might! This game for sure has its audience who value grinding and just running around more than story and polished game mechanics.

I really would like to give this game a positive review but I can't as it didn't really please me in the core aspects other than the look. However I feel like I got so much content for the cheap price, that is really positive! I don't know if I can recommend this game but you should know there are some problems that make the game feel somewhat unpolished, boring and repetitive.

In conclusion you could buy this game and its DLC for a cheap price but you probably should consider if you'll like the game even with its problems.

[ Note: I compare BL2 to the Enhanced version of BL1 since I have played it. I recognize that the Enhanced is quite new and improved version of the game.]"

+The game features a much more engaging story than the previous one.
+Hundreds of different guns, shields, class mods, cosmetics, and grenades to loot.
+Fantastic replay value due to the characters and the builds that come with them.
+The DLCs are great and extends the life of the game more.
+Music is fine as fuck.
+Graphics are nice.
[h1] Negatives: [/h1]

-To some extent the comedy sometimes doesn't stick well.
-Loot can be taken from players in coop. (I don't really mind it but lots of people do)

28609,This Game is amazing.
28610,Borderlands 2 ! Such a perfect game. In fact it's too perfect and makes me expect too much about  pre sequel and B3 (Presequel disappointed me).
28611,"Had this game not been gifted to me by friends who wanted to play with me, 
this review would have been written a lot more angrily.

You see open world shooter rpgs are kind of like, my ideal game. It's why I love Destiny, Ghost Recon: Wildlands and so on.
But Borderlands, it's different, a good kind of different for people that like that different, but I am not ''people''.
If I remeber right, half if not more of the hype for this game is how many guns it has; and boy, won't you find out how many guns it has wether you want to or not. Let me simplify: The guns have levels, your character and the enemies also have levels. 2 of these things can level up, guess which ones can't. Exactly. Say you wanted to, you can't beat the whole game with only the first gun you get. You have to keep getting stronger guns that you may or may not like. ''Well with so many, I am bound to find guns I like.'', the opposite is true as well.
Imagine this scenario (and trust me, it will happen) - You go into an area and suddenly all your guns are underleveled. You could struggle with the weapons you like, or you can pick up that ''better'' one on the floor...
Except, it's a burst fire sniper rifle. Pick your poison. 
So now not only do you have to go through that area (o/r up untill you find a nicer gun) with one weapon, but that weapon has a small ammo reserve and it wastes most of whatever little amount of bullets you have for it. Fun.

Maybe I didn't go into this with the right kind of mindset, but I would sooner read a Borderlands book then play a Borderlands game again.
It has it's moments.
The story and writting are Nice!
When you are using guns you like, at the level they are meant to be used, you enjoy using them.
But that's about it for me."

tl;dr:
Uninstalling this from my computer because a patch killed multiplayer."
28624,i just love this game to much fun and it never gets boring.
28625,"terrible, gameplay is tedious at best, I die very quickly, even with the best shield offered, it requires luck to get second wind (self revival after getting a kill) as enemies quickly back away out of range when I get downed, and, out of curiosity, I started a new game, and there was no way to recover my previous game, that's what turned me away from this game, why the reviews are overwelmingly positive are beyond me, complete waste of a $20 steam card, 0.1/10"

28695,"Borderlands 2 has an enormous amount of content. Four characters are available, each with their own three distinct skill trees. Every gun you find is randomised, meaning every weapon has some marginal uniqueness. The game has a myriad of sidequests to complete, along with the fairly long main story.
If you buy all the DLC (more on them later), you get two more characters, a few new loot drops, and five new expansion campaigns with their own stories and sidequests.
Borderlands 2 is a big game. But is it a fun game? That depends.

The game is a standard fare looter-shooter. Run around in a big map, complete quests, find guns and occasionally venture into a main story dungeon to advance the plot. The game provides you with plenty of bad men to murder with no moral consequence. The gunplay, while simplistic by today's standards, is saved somewhat by the characters - each character has their own unique active ability to help them in combat, and while they vary in polish, they do make combat stick out a little more. The randomised guns, while extremely superficial, do mean that you're never sure of what you'll get in a chest, making each run a little more interesting. The sidequests often feel like mindless busywork, just more content to chug through to level up to the threshold for the next story mission. The combat arenas are serviceable, offering you both interesting things to look at and plenty of ways to get stuck on the environment decals.

The game's visuals have aged, but style always trumps fidelity, and BL2 has a nice cell-shaded aesthetic that makes it stand out, even amongst today's FPS games.
The story is exclusively propped up by the game's main villain, the lovably egotistical Jack whose handsomeness is only matched by his sociopathic hero complex. Jack's twisted moral compass makes him quite an interesting villian, and he's given some of the best lines in the game, delivered home by the excellent voice actor who channels Jack's identity worryingly well. Handsome Jack is great.
However, without him, the game's story rapidly collapses. Jack is the only thing that makes the story memorable, and without him, the incessant wackiness of the other characters quickly becomes gruelling. You spend most of the game running around chasing the blue diamond quest marker around while the NPCs, the game's real protagonists, discuss the events of the story and give you orders. You can turn your brain off and let it fade quietly into the background.

The game has an entire circus of DLC available. Extra content, cosmetics, the ability to start each character with a few underwhelming guns - everything is here, from the fun to the genuinely predatory. Is it worth buying? If you finished the base game and want something else to stick your teeth into, sure. I got all 52 items when the handsome collection randomly went on sale for 97% off. Maybe just wait for another sale like that.

So, is Borderlands 2 fun?
By yourself, it's engaging enough, but not really anything special. The game is absolutely designed around a co-op experience - bring a few friends along, and you'll end up having a much better time. So, yeah: if you have friends and want to muck around in a very big game, go pick it up. There's a sale on right as I'm writing this review, and there'll probably be many more in the future. Hell, maybe buy a few of the campaign DLC along with it if you really want some extra content to chew into. I'd stay away from the cosmetics unless they're part of a discounted bundle, but hey, you do you."
28696,Well yes but actually No

- Some Jokes Doesn't Work, Some are Even Cringy
- Repetition Immediately Become Apparent as End-game Begins

Summary:
BORDERLANDS 2 has strong enough pillars that supports the game's existence as a looter shooter, aside from the minor problems that i ran into through out the main storyline and right at the end, i won't deny the fact that the journey and all the set up is very entertaining to follow and to go through even all the to its conclusion

28757,"This is one of the most overhyped games in history. Is it good? Yes. Is it a masterpiece like many claim, or great? No. It isn't I went in really wanting to enjoy it, but was pretty disappointed. If you LOVE shooters and cringe inducing Deadpool knockoff type humor that is VERY in your face you will love this game. If you don't pull out Halo 1 or 2 to be reminded what a masterpiece of this genre is capable of. Again, not bad, but the hype truly lets down here."
28758,A beautiful game that I will continue to play over and over. BL2 is my favourite gameand is chock-full of endless hilarity. I could not recommend this game OR the developers more highly!!!
28759,just play the first borderlands then come back and you'll get that but improved
28760,"ive been playing borderlands as long as i can remember. it is thie #1 best game to play with friends! the games almost always give a comic book feel that makes every goofy thing you do with your pals feel true to the world

28780,"Yeah, just not my cup of tea.  I think that each individual aspect of the game that I'm sure you have read about in other reviews is fine, but the whole package is ""less than the sum of its parts"" for me.  I got this for about $9 so in that case it is fine I guess.  And if there is still a sale going on I would say give it a shot."
28781,"To be honest, Borderlands 2 is one of the most fun games i have played so far. It has great class choices and also since OP10 is out it is quite fun game. I do not have many hours on PC but on XBOX I got every class to level 80 and also OP10. 

Pros: 
+ great game for multiplayer
+ the story is fun
+ if you like farming it is a nice game
+ you can farm your weapons fast

Cons: 
- it uses quite a lot of processor power
- sometimes it glitches out, but what game does not have glitches

in total a nice game"
28782,fun as hell
28783,i only liked it coz of its unique anime type eye appealing game design and its fun when a high level player comes in and finishes ur mission.
28784,its really fun
28785,"Whoa, So this was unexpectedly amazing! I enjoyed the overall game-play and i had a great time. Definitely recommended! Worth it for sure."
28786,"Absolutely a wonderful game! I am not much of an FPS person, but this one just one just keeps giving. 
Recommended to Play with friends on Coop - Double the murder, double the fun, si?"
28787,"The story and game play is fantastic. The euphoria of completing this game and finding rare guns is immense. It does get a tad tedious, but it is always worth it."
28788,"The shooting mechanism is overpraised by many fans. Enemies aren't nothing but bullet-sponge dolls, in most cases they are placed randomly around the map. They will also respawn immediately if you exit its area. This is what I usually call a company's strategy to prolong the game with the least effort possible.

It's been eight years and the game is still not optimized, FPS drops happen, bugs also happen.

It's a shame that the gameplay absolutely ruined every aspect of the story and the atmosphere for me because characters are actually well written with a lot of humor included. Graphics and the art style is where the game shines at most."

28795,Guns and loot.  The only thing not to like are the jokes.
28796,I love this game.
28797,Ka.. pew
28798,It has more than 175 million guns. What the fuck more do you want!? Just buy it already..
28799,"Of all the Borderlands games out there (1,2,TPS,3,WL), this is THE definitive Borderlands experience in my opinion.

I've played maybe 400-500 hours between PC and Xbox 360, it is just that good. On the surface its a really solid FPS adventure but you quickly learn the thrill of finding a new and better gun every single mission or boss fight you finish. Each class offers a unique way of playing the game and I've gotten to Ultimate Vault Hunter mode (New Game++) with 4 out of six, with all of them having at least a whole days worth of playing time, two of them with a whole week's worth of playing time. 

This game is great if you're looking for a 15-20 hour story to play through, but the real standout feature is the grind and adventure for the best loot out there; If you like games like Diablo or Warframe that reward long grinding with great loot, this is for you."
28800,Funy game
28801,"Despite being a few years old, this game still has not lost the charm or fun since its release.  We are still having fun with roaming around Pandora picking up cash and blasting psychos!  Life is good."
28802,"Shoot stuff and get stuff, what's not to like?"
28803,Classic loot n' shoot!

28806,epic
28807,"ARPG meets FPS: the quintessential looter-shooter. The itemization and story driven campaign structure mirror Diablo 2 perfectly, as does the lack of an endgame beyond replaying the game on higher difficulties.

Another thing that sets Borderlands and Diablo apart from their competition is their distinctive identities. Diablo's dark, gothic atmosphere is iconic, and Borderlands' comic stylings and irreverent humor are just as distinctive and memorable. And popular. It's your call how funny you think Zer0 saying his ""trap card"" voice line for the thousandth time is, but a lot of people love this game's humor and identity. Personally, I don't think it has aged all that well. When it came out, this sort of self-aware, non-stop humor was less common, but it doesn't feel as fresh in the year 2020, and once the shock value wears off, it doesn't feel as clever as it wants to be. Still, it's not badly written. The characters range from tolerable to likable and the actual narrative is fine--in fact, the main questline gets pretty engaging by the end, though it takes a while to pick up and some of the ""oops, you've been mildly inconvenienced, go finish a new questline to get back to the original goal"" missions break the pacing a bit much. (The side content runs the gamut from varied, well-scripted unique challenges to ""kill x things"" or ""fetch x"" quests--but that's okay, I suppose, since ARPGs usually manage to make those sorts of quests fun enough, and this game is no exception.) But I rarely find myself actually laughing at it-- most of the time I'm idly amused by it while I sprint my way through the real appeal of the game: shooting enemies, killing bosses, and collecting better randomized gear.

That part of the game is pretty good. The gunplay isn't as tight or polished as the best FPSes, but those games don't have this one's itemization or RPG systems, so it's a fair tradeoff. Still, the simple act of shooting a gun could stand to be a bit more satisfying. The reliance on an accuracy stat to keep your gun from swaying wildly while your mouse is idle means that it feels better the longer you play, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to make the player wait for the gunplay to actually feel good. It's similar to what the original Deus Ex does, actually, but Deus Ex offers ways to play the game beyond shooting things. Here, having to invest points in simply being able to shoot where you aim feels strange.

The classes are cool, and while the skill tree system is fairly simple, it offers several different ways to build each class. I'm not sure how viable they all are, but, being a pretty casual-friendly game, it seems like you're not likely to break your character by the end of the story mode unless you spread your points recklessly, and even then, you can respec easily enough. Some abilities seem more balanced around group play (and classes-- my squishy, sneaky, sniper-focused assassin has a much harder time alone in some areas than others), but there's not enough scaling to make drop-in, drop-out play seamless. When all players are very close in level, co-op is a great experience, but unless you schedule your play with your friends or roll a separate character to play with them, it might get a bit awkward keeping everyone in sync. Which is a shame, because having a set of allies with a variety of abilities is genuinely more fun than playing alone. There are no closed servers, so a trading economy like in Diablo 2 or Path of Exile is absolutely not a thing, nor are there any opportunities to find random players like the MMO-lite scenarios of Destiny, but that does at least mean you're free to play offline all you want. Unfortunately the game isn't very moddable, so there's not much in the way of custom content available.

All in all, it's a pretty compelling, genre-blending effort, with a hell of a lot more polish than the first Borderlands game (and I haven't yet played the third; maybe it totally outclasses this one--but then, that one isn't available in a bundle with a bunch of DLC and a whole other game for a few dollars on sale). But Borderlands 2 has some warts as well. Jumping is annoyingly floaty and the environments are occasionally awkward to navigate. The sensitivity settings are a bit more coarse than I'd like for a PC game. There's no autoloot button for nearby ammo or currency, leading to a lot of unnecessary E key mashing. The gunplay is just decent, not great. You'll either find the writing great or grating. And, as mentioned, the endgame is limited, meaning that your motivation to keep leveling and farming better gear will be dependent on how much you like repeating the main quest. But at least going through the main quest is, by and large, a pretty good time."

28837,it nice
28838,This game is so loveable
28839,"This game may 8 years old at this point but it is still a very good game, if the handsome collection is on sale you should definitely pick it up"
28840,"Pros:

1. Iconic villain that feels like he is the true protagonist of the story
2. Angel
3. sense of humour if it connects
4. you can play both single player and multi-player and there are 6 characters to choose from
5. headhunter and 4 story- add on dlcs that you can get in the handsome collection are fantastic
6. Tiny Tina's assault on dragonkeep is by far the greatest dlc I have ever played

Cons:

they overcharge for commander Lilith's defense of sanctuary and the OP levels are now locked behind it even if you have digistruct.

Worth every Penny :)"
28841,I love the game and i recommend get it
28842,what can i say its borderlands! great fun but id say the first one was better prob just nostalgia goggles tho
28843,yes
28844,IT'S ALMOST MOTHERF***ING PERFECT!
28845,"great fun, tons of guns"
28846,"really good storyline, boring at some point due to it's abundant secondary missions, but a really good game overall, great to play with friends, really fun. the idea is pretty good but the only problem i found was a lot of bugged hitboxes and movement issues. p.d.: don't purchase borderlands 1."
28847,"Usually don't write reviews but thus game is good! Unique graphics, good missions, story, humor and fun"
28848,"This is most likely my all time favorite game. No library is complete without it. I cannot praise it more if i tried. It is so good, Ive written essays for school shorter than the review I would have to write for this to be an in depth review. Buy it, it is amazing."
28849,"Very enjoyable.
Amazing dialogues you will never get bored of.

28850,"A defining game of its genre, and an absolute blast to play. Even after years of replaying I never get tired of coming back to blast my way through its campaign with my friends/"
28851,Pillar of Community Review tbh. The game's great tho
28852,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!

I played this game for two years on a different platform before migrating over here to PC.  And even on PS4, with the controller that I sucked with, the game was still fantastic.  On PC, it is 1000 times better.  Each Vault Hunter has a unique playstyle to fit each and every person's preferences.  Like running into a room and decimating everything?  Salvador's got your back.  Care for a more sneaky approach? Zer0's your guy.  And the trailers didn't lie.  There are tons of guns, each with something special or different from the next.  And once you get more advanced, you will start to learn weapons parts, and let me tell you, you feel like a real nerd then.  Overall, this is my all time favorite game and still holds up against modern games."
28853,"borderlands is prob my fave game of all time tbh, the second one i mean. everything about its customization, content... characters... it's so immersive and it feels so alien."

28868,"A really fun game to play , specially if you are going to Co-op the story with your friends. Good game but even better with friends."
28869,"It's borderlands you get what you see, crazyness, gore & guns guns GUUUUUNS!"
28870,"This game is a beast. I love the cel-shaded art style, sense of humor, and gunplay. The story is pretty interesting in its own right -- having not played the first game, I didn't feel like I was missing anything (although I'm sure that it adds something). Handsome Jack is a surprisingly compelling villain that you love to hate. I really enjoyed the more serious turn the story takes towards the end.

It's not perfect though; I found myself dying over and over again even with powerful weapons and equipment. Maybe a skill issue, but I doubt it. There definitely was a difficulty spike in the second half of the game.

Overall, though, I definitely recommend picking this up, either on its own or as a part of the Handsome Collection!"
28871,Yes? yes
28872,The perfect blend of comedy and thrills.

Buy it. You won't regret it."
28881,it's cool
28882,its good
28883,This game has always been my favourite since the first time I played it and is always amazing to play by myself but when I have friends to play with that makes the experience so much better. I love how much variety there is for the guns and equipment you can use and what you can do with the skills. Absolute 11/10 game
28884,"Lovley FPS, not too hard, funny story and humor"
28885,"Personally I have zero interest in the cheesy child like stories (they really are like a comic written for ten year olds) but it runs smoothly, is super stylised and a nice simple and easy to pick up game ideal for co op. 
Almost a casual game! More or less all the controls are standard if you have played games like COD. Confusing menus."
28886,REALLY GOOD GAME
28887,"really good, the movement and guns in this game are awesome. The part that makes me come back to borderlands is the boss fights and story mode, also the tier challenges. +1 rep"
28888,nice
28889,"This game is a classic at this point. Definitely a must have if you enjoy a bit of crude humor with your looter shooter. And you can play with friends, which is always a plus! Its got a nice story too. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it definitely isn't the worst either (and it certainly beats whatever the hell Borderlands 3's story was).

Also I played this game on my brother's account in the past, so the total playtime is more like 200 hours or something."
28890,"Great Game

"
28891,"If you are a solo player, don't bother. The game is not fun solo, maybe I'm just not a fan of the looter genre, but it just feels like I am always in the inventory.

If you have friends that you can play with you can absolutely enjoy it, but the game on it's own it not good.

EDIT: Completed it, still not worth it, maybe at a 75% sale."
28892,The intro cinematic was worth the cost to me.
28893,"Pretty chaotic, love the voice lines"
28894,"I recommend Borderlands 2 it""s really beautiful it""s addictive and you will spend hours playing it plus the game is really fun."
28895,"good game
"
28896,i love this game
28897,it good
28898,"I heard about all the great things about this game, but I have to disagree.

The guns do not feel fun to shoot. Guns all shoot projectiles, making it awkward from the hitscan of today. Being the main premise of the game, shooting, I quickly began to feel more tired getting wrecked by enemies while my bullets whiz past their legs and arms.

IDK maybe I'm just old :/"

28913,"New lovable characters with special abilities, often humourous and sometimes dark storyline, tons of side quests and more guns than you can shake a stick at!  A worthy successor to the original!"
28914,"I've played a lot of Borderlands 2 and it definitely is one of my favourite games.

PROS:

-Fun gameplay, variety of weapons and classes and builds
-Great humour and writing
-Handsome Jack: Such a memorable villain. He is constantly talking down to you, and messing with you. And the voice actor really brings Handsome Jack to life.


CONS:

- Fast travel.. This is a small complaint but I wish you could just fast travel from anywhere. If you aren't near a fast travel station you have to walk back through the empty areas where you have already killed everyone, taking you out the action for quite some time.

Definitely give this game a try, I've seen it go on sale for less than £5 multiple times. Definitely worth the money.

28923,"Amazing story.
Bit outdated when it comes to some of the features, but can probably get them with mods.
10/10"
28924,"Alright i think this a great game so far, 8.7/10 would buy full price if needed, but i think should have more modern fps gameplay. So it`s the got the basics of a fps, Aim down sights, crouching and shooting, But it does not have these:

1# going prone
2# Sliding
3# peeking (as in after down sights when up against cover you don`t peek out like in far cry 3 or modern warfare) 

And you might say the game is not built around these 3 mechanics but they would help a lot in terms of combat, Borderlands 3 i hear added in sliding which i think is cool but why doesn't this game have it? or at least a mod for it, because i can`t find a mod for it. I can understand prone and peeking, but sliding? that`s not right, You can`t slide doom but that game is power trip, this game is a Fps Rpg, it should have sliding in it, even if it came out 2012 it should, black ops 2 came that year, Far cry 3 came out that year, they also didn't add into the pre sequel. hell its not even in bioshock infinite, 2K get shit together and add sliding into your fps games, I  try and do it all the time but now just feel stupid. If there is a mod that adds in sliding please tell me."
28925,good
28926,Still hasn't been topped as the best looter shooter game.
28927,fell in love with this game
28928,I mean how can i waste this much time of  my life playing this and i dont like it
28929,"This game is awful! Not in causes of gameplay, it's okay. The characters are ignorant, crazy and pervert in 99%! All of them! Why I can't see the man in the game, who is not sadist, homosexualist, cyberpsychopath, addict, maniac, or just not that stupid as all those people we would meet through the game?! You know, I glad to shoot, loot and walk, kill in this game, it's pretty fun. But otherwise, is terrible! My opinion - nothing more... if you love Randy Pitchford's crap, get the pleasure."
28930,"Very funny and beautiful graphics , I loved it!
The art and the gameplay was marvellous!!"
28931,Pretty Good!
28932,Good game
28933,I personally have been playing as the CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN and ive been loving this story but the car mechanics are super janky but the extensive story makes up for that for me
28934,Not my thing
28935,epic
28936,Worth every penny.
28937,"I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the, who's best villain but
The ones who stop you fallin' from bad shooters, baby

Feel like you feelin' now
Lootin' wild just to gun psychos down
When you loot them like the way you gunned them
And I suffer, but I ain't gonna steal ya 'cause

This ain't no game for no hero
This ain't no game for no morals, man
This ain't no game for no zero
To play alone

Imagine me and you, I do
Think about playing day and night, it's only right
To think about the gun you love and hold her tight
So trigger happy together

Oh there ain't no rest for the gunplay
Loot don't grow on skill trees
I got quests to take, I got mouths to shoot
There ain't nothing in this world this good

Oh no, we can't slow down, we play it back to back
And you know if we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the addiction
Cause this game is stupid good

Ain't nothin' too broken
Ain't nothin' too badass
Ain't nothin' too repetitive
To get what I want
I made a deal with power
I made a pact with funtime
I'm gunning down without a bother
Putting life on the line

Can't keep this down, let it live, let it live, play it now!"
28938,"Epic game. Got it when a guy scammed me, I could get the game and I dont feel scammed anymore"
28939,They ruined a great game.
28940,"is good
"
28941,Loved this game. The humor and story line was great.
28942,fun
28943,"Man, this is not for me.

I gave it a good try. I put 40+ hours on it, in part because general reception was so good. As a FPS it is absolutely not among the best. The RPG elements force you to grind, or have artificially long battles were you have to hit an enemy 3000 times; it feels like you're aiming a pea shooter to a steel giant. Then, you'll level up, and instantaneously become really powerful until the next story mission and then again, the grinding.

I saw multiple accounts of side missions being awesome. I found them really weak: they're just hastened constructions with reused assets and poor scripting. The main story, I like, and I think Handsome Jack is a great character. I really wanted to push forward to see more handsome jack, more story, and less endless repeating enemies.

This is probably better as a co-op. Unfortunately I don't have the time nor availability to invest in it."
28944,"Even if you're not a fan of shooters, this game is worth it just for the story. ITS HILARIOUS!"
28945,Nice
28946,yes
28947,its a really fun game i would recamend it
28948,"Endless amounts of fun can be farmed from this video game, so long as you are alright with farming."

28951,Time flies when your having fun.
28952,It is the classic looter shooter and I cannot recommend it enough.
28953,Great game
28954,"good game
"
28955,not bad ;)
28956,"More story than Borderlands 1, lots of memorable characters and cool weapons."
28957,this game's great everyone knows that
28958,"Requires you to be online all the time, even when you are more or less just going through single player. Constantly get kicked out of session any time there is a hiccup with the internet. Really long ""searching for dlc"" icon BS whenever you start the game. Why? Doesn't even let you quit while its trying to find the server or whatever it is its trying to do and you are getting really bored, so you have to wait ten minutes or shut the program down  with task manager.

I got it on sale for a couple of bucks, but after fighting with the online all the time BS, it wasn't even worth the 6 dollars or whatever I spent on it. Online all the time is super gaaay. Don't bother with this game."
28959,"goot but i scare of bug creature i no like spider, worm, bug, no me gusta, but game goot"
28960,Handsome jack is easily one of the best villains in video games

28963,Salvador bl3 pls?
28964,Classic game. Lots of fun.
28965,"I randomly picked up this game. Never played it until I randomly wanted to play this game. And randomly I got throw into this world of violence and randomness. After beating this game I randomly started Little Tiny's D&D adventure and also I randomly kill a Pirate in desert. And after that I randomly went on nexus mods and randomly picked up some mods. Randomly I enjoy the whole experience of shooting random things.

(Spoilers!!!!!)                 I want to play Borderlands 3 But I heard that story was not very well written, And I just wonder after the death of Handsome Jack which was one of the best villain of video games and also found out there are more vault key in the universe, how can they f~~k this up???? And Randomly they did."

Just for that alone it is worth playing :)"
28976,The perfectly stylized humor filled shoot-and-loot RPG experience.
28977,best game for relax with friends
28978,"Game is severly bugged, constant lagging from trying to connect to the servers.

Game design is lacking, it's basically about grinding to get good gear.
The story is meh."
28979,Beautiful game
28980,Loot guns. Shoot guns. F u c k Aspyr Joe
28981,o:
28982,"Buggy, but still a very good story. And ofcourse it is the nonsense looter shooter that defined the genre."
28983,It's just an all around fun game with great gameplay characters and guns.~
28984,This is awesome!
28985,"Even with Borderlands 3 out, this is the definitive Borderlands experience imo. The story is great, the jokes are funny, and the shooting is addicting."
28986,"Ok first this is not my type of game.Actually after what they did with epic store i will not even buy but my friend wanted to play with me so bought it, and only play it cause my friend want it so take this review as not someone as fan of the genre. 
Ok a lot of chars, for others to see. The fact that is a first person shooter make the char selection only a selection for skill that you dont know what they will have. That is select blind and play.. dont like it start over again. That for my opinion is only for increase in a manner artificial the game play. Actaully this increase appear in a lot of things starting with...
3 modes that requiere you do all over again for finally be in the difficulty level that should be... from start why waste time .. well cause game is 30 hour long with only 1 run. 
drop so bad that game give gold keys for cover for that. Is true that part of the fun of a rpg is get equip but when you notice that equip is 100% trash and that gold keys are the manner of get good stuff you feel that is something rare going on. 
So at the end, if were not for my friend i refund long ago. this game have no character progresion (not matter what my friend feels) music is fine but inventary and ammo drop is well not so good. Maps are long and lack a real fast travel.. a lot of times is walk for more of 10 mins cause quest ask you go to point B."
28987,a
28988,I had this game on the Xbox 360. I played this way too much and I'd like my life back. I don't think my lack of a life a life is this games fault. I've said too much goodbye.
28989,best game ever
28990,yes

29006,i'm playing this game 8 years after it came out. I can put physx on ultra and rocks and sparks are flying everywhere. if you like physx effects and want a co-op FPS diablo check it out.
29007,very fun
29008,"Borderlands 2 is a good shooter in its own right. Granted, it's RPG elements mean that in later play throughs you can't one shot an enemy with a headshot, but if you know that there will be some ""bullet sponges"" going in, the RPG elements only add to the fun. The loot aspect also keeps the game interesting, though it does get tedious when end-game means grinding out the same enemies failing to get the gun you want because the wrong manufacturer made one component out of five. That being said, I haven't spent much time in end game because I keep creating new characters for the fun of playing a different style. Multiplayer also keeps the game interesting, though I tend to only friends games.
The story is interesting. I am somewhat annoyed by what seems like retconning of Angel. However, the antagonist is well written to get you to dislike him and yet still seems generally believable. As with action RPGs, story isn't usually the reason you come to an FPS, but BL2's story, and those of some of the DLCs, at least keep things interesting while you run around killing things."
29009,Good combat. Good variability in enemies. Love the animals. Guns are good. Lilith is hot.
29010,"I play this game on multiple other platforms as well and I can say that its one of the best RPG/FPS out there. Most of you have already played the game and know how amazing it is but if you haven't, you need to try it out."
29011,"One of the Best Experiences a video game has offered in terms of story !
gun play is sub par especially to the newest and fancier titles but works well !
"
29012,"HAHA bullet go woosh woosh, grenade go boom boom"
29013,"Great gameplay, really smooth controls. Highly recommended for those with issues concerning BL3 gameplay"
29014,very good
29015,I like this game a lot

29029,very fun game
29030,Just brilliantly done.
29031,"The child of Fallout and old time MMO looters, its fucking perfect!"
29032,"The game ran great on my Mac even at the highest setting. HOWEVER.....it CANNOT .....SAVE any of my progress! I restarted a new game, no saves. It save at certain points and at other points it does now. And yes, I see the blu icon lighting up in the upper corner supposedly auto saving at certain checkpoints. BUT no siree. So 8 hours wasted trying to play this game in twice and trying to figure put the saves. I amdone with this eye candy. Steam should bring back Borderlands 1 GOTY for Mac, I would buy that."
29033,Favorite game of all time :)
29034,e
29035,Really fun
29036,"The gold standard in co-op shooter experiences. Played with friends, colleagues, random people, and solo. The game is great from start to finish, has enough randomness, classes, and loot to keep you coming back, and tons of DLC for many hours of entertainment."
29037,Yes

29039,Good game
29040,ok
29041,Needs CROSS-PLATFORM....
29042,"Still the best title on the Borderlands world. 3 is alot of Fun but 2 is still by far the best game.
Not every main NPC is a female ( 3 was way overboard with making every Damn NPC a female and all the males weak roles. )
Was made at a time before PC infected games and the world around us, thus making the Jokes in BL2 far better than 3.

If you have not played a Borderlands title yet, Pick up 2 and the DLC for it before wasting money on the Female fest 3 is."
29043,"ye
"
29044,"I snagged the handsome collection for ~£11, what a great purchase. It's a good base game, the DLC is great fun. This is something I've put a lot of time in, and I will put a lot more in. There's so much content. I wouldn't buy it for full price though, the handsome collection is ~£200. Not worth it. But yeah, if it's on sale for 94% off, get it, it's great."

29069,"I love scifi guns and enjoy playing RPGs. I never was interested on Borderlands because I thought it's just a tournament type game. When I discovered it wasn't and the theme of the game is a bit of a comedy, I enjoy every bits of it."

29083,"Guns guns guns galore! Hours upon hours of entertaining game-play, with an engaging story, lovable characters, and action behind every corner! An amazing space RPG where the loot is sweet, and the world is deadly!"
29084,"This Game is crazy fun. Be prepared to blow 300+ hours to reach the highest tier content on the hardest difficulties, for each character. I'm serious. If you like this game as much as I did the first time i played it, then you will basically drop all thoughts of every ether game on your list just to play this game through the highest levels. I got almost ALL the DLC for $15, plus the pre-sequel, so it's a huge bargain for the number of hours of content and the enjoyability of it. It runs really well on almost any computer, and even the lowest graphics setting look pretty great, even by today's standards.  By all means, a wonderful investment of money and time for cheapskate gamers with low end budgets and low end hardware, and a brilliant classic to revisit even for the top tier gamers with those big money wads and high end set-ups. 10/10"
29085,"I was just a young boy of 8 years old, and my most valuable possessions on this earth were my Xbox 360 and Borderlands 2 disc.  They had come as a gift from grandmum, whose visits shined a beacon of light on our otherwise painful and oppressive lives in our sparsely dressed 2 bedroom apartment.  We never talked about it openly, but didn't have to.  The rages and small, but destructive fits of violence that he flew into spoke for us all.  He had the same sickness as grandad, and would always take out his rage on us after a couple of pints of liquor, or uncountable number beers.  

Grandmum would always talk to us on the side to make sure we knew to stay away when he was ""being nasty"" or ""in a mood.""  My youngest memories were the desperate, and fearful look that would appear across my mother and sisters faces as the low droning sound of his rusty Oldsmobile announced his arrival. As the years went on, the sound would make my stomach turn out of anxiety. We hoped for the best, but usually were recipients of the worst.  The drone of the vehicle, was followed by 2 consecutive slams.  After the 2nd one, you learned to find whatever corner you could in the 250 square foot apartment to avoid what followed. 

It became a sort of cat and mouse routine over the years, but I think we can all agree that my oldest sister Gina could not have picked a worst time to enter her ""punk goth"" phase.  Dad had been out of town for almost a week to attend the funeral for one of his old Navy buddies, and in that short period of time she dyed her long blonde hair black, and insisted on 

"
29086,One of the best games I've played and an excellent replay value. You get your money's worth x1000 times...
29087,"This would be my favorite in the Borderalnds series, It kept the original fun and style and even a decade later holds up"
29088,As a Mac user I really appreciate having this game available. It runs well on my 15 inch 2018 i7 with 16gb of memory. I already owned it on another console but needed a game like this on the laptop to fill the space that only a unique rpg style multiplayer fps like the Borderlands series offers. There are tons of weapons and play styles. After you finish it with one character there is incentive to see how one of the other ones plays. The price is really nice too  when it is on sale. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. It plays well if you want to do just one quest or totally binge out.
29089,"yes a great looter shooter and a great villan

It aint borderlands 2 if handsome jack dident say CORROSION"
29090,I recomend buying
29091,o
29092,"absolute banger, mate"

29094,GREAT!!!
29095,Fun Game.
29096,Good story and lots of unique weapons
29097,"Lots of intense FPS action while you grind out crazy amounts of drops looking for something that's actually an upgrade.
And I love it, so much."
29098,"An old game, but a lot of fun.  Use youtube for info: there is a lot of it.

I play from steam on linux, so far without hitches."
29099,"Good humor, decent story, and guns. Lots. Of. Guns."
29100,"Borderlands 2 Freezes every time at the same boss (The Warrior). Further investigations prove that it does not play well with 1660 Ti cards. It was running fine with the old 1050Ti. It was a pretty cool game when it first came out, support of this game is a joke. PhysX in whatever form that it is used in this game is retarded beyond belief. Thanks Nvidia, for screwing over your own partnered games. After and additional 62 hours into the game, decide to revise my review. This game is a buggy mess. Unless the game is gifted to you, skip it. You'll thank me later. Take the money you save and go play anything else. Try Hollow Knight. You will never regret buying Hollow Knight."
29101,"Don't drive cars...

It'll ruin your life :I"
29102,Coop with friends.  Tons of missions.
29103,yes
29104,one of the best games i have ever played

29107,very fun game soo good open area soo much to do even when your done the game
29108,"best game ever, 
infinate replayability. 
just a great story, one can relive over and over again. with great soundtrack, dark humor. 
it never takes it's self too seriously, the game play is based on having fun, and a good time."
29109,the game where i stereotype my friends based on their mains
29110,fun af
29111,Its a good game
29112,Tons of Fun.
29113,"Honestly? One of the best FPS games ever made as of writing this. Nearly perfect in almost every aspect. Story is great, humor is great, characters are great, graphics are great, anything you can think of they did well. I could go on for hours about how good it is.

Also Gaige is best girl. Fight me. ANARCHY!"
29114,I enjoy shooting
29115,"Runs smoothly on my MacBook Air (without the free Ultra HD DLC) and it's pretty fun. There's always a joking on its way, wherever you are, and they make the story a little more interesting. I'm about to finish it and I bought it like a week ago!"
29116,"The combat is fun and the world is really rich in its eccentricities. I haven't finished the game yet so I can't speak too much about the story but it seems alright so far.

As a solo player I have to say that it gets a bit frustrating as the hordes of enemies seem clearly structured for co-op play. The enemies all respawn over time (a rather short length of time too imo), including the bosses, which can be really annoying if you're not all that into the combat but it gets easier after a while.

In general, I would really recommend this."
29117,8/10
29118,Sure
29119,Everthing was just good the story the dlc the character my fav is tiny tina and and the and the bunkers and badasses dlc (havent played in a while forgot the name) but its just really good in my opinion and whoever  hasent played i recomend it.
29120,"its borderlands 2, its good. you already know this"
29121,nice
29122,will always be one of the best shooter looters out there.
29123,Good game funny game
29124,great game with friends
29125,"Awesome loot, an art style and game play that still hold up even after 7 years, fun characters with an interesting story, tons of hours of content, and a buttload of dlc. I've probably dumped about two weeks worth of game time into this game, and at least a week in the other entries in the series. Haven't played 3, but of 1, 2, and the pre sequel, this one's my favorite."
29126,"It's fun, you can put a lot of time into it. The story is very rich, you always know what you're doing and why. Characters are unique as well. Good atmosphere, good graphics, good humor. Vast arsenal of guns, there's always something to get. There's also multiple ways to play this game, regarding characters, so that's fun too."

29135,"I am a little late to the party with Borderlands 2. I have let this nit of lowbrow video game artistic masterpiece rot in my inventory for nearly 3 years and for that i will forever be kicking myself in the face. Everything about this game is a treasure. The visuals are superb and with the ultra HD texture pack they look even better. The gunplay is buttery smooth and the amount of playstyles is unheard of in most modern games outside of pure RPG gaming. There are probably still builds that could be made with characters that haven't been tried yet. The way perks stack on each other through the multiple perk tiers is a thing to behold and should be put on a pedestal all others of its nature aspire to. The story of Borderlands 2 is interesting but the character building, weapons, and the everlasting drive to get bigger, stronger and better gear is the main drive here.
Besides the search for ever better gear, my favorite part of the game is actually the dialogue in battle. Each enemy type is unique and has different quirky and silly things they say during battle and after they have fallen. One of my favorites is "" I was going to pay off my mortgage next mooonth uuuuughhh!""
I play as Kreig and he has internal monologues with his alter ego which is exceptional to hear. it is very quiet and can best be enjoyed with a headset. It feels like you are Kreig and are hearing voices. You get to let that out as his power skill as a rampaging psycho as his alter ego.
I have nothing negative to say about this game. It hits all the marks, and as someone who got the Fight for Sanctuary dlc during its free period, i was exceptionally surprised by its quality and what it adds to the game. Even though it is 15 dollars now, it adds a lot to the game. I was amazed that this was still being supported 8 years on. I suggest getting the handsome collection for a pittance and ponying up for the Fight for Sanctuary dlc or waiting for it to be on sale. You can still get the game and the presequel as well as all of the dlc for around 25 dollars. Not a bad deal at all considering the quality and quantity of everything included. The replay value with 6 unique characters with multiple playstyles, the ability to do increasingly difficult playthroughs, the quantity of dlc, and the ever increasing amount of weapons that can only be gotten at higher difficulties will keep you entertained for litterally hundreds of hours. I have only played one character through the main story and 1 dlc as well as part of a second playthrough and have over 100 hours in. imagine doing that and it remaining fresh for almost 2 more playthroughs plus dlc. It will probably be close to 250 or 300 hours on 1 character. if i play through all of them i may get close to 2000 hours of playtime.
i would give this game an OP8 out of 10"
29136,NICE
29137,The slot machines helped me with my gambling addiction

29154,"I like the game it's funny but has the worst save system ever, you have to play same mission over and over again from the beginning until you complete it.
If you play 2 hours and then ""save and quit"" without completing mission it doesn't save, you'll have to play the same 2 hours again.
I stop playing, luckily I get it free during an offer period

29170,"Actually really fun, the movement is a bit janky, weapons REALLY innacurate, bot other than that would reccomend!"
29171,"Loved the game. The story is pretty good, graphics is pretty interesting and the game-play is pretty great."
29172,cool
29173,"it good
"
29174,"Good gameplay, level design, story and characters. One of the few games I kept playing after the main story ended, though the DLCs and side missions continue the story so that helps (This is also an indicator of just how much good content there is in the game+DLCs to keep you entertained). If you like shooters with a good humor and story, Borderlands 2 shouldn't disappoint. 

I finished most of the side missions as they became available, which is a good way to get good loot you can use. Played it as Maya, and going through the DLCs now as Maya and Salvador. I also found Gaige to be interesting in some of the DLC side missions I played with all of the characters. I do wish the vault hunter mode didn't restart the story. 

Played the Windows version with UHD textures on Proton and Gentoo Linux without any problems. I don't think the save files are transferable from my reading, which makes me rethink my decision a bit."
29175,"This game takes over 2 minutes to load (and requires many key/button presses in the process).

- 7 seconds for the BL2 launcher to appear (have to click ""play)
- 30 seconds for the 2k video to start (where I hit escape twice)
- 21 seconds for the title screen to appear (where I have to hit a key)
- 1 minute (!) ""searching for downloadable content"" (???)
- 10 seconds to load my saved game

Given that I've launched the game 5 times, that's 10 minutes of waiting (approaching 10% of my total play time). This might be forgivable if I enjoyed the game, but so far my experience has mostly been a lot of opening boxes with green lights on them, sprinting from place to place, running out of ammo, and getting one-shot killed by the first boss (Boom). Oh, and seeing ads for Borderlands 3.

I do like Claptrap, though."
29176,VEry Fun indeedo
29177,Super fun and worth the money. Very addictive.
29178,good
29179,Amazing
29180,My #1 favorite game
29181,"Awesome game, worth playing guys"
29182,"Fun shooter, lots of humorus elements."
29183,This game is overall the best so far I have not played the 3rd yet
29184,"I liked so many things about this game.  The see enemy, shoot enemy gets old after awhile though.  I'm tired of games where you just grind."
29185,"Great game !, I have played it 24 hours and still amazing me !"
29186,"I know, I know, this game has hat-fuls of reviews and is loved by everybody, but I just don't get it.

On loading the game I wondered if the graphics were a joke or just for an intro screen or first mission, but no, they don't change, that's how it is.  I highly recommend watching a playthrough video first.  Really, that's definitely worth doing. There's nothing wrong with the graphics, it's just a style I was not expecting and I happen to not appreciate that much.

Then the game, I didn't like the robot helper's jokes or sense of humour (I do like jokes, just not his : ) ), I didn't enjoy the combat, seems like there isn't much strategy in running and shooting blam-blam, and I really don't like being spoon-fed through an adventure.  After three regions I stopped playing, I just cannot find it fun, but I accept that I am probably in the minority, it seems well-made and doesn't appear to have any flaws per se, I just didn't like any of it."
29187,Best looter shooter of all time. Simple as that.
29188,good
29189,its extremly good even 8 years later highly recomend it to anyone who is thinking about the purchase
29190,shit game dont download
29191,lot's of crazy guns and missions
29192,such cool artwork and very different! so much fun!!
29193,"its fun to play with friends  really like this borderlands 
"
29194,"ruthless, fun, and more."
29195,poopy
29196,yes
29197,The hansom man is pretty cool
29198,The story is amazing
29199,"I had never really been into shooters / shooter looter games up until now. It's fun and not so hard that you can't get any enjoyment out of it. If you don't play fps / shooter games i highly recommend this as a gateway into them. The story kept me interested and the sidequests never felt boring or bothersome. after playing maybe 10 hours of borderlands 2, i decided to grab the pre-sequel and borderlands GOTY to play next."
29200,"Borderlands, one of the best games I have ever player. Check it out!"
29201,good
29202,"Get your friends, get your guns and get ready for one of the best first person shooters on the market."
29203,The story is much better than Borderlands 1. I'm actually engaged in the story and it doesnt feel like a grind to get through.
29204,"just a good game, lots of completionist content."
29205,dünyanın en iyi oyunu
29206,the Greatest shooter that rivals some of the best FPS in the industry. If you don't get this on sale GOTY you are a simp.
29207,it game
29208,"Eccentric and fun, there are various enemies, characters and guns. I loved tiny tina"
29209,Grind is ass
29210,"Hello. I`m here

29211,good game fun loot stuff yes
29212,PLAY IT
29213,"j,hv"
29214,"nice
"
29215,"including about 3k hours on my ps4 and 3, its a perfect game. just buy it."
29216,"is game
"
29217,NICE!!!
29218,Good game
29219,awesome
29220,It is just fun
29221,The best game when i was childhood damn
29222,"Bad:
A lot of problems with the story/tone of the game, unskippable cut scenes will get on your nerves after a few playthroughs, and 13% scaling/level means that your gear quickly becomes obsolete. 
Good:
Lots of options for creating interesting character builds with unique play styles. Characters combo well with each other so co-op is a lot of fun. Still active modding community offers a lot of replayability. 
Overall:
Offers polished and engaging gameplay at the cost of annoying story elements."
29223,"played it with a friend who was like level 50 and i was level 10 so he gave me money and guns, 10/10"
29224,I hadn't ever played a game like Borderlands 2 and was honestly worried the graphics style would be too weird for me (screenshots look like paper cut outs to me)... but I don't notice at all and now it is my favorite video game franchise! The co-op play is outstanding and really harkens back to an earlier era when people played with each other instead of against.
29225,"Guns,guns,guns...and humour! That's what this game is all about. I have never felt more pain in throwing loot you don't need from your inventory than in the Borderlands franchise. Good story,great characters,excellent villain,amazing quests(especially the side quests) and tons of guns to try."
29226,haha head go boom :)
29227,So far my favorite of the whole series still mostly just becuz of it being the first i played but pandor as a map is so much fun to play in with so much content that i find my self coming back to finish even after playing it on xbox
29228,"I can play this game on my potato of a laptop and I can run it at 30fps at 800x600 and it's still playable. Although it's annoying to play it at such a low resolution I'm still happy I can play this masterpiece of a game on a sad potato laptop

tl:dr amazing optimization"
29229,"As with many of the shooter games I play, best with friends. But in all honesty the comedy of this games stands the test of time and is enjoyable either way."
29230,great game would recomend
29231,poop
29232,"I love this game. My boyfriend and I played together and honestly this game is way more fun in cooperative than by yourself. The guns are ridiculous and the game is just fun. We bought this during Corona and we used it to be able to do something together that wasn't just calling or some boring multiplayer online board game. 

Totally recommend playing this with friends, and i especially recommend waiting until the borderlands sales are live, because you can get so much more of the game for your money."
29233,i coomd
29234,The Only First Person Shooter Game I Enjoy!!!
29235,villain is hahahhahh he scoop man eyes out with spoon asdahdhuasidha
29236,"Very Fun, I like that you can play Story Mode but multi-player"
29237,The game is great.  But I purchased the DLC (downloadable content) but it WILL NOT PLAY!
29238,I AM THE CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN
29239,Spent too much time farming Larry Lee and didn't get a DPUH
29240,.
29241,yes Good game with nice graphics engaging fight
29242,"ive been playing this game for years on xbox/ps3 and i just got it for pc, if you dont mind comic book graphics, i highly recommend this game! Great storyline and comical dialog (I love tiny tina)"
29243,"Sure, every mission basically boils down to ""go here and kill some guys to get loot"", but it's a simple and addicting loop. And finding a rare piece of loot in the wild actually feels rewarding"
29244,"good main story line, side quests are also very enjoyable. good character and weapon diversity. DLC's are okay, i just wish the raid bosses were part of the main game. great replayability."
29245,gsme is fire
29246,yup
29247,epic better than bl3 for now but big change coming soon
29248,"just run and gun
"
29249,"Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite types of games. It doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, and it just lets you shoot and loot. Yes, there is a story, and it is pretty good, but it's the characters and gameplay that make this game awesome. The humor in this game is also one of the main selling points. Basically, this game is a hilarious shooter-looter that takes you on a heck of a ride. Completely recommended!"
29250,Having so much fun with this game
29251,yes 8/10
29252,"I have played this for hours and hours. It keeps you locked in well, and there's always more to do"
29253,"Well look and behold at one of gearbox's best games aside from GTA, the punky team based shoot'n'loot game itself and it's debatably best entry, but enough talk let's get the pros and cons outta the way
[u] THE GOOD [U]

A funky cast of characters, both the evil, the good and the morally questionable are unforgettable.

Great Gameplay, Regardless of what character you're playing, you'll enjoy fast paced showdowns against enemies both big and small with a massive arsenal of weapons with you. And to make things even better you've got a skill tree filled with unique powers for your character.

Amazing Music, Damn the music slaps hard, whenever it be a goofy western sounding theme while fighting two dimwitted bandit brothers or a seriously grim and urgent tune as you're racing against the clock to save an ally from an all-too powerful Corporation, borderlands 2 has you covered.

Perfect For Co-op, Although playable alone perfectly fine, your adventure on Pandora will be much more enjoyable with some good friends to kick ass with, whenever it be running into the enemy or elaborately planning a combo of attacks you'll find a grand time when you ping some fellas on discord and go together.

Almost too much content, The story quests are already enjoyably lengthly but put the many side quests into consideration and boom, entertainment for ages. why not go help hammerlock extract vengeance on a massive sea creature or go through 5 rounds of bandit hell eh?

Handsome jack, all i need to say for this point.

[u] THE NOT SO GREAT [/b]

Dated game, Although the game still looks really good for today's standards it isn't top of the line anymore, those looking for an intense visual experience should look at borderlands 3 or maybe another series that has a new entry like DOOM.

Bugs, It wouldn't be a gearbox game without some annoying bugs...Loot clipping out of bounds at the skull chest, getting trapped in a porta potty's door or gateways that should open not opening, these are thankfully minor inconveniences at worst. i've seen worse bugs in other games and i'm sure you will too.


RNG is a bitch, this goes for any game with RNG to be honest, roll those numbers wrong and you might not get the best gun, a secondary effect might not kick in or whatever else...


[u] OVERALL [/b]
9/10
Get borderlands 2...no; get the Handsome collection, it's not too expensive and you'll get ALL DLC and the prequel bundled with it. See you on pandora fellow vault hunter!"
29254,guns go boom boom
29255,"Best game I have ever played. And I've played through it well over 10 times, across PC and console platforms."
29256,.
29257,"10/10 dads jokes, recommended"
29258,great game love it
29259,"Absolutely amazing first person shooter that basically made its own genre of games.
Massive amount of guns, enemies and quests.
Every single one of the 4 playable characters is completely unique with many different ways to play them, and with DLC you get 2 more characters.
Gearbox made one hell of a good game and enhanced it with DLC and even recent updates to tie into Borderlands 3.
Recommend it to anyone who like loot-shooters."
29260,Good campaign. One of the best fps coop.
29261,MY EYE! MY EYE! THE BULLYMONGER GOT IT
29262,"It's a very fun game, especially playing with friends but if you are a loner, it still is a fun game to play. One complaint I have about this game is the leveling system, it takes a long time to get to level 80 and around level 50 it just slows down. But when you do get to level 80 it opens a whole new level of gameplay. Weapons and shields to chase after that are OP. Overall I highly recommend this game if players are looking for a game to play that is similar to Destiny."
29263,This game is amazing. I'm still coming back to it nearly a decade later.
29264,fun
29265,cool
29266,One of the best i games i have played
29267,"Tried to 100% borderlands and im at 50% atm. Wonderful game from the guns to the characters you meet in the game,cosmetics are just a blast to mess with making your character whacky and cool! More fun with friends but still playable alone"
29268,"a lot of fun, you easily get lost in the game time and you just keep playin for hours!"
29269,"Pros:

1. Iconic villain that feels like he is the true protagonist of the story
2. Angel 
3. sense of humour if it connects 
4. you can play both single player and multi-player and there are 6 characters to choose from
5. headhunter and 4 story- add on dlcs that you can get in the handsome collection are fantastic
6. Tiny Tina's assault on dragonkeep is by far the greatest dlc I have ever played

Cons:

they overcharge for commander Lilith's defense of sanctuary and the OP levels are now locked behind it even if you have digistruct."
29270,good
29271,"Story is pretty bad, dialog is cheesy, writing is linear. All this is part of the game's charm, it was destined to be bad. Pick up a gun, shoot stuff, pick up another gun, realize it's bad, drop it, pick up another gun, realize it's even worse, drop it, fall into a deep state of depression as your legendary you got level 12 is slowly becoming weaker and weaker. Overall a great shooter if you just want some solid mindless gun play with unique gun variety."
29272,Its just straight up awesome.
29273,Verry nice
29274,Yee
29275,THE GOAT
29276,"Great game, worth buying, tho wait for sale and buy GOTY"
29277,"Good game, I liked the part where you shoot the guns, except the new mode for online play will kick you off your session if you lose connection, even if you're playing singleplayer. If you get kicked, you get sent to loading screen purgatory for the rest of the game, so you have to alt-f4 and re-launch the game. It's a pain in the ass and I don't know if I want to keep my rating as a positive."
29278,"I have played this game for 600+ hours it's a good game thats why i have played this game so much
"
29279,its da best
29280,AHHHHHHHH
29281,Yes
29282,g
29283,Playing this to relieve the depression of never being able to get a pc powerful enough to play borderlands 3
29284,fun and Moxxi is very sexy
29285,"its okay
"
29286,Still a great multiplayer game in 2020
29287,d
29288,Sometimes I disliked the npc's
29289,"Brilliant game, doesn't feel repetitive despite the formulaic structure. Got it to chill with friends during the lockdown, is great."
29290,"Is nice.
"
29291,"A mindless shooter, which is pretty fun. 

pretty easy to get a hang of regarding upgrading your guns / shield etc

installed on a omen laptop to play while stuck at work, so technically i'm paid to play this game"
29292,fun
29293,its a bad game with bad characters but if you play it with a friend its midly ok
29294,haha gun go pew
29295,Pew Pew.
29296,8/10
29297,Wicked good.

29301,"this game is fun with friends , love the details"
29302,Quarantine Essential
29303,Great game
29304,gun go bang bang
29305,great game shame they never made a third
29306,This game is worth every penny
29307,"Good combat, good writing.  Handsome jack is a great villain.  If you haven't played it before, it is my favorite of the series.

If moving to Linux from windows, your saved games do not move.  Mainly since when the game was in it's prime, the 2 versions were not update-synced, Saved game folders are:
Windows - ...(home folder)/My documents/My Games/borderlands 2/willowgame/savedata
Linux - ~/.local/share/aspyr-media/borderlands 2/willowgame/savedata

Also if you are new, most ""key codes"" no longer work.  I recommend some google searches.  But to stretch out the remaining working codes (and have the same experience as those in its prime): once you are finished entering all codes, profile.bin in the savedata folder is where the amount is stored.  Lock this file to ""read only"", that way the total resets to the full amount after each session.

It's possible to spend an entire evening trying to find and enter working keys.  Spend time playing and enjoying the game instead."
29308,"gun go pow
"
29309,Moxxi is hot.
29310,fun wasteland game
29311,Great game!
29312,This game is by far the best I've ever played.
29313,Liked.
29314,Fun game for many hours.
29315,Fun with friends
29316,"When this game came out it was hailed as a pretty goofy and left-field kind of game. One that didn't really take itself seriously. Granted some of the jokes and reference are almost so dated they've developed rigor mortis. 

But if you have the time to spare and your are that invested into the Borderlands 'lore' you may find some enjoyment whilst chugging down some frosty chocolate milkshakes."
29317,"Simply an amazing game with great dlc. As a total bundle, BL2 is one of the best purchases for pc."
29318,"Grate story, grate gameplay and never gets old."
29319,Best game ever
29320,game gud
29321,"This is an absolute classic and my favourite game of all time. If you like action, billions of guns and most of all comedy, you will love this game"
29322,good
29323,"Absolutely adore this game, never gets boring"
29324,"The ""psyco"" type enemies remind me of trump supporters."
29325,Fuckin hate this game?
29326,just get it
29327,Good game
29328,brings back old memories dudes. great game <3
29329,pretty epic
29330,spectacular
29331,"Don't download this game if you're hoping to play with your friends online. I have been trying to join my friend's game and vice versa all night and it has been the single most excruciating thing. A search online shows that many gamers are facing the same issue, and have been frustrated because they just can't play it with their friends. A absolute disappointment, for an award-winning game like this."
29332,yeah
29333,"I tried this game many years ago on console and just couldn't get into it then. But I gave it another shot now under a friend's high recommendation and I am extremely pleased with it! I *love* the glitchy graphic style, the characters are hilarious and really enrich the story, and the loot/resource mining is amazing! I'm really glad this game franchise is so expanded, so I have a lot to grow into."
29334,meow
29335,"I have put over 200 hours into this game, and I am still putting more into it. If I didn't think this game was fun, I would never put this much time into it. Play it, enjoy it. Play the rest of the series. That is all."
29336,GOOD
29337,".
"
29338,"Borderlands 2 is a great game. I have sunk 62 hours into this game both alone and with friends and can safely say I will be playing this game for hundreds of hours more. I would reccomend two things if you are going to buy this game. 
1. play the first game before the second. It will make you appreciate the second games attention to little details. And on top of that, the first one is a ton of fun as well.
2. Buy this game on sale. Borderlands 2 can go down to $5. And make sure your friends buy it as well because it is a blast to play through with friends and learning the enemies and how to cheese boss fights.

All in all, I give this a 9.5/10. A great game and I would recommend anyone with an interest in FPS games to buy this game and play through it. You will not be disappointed."
29339,"Amazing game, almost regret buying it on sale."
29340,"kinda cool, but if ya want some real experience you need to buy all dlc."
29341,"
"
29342,gooooog game
29343,dis good game
29344,Perfect game

29347,I SMELL DELICIOUS
29348,fye af
29349,have thousands of hours played on console and it is one of the GOATS and it started the looter shooter genre for the most part.
29350,"One of the best shooter looters of all time, iconic and very replayable with great charaters!"
29351,very nice
29352,AWESOME GAME
29353,A fuck ton of fun and shooting and looting. If you play with friends then you're going to have more fun. The villain is possibly one of the best ones that ever existed
29354,Guns
29355,"i was so high the entire time i played this game i dont even remember playing it, but it says i beat it. so i guess it was ok."
29356,W
29357,"Borderlands 2 is a loot and shoot type of game; basicaly a Hack'n'Slash, just in FPP. And truth be told, Gearbox took everything that was good about the first game and just made it better. The guns feel great, the story is both engaging and funny, the characters feel really distinct from each other thanks to their active skills and skill tress... I could honestly cream over it for hours, but there isn't really anything new to say about it, especialy at this point in time, so many years after its release. Considering how cheap you can get it, it's totaly worth the price."
29358,Great game with Lots of weapon choices :)
29359,L
29360,"good fun
"
29361,"Great game to play with friends
"
29362,"VERY good game! if you're playing for the story, definitely play the games in sequential order: 1, pre-sequel, 2, 3. bery good games with great combat/gameplay wnd compelling story. 9.5/10."
29363,"its fucking borderlands 2 man
"
29364,"Best, Game, Ever."
29365,Had a lot of fun with this game. Funny clever. Guns are real fun. Feels a bit empty. Great game to pick up with a couple friends.
29366,sicko mode
29367,classic
29368,Handsom Jack kinda kute ngl
29369,"This Game has had a Lot of Potential and seemed to have used it at Max Output. [Please keep in mind this Review is MY Opinion)

-A Lot of Weapons to collect [Different Weapons with different Abilities, kind of]
-4 Classes [+2 DLC Classes] to choose from
-Very Interesting Story
-A Remarkable Villain, greatly written
-Great Amount of Replayability

Keep in mind there are more Interesting Things to cover but its late and I am lazy.
Give it a Try and then Tell me what you think!

29370,I'd go gay for this game.
29371,"Bom jogo RPG FPS. Bem casual para joagar sem problemas, porem com momentos tensos"
29372,"Used to play this on Xbox 360 and I missed this game but if your eyes are easily bothered by certain shading styles, you may wanna be cautious of this one; my eyes are so I can only play a few hours at a time but I still adore this game"
29373,"Broke my game.  Put loads of time into this, then the DLC for increased lvl now i cant play overpower 8, cant get items of that level and cant run overpower 8 runs.  Basically you have wrecked my experience with a great game."
29374,so fun for nostalgia
29375,pogchamp for this game
29376,this is one of my fav games to date and i would recommend  it to everyone.

29398,Great ambience & music... fun characters and a breathtaking story... strongly suggested
29399,"I'm sure just about everyone has heard of this game. It was extremely fun with friends or even single if its your first playthrough. Don't let my hours fool you, i've played this game countless hours on the ps3 and ps4."
29400,Great game!
29401,I enjoyed it
29402,"quite enjoyable if i do say so my self, even better with pals"
29403,"Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game. Full stop. Interesting setting, hilarious story and dialogue, and all the guns and baddies to shoot that you could ask for. Playing with a friend or group of friends is the best way to experience this RPG loot shooter. By yourself the enemies are weaker and there may be less of them but, not having a teammate to revive you when you are down is a real disadvantage that makes buddies a must for less skilled players. A defining characteristic of the Borderlands world and characters is the colorful, zany dialogue that had me chuckling as I eliminated enemies across the world of Pandora. In this game there is a new main enemy, Handsome Jack, who steals the show with the best lines in the game. Overall, he is probably the most compelling antagonist in the Borderlands franchise (so much so they made Borderlands The Pre-Sequel to give him a fleshed out backstory). Along with a better loadout system than Borderlands 1, more varied environments, and a surplus of available weapons, Borderlands 2 improves upon it's predecessor in almost every single way.

10/10"
29404,Fun with friends... if I had some :(((
29405,Mint
29406,it gud.

29409,v good
29410,"haha gun go brrbrr
"
29411,"This game was my childhood, along with the original Borderlands. Great game, fantastic story and humour, game still holds up well to this day.

If you don't buy Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, I shall disintegrate you and piss on your ashes."
29412,[h1] GREAT [/h1]
29413,"SO MANY GUNS.
This game is exactly the fucking madness you think it is.
I didn't think i'd enjoy the cartoon'ish style the game is designed in, but it's really good.
A lot better with a friend though, but singleplayer still does the job."
29414,"one of the best games there is. a bazillion guns and great humor
only downside is that due to its graphics rendering it can cause a small bit of nausea for some people (friends I played with.)
they fixed it in bl3 though <3"
29415,"One of the best games ever made by man, it's what every looter shooter dreams to be and what every hardcore gamer wants in one hot package, third one's kinda weak tho"
29416,there was a time when I'd recomend this game but recent updates have turned it into little more than a lag ridden advertisment for another game that I refuse to even speak about.
29417,finally 100% on achievements. buy this
29418,solid game. easy to play and understand. very replayable. goo mechanics. and just a good game overall 10/10 would recommend and ply again.
29419,Best Looter Shooter
29420,"Played this on all platforms, between PS3, X360, X1, PS4 and PC, this game just has enough content to have you playing for hours straight."
29421,The best Borderlands game
29422,it is good

29424,"Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get into a groove with a game with friends in quite the same way as this one.

All I wanted for years was Blands3, and now it’s here and it’s sort of not the same.

I guess I’m just an old-boi now."
29425,"I highly recommend this game, Krieg main, NIPPLE SALADS"
29426,"good game
"
29427,Still better than 3.

29431,"Its a great game! clever, funny, fun, good music, enjoayable gamplay, good replay value, LOTS of content! play this game is fun!"
29432,"You shoot stuff, to get better stuff, then you shoot more stuff with that stuff to get even MORE stuff to be able to shoot BIGGER stuff"
29433,It was good.
29434,"Borderlands 2 used to have a native Linux client, but an update broke the play between Windows and Linux machines. Luckily, I can use the Windows install with Proton 5 to keep playing, and it works great.

Glad to be back in the Borderlands."
29435,It Borderlands. Pump it.
29436,noice

29439,looty shooty
29440,"Great Game with great graphics, amazing and crazy weapons, and awesome story"
29441,"It's borderlands, you will probably like it.  Played on Xbox previously, got this on sale"
29442,Yes. It is a very fun experience even for people who do not play too many shooters. The art-style and character of it all is supreme.
29443,love the co op and the storyline as well
29444,"I love the art style behind this game, but the game itself is just not for me."
29445,"I find this game to be simple and fun. When games keep it simple, they can really sharpen their focus and make good concepts into great execution. For those who love comedic RPG FPS games, this is a must play."
29446,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite games to date. Would highly recommend. The story is interesting and engaging, the characters are well-written and very well-represented, and the gameplay itself is very enjoyable. Yes, it can be a bit buggy or laggy, but is nonetheless one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing."
29447,yes
29448,do i really need to say anything
29449,"it is a fun game 
"
29450,Extremely fun with friends. Definitely one of the best coop shooters out there. Highly recommend!
29451,"Easily the best in the trilogy.

Amazing Writing, THE BEST VILLAIN EVER. Will definetely playthrough it 100x more times."
29452,"I've only completed the base story so far is doing TVHM currently. The graphics are unique and nice (Max Setting Btw), Story was good, It was really fun and quite an enjoyable experience. 
Overall 9/10"
29453,Best looter shooter ever. Period.
29454,"With the ever-present dialogue from the villain, Handsome Jack, being a core element of this game, i can say that Borderlands 2 joins the ranks for one of the best villain characters in gaming. The story is entertaining, the combat is tight, responsive and engaging, and the environments are varied enough to not become too stale.

Like many have mentioned, this is a game all about the loot, where i have spent countless hours comparing the stats of 2 assault rifles, but it never felt like a chore, and i'm sure keyed into whatever part of the human brain loot boxes were designed to trigger. Simply put, the loot system is addictive as hell.

If you are a fan of AAA FPS games with humor, a memorable villain and guns as far as the eye can see, this is most definitely the game for you."
29455,Very fun and immersive game with likeable funny and strong characters. The dialogue is clever and funny and well written with the voice acting being great. the action is great and you feel the heat when things start to get tricky.
29456,"Borderlands 2 was a superb sequel to the first game. The story line is by far the best in the whole series so far, handsome Jack is definitely the star the game and he is the villain. The game play also improves from the first title with the min map a much wanted addition. No complaint here from me except one. The gun system is something i didn't like all too much. I felt i was trading too much a good trait and suffering with the bad ones all too much. The gun effects were little too much at times and wonky with the way they spread and shot. But when you did get a good gun my was it great!!! Plenty of DLC and i mean plenty too keep you occupied even after you beat the games story line mode. BL 2 is a must and arguably the best still in the franchise."
29457,Good Game
29458,9/10
29459,"very big bang good
"
29460,Quite enjoyable.
29461,good game to play with friends!

29466,"Great game I enjoy playing. Fun with friends
"
29467,BL2 a great game its better than BL3 so im sticking with it
29468,"Great game. Lots to do tons of enemies,bosses maps.The graphics are great. I like the fact they'res different elements of guns and different color schemes. Level 1-30 Concludes the story and 30-50 Is just the story redone but harder than usual so not worth playing unless you're really into it. DLC is fun also"
29469,its good
29470,"Bought this game on sale, and I'm happy I did. For an eight year old game, it's remarkably sharp. Good graphics, fun quests, and a refreshingly interesting story and dialog. It actually makes me laugh out loud on occasion, which is a sweet bonus. 

And although its loot suffers from the usual colour-coded simplicity, the specs of the guns and shields aren't entirely linear. The balance of different special abilities, damage, reload time, clip size, etc. makes the choice of weapon interesting.

The best thing about this game? I feel like I'm running around in a Road Warrior movie. Life is cheap. Things go boom. And the bad guys are fucking crazy."
29471,very good story. took me a few years to beat it but i did it!
29472,it also gud
29473,I was really enjoying this game. Twice I got all the way to killing Flynt and when I returned to the next day I was back to Sir whatever the hell his name is. I uninstalled and will not waste my time anymore
29474,Very Good
29475,Its so fun to build classes and it feels amazing when you get that gun thats jusssst right! It took me so long to get into this game and im beating myself over it. Cant wait to play BL3!
29476,guns go boom
29477,"Bloody Good Fun

29482,"No cross play and refuses to run under Proton, if you're looking to buy due to Linux be aware you'll be playing alone."
29483,Definitly nice atmosphere to be in. With some friends this game will you give lots of fun

29503,old graphics / old game / shooter with additional mechanics (skill tree / loot farming / rarities+variations of items) / great in coop with friends or even with strangers. Enjoyed it very much
29504,its ok
29505,"its a great game 
"
29506,"heard a lot from friends, seems ok but if you like this kind of games buy the 3 not the 2"
29507,"I'd say it's better than 3 I guess
"
29508,"awesome game 
"
29509,Just endless fun
29510,Borderlands 2 is THE looter-shooter. Destiny 2 wishes it could be this game. Also it's funny
29511,"Best Coop game ever!
Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - best DLC!
Flamerock Refuge Music - best Soundtrack!"
29512,"i love it
"
29513,pretty damn fun
29514,"Its a shame to write this review because I geniuenly want to enjoy this game, it has lots of incredible charm and concepts but it just doesnt work most of the time. Besides the artstyle, general theme and Handsome Jack, the game is incredibly lacking in everywhere else. 
Most weapons suck to use. Automatic rifles and SMGs barely do anydamage, and shotguns, pistols and semi-auto rifles do the most damage, but arent fun to shoot. This sucks because I love the idea of the different companies with their own design spins and special attributes on the weapons. 

Fighting enemies is barely fun, the only fun enemy I fought were the beginning yeti-like creatures and Loader robots who you could dynamically destroy limbs to incapcitate them, otherwise, all other enemies are just giant bullet spongies that sit far away and slowly chips at you, or rushes you, and who you could shoot back at by hiding behind cover, like a poor GearsOfWar ripoff without a cover mechanic, using a sniper until you run out of ammo, and must use a god-help you, shitty automatic weapon.

The class system is incredibly meh. Siren just sucks and is boring, Zero has some interesting abilities but his overall edginess is unfunnily painful, commando is a meh, effective but meh and so is gunzerker.

TL;DR Game with tons of charm ruined with a very mediocre, shoot at the bullet sponge, gameplay and meh story (besides Handsome jack, love that man)
"
29515,Get one (or 3 of your buddies) and enjoy this game for the mindless fun that this game is.
29516,Funny game because it is hilariously funny sex. I want to see claptrap fucking get his penis ripped off and fucking die like a bitch fuck claptrap. 9/10
29517,"Better writing than 3 and better gameplay than the original. Strikes a more re-playable balance between 1 and 3. It's one of the best shoot n' loot games out there, and your time and money will not be wasted. The DLC only make the game more enjoyable and expand the universe in a healthy way. Great pickup and great time-sink."
29518,very ggod
29519,pog
29520,amazing and so funny
29521,"the Name ""kaokan"" is apparently offensive or profane. As i am not willing to change my name, a  name that was always okay before and is fine in every other game, I am no longer able to even start the game. Fix your profanity filter for names please"
29522,It is nice!
29523,"350 hours. Yea. Play this game. Great with friends, still fun without"

29531,"Great game, fun to play with friends. Excellent story and the characters really bring it all together."
29532,"I'm not a fan. Borderlands 1 was decent, but this is too difficult to play alone without grinding. With friends, it is far too easy. Story has some good moments. Gunplay is nothing incredible. Setpieces are a lot better than Borderlands 1.

4/10"
29533,Played solo. Still so much fun.
29534,"Borderlands gives you so much to do in the funniest ways with friends. what better way to come together than killing things that make sentences that make no sense at all, or blowing a railway up for a crazy murder child's enjoyment."

Still best game ever"
29595,best game ever
29596,Incredible
29597,Well what can i say 280 hours finished the story a few times and i can steel go back and play the game while enjoying it. It's a good solo experience but if you have friends to paly with you will enjoy it even more. Most likely you will end up not carig about the story and you will go around with you friends blowing up staff and having a laugh in general having a good time. if you are hesitant to buy the game just go for it and if non of your friend don't have it but whant it just split the cost of the 4 pack non of you will regret it.
29598,Handsome Jack is dad
29599,yes
29600,I find playing coop is quite fun playing together
29601,Tried to play coop between windows and mac. did not work. all other games played fine
29602,"very good, its a game you can play multiple times"
29603,"if you are into survival, multiplayer, crafting games you will love this game because its just soo much fun to play so i would highly recommend playing this game."
29604,H
29605,"A awesomely done looter shooter, the dialogues and characters are very well made. A bit old now, but the HD textures makes up for it. Must buy if you get it on sell."
29606,"I recommend it because I've had a lot of fun with it over the years, and its fun to go through a few missions, or even the entire game, with friends. I found it a lot more fun before I'd played a lot of other games that honestly make it look kinda shit. 

If you want a good RPG, play something else.
If you want a good shooter, play something else.
If you want a funny game, DEFINITELY play something else.
If you want to spend some time mindlessly shooting robots over and over with your friends while a plethora of mildly irritating voices shout at you over an intercom, play this.

It's evident that this game is quite badly made as far as games go, it never bothered me before, but there are so many collision issues, bad level design, boring and repetitive enemies, and so many fucking glitches. It's a bad game, but kind of endearing at times. Handsome Jack is great, Claptrap isn't overly annoying here, but most of the other characters can fuck themselves.

All I'm saying is, don't expect an incredible game. 

Note: I used to have maybe a hundred or two extra hours on my account until steam glitched years ago and wiped most of my hours from all of my games somehow."
29607,"Great game,  playing cooperatively with mac users is hard though. Character progression does not always sync via steam"
29608,Absolutely incredible game especially once you starts figuring out how things work I.E Loot Grinding to get better items and make the game just a bit easier
29609,Awesome
29610,Fun Game
29611,"Still holds up as one of the best loot shooters out there. Better than every other Borderlands, even 3. Play. This. Game. Worth every cent."

29629,Pretty bad tbh.
29630,it fun fortnite fun so fortnite fun
29631,proof that god loves us
29632,"I've only played the first 3 story missions and I'm already drawn to the game. The dialogue has improved amazingly compared to the first. The side missions feel worth doing, especially the gathering of tapes. In the first Borderlands, the tapes felt a bit pointless. They weren't being acknowledged by any of the NPCs, and the stories told by Tannis were not really worth hearing. But, so far I have listened to 3 tapes in Borderlands 2 and I'm itching to look for more in the side missions."
29633,It's fun
29634,"Game still fun to play even in 2020, even better with friends."
29635,really good you should check it out
29636,uwu
29637,"If you haven't played this game by now, You're a damn fool. Borderlands 2 has been the entry game for a lot of people including my self to the series. IF you like guns, rocket launchers and fighting midgets on top of four armed gorillas then you're in heaven. Story is great and the action is even better,"
29638,One of the greatest games that i have ever played. From the raunchy comedy to the excellent graphics and gameplay. all at a great price. you just cant beat it
29639,Great if you like games like Far Cry
29640,fun game
29641,#1 game made since games were made. Simple as that.
29642,"daora
"
29643,it's fun to play with your friends :D
29644,Yes!
29645,"Borderlands 2 absolutely holds up in 2020, but in my opinion only as a multiplayer experience. 

I couldn't get through it the first time on my own because the grinding you have to do is unreal, but playing with a friend introduces a whole new layer of depth to the game.

A lot of character moments happen when you play with a friend (or multiple) as you cause chaos and mayhem together. 

I wholeheartedly recommend this game for any of group of people looking to play a multiplayer shooter together."
29646,love the co-op mode
29647,Rather play this one rather than Borderlands 3 but all the borderlands games are great and funny.
29648,I really enjoy the story to this game.
29649,"I would give the original Borderlands 2 and all of the original DLC and UVHM mode a 10 out of 10 score. The gameplay and the replay value are nothing short of incredible, BUT....and here is the BAD part, after reading all the negative reviews about the DLC that is an intro to BL3 (Borderlands 2: Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary) and in particular the fact they removed the ability to use over power levels up to OP8 WHICH I PAID FOR IN UVHM....THEN they have the nerve to stop allowing free download and charge $15 for what many have described as totally NOT worth paying for....I can only say I feel stabbed in the back.

To add insult to injury, I now have to look at their advertising for BL3 on my BL2 home screen. Unless they offer the last DLC for FREE on a permanent basis, I won't even consider buying BL3. In fact I am DONE with ever purchasing anything ever again from this franchise. If the folks at Gearbox are seeing this, I hope you change your mind about how lousy you are treating your loyal fanbase....at least we WERE loyal until you decided to be greedy and turn out an inferior product that does not ring true to the previous releases."
29650,"One of the best shooters out there, no doubt but the comic feel of the game adds something more. Also, does not take too much of graphic power to run... that's a win-win."
29651,Love it. <3
29652,Great mindless shooting looting fun!
29653,"Enjoyed the first, enjoying this more; still holds up against more current shooter ARPGs with it's leveling/ perk tree system and looting."
29654,"Fun introduction to new character, variation of weapons, nice gameplay, & fun multiplayer (if stable connection)"
29655,"TL:DR ver:
Was a fun lil game, ruined by stream of never ending, scummy, borderline pay2win DLCs.
Its not a proper RPG, u cant role play for sheet. This thing is more on rails than Witcher 3 (gr8 game btw, get it and all its DLCs RIGHT NOW). Music is good, and the shoot is...meh.
Buy in on sale if for $2, if you dont mind giving pocket change to Randy ""I'll screw the gamers n my devs for pocket change"" Pitchford. If you really want DLCs, get deals da include the 2 char classes, n the 2 campaigns for Captain Scarlett and Tiny Tina.

Long ver:
Borderlands 2 and pre-sequel, offer a rather in depth look, and dare I say, fascinating look into the words and actions of the most colorful and pathological minds of our time, namely, Anthony Burch and the eve so slimy, Randy Pitchford. People would often say: ""It could be worse. At least, you are not Anthony Burch"" for good reason. He is a man, if one could call this creature a man; who opt for an ""open marriage"", getting cuckolded whilst this wife sleeps around; who framed a tweet from the infamous grifter, Anita Sarkeesian and still thought himself a game developing; and break his knees from bending them so many times to SJWs; who lost his Wii to his wife after she divorce him. What we have here, sirs, is a literally a man who lost his wee to his wife after she cuc-ked and divorced him. While Randy Pitchford is the man who ruined Duke Nuke (remember what happened to Mega Ton ed.?), made deals with Epic, and exploit his employees. 

Gameplay wise, the shooting feels weak and loose. Its not tactical; its not brutal, and its not RPG. The only element it borrow form RPG games, is the RNG loot system. Which just make the game a lot more boring and grindy than it should've being. Not a problem until the NG+ and NG+++xyz, but a huge problem, if you are one of those guys who will be putting 1k+ hr into it. You get to pick a class but for half of their builds, their special abilities dont get used often enough until the end game, when you get enough DLC pay2win weapons and skill points to synergize and finally getting that awesome melee build to work. The other half is the opposite, fun and useful at first, but useless in NG+. There is no lean button. and crouching behind cover to shoot is made even worse by the giant hitboxes on environmental entities. For example, a wrist thick railing that act as a wall and cover enemies from fire; or if it looks like you can shoot through yours, but can't, while the other guy can still shoot you through it; or crouching to shoot a rocket, only to find da the 4ft box you are hiding behind is 5ft high, making you eat 100% damage of your own rocket.

Artistically, the game is very pretty, ages well due to its style, with great music. The writing is where the fun comes in. There is some good part and bad parts. Some might find the character and dialogues cringy, juvenile, autistic and filled with outdated memes, but trust me, it is all worth it. For judging Randy and Anthony by their deeds in and outside of the games is a gift that never stops giving."
29656,Cool.
29657,"Dang how did i not know about this game earlier? If you like DOOM, you will probably like this game a lot!"
29658,9/10
29659,is very good
29660,"One of my favorite games of all time. 

Engaging story, lovable characters, fun gameplay mechanics. DLCs are either average or REALLY GOOD, with none of them being objectively bad in my opinion (my favorite, like many, is the DnD themed Assault on Dragon Keep). Good replayability as well with the inclusion of multiple classes that all play uniquely and can be built differently. After completing numerous playthroughs I found myself trying to get all the legendary weapon drops - something that others might not enjoy but that I loved. 

The biggest shortcoming in my opinion is how some of the playable characters are worlds more interesting than others. For example, the Commando and the Gunzerker are relatively run of the mill weapon-focused characters that have a large reliance on the types of guns they have equipped in most situations. Characters like Zer0 and Maya rely on their weapons, but also heavily on their class abilities. The Commando and the Gunzerker don't really even have to use their abilities to beat the game.

I give this game a 9/10"
29661,mmmmm v ery g ood  g   ames!??!~?!?!?
29662,yes
29663,"This is buy far, one of the most fun games out there today, even to this day and still more entertainment  as before and too those who have not play it yet my own advic is, do it now."
29664,good game if you like loot and playing with friends otherwise dont buy it
29665,PROTECT ME SQUIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !

29674,cool game yes
29675,"Gameplay has a steady pace, battles are fun as much as designing your own robots."
29676,it wasnt a fun game
29677,the best of the series
29678,damn good game played since i was a little kid
29679,"Very hard to get tired of this game, even less so with the dlcs. Great story, great characters, amazing villain and the bests dlcs ever (specially torgue's and tiny tina's)."
29680,Just the pure amazing and unique graphics and compelling storyline make this game a must buy.

29684,"Play the game with guns

"
29685,i love this game
29686,"I enjoyed this game thoroughly. The game has wonderful main mission and the side missions are interesting as well. Not to mention, it has some great DLCs too. I recommend you play with friends as that multiplies the fun you have while you play. I would strongly recommend this game to you."
29687,n9 joh-o
29688,F.uck yea i love this game who wouldn't. if you don't own this game you are not a true gamer.
29689,da best
29690,addictive and frustrating love it
29691,"I currently have 51 hours of PC playtime but i have played through the game on Xbox as well multiple times. I am just now picking it back up to play through with some new friends. Wonderful game with amazing art style. Love the humor and story of this game, the RPG elements are awesome and really allow you to customize your character and allows for many play throughs. Fun to play solo but the fun increases tenfold when you have a friend or 2 to play with."
29692,The one and only.
29693,Boom Bewm V gud
29694,A gun screams. Do i need to explain anything else?

Its like Gauntlet legends meets halo... I really liked it. I'm excited for the new ones. 

Its a little buggy on linux, nothing too bad though."
29703,bruh
29704,Its fun c:
29705,Hundreds of hours of fun are contained in this game. 9/10
29706,fun game alot of hours of replayablilty
29707,lots of gunz
29708,this game is a literal shit fest full of shooting shit and getting loot in return for making gun shoot
29709,EPİC
29710,"When the game first came out it was really good. But now, there are so many gliitches with the game, software, save and launcher problems that do not get fixed or the support team never bothers to respond for help. İt used to be a good game to play but not anymore..."
29711,i honestly just really like borderlands their whole franchise and yea i support it and recommend to others.
29712,Gud game
29713,yes
29714,in my top 5 of all time
29715,"Much wow, many guns"
29716,"Fun co op campaign, play with your friends,but everything changes when getting the best loot drop from bosses, everybody turns piranhas, tryna get the loot before anyone else rather than reviving your friend thats dying after getting smacked by the boss,Oof."
29717,i like it.
29718,"wow, why did i miss this until now?"
29719,gud game
29720,Nice game
29721,fun
29722,yeah
29723,"If you looking for fun + amazing stories + crazy characters with their dialogues + badass weapons and equipment, this is the game for you. 6 hunters for you to choose, each has individual skills with multiple play styles. DLCs are extremely fun as well. 

This is the story between borderlands, borderlands pre-sequel, and borderlands 3. There are a lot of stories to be told and discover from this franchise. 

Coop is available all the time, able to enjoy the game in 400%, as well as trolling your friends. 

I recommend you get all the story type DLCs. For maximum fun and maximum level

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those gamer who love grinding and achieve maximum gears:
There are 3 difficulties for you and your friends to grind, sadly the higher difficulty can only be unlock by finish playing the first game (1st difficulty). Similar to the 3rd difficulty but this time is to finish the 2nd difficulty.

There are only a few minor exploits that i found, but overall, this game is well designed and to be well played."
29724,"MY FAVORITE GAME.
LOOT AND SHOOT"
29725,fucking amazing
29726,Very Awesome.
29727,"one of the only fps i play
"
29728,"This game is a blast. Hours upon hours of hilarious, action-packed content. I love all the Borderlands games but this is the very best one in terms of story."
29729,"other than a good story line, there's always more to do after the main story line that keeps you busy ages afterwards."
29730,Farms item for 3 hours *does not get it*. 10/10 would farm again.
29731,best game of all time
29732,"this game is . . . ok.

I prefer destiny but that's my opinion since I know that there's a weird thing where people love either borderlands or destiny and I don't know why this game though I hate it

in summary there were parts I absolutely did love such as the narrator he put a nice intro hyped me up as like a wild west of space thing that destiny tried to do with forsaken but they actually did it incredibly well but after the ""A planet that is rumoured to contain riches beyond wonder and also dangers unfathomable"" - it goes to a cutscene introduces the situation who the bad guy is who I also liked but then claptrap came in

claptrap is pure shit

what the actual fuck

thats when I started hating this game as it sets it up as a really cool lawless frontier bounty hunter kindof vibe and then goes to the fucking slums of what I would imagine dumpster home living space texas would look like mixed with motherfucking mad max the gameplay is a step down from all of destiny and while the element system used is actually rather clever for taking down enemies more efficiently it feels more like a zombie survival game and all of them  have guns and take this disadvantage and poor game design and fix it by implementing your super being recharged basically every 20 seconds and second wind which you have to abuse the absolute shit out of. After that theres even more slum dumpster texas thrown in where you have a focus on guns and badass tokens and get to have 4 guns to neglect the armor system which isn't in the game at all every gun feels about the same minus the hyperion guns and throw away ones but come on and then the levelling system expects you to do side quests and shit along the way in order to be able to actually finish the campaign when a good campaign would have the levelling system go along with the campaign evenly. Then somehow my game is bugged to have all the dlc and I just go along with it and play the sand treasure one with captain scarlett and once again does the cool hyped up narration and introduces where you're at and they manage to make the humour somewhat non shitty garbage and at least semi ok but it's still a letdown from what I would want from the game I didn't come here for dumpster living space texas I came here for the ""lawless frontier and evil space corporations with a desert sailing pirate adventure on the side"" of which I got none of

they call this destiny with a potty mouth

it's literally takes all the mechanics from it makes it half of what it was and adds a robot with a high pitch whiny voice making a toxic xbox live 5 year olds idea of a joke every time he opens his mouth

I have enjoyed this game once or twice when I manage to find a spot where I can find that cool vibe I was looking for but then almost immediately after I either hear my characters comments someone else's comments or I see a lootable porta potty across my field of view ruining it almost immediately

I don't understand why people get into this but then again some people don't understand destiny either

looter shooters are weird."
29733,"Keep stuck in ""Creating online session"", can't even play with friends???"
29734,"Great shooter game with unique graphic style. If you're looking for a game where you can kick some as*es, and laugh on some really good jokes with bunch of friends, this is the right choice."
29735,"Ahh, yes. What a nice and good shooter game, It's rarely I like shooter game. But this one, I love it. I've never satisfied with one weapon, When i found a good weapon, I always find better weapon. XD"
29736,"Very fun to play with friends 
pros:
Fun,Lots of missions

cons:
friends not included with game"
29737,hello gerbox plz mack more borderlands games plz i love your games :)
29738,"there's so much replayability to this game, its worth it"
29739,Very fun game
29740,uhh yeah.. pretty good yeah
29741,it good
29742,nice game i love it
29743,"If you love crazy loot stuffs (like legendary weopons kinda things) and boss fights  ------> Borderlands 2
I also recommend you to play with a friend. It is much more fun. Whenever we encountered a rare weapon loot box, we were like 6 years old children opening their birthday gifts :D"
29744,Great Game
29745,peepee poopoo
29746,MARVELOUS

7/10"
29751,Great Story & fun Co-Op with friends or the public.
29752,it pretty good so far just dont go into the game not knowing anything and then going with the Zer0 character. Bad Choice!
29753,"i did NOT expect to get a story this long lmao 

its fun singleplayer and with friends too"
29754,please for the love of god put the auto bullet pickup from containers feature in borderlands 3 in this game I AM LAZY AND I WANNA SHOOT
29755,great fun
29756,"Where to start... hmm... okay... BEST & ONLY ''GRIND'' INCLUDED GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED WITH MY FRIENDS! okay, I'm calm. Let the Marcus tell you a story.

''GRIND'' = ''LOOTER-SHOOTER''"
29757,IT WONT SHOW IN LIBRARY
29758,"It's like The Legend of Zelda, but with guns and a Half-Life 2-esque soundtrack; linear, but with many side quests and exploration. It is a bit difficult, but also very fun."
29759,Great game
29760,:)
29761,It is really fun especially with friends and it has a great story line.
29762,"I love it so much, its so much fun when you play alone or with friends
"
29763,great game but doesnt work well with gtx 1080
29764,"yes
"
29765,One of the best games ever!
29766,:)
29767,great game!
29768,THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE !!!!
29769,إنها لعبة رائعة حقًا! من المحتمل أن يصبح الرماة من منظور الشخص الأول أفضل نوع من الألعاب على الإطلاق بسبب هذه اللعبة! لديها قصة ورسومات وأسلحة مذهلة! فقط يجعلك تفكر ، نهب. لوط .. لوط! عندما تحصل على أسطوري! أعني ، فقط انظر إلى المقطع الدعائي وسترى! كل شيء ، نعم. كل شيء
29770,"It's a wonderful game to have a gaming night, to skip time or just to have fun playing and getting in the story line"
29771,"One of the most entertaining games the world has to offer.
Played Part 2 on Pc, Ps3 and Ps4 for thousands of hours.
-The community is awesome, you will always find somebody to play with.
-Story, artwork, and NPCs are full of love.
-Almost limitless amounts of weapons and variations of customizing + 
-There are dozens of well fitting references all over the game - about movies and other games.
-There is also a high replay value due to NG+, NG++ (aka TVHM, UVHM) and new loot, higher difficulty as well as new Mobs/Enemys
-Awesome DLC content
A must have for every (Looter)-Shooter lover."
29772,"This is one of the only shooters that I genuinely have enjoyed. There's an inherent quirkiness and over-the-top-ness about everything that makes this game less serious than other shooters. There's a likeability about almost all the characters - even the villains. 

There's absolutely no stealth to this game, so you have to go in guns blazing but each class does feel different in terms of how to play. 

Playing solo or with friends is fun and there is immense replayability to the game. Would highly recommend this :)"
29773,IT WAS FUN TO PLAY
29774,"ive been playing with 2 friends having an absolute blast. gameplay is fun, yet complex. the first ennemies are abviously easy, later it does require some team strategy. the story is fun but yet not really the main point when playing with 3 people. playing it alone is fine too, although i recommand playing it with friends, so much more fun. in addition the loot is better and the foes are stronger when ur in coop. one thing i didnt like though was the map. if you dont know how pandora is build, the ingame map wont tell you shit. still the massive ammount of various guns and the fun charakters are a blast. in conclusion i think this game is really playable in 2020, especially with friends."
29775,"brabo
"
29776,"The gamethat started hthe loot and shoot gaming community. Still very good for it time, and helll still better than the third entry. A recommend buy if you loot FPS, and just playing co-op with online player or friends."
29777,love this game and always will i love the concept!
29778,this game makes my pp hard :)
29779,"The game overall is great, but there is one problem that I have with it. 
Every time I quit the game and come back hours later it, the game completely freezes when I press the ""Continue"" button making the experience a little annoying, but as I said the game is great 
8/10 just because of that little bug or glitch"
29780,"I am someone who plays a lot of video games and will replay my favorites forever. This is a game I love, especially playing as one of the characters that is not included in the base game, but I have to steel myself every time I start a new playthrough. This game is incredibly fun, but I also am someone who will play a game just because I am attached to a character. Unsurprisingly, since this happens in other games in this franchise as well, things happen plot-wise to one of my favorite NPCs that were devastating to watch the first time around. If you are someone who does not get attached to characters or care much for plot, this is a game that you will absolutely love. It is beautiful, it is easy to navigate, and you will have the time of your life mowing down enemies and picking up shiny new loot. If you are like me, just plan ahead for the time to grieve after you hit certain story points and don't schedule a date that same day."
29781,Fun game
29782,good gayme
29783,"The difficulty is either boringly easy or frustratingly hard, the enemy AI is either useless or unbeatable, and the backpack size makes you spend the majority of your time running back and forth. Overall a 5/10 game at most"
29784,is very guddddddddd
29785,Only shooter better than B1.  Greatest atmosphere.
29786,.
29787,"friends dragged me into fighting terramorphous or w/e the bastard's name is and i was only level 3 when the fight started. by the end, i was like level 23. 10/10 would recommend that ridiculous experience again"
29788,"Amazing game, great humor that is very refreshing compared to other games. The gameplay is slightly repetitive but overall fun and engaging. High recomendation from me."
29789,"Get,Good, Super fun, Should get
"
29790,its gud
29791,"Fun and unique cell shaded shooter! fun by yourself, but even better with friends!"
29792,yea

29800,"this is a great game.
after playing for about 21 hours I can say that I will be able to put hundreds of hours into this game.
looking forward to buying and playing Borderlands 3 in the future.
well worth the money."
29801,"I've been a fan of the Borderlands series for a long time and just recently acquired the newest installment of the series. All of the games have an iconic feel and character, and I would love to play this game with anyone new to the series."
29802,it's a nice game and has a 4-multiplayer feature.
29803,This shit will keep you busy

29806,best came out there when it comes to the looter-shooter craze
29807,gun go brr brr
29808,For everything !
29809,"I would've rated this game negatively a couple years ago. Revisiting the series with Borderlands 3 made me really appreciate BL2, as the gameplay is amazing. I can't say much as I haven't played the game very long (most of my 9 hours are my siblings playing), but it is a very VERY good game. Well worth the $10 I paid for it."
29810,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!
29811,good fun
29812,".
"
29813,worth to play!
29814,This game is so addictive. I need to go and do something else but what if the next loot box is legendary???
29815,"Probably better off getting this on the console of your choice or just outside of Steam if possible, because the Steam version of this game has issues. Mostly related to network play. If you want to play with others, expect the latest version to crash, freeze and disconnect you frequently, not to mention sometimes you won't be able to start up the game without a 5-10 minute wait because the SHiFT servers hate your computer and decided they need to SLOWLY, EVER SO SLOWLY try to connect (and fail). A day or two later it might correct itself and you can play online, but even if you DO connect to someone your experience will be sluggish with a lot of lag. And if you're the host your game will freeze, oftentimes not even bothering to close out the application (crashing is preferable because at least it's quicker and saves you SOME hassle), and this will happen frequently. It's not a matter of ""if"" for me, it's a matter of ""when"" because EVERY time I play online either the game will disconnect me from online and leave me alone or freeze up my game for no reason whatsoever. Almost always the latter, which also costs me progress as the autosaves don't seem to do the trick for keeping quest progress.

It's utter bullshit."
29816,good game
29817,"This game is definitely one of my favourites. From the gunplay to the silly dialogues that happen.
I just cannot recommend it enough.
10/10 would shoot Face McShooty in the face again."
29818,its real good. love it lots. BUT ITS NOT FORK NITE SO BAD GAME
29819,5 years of playing this still haven't beaten quality game XD
29820,"Borderlands, gud gaem"
29821,One of the best shooters I've played
29822,good game but it is relly hard to new players and peple ho are new to frst persun shoter
29823,"Significantly better story writing than BL3, that's for sure"
29824,"Vault hunter:you cant just commit massacre on a planet wide scale
handsome jack:haha warrior go rawr
"
29825,"This is, hands-down, my favorite game. You can play it solo or play it co-op, which I love. I have owned it across three platforms and have spent far too many hours playing it across them all (infinite replayability for me). I love the gameplay of the Borderlands franchise and all of the guns. 
That said, what makes this game a real standout for me is Handsome Jack. Borderlands 2 has a decent story to it, but that story becomes great because of its villain. Jack is a fantastic character with a strong story, great dialogue, and an amazing voice actor."
29826,Really enjoy the game but can't play it much since it causes vertigo :(.
29827,yes
29828,Worth your time and money!!
29829,is alright i guess

I beat this game a hot minute ago with my sister steph, we played for hours the weapons are amazing and people are great. if you found this helpful please send me some steam points"
29859,"Nice game, Various guns available and they are all ready to break some bones and punch holes on skulls."
29860,Good very good but sadly no one plays in sea
29861,"Good game. Came to it late in its lifetime and its been a great use of time during lockdown. Quality game, love the wacky stuff some of the NPCs say as you run around, with references that hold up to the test of time. Some great commentary on capitalism and its inherent issues, like the engineers yelling about medical insurance when you shoot them or how they just paid off their house. Woah, double rainbow all the wayyy! 

I'm 45 hours in and haven't even finished the main storyline, and thats just from alternating between one main quest mission and then a few side quests. Great overall."
29862,"played in 2020 and didnt liked the graphics may be go with borderlands3 that has good graphics compared to this one , cinematic were good"
29863,This is a game
29864,"even in 2020, I still enjoy this games"
29865,I can see why people say this is one of the greatest coop fps games of all time
29866,cmon
29867,zero is hot af
29868,"Muito divertido tanto com amigos como sozinho, mas claro que com amigos fica bem melhor kkkkkk
to economizando pra comprar o borderlands 3"
29869,"is buying this game a good plan?
yes
 not only that 
its a GOOD PLAN, GREAT PLAN"
29870,I hate and love claptrap
29871,Great game. Torgue is Epic!
29872,So good I had to sacrifice this game to the Firehawk before I could continue. 4/5 too much water.
29873,"Wilhelm isn't balanced for single player and I'm stuck in the story mode until I can either beat it all the sudden or find a friend who suddenly feels like playing this game with me when the 3rd one just came out. That's honestly really dumb,"
29874,"Diz Game Dooooooopeeeeeeee ;D #TinyTinaVoice. . . . .

Friendly Advice. . . . Pls buy the game of the year bundle (this time) because it will cost you less. . . . learned the hard way here lol"
29875,"Does it have Cliff Racers? yes. They Are Named Rakk. 
Does This make it a bad game? almost, but everything else is exceptional. 

7/10 would backtrack for Moxxy again."
29876,"played like 500 hours on console, great series and this is the best installment"
29877,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
29878,it's ok
29879,borderlands at its peak
29880,nice
29881,yes
29882, I love this game! Great for beginner gamers and the advanced gamers.
29883,G-Box Softies really outdid themselves this time
29884,"it is good game to play for fun and get the funny jokes that is in the game, like this game and i can,t wait to play borderlands 3 because it might have a better story then B2 ( Borderlands 2 ) but yeah if you like good story and funny NPC in game get this game right now it is the best game i have play and that what you say if you play."
29885,"Great story with a ton of content, the dlc's are the best part of the game especially while playing with friends"
29886,It Amazing
29887,Great game with lots of content. The unique characters give 6 different ways to play. The NPCs and their dialogue along makes this game worth it! I recommend getting the Handsome Collection (preferably on sale) to get all the content available save for CC&TFFS. It's fun alone and with friends and the plethora of challenges to do gives you plenty of things to do (and grind for if you really wish to do so).
29888,"Playing on the 2019 imac. Runs well, a lot of fun. Waiting on borderlands 3 for mac on steam. I know it's on the epic store but I'd rather all my games be in one place if possible."
29889,wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
29890,YES!
29891,Great game!
29892,"can't get past the tutorial 
"
29893,Social distancing baby!!!
29894,yes
29895,Awesome game
29896,"I really recommend Borderlands 2, but after playing 3 I can't do so wholeheartedly anymore.

Yes, BL3 has a shit story, but one of my main criticisms of BL2 was what I considered god-awful combat, and BL3 fixes that. The gameplay is a lot better in that game, and frankly makes BL2 somewhat obsolete in that respect.

But I'll still recommend it for the story and witty writing. Whatever you may think of Anthony Burch's writing skill, it's clear that his influence made Borderlands one of the best comedy game series, with humour that may fall flat at times, but well thought out characters, from the delibrately annoying Claptrap, to the insane 13-year-old Tina (and her side quest somewhat shows why she falls off the deep end), all the way to the main antagonist, Handsome Jack, who you just want to punch in the face if you met him in real life, not because he's annoying as shit (hello Tyreen and Troy Calypso) but because he is actually villainous and not a freaking tryhard, and even then he has a certain charm to him.

The classes good as well, although full disclosure, I've only played as Maya and Gaige (who I main) so when I say they are all good barring those two it's really from other players experiences with them and my own reading up on them short of actually playing as them.

Overall I would recommend Borderlands 2 for only one reason nowadays, the story. But it's one with such memorable characters (heck, even Roland the hum-drum soldier dude is actually interesting compared to most soldier types in other shooters), fantastic writing, and a lot of loot at the side, oh and did I mention that the DLC, Dragon Keep especially, are all pretty good? Yeah, get this immediately if you want a good story, and nothing else really.

7/10"
29897,Better than warframe!
