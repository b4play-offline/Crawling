11,Great overall game
12,"Generally fun game. Incredibly realistic. Very frustrating at times and Gaijin consistently makes terrible decisions and ignores the community, but at the end of the day there's no other game with the level of detail and realism of War Thunder, and it's genuinely fun and always has fresh challenges and skills to learn as you slowly progress through the tech tree. Pro tip from a level 100 marshal: PLAY MULTIPLE NATIONS. It will make you like 20x better"
13,It has very good graphics and good world history
14,"love planes, tanks, ships, helecopters?    if you do then this game is for you i highly recomend it"
15,good game. Be careful when you rush one person because it's guaranteed that like 5 other people will come over for that one free kill :/
16,didnt know you actually have to sell your soul to play the game
17,I don't know how and why sweats exist in a game like this but otherwise very nice game.
18,An amazing game overall. Few bugs here and there but mostly a very fun and realistic war game!
19,"I really like this game but Gaijin seems to be doing everything they can to ruin it. Game economy is getting worse and worse, they continue to make changes that the player base almost universally despises, they simply don't listen to the player base at all as far as I can tell. I currently cannot recommend that anyone start playing this game and I'm considering abandoning it myself."
20,"nigga 
"
21,"Grind at its maximum expression. Every economy ""Improvement"" done by this company goes in detriment to the players and increase the grind. Every update always something breaks and there are things that are broken for so long it has become a feature. It will take years, YEARS of playing to get even close to research a nation's tree, IN ONE MODE (ground, aviation, naval, etc)."
22,i like to play thius game after wacghing top gun: mavarik by login pol andf lisen to the danjer sone
23,RAAAAAAAAAAAH AIM7ES
24,yes
25,Really nice game. Realistic. If you like squad you maybe would also like this game.
26,this is a good game
27,makes me want to end my life.
28,Every update just gets worse.
29,The game itself looks amazing however i found it to be excessively grindy even for an MMO and the rather dubious 'shots' that certain players make even when they are hiding behind a rock that's behind a wall that's behind a hill.
30,good
31,This game is cool
32,You don't wait for a game but sometimes come in late. The high ping can cause some rubberbanding that takes some fun out of it. I wish for more local servers with a lower ping.
33,i just started playing this and I dont know why people are hating it
34,Fun But really grindy
35,"Had to take out a second mortgage just so i could please the snail by purchasing a mig 21

36,good
37,"It puts the Ar in War, 10/10, love the skink, keep it up Ukraine #godbless"
38,It is a really good game! It combines the arcadiness in the arcade matches and the brutal realism of realistic battles. I reccomend it to anyone who likes military games or are into history since this game is really fun. 10/10
39,"big planes big guns woop woop

41,"Much like nearly every player of this game, I hate it. However, it is also approaching Factorio levels of crack."
42,Dont buy premium planes they always make you spend 60$+ just for them to nerf it a month later.....my f-5 cant even carry missiles anymore and is slow!
43,"SO REALISTIC IN VR THAT I ACTUALLY FELL AND BROKEN MY HEAD ON MY FLOOR. STILL PLAY IS NORMALY

52,fun
53,"Just a very fun game, but can induce rage."
54,It fun game you shoot plane and hope plane don't shoot you. No really the game is really fun and actually encourages you to play the game to be able to unlock better planes and there's more than just planes there's also warships and tanks.
55,The Snail took my soul I love(hate) this game
56,i love the game and since the new update [drone age] everything has got even more realistic that's why i love the game
57,fun

59,good
60,im sad
61,"game can be fun at times but ends up just frustrationg with all the diffrent stuff. Gamepay can seem outright unfair at times and if you invest to much time into the wrong items you will find out later that it was just a waste. From my view it dose feel like a pay to win game with some of the perks you get for dumping money into it. I do understand it is free to play but the grind vs pay way of playing just makes players like me angry and not enjoying the game. for example in game i can hit a target about 5 to 6 times with ammo that should work but that can turn a fire 1 round that instantly knocks me out. even seen this when i was useing a better tank with better armor, just feels like possable cheats too."
62,"P2W dogshit with an even shittier progression. Tutorials are pretty useless, and you will constantly get 1 shot or have movement disabled."
63,I like the game in general but i want to test fly every vehicle regardless of tech tree advancement
64,Pain

66,takes your money. money magnet. it likes money. it costs money to progress. it wants money. i will take your money
67,great game would recommend playing if you hate yourself and want to suffer
68,merica
69,"Dont play it. 
Company sucks, vehicles are frequently implemented wrong
the game's business model is pressuring you (through anger) to pay to progress.
Many mechanics are done in the most infuriating way possible, or outright make gameplay more unpleasant for no reason. 
The newest update, ""drone age"" implemented a mechanic that lets you essentially spawn in a little drone that can ""revenge bomb"" whatever just killed you. They have literally no recourse, btw, they're helpless. 
I'm not gonna pretend the game isnt fun, or elements arent good
But the studio that runs this game, Gaijin, is so fundamentally incompetent and greedy that the game borders on unplayable as a result.
Dont download this game, go play anything else. 
FFS, go watch paint dry, it will be more enjoyable"
70,"very good game. lots of grinding to get good jets, boats, tanks but still a lot of fun"
71,This game is HOLY...Period
72,I love war thunder truly. However the game has been on a decline. With entire battle ratings being unplayable and the issue with USSR top tier over performing for over a year now. On top of all that the grind that has only been getting worse as time goes on makes it almost impossible to recommend the game to friends since even with premium accounts and premium vehicles it still takes an absurd amount of time to get anywhere in the game. The game play is so unique and fun but horribly unbalanced at times. I wish Gaijin would just stop being so money hungry. I fear the game will die
73,"Initially exciting, then progressively addictive, then more and more limiting, repetitive and unsatisfying   this game ultimately left me feeling embarrassed  and ashamed of myself  that I had wasted so many hours of my life trying to replicate killing endless numbers fellow human beings  in mobile tin cans or make believe aircraft. Without plot, storyline, character development or human interaction and growth it is simply a Killfest and probably the shallowest game I have ever been drawn into.   I can be better than this, and in uninstalling it at the end  I felt lighter. A junkie starting over.

105,"War thunder is not free to play, the game is much more enjoyable when boosting research on your tanks for fremium money. Aside from that, stick around 4.7 ranking and you'll have a blast. Genuinely fun game 7/10."
106,"i mean its my favorite game ever but anoying asf somtimes. once you get the hang of it its awesome but one of the best ive played, are some set backs as far as balance goes but great game."
107,"The Game is certainly hell to play at times. Gotta love getting uptiered in your brand new vehicle that is already a higher BR than the rest of your line-up. But playing with friends leads to the best shenanigans known to mankind. And once you've spaded your vehicle/get understand the tactics to use, you can go on murder sprees that probably violate the Geneva Conventions. Would rate average gameplay as ~7.5/10 to 8/10. But for the love of god Gaijin please fix the RP and SL rewards for higher-tier matches to lessen the grind from the soul-crushing experience it is."

122,Praise the snail
123,i luv plying wit mi mummi and mi frends
124,Enjoyable Game
125,"This game is fantastic as long as you don't take it too seriously, playing in a platoon with friends is the way to go. If you play alone, you will get angry, frustrated and rage, with friends you will just laugh it off and have fun goofing around. The grind is real, and anything above approximately 4.0 takes serious time to unlock. The stock grind can also be frustrating because often, a stock vehicle is worse than the unlocked tank that came before it. 
Skill is king, and being killed instantly is usually a skill issue not some unfair bias or hacking, but there are absolutely pay to win vehicles that are stringer than contemporary tech tree vehicles and you will quickly learn which ones they are. Learn positioning, weak spots and target priority and you will do way, way better. I used to get very frustrated with ""BS"" deaths that came from nowhere, but now I've learned to play and especially position myself better and it is far less of an issue. Much like with crocodiles, its not the tank you see that gets you most of the time. 
Start in arcade, learn basic mechanics, then give realistic and sim a try. They're far less forgiving though, especially air battles. You will rip your flaps off in your first realistic air battle. Overall its a fun game and its worth giving a try if you are interested in a game with serious depth that rewards good play."
126,a great game  if you want action pact fun with aircraft tanks and ships but don't forget the helicopters
127,dont buy anything that costs real money from them unless you want to encourage pay to win

136,wee
137,I LOVE THIS GAME
138,It is engaging and fun.
139,"if you want top tier vehicles. it will drain your life
"
140,"Game used to be fun, now that they've added so many helicopters you can obtain with money, as well as drones, for free, that buz around you, and you can't do anything to the scout drones, and if you don't have one, your at a massive disadvantage, you can't target the drones with radar/IR, even trying to shoot at them with Geopards, tunguska's and other anti-air vehicles, it's nearly impossible to kill, the night battles went from you could see barely, to pitch black, so if you have a stock top tier tank, you wont be able to see at all, the amount of vehicles you can obtain with money, is outstanding, an example is a BMP2M, 9.3 vehicle with four 1200mm pen missiles, tandem charges, which are stupidly OP, now you have the ability to fire all four on the move, and have them all track at the same time, and then give it a 30m autocannon with APFSDS which is insane.  Even then the community is toxic, god forbid you have any type of ""UwU"" or any type of anime name, and you'll get told to kill yourself.    However if you wanna play with the WW2 vehicles it's not as bad, just when you get to the 6.3 br range you'll start facing vehicles with guided missiles, and those are annoying."
141,realistic game yh thats all i have to say
142,the game gets boring quickly whenever playing solo but if you play with friends it hardly ever gets boring! recommend playing rarely solo and always have at least 1 person playing with you
143,it is gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
144,"Every single update leads to more grind and a worse economy. Latest:
""Conditions for crediting serious damage to ground vehicles have been changed: destruction of optics, wheels and also partial damage to the barrel and cannon breech are no longer considered as serious damage and can not lead to vehicle destruction assistance."""
145,"very good game
"
146,"The game is bad in term of keeping player stay with the game.
1. Unbalance vehicle
2. Crashed (on steam only) and Bug (in game) (everywhere) everytime a.k.a ""skill issue"" according to Gayjin (their performance is horrible honestly)
3. You cannot do anthing helpful at top tier with stock Ammo. Have fun grinding for the usable one
4. GAYjin is a greedy company, they only care about your money...Do not spend any of your hard earn money in game...

I am leaving this game for good"

154,France
155,"jet,"
156,"Off the bat, a very fun game, much more so with friends though.

HOWEVER - If you're not uptiered every match around 2.0, the enemy team will be full of people just trying to win. By no means a bad thing, but not always the best game to just pal around, and although the community is usually okay, there's usually a couple extremely toxic/teamkillers most games.

Gameplay wise though, spot on."
157,"I may only have 72 hours right now, but the game is very enjoyable. It does take awhile to progress through the research tree. Once you have progressed to the various levels, the game gets better and better."

267,"So let us start of. The is a Russia gaming company. So the obvious Russian bias. They been caught in the past lowering the fire chances with their russian tanks. Plain and simply facts. They disable chat claiming that they get 3000+ reports at peak hour. Simply put that means everyone reporting everyone simply no the fact. Assume and most likely reason is the war. They (WT) bans people who speak the true and the russian bots and troll are allow to move on.
Now the game play. It a grind that makes you want to pay to move on. Game play ok, but shit. The gen 3 jets have so many issue. There are a stupid amount of bugs. 


***DO NOT PLAY***"
268,"Regardless of any potential bias, this game slaps."
269,i hate this game
270,"boom car go burr
"
271,"First they make a game that's suffering to play, and then they charge you a monthly subscription to make it somewhat less of a suffering."
272,I really love game's like this i would recommend this to a new person to steam or like a first time pc player.
273,Please never play this.
274,"This game is bad for your mental and physical health, anyone with anger issues should NOT play this game for the cost of new PC screens is too high atm! 10/10 will play again"
275,"I love this title for the arcade mode shenanigans.   Pick available planes for your crew and play arcade.   Forget about all the other bells and whistles, lions, warbonds, eagles and just play.   That is all I have done for years and still think it is a hoot."
276,don't buy planes with real money its a waste if you can't even aim
277,I can see the snail in the dark corners of my room when I'm not playing this game. The snail owns us all.
278,paid a lot of money but my team still dies in 2 minutes. i'd like to buy premium team gaijin trust me people will pay for it
279,"this game is so fun, i love how there are some many military vehicles to use like tanks jets to boats and even drones soon and this game has planes from WW1 all the way up to modern days so fun of a game"
280,Its fun.....

285,"War Thunder is an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it to you!
but there are a few expectation you need to have
1. The grind to top tier is long and can be difficult unless you purchase premium vehicles or premium account time.
2. realistic and simulator mode are very different from arcade mode
3. people might get political in the chat lol"
286,i love grinding up to level 78 on PS4 and not being able to transfer my account because younger me decided to create a gaijin / steam account back in 2014 :)
287,the only thing that suffered was my ram
288,war thunder is fucking poop fart fella balls
289,tonk
290,"I tried, really really really hard to like this game. I think I gave it a solid chance but it just has so many questionable and stupid design decisions. If you want to play World War 2 era stuff I think its fine, but low tier / high tier gameplay is just fucking miserable. 
"
291,trash and pay to win
292,THIS GAME MAKES ME WANT TO GET IN A CAR AN HIT MANY PEOPLE
293,"Warthunder's primary appeal is the breadth of vehicles and eras of warfare it represents. There's something for just about everybody here, and working towards acquiring your favorite plane or tank can be very compelling. The game can look beautiful and is generally very impressive graphically. It performs very well on most systems. All things considered, it's fairly stable, too. If you don't care about anything modern, then the grind that comes part and parcel with Free to Play MMOs is actually very manageable. WW2-era vehicles can be reached quite quickly.

Unfortunately, Warthunder is not more than the sum of its parts. There are many great aspects of the game, but truly horrific mismanagement by the developers has sunken any and every chance for real improvement. There has been no significant overhaul to the basic team deathmatch or king-of-the-hill game modes for eight years. Gamemodes and features that used to be present, such as historical battle events or multi-hour long ""Enduring Confrontations"" have been scrapped despite being very popular. The entire game's lifespan is defined by feature creep weighing down a fundamentally barebone skeleton of a game and it is the source of nearly every complaint the playerbase has, from vehicle matchmaking rank, uncounterable weapons and tactics, gross imbalance from one end of the tech tree to the other, and much, much more. Community suggestions are frequently ignored, developer decision making is opaque, and every year sees more of the old-guard playerbase leave, disgruntled with the lack of meaningful progress. Looking forward, it seems likely that we will see more of what has been going on for the last four to six years - more modern kit, more premium content, and no changes to the basic formula. The developers are content to play it safe until the last whale finally moves on to greener pastures.

No, despite having played it more than any other game in my life, I do not recommend Warthunder. It can be fun with friends on voice chat, but it is not a rewarding experience and you get less out of it the longer you play. In the hands of a competent developer it could very well be a knock-out success, but as it is, it seems that competition will gradually swallow up the playerbase. IL-2 has much richer gameplay, DCS has a fantastic community and simulation depth, and World of Tanks fills a casual itch for tank combat pretty nicely. For modern tank combat, GHPC just came out of early access and is shaping up to perfectly fill the casual simulation niche Warthunder failed to exploit."
294,"Do you loooove to grind? yes? then this game is for you :D
"
295,plane go fast i kill enemy
296,"It's like an abusive, hot girlfriend. You keep coming back for more even though you know what's gonna happen. Thx Gaijin."

307,the snail has claimed another soul please don't give in
308,"I am a 43 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 12. My son recently started War Thunder and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."
309,this game is a ptw nightmare at this point i enjoyed it for years but the devs are def and dont do shit the playerbase wants and manage to make it so hard to progress you are almost forced to spend cash or rip out your hair 12 hours a day to make any sort of progress

313,"I have played this game for over 60 hours and I can safely say, it's a pretty realistic and good game, pay to win aspects are kinda shit, but it's pretty okay overall"
314,no
315,"I have been playing this game for nearly 1000 hours as i just moved to steam recently , i would 100% recommend it if you like war games as it is the best ""realistic"" one in my opinion. It is pretty easy to play and you will understand it ez. BUT THE GRIND IS HUGE

324,Came back after years.... love it and dont know why i ever stoped playing it
325,I hate this game. Still better than WoT
326,"Just a casual fan. The in game economy is weird, and artificially extends the grind. Microtransactions are offered as the solution to every problem. Sometimes you'll feel you're fighting something that is vastly overpowered, and sometimes it is, but often you can compensate with good positioning and movement. Even with good gameplay and the rest though I'd only rate it 5/10 max because of how bad the microtransactions are. Only invest time in this if you are also willing to invest money, or else it will largely be a lesson in frustration."

338,cool game
339,"This game has gone through many ups and downs. But...in it's current state I can say it is totally worth playing.
I prefer this game over other tank/plane/ship simulators. It's got a nice balance of realism to game mechanics that I think allows for a wide range of players. The progression also feels rewarding.

The game does have a bit of a ""pay to win"" aspect to it, but I find that you can balance that curve a bit with practice."
340,Its a grind unless you P2W.
341,"Great game.
"
342,"Great game , real but progress is slow and force you to buy things.Its like PAY to WIN game but i dont care..."
343,penus

345,"Don't bother. F2P game that will require more of your time than your probably already failing marriage if you're playing this game enough to actually get anywhere, even with premium and an average to slightly better than average KDA you're looking at raising your stress levels high enough to have a cardiac arrest by the time you get your next tank that is probably going to feel like a downgrade. There are issues in this game that even after 3+ years of them being known aren't fixed, if you and another tank fire at each other and say their shot lands first, doesn't kill you but takes your gunner out, your shell will more times than not just vanish into the ether leaving you cucked from that tiny bit of research towards your next downgrade. Then we'll start on the community, having played all the countries not a single one has people that are respectable, you will get a diamond in the rough but 90% of this games population are all hardcore, level 100 elitists that will push you out and use you as armour just because they want that kill you were about to shoot at. I believe there are roughly 130000 people on at peak time and more than most of them are what I said above. That also being said this game is horrible for people who are new and want to try and get into it, as soon as you leave battle rating 2.0-3.0 and start climbing all them people who are new and at your skill level will start to disappear because they know better than to get into a toxic relationship. Gaijin themselves as a company make Riot Games look competent, they're biased with the countries that get good stuff and as I said before there are issues that aren't fixed that have been known about for years. And finally, their banning system and anti cheat make it look like they don't care, if you ask Gaijin they will tell you that cheaters aren't a thing in their game because they're so far up their own prostate with the money they rake in why would they care. The shear amount of people who don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating is insane, but they're all level 100 so they have been playing the game for a very long time, I am level 40 and I have 300 hour in the game, It'll be different for everyone obviously but that is the amount of time it has taken me to get to that level, some people are just genuinely good at this game of course but the ones that are clearly cheating and not even trying to hide it probably have close to if not 1000 or more hours in the game and they're still there unpunished."

372,"Ima keep this simple this game is fun but highly grindy and this is the only game that is so grindy that reaching teir 6 would probably take you years or possibly into old age but if you want to keep your youth its better off buying with actual money to gain them juicy high tier vehicles. so do I recommend this game? Yes, if you live under a rock all day or in your moms basement other than that not really."
373,"I have spent a lot of time and money on this game over the years, but i just can't bring myself to play much anymore like I used to. The constant BR compression, the lack of updated gamemodes, and the constant addition of copy/paste nations (China is a mix of US/Russian vehicles until you get to higher BRs, as just one example), has just really killed the game for me. Yes, they keep adding cool new more modern vehicles, but the BR compression will have Cold War era, pre-missle era planes up against planes that have no defense against such missiles, WW2 era up against Vietnam Era, etc. Every now and then, you'll see them experiment with cool game modes like Enduring Confrontation which is a historic focus, large battle map and gamemode, but no matter how many posts i've seen requesting them to make it an actual gamemode, the devs dont listen. Sim battles are pretty dead as well with the constant nerfs in rewards. Basically, since I started playing way back in the Beta, the game has only become more and more PTW and the devs consistently dont listen to their community. I feel my complaints are pretty in line with most of the other negative reviews here, and they go into a lot more detail. 

In short, save yourself the time and money sink that is this game and hope someone else makes one better down the line~"

I've been playing almost exclusively planes, and as soon as they start looking cool the grind will start, and it starts very fast and pretty much lasts forever. One would say i've been grinding for 100+ hours after a few hours of discovering the game, yet i didn't even get to jets yet, despite being quite skilled. There's not much to say about War Thunder, it's just flying monkeys killing eachother. Do something else. Play music, call your grandparents, study, get dcs."

427,"Tank, an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.


The first tank to engage in battle, the British Mark I tank (pictured in 1916) with the Solomon camouflage scheme
A British Sherman tank in Italy during World War Two
An M4 Sherman tank in Italy in 1943 during WWII.

A Leopard 2A7 tank in Germany.
Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. They have heavy vehicle armor which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. The use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. These features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against most heavier weapons), all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations.[1] Fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armored warfare.

Until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-, cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks). Some being larger and very heavily armored and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armored, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. These smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. The smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily armored tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

432,"Very frustrating when the enemy always have the advantage when IAM the reason my teamates lost the game because according to the enemy ""im garbage"". very unforgiving to those who got a weak computer as the framerate is pretty much needed for competitive games, and the singleplayer rewards nothing making the game much harder for those who are new to such genres of games.
I guess the game has its ""good moments"" but still getting a repair time while still learning the game slows me down by a hell ton of lot especially for those who try something unusual, like the Swedish vehicles. i would recommend this game to someone just to make their life's worse *ahem i mean better."

It was a promising experience, but the latest ""heavy handed"" action by the devs just show you what you are supporting. Due to world events with a certain special special regrouping action, the CHAT FUNCTION was DISABLED AGAIN. 
Reason: Players would not behave and start texting political topics. 
Now being as it is, no one should derail a game with politics. BUT playing favorite with a certain nation and being extra hard on anyone pointing flaws to obvious vehicles in the game, one has just to open the squadron or regularly read the chat comments just to see what is OK with Gaijin and what not. 
Squadrons with obvious names of recent murderous war criminals, Z symbols and WW2 Nazi references go hand in hand with occasional racism in chat. YET they only disable it because of a certain shortcoming of a certain military operation. 
Why is it important now? It BREAKS GAMEPLAY, constantly trapped inside spawn by faster soviet tanks without being able to alert teammates. 
Plus, as someone who played this game when it was pure Airbattles, this is the final straw. 
If you want to see how hypocritical they are, go on the boards and read how they handle the playerbase. 

Bias, no transparency, greed and now this ""snowflake"" incident. done 0/10, took me 9 Years to realize how bad this company is."

471,Sold my soul. Gaijin Please give me my family back. Good game. It can actually be fun (big surprise).
472,"takes 70 years to progress, but fun
"
473,i hate this game
474,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE! GET YOURSELF OUT OF HERE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
475,"don't get this game if you value properly made game modes..."" Ground battles"" you know from the sound of it you'd think it would be a tank on tank, no no you barely even see tanks all you do is get spawn killed by nerds that sit in their planes the whole match just doing bombing runs. Of course, let's make the only tank game modes have planes because that makes it ""fun"" no it doesn't. Also for the ones who say to ""just use AA"" be quiet I'm not gonna sit in my spawn doing nothing but just shooting planes that's f ing boring. They need to just add in a REAL ground battles mode where its tank on tank not tank on plane and every once and a while tank on tank like come on dude"
476,"War Thunder is an action packed war game. Thus far, I've mostly played the tank battles and I can say the tank battles have a good feel to them like I'm really inside the tank and it's fast paced where a second of hesitation can mean the difference between life and death, it's an awesome game and I highly recommend it based on my experience with the feel and graphics of the game, it's awesome! I highly recommend War Thunder for War games aficionados. ."
477,Nice.
478,"Sadly the devs feel its convenient to ban chat all together whenever Russia is being talked about in politics. Banning chat ruins the game, its pretty much the only thing I find enjoyable since I've made friends chatting with friendlies and enemies who are having fun. This asocial bs ruins this game."
479,kinda fun
480,"Take it from me, a dude with 2,000.00 hours on record. Fuck this game, and everything it stands for, ill see you in the next battle"
481,"I have as of writing this review, played for 64 hours ( according to steam ) and have just now reached R3 aircraft. This game is very fun but is difficult as a none premium player, especially if you do not know what you are doing. I have purchased premium for 7 days and have subsequently unlocked 3 planes in 1 day where is was about 1 every 2-3 days. If you have a few dollars to shell out go ahead and buy the game. If not I'd suggest staying low tier or play DCS or another game."
482,"the cake is a lie 
"
483,"i love this game but when a update is comeing and you buy a pre-order plane heil or tank excitement and then it takes them 2 or so week to get the update out and you buyed it 2 or so weeks ago
like we need to know when it comes out
"
484,"Its really well balance in the most important way. As soon as you have fun, you get a full uptier. This game is one of the main causes of my depression, I'm literally going to kill myself."
485,I highly recommend not getting this game. It is so broken it is not funny if you  like flying in a straight line for 20 min in a bomber with no interaction just to get to the target and pilot knocked out by a stray bullet before you get to target well then this is the game for you. if you don't like wasting your life away with the same repetitive missions with the same repetitive bullshit. Oh and don't expect to get past Tier 3 Tanks because they will cost you more to repair them than you do winning a mission. This company is just one money milking machine. Do Not by God Do Not get this game...
486,"the monetisation of the game still masive , and you take ages to research anything , basically nothing has changed . so you either spend masive money on dlc or play it intesively and still get nothing advanced lol."

2nd The Grind and nerf to Lions - Happened a while ago but was the grind so much worse where you feel you have to spend some cash to get outa some grind dead ends. (noone is pointing a gun to your head but jesus fucking christ its bad)

after years of playing on and off. I got back into it and had a pretty good last few months, till about last month(ish) This one match fucking was it. Every single American aircraft I own got dominated by ONE fucking Japanese fighter? normal and Prims... fuck off. After this gentleman took out my bomber, I wanted to make it a point and kill this guy... He could out climb everything I had, BEYOND out turn anything I had. Never again, balanced my ass. Like the days of old and StalinWood, and this shit with Chinese and the Japanese and Swedish shit, my friends had some really weird shaddy kills (not hackers, hopefully) but wonky bullshit, and all of them quit for good. nawh I'm out."

525,Is heavily pay to win. If you want a flight simulator where you can piss of other players and just keep doing bombing runs and make easy kills this game is for you.
526,"The game isn't worth playing anymore since the economy is simply broken and at this rate it's been this way for over a year....

Low tier it's not nearly as bad as high tier and you start the game with a lot of free silver lions but once that runs out and you get into cold war era hardware you're looking at consistently losing 10k or more even on victories with 1.0 KD at least. Furthermore the odd time you do make a surplus it's a pointless sum.

The devs have chosen a route in which you get punished for just performing average with barely any reward for playing above average... To save myself money I won't use the rest of my vehicles to finish a match if I think the team won't obviously win and after I land my jet if I got ANY points what so ever I J out to avoid the repair cost."
527,"After 10 years playing this game(on/off) i can tell you that this is a pay to win title made for whales. Every single aspect of the game can be bought with money, from aestethics to the reload time of your tank or the spread of your airplane rockets. EVERY T-H-I-N-G. Don't be mad if you lose, maybe your adversary put 50€ more than you.

Play this game for the low tiers BR 0 - 5. Here you can progress without putting any money on it and get some good moments."

547,Carpet bombers in ground battles with fake lead indicators. Whatever brain dead devs they might have at this company clearly have no interest in even attempting to create a realistic representation of tank warfare.
548,"after around 390 hours of playing, and realising the game made me absolutely miserable because I wasn't a sweaty elite gamer, I've decided to move on with my life. Whilst planes and tanks are cool, the gameplay of being punished, instantly dying after making a minor error and not being a 42069 gaming pro and knowing all the good map spots, play styles, dogfighting, energy fighting, turn fighting....and most importantly WALLET FIGHTING.

 I unfortunately do not possess the funds to essentially buy myself wins. there is just too much negative emotion riding on a videogame, videogames should be fun, yet instead I achieve the opposite. It was fun when I was younger and excited at the prospect of working my way up with awesome historical and cool vehicles of war and means of murder, but there came a time when it turned into a grind, a much much bigger grind, and with the learning curve for new players being about as steep as the doorjamb I smacked my head into as a child, it is simply not fun to die all the time. 

Thus I shall play outside and rest easy knowing that I am not spending money on virtual tanks and planes, cause NFTs are pretty stupid, and I can instead buy myself a model plane and be infinitely happier!

Don't play, there is no play"

Good games give you what you want when you need it. Good games. But War Thunder gives you money if you pay for it. No money means no progression in the game. You have to research vehicles in order to play them, but once researched you have to buy them too. If you don't, you cannot research the following ones in the tech tree."

663,"W game, grind for better vehicles is too much though"
664,.
665,good game
666,why is there a vehicle wait timer
667," I have been playing this game for 3+ years and it has never failed to entertain me with all the stuff you can do.. . Tho the game can be a bit grindy at times its fun if you like a semi to fully realistic military sim for vehicles, such as tanks , planes, boats , and helicopters. Be warned tho that premium makes the game so much easier to progress and without it , you have that chance of having to grind for hours to maybe even a day or two for higher rank planes, and tank tech trees get really grindy with some tanks i have spent weeks of work on. but as you progress and get better it makes it easier to move to the next vehicle. Premium vehicles are helpful but not necessary , really only there if you wanna grind out a tree with minimal effort compared to no premium vehicles or premium account. Also gaijin store is the way to go if you wanna purchase anything they give fatty deals sometimes that can give you more for cheap. 

Overall this game is very fun to play and gives you something to work on if your bored , and once you get high enough you get a sense of pride from starting all the way from ww1 biplanes and early tanks all the way to pretty modern vehicles. Updates to the game are always fun and just give you more stuff to do, and events and challenges give you the oppertunity for limited edition stuff such as vehicles , decals, camos, and so forth. 

10/10 game recommend to most"

682,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

688,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.
In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

692,"Game is in a broken bias state. Hit detection are off and ERA only benefits Russian tanks (why not release the SEP for the Abrams and the 2A7+ for the Leopard trees?), had a BMP-2M eat my DM53 round, survive and hit back w/ an ATGM. Yet Gaijin will be more than willing to nerf the TOW-2B for the Wiesel and not release DM63 for MBTs."

694,this game is plane
695,Yes.
696,plane
697,"this game sucks ass
"
698,"its grindy asf, you have to pay to win, but its still pretty fun"
699,"TLDR not worth the investment neither in time nor money.

There was so much potential in this game, but looks like the developer doesnt care as long as the people pay for the overpriced and overpovered vechicles and for the premium accounts.
You need a premium account if you dont want to get a stroke from the game (makes you earn more xp and money).

The economics is the first thing that bends my brain into a knot. I have managed to grind my first jet out, but I haven't choosen the best one to dogfight (because there is no point to fly a plane in this game except to go dogfight with it lol), so now I rarely get a kill with it, so I loose money constantly. Doesn't matter that I grinded out the second jet, I don't have the money to buy it. You have to pay if you go to a battle with a vehicle, you have to pay for the ammo, and you have to pay for the repair. In what air force does the pilot pay for the upkeep? I just want to flight and fight, but no, I have to play Mr. Air Force Manager here.
I'm usually okay to pay for some things in free to play games, but I'm not okay with pay to win systems. A jet is 60 EUR/USD, just like a full AAA game. If you start off by buying one, you can grind a whole tech tree with it in no time. With a free account it is just painful to grind and takes forever.

And there are other things like visual bugs, hits that should destroy a vehicle but do nothing, Battle Rating TM compression, crap maps/gamemodes(domination)/gamesettings(ground games are so short imo), stupid ai (bot planes always flies into a hill right after I decide to engage one, and in pve modes 100% hit accuracy), research modules for field repair and to kill a fire, etc."

702,funny explode when crash into floor hehe
703,Realistic good pvp love the visuals and smoking fools.
704,Game is going to the dogs. Just got 3.5k RP with a 9.7 lineup with one premium and premium time. I came first in my team. Screw Gaijin
705,Game is incredibly fun when everything goes right..which is not very often. You'll spend 1/4 of your in game time being shot or rammed by your team and the other 3/4 of it chasing enemies who fly like crackheads or zip away in a wheelie boi tank. 10/10 best vehicle combat game around.
706,"good
"
707,i can not recommend the game i get put into battles with tiers like 2 or 3 higher then myself. i can if i get in a game with same tier get many kills the most i have seen is 12 a game. so it is not that i am bad but when i have a 2.3 tank and i'm fighting a 4.5 that's a problem. can not grow if i cant fight. other then the loopy match making the game is fantastic.

719,"I will be uninstalling game after my premium is done. Here is why. 
1. The community is horrible! This goes out to everyone and anyone who is level 100 and lower and to the big squadrons and little ones. This goes to the fact that matchmaking is ASS. You go in a match and ether the enemy team is so stupid that not a single guy on the team gets a kill or your team is so stupid they can get a kill. People in this game are FUCKING RETARDED AS FUCKS WHO DONT NEED TO BE PLAYING A GAME IN GENERAL. 
2. GAIJIN IS SO WORRIED ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND GET MORE SHIT OUT THAN THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT FIXING ISSUES. Matchmaking has always been a problem and they know it but will not do anything about it. 
Im not a bad player and i have proof so if you will like trying to say something to me then please hold your breathe because your not worth my time idiot. I have pics of plenty of matchs where i carried the whole team so i warn you do NOT DOWNLOAD. FUCK THIS DAMN PISS OF SHIT GAME FULL OF FUCKING RETARDS."

764,"A game with tons of potential and actually good gameplay. 

However if you want to have any chance against other players you'll need to pay money. There's tons of good vehicles locked behind a pay wall, a camouflage that you need to pay real money to get it, tons of grinding that can be skipped by paying money. The matchmaking is broken, it puts you against people that have much more experience in the game than you, they know where your vehicle's weak spots are and generally know more about the game, to top it off they probably have paid vehicles and camouflage.

 It has it's moments but they are so rare. In other words don't bother playing this game, is total waste of time."

Imagine if you took wow/lol and increased the toxicity and salt ten fold and then made it appeal to wrehaboos and the like... that's war thunder. Game been brokey for over a decade, it's near end of life, they will not fix anything so if you wish to commit yourself to the snail, do so being aware and warned of the consequences you shall face as a WT player"
802,"If you want to have fun in this game without spending too much money don't go above Br 4.0. The Game Feels like it is anti fun at br 5.0 and up because you are almost always only breaking even on SL or losing, Very Rarely do you gain SL and everything past br 4.0 is over priced by a lot. Once you go into Br 5.0 and up You are upteired 90% of the time, for context it means having a cold war tank go against a early MBT you cant pen it you can barely scratch it and it looks at you and you die. You have to research a fire extinguisher. Yep a flipping Fire Extinguisher. And if you are hit you are 50% one shot or Most liky gonna die because you are missing mobility or gun. The Game [strike] is fun [/strike] [b] was [/b] fun but it was trying its Hardest to get me to up up my wallet like it was Genshin Impact."
803,"game crashes constantly, glitches after reinstall, not fun"
804,"This game is a grind fest. There are only two types of players that play this game, either masochist or addicts both need help. The developers treat you like crack whore they brutally beat you and then give you some content so you keep playing and buying. And yes you cant play this game if you don't spend money, early game it looks you can go though the tech tree with our premium or getting ealgles but when you truly get in there (around tier 3) you find out that you are going to need 100k rp to get a new tank with a average game you earning around 1-2k per game. I think it speak for it self and if it dosent for you my friends it way to gone."
805,tank go boom
806,ngl its kinda addicting and is really easy to rage at
807,"About 10% of this is me watching Youtube while waiting for something but all in all, good game"
808,never download this game
809,"Worst thing to ever touch this earth, i get one shot every time not fun at all pay to win and takes 85 years to get modern stuff dogshit game dont install"
810,"A great game utterly ruined by the waste of existence types playing it. 
If you aren't amazing right out of the gate, members of your own team will at you just a bit each so nobody gets booted or, they'll ram your tank till it gets stuck. 
Keep drinking that Mountain Dew energy drink Pepe, and then you can bring that snotty little troll attitude of yours to the dialysis clinic, enjoy your organ failure, should got your @55 up outta the chair sooner."

861,"fucking dog wank cant even play vr without keyboard and mouse
"
862,"While I do play this game on a regular basis because it interests me on a niche level, I would unironically not recommend it for anyone. There is barely any fun to be had in grinding for days to buy a tank, a crew, tank upgrades, crew upgrades, going into battle, dying, and having to wait hours for your tank to repair because all the money you could gather up had to be spent on your vehicle. Not to mention the enemies with blue names. It's like if the among us crewmates all had access to the sabotage tab. Don't download this game. Please."
863,"Good game, kinda RNG based. But still fun"
864,Would be great if you didn't have the option to buy vehicles and upgrades. Gives some players an unfair advantage and you spend more time going in and out of matches then you do playing the game. Shame its just another pay to win.
865,"things go pew pew, and bang"
866,"sex update when?
"
867,"To start: This game is horribly balanced and doesnt really have anything to keep people playing.

The ability to pick your own nation in so incredibly pointless because only one is actually worth taking. The devs focus most of their resources onto developing new Russian vehicles, this would be fine if they were balanced but they aren't. Some Russian tanks (T-34 for example) have way too much armour for their BR (Battle Rank) and class, I was in a 100mm Italian tank destroyer and could not pierce its front armour at all, this makes no sense.

The main tank game modes are Arcade Battle and Realistic Battle, both of these are boring after a few hours. Arcade and Realistic battles are the same in that you have to take certain points and destroy enemy tanks but they differ in what is given like player locations. The battle types boil down to a death match, they are not fun.

Penetration system is awful, you have to hit tanks in specific places to even pierce them and even then, you probably wont kill them. It is also incredibly easy to get shot, lose your gunner and then die because you cant defend yourself.

Do you want to progress in this game and get modern tanks? Expect 50 hours minimum to even get close and even then, it isn't fun because certain things are massively overpowered.

This game can be fun at Rank 1 but it just gets progressively worse over time."

920,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ANGER MANAGEMENT OR THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE THEM

This game is full of gliches and will use that against you, I have lost track of how many times my rounds would do anything, or the game will go out of its way to screw me over. I have never see someone else die from a round taking a 90 degree turn after it bounced off my add-on armor, it was a heatfs round, they dont bounce, at all

Forgot to mention earlier but they like to pull shit rounds on you and pull fast ones, ive been able to unleash hell with a torrent of 20 and 30 mm with certain planes, and the other side can only have 7.92 rounds, they end up killing me but for some reason I can hit them, my rounds to nothing. And to top it off me and someone else can have the roles reversed, and they will absolutely kill me 100% of the time. This is fact, Gaijin is shit with how they handle things, and they do it to everyone that plays this game

BE WARNED"
921,"Good Game over all....... If you have the patience to learn systems/mechanics and its Ballsack 2008 Style UI.

Iv Been a big fan of World of Tanks (WOT) for the last 8+ years and other than both these games having tanks in them you can realy compare them fairly, there to different.
over the years iv installed War Thunder to play 1 or 2 games to promptly uninstall it again, after repeating this a dozen or 2 times........ i started to get a little bored of WOT not disliking just bored of the same tanks game so i forced my way through annoyance and pain of a new player.
i realy liked the graphics style of War Thunder and with the Different and more modern tanks available to try out i forced my way past the pain of not knowing what the FKK i was doing other then drive for 5 mins to just get 1 shot to WTF just happen there!!!!.
Arcade mode is completly weird and i dont think it should be in the game at all. still to this day dont understand the spotting mechanics or all the extra crap you get att the bottom of the screeen. aslo all tanks feel like go carts so anything i say about the game is strictly Realistic battles as learning how to play the game in just realistic battles made me learn what i needed early on and relativly quickly.
Battle Rating 1-5 is complete dog ass. low tiers are like low tiers in WOT....... you aint using the META seal clubbing tank and you have a brand new crew (crews matter more in this game and i like how theyv done it, kinda) new players get crapped on by players who have thousands of hours in the game just to shit on new scrubs like me so they can feel good getting some kills.
Battle rating starts getting ok after around 6. personally 8-9 feels best so far for me. feels like tier 9 MM in wot.
In my Opinion this game is unplayable Full Free to Play.. the first few days of this play through wereee sooo painfully slow playing with bad stock tanks. just buy premium time its fine. if you have everything you want unlocked i can see F2P gameplay easily done though. its just grinding F2P is not fun at all.
i Did buy pixels for 9.7 Premium tank after i found some fun in the game when i was around BR 5-6 ish in 1 tank. ignore what people say that high tiers are to hard or full of sweat lords etc, thats not true it helped me learn the game quicker. helps me grind points and silver and overall i do much better in my prem tank (Challenger DS) love this tanks play style.
the real issue is alot of games you team dies and leaves the game. when the other team either has backups(that cost real money ) or another similar tiered tank to replace it. this is an issue of the game imo.

Overall Learning tank weak spots Followed with Learning crew/ammo rack locations for those sweeeeet 1 shots is extremly satisfying

Being able to use your jet/plane after something as simple as an early cap is EXTREMELY toxic as 90% of the People you kill will spawn in a plane and try bomb you or die trying. this is by far the worst part of the game you kill someone they see a kill cam of your exackt position then they go the revenge kill right after............ if anything needs changing in the game its that. 2 kills or 1 kill 1 cap then you get enough spawn points for a place. Give players 1 free backup a game to encourage TANK gameplay in the Tank Game mode not bombing revenge sim.


Would recommend:
Premium time is essential for new players.
1 Shotting enemy tanks is Extremely satisfying
Lots of decent varying maps
Lost of ways to play
Revenge killing/Bombing Sucks ass crack

I like Tanks this is a good tank game

This review is more rant style but i dont care. Just give the game a go its fun"
922,"Imagine everyone you play against doesn't have a job or touch grass. The grind is immensely disgusting, another free to play and pay to win game."
923,"This game is overall a decent game, don't get me wrong. It just has an impressive amount of Pay to Win mechanics that greatly encourage you to spend money if you want to have any fun. Skill will always triumph over all else but whether you have god-like skill or not, the lengths that this game goes to make you try to support them financially is kind of baffling.

Now I understand that a Free to Play game has to make money somewhere. I'm totally fine with that, but you'd expect there to be some sort of balance in a competitive game even if there are some P2W mechanics. In my opinion, this game doesn't really do much to balance things. The game has a vague attempt at balancing with 'Battle Rating', but it only accounts for the vehicles themselves, not any of the upgrades the vehicles or crew have, nor the amount of 'lives' a player has. Here's a list of things that I would consider P2W:

-You only have as many 'lives' as you have crew slots/vehicles. By default you have 2 & it isn't hard to upgrade the slots to 5 with free currency. To unlock past 5 you need to pay real money, effectively limiting a players lives to 5 if they don't pay. Buying slots doesn't always mean you have vehicles to use in those slots either, so you also have to grind with the meager starting vehicles to unlock more (or pay for vehicles to fill those slots). After this you can play a match & effectively have more than 2 lives. If you pay real money, you can also respawn with a vehicle that has been blown up when normally it's removed from your roster for the remainder of the match.

-Each crew slot has individual stats that need leveling up in order to operate vehicles better. This means faster reloading, aiming, driving, more health, etc. The XP to upgrade them is gained very slowly & the cost for upgrades is substantial. If you simply pay however, you can immediately upgrade all your crew to reload faster & withstand more damage. You'll have to do this individually for every crew slot for every faction too.

-Despite being ""just cosmetic"" the cosmetics in this game I would consider on the P2W spectrum. While obviously a type of camouflage will not work on every map, it still gives a sizable advantage when used in the proper environment. You can buy said camouflage paintjobs to increase your odds that you'll get the first shot before they notice you. You can even buy various bush & plant coverings so that you can ghillie up & blend into the foliage to become even harder to see.

-If you want to play with anything more modern than WW2 stuff, you'll have to grind for ages before you see any of it. Or just pay your way into playing with modern vehicles of course. Not that the WW2 stuff is bad, it would just be nice to be able to hop into matches with newer gear without having to grind or pay.

Of course Pay to Win mechanics like these aren't the end of the world. The arcade game modes alleviate some of these issues but they will always be there, especially if you'd rather play the realism modes that give much more XP & currency. It's very easy to see P2W in action when you look at the scoreboard & see top players that have died over 7-8 times, when you can only die a few times before you're knocked out of the game entirely due to lack of crew slots & vehicles.

You can grind for free to slowly unlock new vehicles, but you'll never be able to use the dozens of 'premium' vehicles that cost real money if you don't pay. The whole time you're grinding, you're often going up against the people who have either played hundreds more hours than you and/or payed hundreds more dollars than you. Having better skill after hundreds of hours is one thing but just being objectively, mechanically stronger than newer/poorer players after playing & paying is silly to me.

It honestly reminds me of Escape From Tarkov a little bit. You can be thrown into a match & be completely & utterly outclassed in every way & there's nothing you can do about it but keep grinding, hoping you get put into matches with people that are actually similar to your level. I will commend this game for having relatively quick matches though, unlike Tarkov. It's usually very quick to get into a new game after being kicked to the main menu for dying.

Since it is Free to Play, it still might be worth a shot if you want to bash tanks, planes & boats together. I'd only recommend trying it however if you're patient & not an impulsive spender... or you're rich & can just buy everything. I mean if you're rich & bored, this game is definitely for you. You will very likely destroy anyone else who hasn't payed as much as you have & that'll probably be pretty fun, I won't lie."

947,"its a free game, what do you expect? not this that's for sure, its blown my expectations out of the water because of its impressive graphics (not ""impressive"" for it has organization level, ray tracing, amazing graphics, but impressive for what they definitely could have been) as well as its realism (although i've heard criticism about being bias, cant see it yet though) as well as just fun aspect of being able to choose: do i want to take it slow and enjoy low tier? or should i just grind and get high tier then play lower tier later? because you can do both if you wanted. because im not an army vehicle nerd i can enjoy all the details added and tell they took the time to do at least some research into what they were making. personally i enjoy playing ground/army and have learned rushing in can be good and also a horrible stratagy depending on what tank i use, and i love the fact you can bring multiple different tanks in with me to use differnent stratagies as needed.

this is currently a fantastic game to play with your friends or by yourself and hope this game keeps getting better"
948,nice
949,Gaijin Entertainment has made yet another masterpiece in the game War Thunder. Along with being free it is playable on almost all platforms and it doesn't really matter if your computer is a potato that gave birth to a lemon the game will run just fine. The physics in the game like bullet speed and drop and how the vehicles can interact with the environment makes the game extremely special in my opinion. also the limited number of game modes means that the lobby's are always full and the wait times aren't that long. The tech tree makes sure that everyone can play whatever vehicle they want and the decals make the vehicles so much better. All in all there shouldn't be any complaints about this game seeing how it is completely free.
950,If you want to spiral into the darkest place you will ever be in your entire life this game is right for you.

964,"You tell yourself you won't spend a dime.. only the free content.  You tell yourself that.  But... the starter pack is only 6.99 and you get 2 premium vehicles etc.etc.  fine.. BUT I'll stop there.  You tell yourself that.   But... you open a battle trophy box and get 50% of the purchase of a Pz.IIIN Premium tank.. it expires in 2 days.. oh man.. do some math.. it's like what.. $2.. fine.  But that's it..just buy a few GE for the discount rewards but THAT'S IT!   You tell yourself that. 

Before you know it you're watching videos to decide if the Free GE App is worth the hassle and risk. SMACK YOURSELF.  I'm stopping at 5000 GE. Not one penny more.  Per month.. NO NO NO. Ever.  Or the wife will leave me.. maybe just one more premium vehicle at the next tier.. you know.. to help with the grinding. NO NO NO.

These f******.. they know human psychology well.

If you have ever had a problem gambling... Stay away.
If you have poor impulse control... Stay away.
If you are prone to replacing your keyboard on a regular basis... Stay Away
And for God sake, If you are a ""completionist"" STAY FAR AWAY (unless you're loaded.. then have at it. hee hee)

Otherwise it's a lot of fun.  Some very frustrating and rage-quit moments for sure.. but watch some Youtube videos on how to actually fly and fight and you'll be fine again."

HOWEVER: It is a God-awful grindfest that absolutely wants you to spend money on it at every opportunity (don't do it) and has some of the strongest pro-Russian vehicle bias ever. I beg of you, please, play this game with immense amounts of caution. There is fun to be had here, but then again, there is also fun moments that can be found in prison, and you wouldn't go to prison just for a couple of fun moments, when every other moment is full of pain, misery, and honest-to-God anal-cavity rupture inducing molestation.

This game will skull♥♥♥♥ you, and then it will deepthoat you, and then it will destroy your anus repeatedly until you go to bed, wake up, and repeat this process for the umpteeth time in the hopes that the Gaijin God snail will smile upon you and bless you with enough silver lion crumbs off of his plate that you can scrounge your next vehicle.

Like getting sniped from cross map from some guy who saw you through 10 bushes 3 wrecks and a train? Well too bad... deal with it. Gayme Play consists of spawn, go somewhere, die. Spawn don't get anywhere because they are in your spawn, die. If you have played for a long time and started something but never finished it well your in luck everything you were researching is now impossible to get because hay, content is better than quality and you now have to research 10 other useless fucking things before you can get what you have spent the last year researching. Oh and by the way it only takes a year if you don't pay. So get those goodie gaijin goicoins from your rent account and shove them into your cd drive because you wont get anywhere without it. Actually enjoying yourself? Better not get used to it Gaijin hate enjoyment, they will nerf anything. Traction? Nerfed. Maps? Blocked off. Team mates? Retarded. Packet loss? Full.

It does have its moments of toxicity, but is wholesome at times in its own way especially with friends. (if you know, you know)"
1021,"All in all, fun game but it gets so grindy.   Then to add insult to injury, you have to play against people with thousands of hours on super low BR ranked matches and will always be outgunned by them.

1062,"The Combat Flight sim of Combat Flight sims. The level of detail and depth of mechanics is fantastic. The WW2 warbirds have such attention to detail in them.
Things I love
The sound of the engines, no cheap looping recording, it always sounds organic from full throat throttle on chase to coming in for landing with the exhaust after firing (which no other flight sim has ever done as far as I know)
The attention to detail on damage. It's not just bullet hole decals painted on your plane, seemingly every panel, every piece, every spar every rib has it's own states. I got shot from behind in a chase with another player, that bullet hit my cockpit armor and spit through the glass, knocking out the wiring for the tech gauge on my dash which caused the automatic pitch control to struggle to maintain RPM. In the battle log it actually said "" Tachometer has poor connection "".
I crash landed during a battle of Britain sim and when my pilot hopped out, I realised I was able to walk around the plane and inspect it and it looked like a virtual image of those historic crash landings you see in documentaries, the engine cover popped off one side, landing gear had a flat tire ripped off the rim on the other and bullet holes ran all through the controls and engine cowling.

The things I don't like? 
It's really hard to convince friends that this game is worth the money as it doesn't have an online progress tree or rewards or loot boxes or unlocks, the reward is the content and finding ways to apply it. If you have friends who are hesitating or you yourself are, I say get the free content and play through the tutorials. It'll take a while to get your controls right and figure out the physics but once you do it's great, then you can move from the free content to some paid goodies like the spitfire, channel map and WW2 assets.

10/10."

1096,"Massive drain on wallet, free time, and will to live.  I love it."
1097,"[b] This review is for those who want to play tanks. [/b]

Addictive and painful. With the promise of being free to play but not to progress. 

Where players who don't have premiums are constantly low on silver lions (games currency) and research points (what lets you progress in the tech tree). A game that rewards lazy and unfair tactics such as dropping bombs in spawn instantly killing you and punishing you by making you pay for the repair cost of your tank in the games dwindling economy and often nerfed reward system. Or gluing foliage to your tank spanning from every corner and climate of the world (only yours for a couple euros)  

Gaijin as a company has proved they put monetary greed over balancing with battle pass vehicles out performing others and then later having their battle rating increased when sales have gone down. 
In the balancing department things still aren't looking good because you will find yourself 5 times out of 6 fighting an enemy that is a BR higher than you, This is known as being uptiered and is a word you will say in the beginning of nearly all matches. 

So here we have a game that rewards unfair gameplay where majority of deaths are to things you had no way of fighting against. A game that actively makes progress harder and harder, and a player base that cant go 20 seconds without saying a slur. Then why do people play this game?

Because on a really good day where those things above don't happen as much this game has one of the if not the best and unique gameplay a tank game can have. There is currently no game that offers the type of gameplay like War Thunder does. And if you are a fan of tanks this is really the only option. 

If you are a fan of tanks and want to play this game make sure to bring friends that you can squad up with, because when playing together you can have one of the best tanking experiences out there. But if you dont have that then I can't recommend this game.

And if you made it all the way down here thank you for reading and [i] happy hunting! [/i]"
1098,top game keep coming back no game ever the same well done gajin

1108,"It took me 5 years to get to top tier, and then when I got there it was worse than the grind it took to get there
"
1109,Really bad balancing. All around pay to win. The grind to get to even the early fighter jets is so huge or not even possible if you went to wrong route. You need to spent at least 60 euros to get some good jets and if you don't buy a broken jet you will just die because these mentally ill developers who are developing from a mental hospital cant balance shit. All around shit game.
1110,"sexy game, makes me rage sometimes and makes me happy sometimes, but it's very sexy ngl

Hope this review helps."
1129,"good

1130,"The game is breathtaking when you're in the air, soaring over mountain valleys or Pacific atolls. Just taking a plane up through the clouds, where the world beyond your wingtips vanishes into fog while condensation whips over the canopy, gives way to the most extraordinary joy and elation when you burst into the clear blue sky. It feels like I'm really up there at the controls of a plane, playing among the peaks and valleys of a cloud formation.

More important, War Thunder's air combat is simply some of the best and most intense I've ever experienced. World of Warplanes doesn't come close; its planes are too confined by the game's simple physics. It's a shooter where your avatar is a plane. In War Thunder, I always feel like I'm actually in the cockpit, and every kill is a story to tell."
1131,fun until u start to die so much i makes you feel like dieing
1132,"Pain to grind, sometimes fun to play."
1133,very good :)
1134,"i dont have a life and if i had one i thionk id hate it 
"
1135,"Unbalanced, pay-to-win ****fest that doesn't get better the higher you get. Firstly, AA tanks are basically twice as effective at destroying tanks than light or medium tanks most of the time. So imagine being in a Medium tank with around 40mm of armour protecting your snug crew, then peek-a-boo your tank is ammo exploded from the first bullet of the enemy AA trucks volley... fun am i right... Secondly, they might as well remove BR (battle rankings) because unless its top tier tanks with their almost equally powerful guns, lower tiers (1-3) is basically German Supremacy, their 'same BR' tanks easily wreck your tank while their crew go full Neo and dodge EVERY fragment that peppers the inside of their tank, 15% of the time however you will actually one shot a German tank and be honestly surprised. But overall if AA tanks and trucks outclassing most tanks of their tier is what you want then go ahead, i'm already in this toxic as hell relationship with the game, almost as toxic as LOL is to be honest. if you look online your see a WHOLE LOT of evidence to support that the game is just a mess overall, but you know, tank go boom i guess."
1136,"I like it. The devs milk money but it's what you get when the game is free. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Tanks and airplanes. Fuck naval.
Protip, if you have GE and need anything. Spend it on Premium and do all-nighters it's a lot more worth it than to just buying things straight off.  
Also don't fall in the trap of buying bushes. I can't get out. Just one more.........."
1137,fuck this game fuck yukio and his stupid ass this game is laggy like the world when instant eats
1138,"I love it but I hate it, I don't know."

but that being said...

its 100% pay to win tho lmao and ill never give in to it"
1140,WWII hell yeah! :)
1141,nice game and good for low - mid spec
1142,"Only play this game if you just love to lose.  Every game i play is always a lose.  I wanted to just hop on and fight players in jets, but there soon i realize that i cannot. I've just been trying to get a jet, but i can't because some guy in a spitfire comes and cuts my damn plane in half, or kills my pilot.  And its so anger inducing because when i get a ""Critical hit"" it looks to be as if they did not even get hit at all. This grind is so damn hard, and when i do get a win. It only gives me about one thousand to my jet fighting dreams. Keep in mind that i have gotten five kills. And here i am 46 hours wasted trying to have fun.  Hopefully they make it so where there's  like a place where you can just fly around with all the cool aircraft. Will give the game credit though, the attention to detail is so good! and sometimes it is quite fun. But man this game just gets on my nerves about how The grind takes to long, I can not fly a jet, And it gets quite stale over time. Thank you for reading and have a nice day!"
1143,i dont have fun this game is unfair
1144,it is a good game if like war and planes.

1151,WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET THE THINGS I WHAT
1152,"imagine spending $2.5k+ on a free to play game haha

1153,"Every single update has stealth economy nerfs. 

Gaijin has been making the game grindier and more unbalanced in nearly every patch since the game's release."
1154,no more storage help
1155,War Thunder. It's almost fun.
1156,"This game has a lot to offer but its Ground Realistic Battles are really fun/challenging if you've got the grit to get through the steep learning curve it really pays off. This game most closely mimics how I expect actual mechanized combat to be more so than anything Ive seen yet though and is still fun to play at the same time.

The WWII stuff in particular looks and plays strategically exactly how WWII tank engagements often went. Only its not a game mechanic they force on us, its simply the by product of all the vehicles in the game performing close to how they actual perform in real life. Its really fascinating to watch happen and if, like me, you don't have the time to grind new vehicles with your friends, you can use the #money cheat to give yourself enough help to keep up. 

It feels weird saying in game purchases are a good thing but they've definitely kept me engaged with this one."

1172,yes
1173,"It's free, so you can see how bad it is for yourself.

1: Unnecessarily long grind

2: Pay to progress
2a: Technically, you learn a lot by going through the game's vehicles in order. However, it's such a long grind that you're going to invest dozens of hours just to get to T4. And it only gets worse from there.

3: Bad community

Clearly a product that is trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you through repetitive gameplay loop."
1174,its a grind unless you pay for it
1175,it is very good in the long and shorty term because you can just have fun in your bomber and chill out the only bad thing is the grinding that can take years although it provides a learning expirernce so idk if its bad but second is the tryhards. its self explanitory
1176,if you want a game to really work towards being good at i reccomend it. if you want to have no fun sometimes. play war thunder. other times its really fun

1303,its a good game but need alot of grinding if you dont want to use money. so if u dont like grinding dont play it
1304,The game is good until you reach the point where you cross from WW2 tanks into cold war tanks. You fight way to often with WW2 tanks against tanks that are superior in every way. This alongside the grind that becomes way to much and that you need a premium account to even manage to have a positive balance at the end of the game ruind it in the end for me.
1305,This is a really good game the controlls are easy to remeber and it does take a little work to get different tanks ships and planes but its fun over all making that progress

1330,"I have been playing this game for a few years, went from playing on PS4 to PC, and the biggest issue with this game has to be the BR compression, especially in ground battles. The developers say it was done to help find games faster, and that you won't end up fighting tanks that you can't kill, which is definitely not true when you end up sitting in your neat little BR 2.0 tank and you have to fight a KW-2 because Gaijin just seems to 'forget' this rule when premium tanks are involved. 

Sure, the game CAN be fun, but only if you are someone who gets lucky not having to constantly deal with the bad results of the BR compression, or if you spend money on premium tanks."

1343,"War Thunder is one of those games where you have to devote hours and hours of your free time to it to have so me fun. Or you can buy your way to fun, but I wouldn't recommend it. Overall, War Thunder is slowly turning into a cash grab because of Gaijin's poor decisions to balance and add new content to the game."

1372,"This game is both some of the most fun you can have and so infuriating you want to smash your keyboard. I would recommend trying to play this with a friend because otherwise it can be tedious and boring.

The grind for this game is quite a lot but it is a free game so what do you expect. The game is quite predatory when it comes to spending money. I'd suggest making sure you wanna buy the item by test driving and looking at reviews of it before committing money towards anything.

but other than that this game is quite fun."

1382,"A hugggggeeeee grind, but if you like Tanks and planes. this is fun"
1383,"if u like to suffer and have no money this this is for u
"
1384,"Avoid this game! There is no fun factor and despite it being free the only real method of progressing efficiently is by buying their premium subscription. Mind you this subscription does not include the battle pass. Additionally it will literally take you years just to finish 1 tech tree. On average if you would play this game with premium it would take 8 years to unlock everything. I would like to mention the fact that their in game economics has failed to allow a fair amount of rewards and is overly complicated. Furthermore, there is a limited set of battle modes that scales vehicles of different eras and of completely different purposes together. This creates biased matches where you are at a disadvantage and almost forced to loose. There is nothing positive about this game aside from getting to see some of your favorite WW2 era vehicles in action. The community is mixed but with so many senior players and no method of separation between those trying to learn and those being competitive there tends be a very toxic environment (especially within matches). So, I say once more. Avoid this game."
1385,This game is absolutely amazing and makes you feel like a badass every time you play.

1395,panzer goes BOOOMMM
1396,"""The first hit is free""

This game brings you in easy so you feel like it's a game that you've got a solid chance of being good at. The truth is, you aren't. It's bots. Once you pass a certain point, that ends and you get to see what happens when dudes way higher than you are turning their ranks down so they can seal-club for game currency.

Make no mistake, this game is only free in order to push you to pay them or quit. Those are your two main options.

Edit: Gave the game some more time. Even after 7 more hours, I die without knowing why I am dying. Why my shots bounce off every target when hitting the top/rear/side of a tank. How I am getting sniped from across the map. There is no logic here, no law, no learning. It's just pain and people FAR more into this clubbing you and putting it on youtube.

Side note, fought a tank who got stuck between two buildings. Crit hit. Dead to rights. He vanished and popped up behind me instead, and 1 shot me. 

The only good way to play this game is to not play at all. Do not get frustrated, just get gone. I'm gonna find literally anything better to do with my time. Glad it's free to play, because I'd be angry if I had spent any money for the 16 hours I wasted getting curb-stomped."

1406,"Alright look, it's got all the usual things that come with free to play gaming.  Multiple imaginary currencies, cash stores, battle pass, premium, multiple tech trees with days-long grinds that can be easily bypassed for some more of your money.  But it's also got something that you can't get anywhere else.  It's hands down the most realistic representation of historical vehicular combat available to play.  The vehicles, the damage models, the ballistics are all presented with a very clear focus on accounting for as many of the real world variables as possible and including them in the simulation.  Despite the F2P spectre, it remains fun at every level, making the grind quite a bit more tolerable than average, and sometimes leading me to go back and play at lower levels just for the fun of experiencing the variety of vehicles.  I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys aircraft, boat, or tank fighting.  Especially WW2 era, 'cause unless you're paying, that's where you're gonna be for a good while."

1425,"Unless you want to spend your hard earned money on premium tanks, buckle up! cuz you will be grinding tanks for ages.

Keep in mind that premium tanks have better stats then regular ones. Also matchmaking is broken for as long as i remember. 
So get ready to get ""Up tier'd""... Meaning opponents will have tanks that are stronger then the ones you have.

Servers are ducking horrible, high ping and package loss... 400mb down 80 up optic internet here...getting around 15 ping in other games... here is 80-100+"

1429,I would recommend this game if it wasnt so hard to grind the teams you get are not on par with you not just that u get thown into up tiers so damn often i also dont like how the game actively punishes you for not having premium there is also the problem of balance since the tanks you face are abused like for example the ush or maybe the ikv 91 there is alot of inbalance in this game and i would recomend saving yourself from its addiction

Air Combat is super fun and my fav mode to play (This is also the only one VR is fun on)

Tank Combat is Good 

And Naval is good 

This game is World of Tanks, Warships, Warplanes, But Better and more real.

This game is super fun all it is missing is VR motion Controls. You will have to use your mouse while in VR, (As of right now)

If you are looking for a Muti/Co-op Jet game, this one works, and has VR Support (Only good in planes)
 But if your looking for a game that has Motion Controls, Id say go for VTOL VR"
1435,"You play this game because either you are a ww2 fanatic or enjoy a long grind. The amount of fun you can have at lower tiers  is insane with fun maneuvers, quick fast action, and genuine satisfaction once you learn a thing or two about how your tank, ship, or plane work to the best of its abilities. HOWEVER that is where the fun ends, you are not going to be able to use the Abrams, the Leopard, the IS-3, any kind of jet, or a good high quality ship/air craft carrier anytime soon when you play the game. The creators of this game could easily fix this grind-fest conundrum by implementing the sparsely used used 'folder' mechanic. Additionally with the desecration of the simulator mode where it is a shell of it's former self this game is more of a 'play for an hour every four months' before you quickly realize why you stopped playing in the first place.  Either way if you play this game, enjoy it extremely casually for you will break either your mind or your surroundings."

1533,"This is, by far, the worst single game i have ever had the displeasure of playing in my entire miserable excuse of a life. Do you like team-based game play where teamwork is never actually involved, and teammates seem to be more lethal to you then the actual enemy is? How about not having fun? Do you genuinely hate yourself? If your answer to any of these questions was yes, then this is the game for you! Prepare yourself for hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of hours of constantly asking yourself how any of the people around you got this far in life. Gone are the days of logging on and having a simple enjoyable match or 2 after work. Here are the days of getting sniped 30 seconds into the match by a 14 year old tryhard who plays this game 25 hours a day! Prepare to play a game where everyone hates you! Yes, you, they hate YOU! You dont like that? Too bad. You have something to say about it? ꜰᴜᴄᴋ you! Yes thats right, ꜰᴜᴄᴋ you! Because if you play this game, you are no better than any other scum sucking cretin on this planet. The only person worse than a War Thunder player is a Redditor, only because War Thunder no lifes are on Reddit spamming ""skill issue"" every 15 seconds to anything anyone says. In conclusion, if you are allergic to showers and women, this is the game for you."

1540,"This title ""Yamato-Tamashi"" means the soul of Japan nation. This special phrase refers to the inherent courage and brutality of the Japanese nation, and the spirit of loyalty to the Mikado -- the emperor of Japan. Release this title on September 3rd hurts not only Chinese people, but also other victims of Japanese militarism. This day should be the day that all people from countries which win Asia-Pacific War. But here in warthunder, you guys release a in-game title that contains a fascist & militaristic character. This behavior already broke your own rules like Warthunder rules 1.1.18 & 1.1.21. .This issue  already  make a huge boycott in Chinese community. To prevent this thing become an international political scandal，to show your empathy of all people and nations who  suffered under fascism during WWII， I believe Gaijin will make a wisdom decision -- withdraw the title ""Yamato-Tamashi"".

Например, арт удар. Вместо того, чтобы реально просчитывать разлет осколков, разрабы сделали так, что при попадании на определенной дистанции от танка с открытыми частями (например любая зенитка)- его ваншотит, а закрытый танк уже не ваншотит.

1573,"TL;DR - Don't try it,  not even once.  You won't be able to stop yourself 

======================================================

Its like an abusive relation ship,  and you are the child.  Mom is an abusive crack whore, addicted to anything she can get her hands on, most of which she gets from you.  The only way to afford the addiction is through Micro-transactions fueled by unbalanced premium vehicles that cost exorbitant amounts and will stay unbalanced for months to drive up sales, after which it will be nerfed into oblivion so they can say, ""Oh its worse then the one you can get for free, the game isnt pay to win!"".  

The father is distant, uncaring and cold,  allowing the mother to do as she pleases.  He only steps in to fix the smallest, and least of the issues that the mother creates.  Sometimes he balances things correctly, but never having the confidence, wherewithal or intrest in fixing the big issues, or better yet, leaving the relationship.  

But the worst part of the game is the niche it fills,  There is no other game on the market that scratches this itch, no relief from the want to play it.  You know its horrendously unbalanced, and that the problems are so abhorrent that you can see them even though you haven't played the game in years, but it keeps calling.  

Louder and louder,  The new vehicles like a siren's call, beckoning you, slowly.  In your moment of weakness, you give in, you download it.  You play it with the promise of ""I wont buy anything this time"" or, ""Ill just avoid the microtransactions this time around"".

But you see, they always get you.

A Battlepass that only costs 500 GE.  Ehh I shouldn't, I made a pro- wait that's an obviously broken vehicle that will only be accessible for the next month, and its only 500 GE to unlock it without having to do the battle pass? Oh but there isnt a 500 GE option.  Oooh but 1000 GE is only $6.60 might as well.  Oh wait if i get 5000 ill save 25%.  

Its a vicious cycle.  It happens every time without a doubt.  Maybe I'm weak willed, but the issue stems more from Gaijin using predatory business practices on their customers.  Statistically there are at least 10-20 Thousand others just like me that play this game.  They'll continue to make the game how they always have

Predatory and abusive.  
Refusing to fix the bug riddled mess.  
Refusing to acknowledge the atrocities they've created.  
Refusing to fix a system they created, and blaming the vehicles that they cant balance, instead of the way they've designed the system.  
Setting repair costs on problematic vehicles astronomically high to stop people playing them,  and if that doesn't work, removing the vehicle almost entirely. 

For your own good, don't.  Its a siren's call.  Play something else.  Maybe if they fix it, maybe if they decompress BR's, just maybe i'll suggest you play it.  But for your own good, and the good of the game aswell.  Dont give Gaijin your money. 

Even as I write this,  agitating old wounds,  uncovering memories of the past.  I want to play it.  Don't play this game, for your own good

1602,dont get addicted. i know i sound like a bot but it is fun
1603,30mm cannon go brrt. Uranium tipped bullets go *enter geiger counter crackling*. It's pretty fun although you gotta grind the shit out of the game or pay them 100 dollars to buy a fighter jet.
1604,"STOP Do not play this game if you want to keep your sanity, money, and hair. You start at the very bottom, WW1 or WW2 tanks and planes then u make the very painful climb to top tier modern day-ish vehicles. It's a very grind focused game like Warframe, and it's game modes and battle ratings aren't good at all. You will be in old A** tanks fighting modern-ish tanks  and you'd almost be forced to spend money on the game If you don't watch any videos on how to really move up in the tiers. yes it is Free to play but, if you want to move at a decent pace you will have to either be god tier out of the gate or spend money.

But like other than that, The Snail is Life, The Snail is Love, The Snail is Everything.

This game is like an abusive relationship, I love the game but it keeps abusing me , insulting me and taking my money but I just keep coming back for more and i wont get help and stop playing the game 9/10 better than WOT -Нилк

1645,"Incredibly realistic graphics and amazing damage models - instead of WoT, etc, the game has independent modules that take damage independent of eachother. You can detonate ammo racks, have all your crew members killed, or be burnt down from an engine fire (among many other ways to respawn). Extremely fun to practice aim and Hand/Eye coordination, especially with this games beautiful graphics. The only issue is the grind, and my goodness is it an issue. I've been playing for quite a while without spending a dime, and I'm not even at mid-war tanks (in any nation, of which there are quite a few), let alone the MBTs and helicopters the game advertises. While I do recommend it, the game requires commitment, or if you don't want to wait, it'll cost you a pretty penny. Happy flying!"

1654,"I cannot even begin to explain to you how fun this game is. When you spend 5 minutes driving around corners looking for an enemy, only to have your entire crew vaporized by an anti-air truck sitting in spawn. Or to have a dead center side shot not penetrate, and you get to watch the enemy's barrel slowly rotate towards you, killing you in an instant. It really makes you feel like the loader of a tank; blind, deaf, and stupid."

1657,this game is very nice and fun no lying
1658,"This is my first review on any game on steam, and I have quite a bit of games and history on this platform. To be honestly speaking, It's quite a good game on graphical and gameplay. But, I would and you should not play this game unless your a 24/7 no shower shit in room tryhard grinder addict to this game, as I have seen someone exactly like that, spent his entire life grinding this game and spending hundreds on this game. 

For people who are new to this game, basically you can fight as any vehicle/plane/ship you want. Twist is, you have to grind so hard and spend just to unlock the thing you want. The top tier modern tech will likely take you 1-2 years to get. Unlocking vehicles isn't like other games, waiting it out or spending ingame points and immediately get it. In this game you have to grind and kill other players to unlock research points and etc, which you get barely any. To get alot of research points, you will have to play realism mode. Which will take you at least 5 or 10 minutes to actually meet up with the enemy and you get killed the first second you enter the battlefield, no matter how ready you are, unless you are a literal tryhard who has enhanced vision in spotting camouflaged tanks or planes, you also die permanently no respawn. Even if you can get one or two kills, the vehicle or plane you want to unlock requires, for example 1000 research points or silverlions/etc, one kill might get you 10 or 50. In arcade, you spawn right in the middle of the battlefield, and you can respawn and fight again, it's also quite easy and you can get so many kills. At this rate still, maybe you can get 1 research point per kill, ONE POINT (literally dogwater). I have played this game myself, Some fans of this game might call me shit or criticising it too much, but this is my honest opinion. It is a turn away for so many new players unless you are really interested in this shit. 
Well, at least it's better than world of tanks blitz or those stuff. DC world might be better tbh.
game is unbalanced as hell, most other players have top tier stuff, and invisible to the naked eye tryhards"
1659,Very well game that is very realistic I like the details of it and  has great physics.

matchmaking is so bad that it almost feels like it's rigged to make you lose no matter how hard you try
the economy is extremely stingy (you get just enough silver lions to make up for the fact that you waste money every shot and have to pay for tank repairs, you need to pay for crew training after you buy a tank if you want to use it, you have to buy tanks to progress down the tree because the game isn't happy with you just researching the tank to progress.)
it's a typical gaijin game.

Edit: I have started playing world of tanks and despite that game being grindy as well, it is a FAR more generous game in regards to progression speed. the game also gives more quite a bit of free stuff every now and then. you can also gain and use free xp for FREE (no paying gold unless you are converting xp from an elite tank).

you still have to pay for ammo and tank repairs but you usually end up with alot more money compared to warthunder.

also for those who like in game purchases. premium currency in world of tanks is cheaper compared to warthunder."

1789,The Trill of being shot at and you trying to shoot back and your almost got the person all it takes is one hit and then you get em that feeling is 24/7 with this game but is takes a lot of grinding to get to better planes and if you just started you might wanna brace yourself people on this will be max rank but go to starter level with there skills so you will die a lot if your not ready for it
1790,It is painfully fun.
1791,"Interesting game, but the menus are a complete mess and progression is poorly explained. Specifically ""research"" is not explained what so ever or how to get it, nor is why you're constantly asked to buy ""crew"", and what they do is never explained, and much more. Additionally, it feels like a flying straight simulator for a good while until you actually get into range in which the fast TTK can result in you having to take the long trek back into the fight from spawn again if the mode even lets you. It does seem like you can upgrade speed to eliminate this problem but you will require a significant amount of this mysterious ""research"", or you'll just have to open your wallet and pay premium currency.

The game presents itself very similarly to a mobile game with numerous pop-ups on the menu screen, multiple currencies which go unexplained, seemingly game-play affecting real money purchases, and a premium currency as well. It's a fun game, but with the interface in such a sorry state, and so much going unexplained I can only leave this as not recommended."

Just watch some videos to help you understand how the battle UI works or you might get angry your tank/planes get oneshot. If you do want to play higher matches i recommend you get premium because you will get to a point where your stuff cost more to repair then what you get from a match. Bring a friend and get rewards! Along with special limited time events with rewards. War Thunder also has a market place where you can trade rare Rides, and if you're lucky you can get a discount coopons in your daily openings. Also WARNING not all planes/tanks/helis/ boats are good. Even if they are bought. You might be a victum of nerfs that may or may not have effected it playablility in battle. Also don't play arcade, you will thank me later."
1805,"Boom, hahaha"
1806,fun but hard to grind
1807,"Fun game but if you really want to enjoy it, it'll be huge big grind. Transactions make a huge difference on the game but aren't entirely necessary."

1819,i really love how realistic war thunder is but not to arcadey. the game still want to make us spend money so to fix either increase rewards or lower cost of all vehicles by 10 to 25 % or maybe do both. BTW if these sound to much please don't ban my account all i want is a easier grinding experience. DO YOU REPEAT DON'T BAN MY ACCOUNT I'VE SPENT 780 HOURS PLAYING THIS GAME ALL THIS IS A IDEA DO YOU REPEAT DON'T BAN MY AMOUNT IS A IDEA PLS

1827,"Number one important fact is that bthis game is pay to play, it is an amazing game and probs the best vehicle combat sim but it is expensive and the devs make use of suchb tactics"

 I'm sure it can be grindy as fuck if you take it seriously, but honestly? Just chill out with it. If you don't spend all day trying to get a certain vehicle and just have fun with what you have, the game is great."
1832,"The most frustrating game I have ever played. Gaijin could ruin anything they touch. I have had multiple accounts. Adding them all together, I have over 500 hours in the game.

1850,"This game takes abuse of your monkey brain, releasing dopamine whenever you earn a new vehicle. You need to work hard in this game, its all a big cope. You are better off spending the $300 or more to just get the vehicles you want so that you don't end up like one of the kids with 4000 hours on this game. You have a purpose in life, and you're gonna spend it on this game so that you can seek pleasure from gaining some virtual tank, airplane, or navy ship.

Anyways, see you on the game later."

1911,"i dont recomend this game for one big simple reason they dont care about fun at all, like to the degree that you a basically motivated to spawn camp others you have to research the right to repair or even put out a fire. like yeah sure low tiers not a big deal get an assist get both unlocked but around the 6.5 + range you literally could research every single part on a lower tier tank in the time it would take you to even get 1/4th the research on your parts. to top that off with higher tiers have higher engagement distances so this can happen to you from easily 1km away that they completely disable you with no way of fixing it besides going more into combat at the cap points hoping nobody looks at you. and if your caught on fire? well your literally just going to set there and burn unless there is an ally near by who most likely is not going to give up one of there 2 FPE uses to save you. and by BR 10.0 getting parts is over double the effort of even getting it at 7.5 so you could research all of tier 1 and 2 by time you even get part repairs. and there devs only excuse is to mock there players and say they might as well give everyone a free abrams because we simply want to do something when we get a new tank instead of being punished for 20-30 games in a row for being shot at even one time im literally ready to permanently uninstall this  mess this game has become over the years and this is only covering FPE and repair parts i could write a bible of the problems they are ignoring in this game currently"

1944,"I've played the game for years, its a fun game, not worth wasting your money on it though also very
 grindy"
1945,"This game can be fun, but it is more infuriating, you also can not advance after a certain point of progression, without premium time and vehicles, unless you have thousands of hours to waste. This game in general has a very cash grabby feel, yes it is “free” but should you spend more than about a dozen hours on this game you will most likely waste some money on this game, and then some more, and so on…"

2020,"despite gaijin advertising this game as being ""free to play"" it is by every definition pay to win, Infact warthunder is so pay to win that if you dont pay you are actively disadvantaged.

Gaijin is a greedy company run by depraved and morally reprehensible russian mongrels that are personally funding the war on ukraine, and if you wish to make their wallets fatter. be my guest to install war thunder and have the awful god forsaken experience that is ahead of you."
2021,"I really only play this game for the planes. Its a great time for when you want to enjoy a dogfight here and there with the game's wide variety of planes that you can work towards, I'd argue, pretty fairly and easily, you just need to have the time to work towards unlocking and buying them. Though I will say that it's very easy for you to lose track of how much currency you go through. Once you find yourself under 100,000 silver lions, it's a good idea to maybe just grind your way back up to a decent amount that can allow you to purchase upgrades and vehicles comfortably. I would love however, and I'm sure it's not going to happen, but I would absolutely love it if they added older generation planes like from world war 1. I think it would be amazing to be able to fly some of the planes that started it all like the Albatros D III, Sopwith Camel, Fokker D. III like the Red Baron's, and a lot more. If they ever add something like this, I would be super happy."

2040,"I would not recommend playing this game, it's very grindy and pay to win. 

here's a comparison and my reason for not recommending it:

let's compare this PvP game to another PvP game that you actually pay for, Tekken 7 is a game that you pay for but it goes on sale a lot of the time; Tekken 7's base game (without DLC) has 36 characters and 23 stages which are unlocked to you from the get go, the DLC also adds 15 additional characters and 6 stages making it to 51 characters and 29 stages, not only that but there's also another DLC which unlocks a whole new offline game mode bowling mini game (if you're interested in Tekken 7 then I'd recommend buying the game and all the season passes since the season passes also contain some new skins) and not only that but most of the cosmetics/skins can be unlocked through an offline fast mini game and you cannot buy them. you can also play Tekken offline with friends and it has a single-player.

now how about War Thunder? it's a ""free"" to play game, all of the tanks, planes, ships, etc. are in the base game but you have to heavily grind to unlock them or you can just buy them with real-life money, the skins, well, there aren't any skins for the vehicles. well, then, how's the DLC besides buying the vehicles? there's none really, there's the OST which costs money (I don't mind that) and there's high res texture packs which are free, there's no additional game modes, mini games, etc. the game also has a very hard to follow crafting and fixing system which confuses me. the game is always online and there's no single-player. I would not recommend playing this game because it's grindy, pay to win and the DLC offers nothing."

Its free and one of the best games i have ever played even when i am getting destroyed i know i am because i am bad and not that people spent money on the game and have the best vehicle in the game because it puts you in a lobby with people at the same step as you

2059,"This whole Game is an unbalanced piece of shit. You cant have any normal Game without getting totaly fucked from Helicopters or airplanes. The Nations are unbalanced shit aswell, like russia is the only nation u can have a fkn win with. The maps are also build like shit you normaly just getting spawncamped the whole game. Progress in the Game is pay2win aswell, making no credits at all without prem account and premium  tanks. Also the progess feels like ur a dead fkn snail which makes u hate the game even more. At all the game is unplayable and words like Balance and Progess dont exist in Gaijins world"
2060,planes.fun.
2061,its very good game i like planes/dogfight
2062,"I dont recommend this game at all. At first it was fun and exciting to go into battle with your tiny plane and getting a few kills Oh.. WAIT!! THIS WAS A TUTORIAL??!! THEN YOU JOIN A FUC KING SERVER WITH SOME GUY NAMED JOHN DI CK AND KILLS YOU 20 TIMES!! Anyways... this game is like any other.. a pay 2 win game and its no fun. Especially if you want a good plane, it will cost you almost around 60-300. Soooo if u a rich person, you have no problem WASTING money on here."

2064,"This game is a complete shit show and shows how not to design upgrade trees in any game, not to mention YOU ARE EXPECTED to pay to have ""good"" experience, and youre just getting spit on by the devs...
The amount of advertisement of tier 6 and 7 vehicles (especially jets) is insane and not even part of the game for 99% of people as grinding a tree without putting in money for premium time might just aswell range in the time a year of playing. And dont forget how fucking retarded and tremendously hard high tier becomes in the tank tree for any country... single premium vehicle costs as much as single AAA game...
This game is an absolute joke of a military game as it doesnt even allow you to experience fraction of everything it has to offer, TLDR: Game is p2w, dont bother trying to achieve something in it without paying hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours in-game, better off buying Battlefield 4 (I've spent about 1500 hours playing it, and its not p2w unlike War Thunder)."

A lot of vehicles are questionably powerful while others have so many weak spots that you are at an disadvantage in most engagements. Also includes game mechanics that will take the remaining fun.

I would rather recommend playing a game that will not ruin you evening."

2069,"The most fun game to hate. Sometimes realism isn’t the best course of action for a game, and things might be more fun with a bit of creative leniency, but regardless. It’s still better than World of Tanks, and it’s super fun in lower tiers."

2086,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

"
2095,"Possibly the greatest free-to-play game ever created if it is a game you enjoy... Started on PS, moved to the application version then just switched over to steam because its easier (so lets just say I wish it was only 80 hours spent). 

It is a very unique game, definitely not a game everyone will enjoy. There are different aspects that may appeal to different people, for example I pretty much exclusively play using air planes and on realistic mode (not arcade, not simulator). That is the real appeal of this game for me. Some others may enjoy playing air planes but only on simulator battles which are just too difficult for my liking, however I think if you aren't able to get into realistic mode and only stick to arcade the game becomes boring pretty quickly. Maybe some people would disagree with that though it's just my opinion. Then there is also boats and tanks which some people only play on those modes as well. I am sure someone out there mixes it up and plays different vehicle types.. The main point I am trying to make is that there is a little bit for a lot of different people, but not for everyone. I find ww2, planes, and flying all fascinating subjects which makes it an appealing game for me. 

You can play the game 100% free or you can spend money on things to make the game much easier. I have never spent a dime - at times you definitely feel a bit of a grind type of game play especially as you get into higher tiered vehicles. This both makes the game awesome by giving a real sense of achieving something when you unlock something, but can also be discouraging when you spend all this time and seems like you're not getting any closer. This can be avoided by spending money on a premium account or by purchasing better vehicles only available for purchasing. I feel as though those people are losing out on the greater fun of the game - and I don't feel that greatly disadvantaged by the other players using the pay to play planes. You can gain a much larger advantage just by becoming more skill-full at the game. So if you are turned off by the fact someone with a pay-to-plane just killed you I wouldn't be too discouraged. As you get better at the game you will start to take down players with paid planes (or other vehicles). I also really like that these developers still create new content/updates for the game even though it is not new. Sure you can criticise some of it (I am not crazy about the new Israeli air plane tree) but overall i have more respect that they keep adding to it"

However the actual combat can be very fun and enjoyable with the planes and jets feeling fantastic to control, the planes especially are incredibly fun to play around with however actually getting them can be so grindy that the only option is to either play 10 hours a day to unlock 1 new thing or pay your way through.

The shiny F-14 at the end of the US tech tree will take you MONTHS of DAILY grinding for hours to get, even after you bring out your wallet and throw your money at gaijin to ease the grind (more than 2-3 tripleA games worth). This game is really fun if you play the early vehicles because the grind isn't a full time job, if you go past rank 5 you WILL be spending weeks grinding for each vehicle (longer if you aren't playing 40+ hours a week). This game has become a sad cash cow in recent years with the makers just increasing the grind constantly, if you want to unlock every vehicle in the game it will take you multiple years (not a joke), and thousands of dollars. DO NOT GRIND THIS GAME FOR THE MODERN VEHICLES (imo their not even much fun because of broken gameplay)"

On one hand it can be absolutely amazing to play and you can have a great time, on the other hand you can be having a shitty night and get shot down by a teammate seconds after take-off for absolutely no reason. The grind alone will make you pull your hair out and most players never get past tier 3 or 4. It takes a very specific person to enjoy this game. My recommendation is to try it out and see for yourself if you'd like it. its free so all you'll be loosing is a bit of time. just whatever you do, DON'T GIVE IN AND SPEND THE MONEY ON PREMIUM VEHICLES/ TIME, it will only feed the dev's and motivate them to not fix the issues the game faces."
2264,"Really good game for plane battles. Best I've seen in terms of plane models. Gameplay can be frustrating sometimes, but most times it depends on what nation you choose, as each nation's planes are pretty accurate to their real life counter-parts. Example being, japanese and german planes generally had a higher turn rate, while american planes had more power output and could climb and dive faster, and generally had bigger guns."

2266,cant tell the difference between cold war era modern era and WW2 era tanks and planes.  Also they think that a IFV with a chain gun can kill an MBT from the front or side let alone penetrate the armor.!! furthermore lets have modern tanks fight WW2 era vehicles because they cant get enough people to play. who wants to die in the first few seconds of gameplay. this game has gone the way of WARSHIP AND WARTANKS....

If you really want to have a realistic, Aircraft and Armoured Vehicle Combat Simulation for free, this is your best option, otherwise, don't play it."

2404,"  War Thunder is a game with high highs and low lows. Some days you will get 13 kills and feel like a pro, other days you will have the worst matches and question your sanity. Most days you will be average.

Tips :

  Play arcade battles as a sort-of ""introduction"". Angle your armor and stay above your opponents to lessen the headache. This game has an awful grind that can be aided by money. don't expect to be to top-tier in 6 months. I have 200 hours and I'm only at 6.0. DON'T BUY THE CREW SLOTS!!! I made this mistake early on in 'Merica and now all 5 of my slots are so much lower than 3 could have been. Turn off free repairs, you will save SL by doing so and have an excuse to do something else for the 2-3 days for repairs(higher tiers). Low tier is fun tier. Find a low tier vehicle that you can A: have fun with and take a brak from higher tiers for a bit with and B: (if you're very poor like me) can use to make a steady source of money with( 3.7 Russia can give like 12k for good games and for MVP matches up to 32k). Rush the Helicopters as they (as of now) are the absolute best way to get SL.  HFGL."
2405,"its probally more of a addiction than herion, more damaging too."
2406,p a i n
2407,I want to die because of how long the grind in this game is
2408,"BR Compression is quite frankly disgraceful once jet tiers are reached. You'll have aircraft with no flares going up against aircraft with IR missiles, you'll have supersonic jets up against 1st generation jet fighters. Mid tier axis teams absolutely stomp all over allied ones, but nothing will be done to balance it. None of it makes any sense, and Gaijin have made it clear that they have no intention of fixing it. If you're not already hooked on the game, do yourself and favour and don't play it, it just isn't worth it."
2409,good
2410," If you love military history, collecting vehicles, a horrible grinding system, developers thinking of a nation's lineup instead of the individual vehicle, seeing your opponent burn or their turret flying through the air, and lousy optimization with all graphics cards, this is the game for you! I've wasted my life and some money on this game. The old War Thunder was a game to play but with all the weird tank modifications and graphical errors, I can't play this game anymore. Do better Gaijin, the player-base is giving you a ton of finance not to sit on your swivel desk chairs and look at the number go higher but to improve all the bugs that have been in this game for years and improve the experience. Do better!"

As of this posting, this is a pure money-sink game.
STRONGLY do-not-recommend until:
- Match balancing is immediately implemented (Top tier players constantly annihilate new players trying to learn the game and prevent the new players from gaining the experience and modification points to advance to better vehicles (or limit that advancement to nothing).)
- Prevent spawn-camping.
- Fix the bots from CONSTANTLY one-shotting from extreme range and ""within one second of spawning"" (theirs and ours).
- Fix new matching (e.g. Ground) where ""green"" (max dmg) shots are 95% ""No damage"" while the bots one-shot you.
- I invested a little $ to get two of my crews to (advanced skills), to see if it would have a better effect.  The only effect I've seen is inconsequential to gameplay.  Very sad.

Game look:  9-9.5 of 10
Game play:  2 of 10

Overall it looks like a great game, but once you have more than a few matches, you realize the game is extremely unbalanced ... has been for years (hundreds of posts) and zero care or help from the owners/devs.  To me, this is very depressing because for the first 25-30 matches, I was really getting into this game ... but it is blatantly designed to force new players to accept their role as whackamole, without exception.

Note:  This is MY review, not yours.  If you don't like it, you know where to go, and post your own."
2439,"War Thunder is a very enjoyable game. It offers fun and intense battles of all sorts, Air, Sea, and Land. It may not be the most balanced at times, but the variety of players makes it that much more enjoyable. 9/10."

2447,"The graphics are good and the game is not p2w (at least not yet), but the matchmating is trash. You get way to good (or cheating?) opponents even if you have battle rating 1.0. In tank games everyone is just camping an sniping, I thought this was only an issue in fps games, but no it seems like you can even camp and snipe in tank games."

"
2453,Ever since switching from the Russian Ground Forces to the German Ground Forces I learned there is only one true way to play this game...the German way. Playing as a low tier Russian tank: if anyone sneezes on you then you're blown to the sky. But now with the Panzers I can finally inflict this pain onto others.
2454,"This game is fantastic.. at lightening your wallet. In tanks, you will be shot by a round from a mile away that barely scrapes the ground, passes through a window, goes through an entire field of high grass and brush, scrapes the ground again, and somehow finds your tank in a completely vulnerable spot, without you ever seeing the enemy.

In planes, you'll watch someone going straight, line up on their tail, and watch them lag in 7 different directions before pulling off unscathed. 

When the game plays correctly, it's fantastic. When it plays like it usually does, it's like banging your head against the wall until your ears start to bleed."
2455,i a good game
2456,nice
2457,"i can't recommend this game for new player simply just due to how this game mmr works or rather lack of there of. The Battle Rating system that they use allows for very lopsided teams, skillwise, resulting in  most games being a one sided steam roll. The repair fees means that if you have a particular streak of bad games you can make negative silver lions, freeium currency, slowing your grind to a halt. If one of these ever get's changed I'll change my review. See everyone on tomorrow."

2474,"No anticheat, unrealistic as they come, only been top tier 1 game, every game is vs people a tier above you in pay 2 win premiums. No spawn protection vs overpowered and easy to use air vehicles, grind to get top tier is about 5x as long as WOT and that is slow. You will constantly die to people abusing ULQ graphics and no skill players that shoot your barrel out. Its basically a bad simulator where you die in 1 shot to people abusing either the lack of anticheat or ULQ graphics and op premiums whilst you have to play a shitty tech tree tank that is stock with worse values than everything it makes you play against with the constant uptiered games, and there is little to no balance in this game."

Whether it be the massive list of vehicles and upgrades available throughout tons of country's and different uses, or the massive skill ceiling, there's always more to do. This is truly a game you can grind for the next 5 years and still have more to accomplish, which not many games can claim. If you enjoy grinding through games, and have the patience to get past the first through hours of learning the basics and unlocking enough to have a proper game, you'll love it."

The whole SL system is flawed, grinding without a premium is painful to say the least, top tier is filled with bullshit, top tier feels like playing arcade... i could go on into detail but that found take hours...
New players that will start, think it's fun until you dive into it, it's not worth the grind or the money.
Gaijin essentially made a game that's mediocre as possible, combined with bugs and premium vehicles that are overpowered, not all of them but a large portion of them are.
In conclusion, is this game fun? No.
"
2524,plane go brrt
2525,"This game is fun at first, but dont think this game will be fun all the time. As soon as you get above BR 4.0, this game becomes an absolute torture simulator and the grind becomes absolutely unbearable.

2546,"Pain and suffering, I can't feel anything anymore"
2547,"War Thunder is a good example of how the business model can ruin an otherwise good videogame.
It's well known at this point that the grinding in this game is almost unmatched. No amount of patience can save you from considering dropping the game at least once. Given that, you'd at least expect the matches to be short and/or fun. Unfortunately, this game is at least in part pay-to-win. Matches are often frustrating, not least because of the realistic damage system, which will sometimes turn your tank into another piece of map cover from a single shot sent from across the map. Given that, progression in this game ends up being slow and often painful.
The game is also extremely unfriendly to new players. I had the luck of starting the game alongside a friend who was more experienced, but that won't be the case for many people. It almost feels like Gaijin doesn't care that much about new players, since most of the newer updates introduce mostly late-game content.

On the other hand, the number of vehicles and the range of customization is admirable. The game is also gorgeous, and, aside from the glitches and such, provides an immersive simulation.
I'm sorry to say that's not enough to outweigh the cons, however."

2550,"This is not a fun game but it has fun moments. There will be moments that you are on a roll and others where you want to punch everything. I really think spawn kills are really unsportsmanlike, that is both from a winning and loosing perspective.
Do like tanks though."
2551,"Ground RB's current state is near unplayable. Not only is vehicle balance in the worst state I've seen it, matchmaking skews teams to where there are 3+ more players on one team or the other."
2552,worst game ever
2553,"War thunder is a game that is pretty cool and you can use tanks, planes, half tracks etc. and if you are a ww2 nerd (like me) this game is right up your alley, and the best thing about it its free! so I recommend this game to all steam users"
2554,"cool
"
2555,OLD BUT GOLD  if you like planes and tanks then i would recommend this game to you. Its an old game and is slowly dying so it might take a bit to get into a match. But it is a little pay to win in the beginning tiers especially.
2556,"im 15 hours in and feeling the addiction.
I have gone ahead and sold my soul to Gaijin for 200 gold eagles and very happy thank you :)"

2563,"I am terrible at 1st player shooting games, but this has do many elements that I actually enjoy this, and can/have won before. There is no gore, as a bonus."
2564,"The game itself is good. BUT

The business model is predatory and hidden pay2play. Once you have grinded yourself through the first few tanks you will notice that the economy is designed in such a way that you will mostly break even with your repair spending compared to what you earn in free currency for a game. So if you want to progress you are more or less forced to buy premium to earn just enough extra bonus currency to progress in a meaningful way. 

This issue gets worse since you cant skip vehicles by just researching them, no you also have to buy them, even if you dont want to play them! Also your performance is not measured by active combat but by getting killshots. In combination with the fact that aircraft can bomb you at the spawn and that aircraft spawns themselves are broken means that you can play 15mins completely present and to the best of your abilities but you leave the game not only with 0 currency but you can actively lose crowns by having a bad game which will then undo 30mins of normal gaming. 

All to push that stupid premium."

2573,Unfortunately P2W - But on top of that you'll be instakilled by players who take 3 full loads of rounds to kill. It doesn't make any sense. There's a huge P2W and I believe return player benefit. Do not recommend for Air flight.
2574,"The more you play, the better you get. I almost quit the first day but i was like ""nah ill keep playin till i know how to handle the system an all"" soo guess if you wanna play this game you gotta keep playin and not quit like some dudes who just started playin and then were like ""nah this game aint for me"" the game is awsome overall by the way."

2608,"its ok for a free game but the BR system doesnt work

update: so many bugs just uninstalled couldn't play this broken game any longer. I've heard people say this is a skill based game couldn't be further from the truth. My first ground realistic battle I went 6-1 without playing any tank games previously. This game is not skill based, the only factor in winning is picking the German or Russian faction or a premium vehicle. Experienced so many bugs (visual and gameplay). Invisible walls which will make your tank slow down or car stop, walls that will reappear after you destroy them preventing you from seeing through them but your enemies will be able to see through, played vs A.I. one game and a bot in a BT7 one shot me through 4 bushes and a hill without ever seeing me (not a bug but the A.I. needs a lot of reworking, they either shoot into the aim and completely miss or shoot you through the landscape without ever seeing you). SO MANY lag spikes down to 10-20fps (playing on movie settings but there shouldnt be any lag spikes with a good gpu, 32gb ram, and nothing running besides the game!) ABSOLUTELY wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."

2617,"Played this game for 3 hours, probably the worst gaming experience ever. Flying around, hitting one guy like 200 times to kill him, just to randomly get shot down by 5 bullets because he has that much better plane than me. So if you want to have a good gaming experience you have to be ready to spend hundreds of dollars because there is simply no other way. If there is a definiton of pay to win game, it is this one. Also the amount of bugs that i have encountered in the launcher in those 3 hours is probably higher than the amount of bugs i encountered in all of other launchers combined since my birth."

2623,The combat is very satisfying once you get the hang of it. however the GRIND is real. it sucks that each country has a separate tree and that you have to endure the slowness and low firepower of tier 1 vehicles to reach the vehicle you want of another country.

2678,"Don't let the meticulously developed ballistic modeling fool you, there are plenty of short comings with the game. More importantly, though is the player base.

There are 2 types of players in WT. Those who cover each other with lanes of fire and smoke concealment, help repair and/or tow damaged vehicles, who call out seen enemies, and coordinate activities. There are also those who grief - push your vehicle into practically inescapable ravines and chasms leaving you to sit the match out, endanger others by requesting help,  or lose the vehicle to rejoin the match, incessantly shoot the back of your vehicle with their machine guns preventing you from hearing or seeing, and spam the same message over the radio with as much speed and frequency as they can. The former is always the enemy team, who will surround you and shoot you from at least 8 different directions at once, while every single member of your team, the later, will be up in the air (in a ground battle) but providing no support or recon until all of your ground vehicles are dead. If at any point you try to help out in a battle, the enemy will immediately cease firing the shots they took the time to line up on your useless team mate and turn around to 180 no scope one shot you.
In a mode called assault arcade, they will all shoot at the frontal armor of a single vehicle for minutes on end that none of their guns can penetrate, declining to take a few seconds to flank and make a useful shot,  while ignoring 20 other vehicles capturing the point your supposed to be guarding. All of those 20 vehicles will aim and fire at you from the very second they spawn in and they can see through concealment and cover.

As with any Gaijin game, it's extremely unpleasantly grindy, but at least here you advance tech by national army, whereas in Enlisted you advance tech by theater, meaning that as they expand that game, you'll have to do the same research for the same army multiple times.

If you want a better ground vehicle experience, use Gunner Heat PC, or Steel Beasts. For air, DCS or Falcon BMS is better. For generic combined arms OFP / ARMA / VBS is king, though the offworld titles like Post Scriptum and Squad and their inspiration in Project Reality Battlefield are good too."

2687,"Very nice graphics and game mechanics, it's definitely P2W but if you play with your friends, it's a ton of fun."
2688,"Trash, has mouse smoothing with no way to disable it in the settings.
There's a mouse acceleration setting but even with that at 0, 50, or 100, there's still smoothing and acceleration.
I'm an idiot of I'm wrong but feel free to tell me exactly how to do it because I tried looking and found nothing.

Any PC game with this feature and no clear way to turn it off is a failure IMO. Uninstalling to play any other game that has proper mouse input. Oh it's also full of unwanted popups as well, I don't care if they're malicious or not the fact that you're bombarded with up to 6 meaningless in-game popups you have to close after each ~5 minute battle is ridiculous. If it weren't for the mouse issues, I would probably get tired of this, it's that bad. Maybe it's a new player thing but whatever that's a terrible new player experience if so."

2709,"well the gameplay are the best but ned to fix the glitch and improvethe security since we have the hacker right now
"
2710,"First of all, the ""free to play"" tag is a wee bit missleading, paying for premium time/premium vehicles is encouraged by Gaijin and most experienced players as it significantly speeds up the grind and helps you stay afloat (it certainly isn't a necessity, but highly useful)

Second point, you will (I certainly have) want to punch a wall or uninstall this game a few times while playing, so get some friends and joke about it, it's hard, and I've certainly wanted to throw my pc out of the window more then once, but the game keeps drawing me back to click that big, red, shiny ""to battle"" button.

Third point, this isn't a massively demanding game on the hardware (mentally? oh yes, the learning curve is pretty steep)and it can be run on some pretty basic systems, which to Gaijin's credit, means that they have a much more forgiving game then some other MMO's

Forth point, this game has a pretty steep learning curve, and as such I would recommend grinding your first nation naturally, from tiers 1 to 7 (if top tier is your goal, it isn't for some people) and then diversifying into other nations. I would strongly recommend against buying a top tier premium straight away, or even before you've gotten to that tier in-game, since you end up being more of a burden to your team then anything else.

I would recommend it as it 100% has some rewarding and funny moments, but it can be a bit rage inducing at times."
2711,The grind is a pain in the ass and half the time I get sniped through like the tiniest gap in the trees from Mars. I don't know how they can see me but that's just how it goes. Probably a skill difference. Most likely a skill difference actually. Idk. I like war planes and tanks. It's fun to play so I recommend the game. +1
2712,"Out of all the other paid games I've played. I seem to be having more fun than of the other paid games I've played. I've played GTA 5 a lot more over my other games but when I decided to check out War Thunder, I was pretty much blown away by the details and graphics. The gameplay was fun as well, my favorite personally being the Assault. Ground Arcade, you basically play as a Ground vehicle and defend from waves of hostile AIs. In order to win you need to rely on your teammates. Which in most of my cases, they just tend to go on a killstreak while we suffer from either the left or right or possibly from the back, but overall it's a fun game."

This is not your casual gamer safe space what so ever, people will yell at you for playing bad. The devs add new content a lot every month or so, but don't know how to keep things balanced at all. If you decide to play tanks, chances are you will die to planes more than tanks. If you play planes you will get your ass handed to you in a heartbeat. If you play ships then.. Who are you? ---Play WoWs for that--- It's just, this game has pissed me off so many times, and I've wasted at least 4000 hours of my life on it. Please don't get into this game as a newer player because once they suck you in, you can't get out, and your wallet and or sanity will pay for it. Please take my word, it has happened to all of us."

2774,IT IS A REALY NICE GAME AND YOU GET TO TEST FLIGT STUFF
2775,yes
2776,flying is cool. haven't really explored the boats.
2777,I like playing War Thunder for its Aerial Combat which I feel is much better than Ace Combat or World Of Warplanes.
2778,Why would they make the grind so long. Even if you have premium it would take hundreds of hours to unlock most things if you are playing casually.
2779,gun go buurd
2780,"So painful, so blissful..."
2781,"Great game, shame the game modes are trash. There is a mode where you have to bomb bases but even if the enemy hasn't even damaged your bases once and you are on their last base they can still win. Its like having a capture the flag mode where you can just win with kills and ignore objectives, really annoying. Other than that good game but very predatory for pricing shop items."
2782,"Fun, Very grindy though."
2783,i finally reached 1000h on this account now i can end my life hope guys have a great time in this hell :))
2784,boom
2785,"I recomend it if you like the realism of the game, instead of totaly arcade gameplay in wot. 
But many other aspects of war thunder are pretty much unfinished and unpolished.
Graphics looks cheap (strange dark contrast, overall graphics feels like something from 2012), lobby interface looks also cheap and unfinished, costumization of vehicles is unnecessary complicated....
Grinding is very long but its more rewarding than in wot ( tech tree vehicles are actually very good).
In conclusion this game need  an update in which  its graphics and interface would be  reworked ( like wot had in 2018)."
2786,"""Do you like being tazed in the balls while eating shards of glass and diping your hands in boiling water ?"""
2787,"I've tried grinding out this game for a while, but the matchmaking in this game is atrocious. You will constantly be up-tiered and fighting against tanks/planes that are impenetrable with your cannons (especially if you are not playing USSR). If you haven't already grinded the game for a long time, you will get destroyed by extremely advanced and experienced players.
Oftentimes, you will find yourself getting killed in unbelievable/unreasonable ways to include spawn camping, 1km one-hit-wonders, shots that go through impenetrable geometry, ammunition exploding despite it not getting hit in the kill feed, and losing to a shot that should not have penetrated while somehow bouncing when it should not have. 
Cheating is still a major problem and Gaijin does nothing about it.
Without a premium account/vehicle, the grind is unbearable for both currency and matches in general.
Many people have also reported event/premium vehicles simply being taken out of the game without a refund while others have had premium currency removed without warning or explanation.
Playing solo is asking to consistently get rolled by pre-mades who spam rockets and CAS. This should only be a game played with friends that have communication and/or with people who have grinded the game for years."

2797,Just dont sell your kidneys and its a fun game
2798,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2804,"Used to play this on the PS4 hence why the low hours... decided to give it another go, same old grindy piece of sh**, where you're in unbalanced matchmaking, unless you pay money like the game wants you to, you have to either become a neckbeard with no free time, or wait until you start to age and feel dusty once you try and progress past rank 3."

2814,"very smooth game with minimal lag all the functions and ways the sim work are fun and easy to use.
any vehicle research after tier 3 or 4 takes too long to stay engaging."
2815,Its a decent game the grind makes me cry inside tho just want the a-10 and f-14 might as well join the air force
2816,"It starts with one
All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard"
2817,Not boring and good.
2818,"Great game, technical & skill based , no pay to win elements to get an advantage over your opponents. You can spend money, but thats only to make your progress further. Historical, no fictional made-up vehicles like you get in world of tanks. Tanks & planes can be in one battle which is freaking awesome !

If you were making a choice between world of tanks and War Thunder, it would be War Thunder each and every single time ! For sure !"
2819,"it's alot of grinding, but overall, the best military vehicle game out there
"
2820,sss
2821,What a great game...but is painful to the soul
2822,"Though it's a free to play game, it's way too time consuming. You'll have a hard time grinding research points and silver lion coins."
2823,TONK!
2824,Pay to win garbage.

2826,"the snail might be watching me but i don't care along as i get to play this game i realy like how the tanks and over things work 

it took me along to write this becuase how good it is"
2827,"This game is Good, it has tutorials to help beginers to play the game easily, 
controls seems Ok not bad, 
If put on High Graphics, the game looks really realistic.


One Neative thing bout the game is that it's kinda grindy,
by grindy i mean :-
you start from the very old tanks ships and planes, so you would have to play a lot, and i mean a LOT in order to get the latest planes like the A-10 ThunderBolt. 

Apart from the above negative thing, the game is really good!
And I would recommend anyone else to play this game.

Thanks For Reading this Review,
have a nice day,
The Spikey Man"
2828,very fun but painful at some times
2829,don't sell your soul to the snail
2830,Grind=Pain&Suffering
2831,a game 10x more fun to watch than to play
2832,y e s
2833,F U And see you tomorrow is the definition of this game. AND WHY IS THERE NO MISSILES TILL 8.0 IN USA BUT &># IN BASICLY EVERY OTHER NATION DOWNTIER THE M551!. See u tomorrow to get tazed in my balls!.
2834,I love the ground battles. Awesome game
2835,Its just a good game.
2836,penetration is so confusing
2837,pp
2838,Other then the constant updates and sometimes going up against higher level players. It's a fun interactive fast paced game. The fact that the tournaments are purely human players can make for some really fun matches. Highly recommend playing with friends on a team.
2839,"I can shoot down fr*nch planes, which would typically kill a fr*nch ""person"", therefore I can kill fr*nch ""people"", which would make this game an absolute masterpiece."
2840,it's alright I guess
2841,total waste unless you wanna spend $$$ for everything in the game.
2842,might take awhile to get stuff but once u do W game
2843,It says free to play but it's lying every time you play your being costed your sanity it is the hardest game and the easiest at the same time it's weird but I love it would recommend to anyone without a doubt
2844,good dogfights
2845,Poop
2846,you love and hate it at the same time
2847,fun
2848,"Just don't play this, the DLC is insanely expensive, just don't."
2849,Fun tank
2850,Game economy and mechanics are fcked up and it keeps getting fcked up every update. Unless you are willing to grind for 12 hrs per day or spend a shitton of money don't buy this game. Even if you're going to spend money here its not that worth it trust me. Devs don't give a damn about its playerbase. Go find other games with devs that care.
2851,its a really good and fun game i defiantly recommend it
2852,"but the damm grind is so much
"
2853,UNLESS youre tying to kill yourself play this godforsaken p2w shitty br game ngl
2854,Grind is horrible. Good luck getting anywhere in War Thunder if you have a job.
2855,addiction!
2856,"Played a few years ago, left due to the ingame currency and the greedy take of the company.
Reinstalled played a few games a reunistalled, stil the same ...
The game is still a waste of time."
2857,gud
2858,"a very fun game. keeps realism in perspective, while also creating a fun way to play with tanks from all ages. can be very frustrating at times, but ends up being super fun once you learn the basics. 5/5. (p.s, go to gaijins website and download it from there, cause its free)"
2859,Tanks go brrrrrrrm
2860,Is oke
2861,Descent balance to game play.  Only occasionally feel like your opponent bought success.
2862,"do not play it is a waste of your time you will feel like your get ass fucked by a monkey

2863,good game i love it so much (please help me i had to sell my right knee cap to get a jet please my family is being held hostage)
2864,Broke my keyboard out of rage
2865,game is very grindy and wallet warriors are everywhere but I cannot deny that this is the most entertaining form of simulated air combat
2866,its ok
2867,Gets boring way too quickly and you have to grind too much
2868,"Its so bad and painful. If you want to feel what its like to be shocked, hit with a bat and be pepper sprayed every single, game then play this. 100% recommended"
2869,"Great game with insane graphics, My favorite 10/10 reccomend"
2870,Fun. When it wants to be.

2884,"It's a fun game. 
But: Regard the ""Free2Play"" aspect rather as a free demo.
Progressing through the tiers is absolutely painful if not on a premium account and preferably in a premium vehicle."
2885,"I've been playing this game since it started in 2012. Heck, I remember when this game wasn't on steam, so really the steam hours don't do it justice for how long I've killed my soul over this game. I'll tell you its great and terrible all in the same sentence. If you value your time and soul, nowadays I wouldn't even really touch the game. Since the grind is about as horrible as it can get, your probably going to take about a month to get to top tier, and that's IF your good at the game with premium account. Its also littered with bugs and problems here and there, when they go to fix them they create about a 1000 more. Damage models have simplified over the years, where a rifle caliber bullet can take out a B-29 in 1 shot nowadays. Veteran players tend to stomp the competition into the ground, they also have access to all the old event vehicles from the past, in which some are amazingly broken. The events now require you to grind a job and use a marketplace (for PC) to get anywhere. Teammates tend to think they can accomplish all the things by themselves, which in turn leads them to die immediately and cause your team to suffer. It is a team game in the end now matter how broke it is, and you can see it when a full squad of players that are good carry a team of lemmings to victory.

All its a lot of bad with some pretty good times. Its the only game of its kind out there and that's what makes it great. And the developers know this based on their money schemes. The community can't decide on anything to hold the developers accountable, which in turn makes them run in circles on various issues, making it pointless to get anything done. The game has gotten better in some aspects, worse in others (I've seen the highs, and the lowest of lows). Pick up it up at your own risk, so you can figure out how you feel for yourself. Form your own opinion. There really isn't a game like it, and I've invested too much to ever put it down, so I'll still be playing this until the game dies.

If at any point things change in this game. Ill update the review accordingly. Until then, its a game I recommend even with its flaws just for how unique it is.

See you in the skies above."
2886,Awesome game!
2887,nosould
2888,"When i feel like my day has been just a tad to good, I jump on War Thunder to make my day a little worse.

The game itself is actually really good, and extremely addicting! Each tank, plane and boat has individual parts and crewmembers that are vital to operating the vehicle. If a component is damaged or destroyed it will effect the vehicle in a simmilar way as if the same component had been lost on the real vehicle (for the most part).

The problem is the way Gaijin handles monetization. Unlike other games where you either have to pay for the game or have the option to pay for new skins or such. Gaijin makes the grind so incredibly long and the repair costs and upgrades so expensive, that it feels like you have to pay to progress. And with their latest advertisements focusing on high tier jets and tanks, It seems contradictory to have said jets blocked behind a 1000h long grind or a paywall."
2889,"Fly planes, drive tanks, (ships, well, yep, its there too )
good graphics, smooth controls, tones of planes and tanks.
WW1 to modern stuff.

comparing with all the games out there that fits the above sentences.

Warthunder is doing pretty good.
and its free.

the grind, just dont think about it and enjoy the game"
2890,I successfully gave myself Stockholm Syndrome playing this game
2891,Very cool game + its free
2892,cock and ball torture
2893,this game is really fun to me and i sometimes forget that there are try hards in this game that produce enough sweat to fill entire aquariums but forget that don't get mad and enjoy the game
2894,"I could honestly go on about the balancing issues, the codensed tier problem, the flight models, armor physics and so on and so forth. However the biggest issue I believe is that they honestly don't care about the game. I played this game back when it first came out on Steam and the way Gaijin has changed both the reseasrch and cost of both repairs and ordering of vehicles is bonkers. Even at low tier (I to II) on a successful mission with a bomber aircraft and even an air to air kill you literally get almost NOTHING. Oh and God forbid you get shotdown because then you lose hundreds if not thousands of SL. I would love this game to be all that it possibly could be but I'm positive that is'nt going to happen."
2895,Yes.
2896,just amzing
2897,awesome game. I used to play this on my PS4 but i immediately downloaded it when i got my computer. i have 403 hrs on the game and i play it almost every day. it is so much fun and you can find some really cool people in custom battles (that's where i spend most of my time).
2898,planes are pretty cool and so is this game

"
2907,"terrible map design for ground forces. everything is so open, might as well remove all the trees and just give you flat grounds. PS due to BR, you will have WW2 tanks facing cold war tanks, eating missiles n screw your heavy armor."
2908,"I enjoyed playing this game with my friend when I did not have an unlimited Steam account. I really liked the graphics of this game, the controls, and the fact that this game is free. Not to mention that this game is completely free. Although I am thankful that this game is free, I really think the developers deserve so much more. Personally, though, I never really enjoyed dedicating so much time in this game, that's why I only have 12 hours in this game which honestly took months to build, but I have already gotten an idea of what the game was like. The reason for not playing this game is really just because of my taste of games of indie offline games, and I don't prefer online competitive games, especially if anyone hardly invites me to play."
2909,"War Thunder is a military vehicle shooter where you upgrade and collect all sorts of military vehicles from planes, tanks and even warships to fight your enemies in a massive all out battle from both the land,sea and skies. You can use a variety of weapons to take down your foes going from machine guns, shotguns to even missile launchers as you navigate your way across the battlefield to achieve your mission.

2919,"Its a good game. Be prepared to invest a lot of time and a lot of frustration. Be aware that you can't grind active events right away. (Also I have a lot longer in this game than seven hours, I only recently switched to steam client) I would always recommend using steam client. Use boosters when you get them but ONE SL and ONE RP at a time. Never rely on the devs to correct a problem, but know that a lot of people experience bugs more than most and therefore make it sound like it is worse than it is. Definitely recommend it but watch out for the previous points."
2920,gamr
2921,"If youre a f2p player you dont have the ability to go above tier 4 in this game. the game has micro transactions which means the premium vechiles are mostly overpowered especially in higher ranks. the events are painful to grind and pointless. Overall a good game i think 






Akchtualy its not as bad as you would think after reading this review you have the feeling of changing real life events not historically accurate but still i enjoy it even tho if you wanna get to top tier you have buy premiums or grind 24/7"

Turn your back on the Snail and the Snail will harm you in ways you cannot fathom. The only joy that comes is when you get that TARGET DESTROYED and man that's the only satisfaction I need.

Get out while you still can!!"
2935,"Game is not balanced at all. Company shows clear favoritism to different factions. The game induces gambling addictions with all the obviously rigged loot boxes. I hate playing this game but I cant stop playing due to the aforementioned gambling craze this game has in its mechanics. Matches are riddled with bugs on a daily bases, as well has having an absolute broken match making program as it will absolutely stack a team, and have the rest bunched up in the corner of defeat. The in game currency is starting to become harder to come by forcing players to spend real money just to keep themselves going. 
I do not enjoy playing this game, I keep hoping it will get better with the next vehicle that is unlocked but it never does."

absolutely garbage game design, until they decide to rework currency or remove repair costs, you may want to skip this game."

2944,"I love War Thunder. People might say its broken, a cash grab, and other monikers, and of course they're right. War Thunder is unbalanced, and at times unplayable. It's certainly not for everyone, but For those select few, its the most fun you will have in a game, myself included.
I would recommend, but buckle up, It's a long road to top tier."

don't mind the low playtime I play this game on a console."
2946,"X56 has been out for forever, and is arguably the most popular HOTAS on the market, but you still have to tediously custom config all the controls from scratch for this game.

I think this was the experience to prove to me that arcade flight games are trash and those of us talented enough to use a HOTAS should stick to good flight simulators like DCS for combat."
2947,Warthunder is a good way to get people interested in the basics of ww2 and post war military vehicles and that's about it. But as a experience its a soul wrenching hellscape of a game.

2952,My buddy got me into this game. It is a big grind but from the amount of time I have played it I do enjoy it. But it is quite tough some games your killing it and doing really well and others your getting sniped across the map in spawn. But if your looking for a game to spend hours on that does not cost any money to start playing then give War Thunder a try.
2953,"i wish my broth would apoligize once for all the things he says about me cause its ok if he makes fun of me but not ok when he invites others to
"
2954,"This game has more bugs than a $10/hour hotel room in Philly. Horrible support as well, very unbalanced gameplay, with a ""pay to win"" model where people can buy overpowered vehicles to dominate the game. Not worth the time to play."
2955,this game fucking sucks

2959,Joining a squad is not available in this event all game modes but one enough said
2960,This is the best war game I have ever played It is an outstanding game with so much effort put into it. This game is also awesome with friends.
2961,"This game is like no other, its so fun yet so not fun at the same, pick it up 100% but be aware you will have to spend Hundreds of hours to even get into the 6th rank with premium"
2962,This game gives me more and more depression each time i play it.
2963,"""free to play"""
2964,"ITS SO FUN
"
2965,"It's a beautiful game, but the battle pass system and money grabbing is insane. I got the battle pass some time ago, it wasn't cheap. Took a break for a while, come back and its gone. The fact the battle pass season ends every 2 months is just a money grabbing scam in my opinion"
2966,"It's difficult to progress and more pay2win/pay2progress than most good free games. The game is good and it's definately something to try with friends. But I can't recommend it knowing how far it's fallen. With the addiotion of the sifth and seventh rank of vehicles as well as ships has ruined it for me. They are losing focus of  what the game was when it was only aircraft available and are trying to make too many things within one game. For tanks I would go to world of tanks. World of tanks is more arcade than realism but in my opinion better. For ships I would choose world of warships because even trying to understand the gameplay of ships, I can't figure out how to hit enemy ships with any consistancy. Aircraft gameplay is still amazing but I'm only at the lower ranks (3-5) and can't say how well it is at the top ranks.
I still play it as I have fun using the japanese Zero's and the Kikka but I wouldn't recommend spending too much money on the game.

If you choose to play. Pick a mode (aircraft, ships or tanks) and stick with it. Buy a low rank premium and later a higher rank premium (I don't recommend higher than rank 4).

I hope this helped."

2968,good game
2969,"BUYER BEWARE! You need to have some sort of anti cheat software installed to play this, made by EPIC. DO NOT INSTALL THIS! Epic is well known for being spyware. It boggles the mind why they would make this a requirement, but alas. It was a fantastic game while it was playable without some 3rd party software by an untrustworthy company."
2970,one of the best free games ive ever played.
2971,Extremely bad game i hope the developers uninstall life.
2972,donnot play
2973,"This game is great, realistic and all, maybe not the best game for playing with friends (unless playing the simulator modes where the game is realistic and not arcade), but it's difficult to stick to once you get to mid-tiers, cuz this is a grind."
2974," Not perfect, but better than World of Tanks"
2975,kamikaze
2976,this game makes me hate myself
2977,"Well, its a great game when it comes to gameplay and it can be very fun in that respect because of the realistic ballistic and armour simulation. However the games economy makes it awful - there is so little money reward and such high repair costs it makes it unplayable without buying golden eagles. It ruins the game. Also the progression takes way too long and it becomes so boring. 
"
2978,ok
2979,war thunder is like superglue. as soon as you use it on your self its going to hurt and gonna leave a temporary mark except this one is in your head and its permanent
2980,good
2981,"Overall a great fund game.  If you want to play mostly early to mid WW2 vehicles from a variety of countries, this is for you.  If you want to use late cold war to modern, right away, then look somewhere else as it will take months to reach those vehicles.  There is something for everyone.  Be kind to yourself, don't get frustrated, keep at it, you will get better. 

Although free to play, spending a little money on a premium vehicle can help unlock other vehicles.   I wouldn't listen to the greater community as there are a log of complaints and complaining about the pace of unlocking vehicles and the economy of the game.  Almost everyone in-game is great.  I recommend joining a squad.  Overall a great multi-player game that has some of the most accurate models and realistic play.  Much more realistic than WoT or WoS, which is much more arcade."
2982,"Dont play for too long or you will grow fat, very FAT"

3052,yep
3053,"Overall, good game"
3054,mid i think
3055,War Thunder is good but it is not for everyone. Vehicles take a long time to grind through. Even being able to play helicopters requires that you grind either tanks or aircraft to unlock. If you go into War Thunder treating it as a grind to unlock top-tier vehicles then you will not enjoy it. But if you go into War Thunder trying to master each vehicle and vary your play style then you will enjoy it.

3078,"I don't want to write a review so I'll write something else.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union, was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union which resulted in the end of the country's and the federal government's existence as a sovereign state, thereby resulting in its constituent republics gaining full sovereignty. It brought an end to the General Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and economic backslide. The Soviet Union had experienced internal stagnation and ethnic separatism. The USSR, although a highly centralized state, was made up of 15 republics that served as homelands for different ethnicities. By late 1991, amidst a catastrophic political crisis, with several republics already departing the Union and the waning of centralized power, the leaders of three of its founding members declared that the Soviet Union no longer existed. Eight more republics joined their declaration shortly thereafter. Gorbachev resigned in Dec.1991 and what was left of the Soviet parliament voted to end itself. /Both the Revolutions of 1989 in the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of the Cold War. The process began with growing unrest in the Union's various constituent national republics developing into an incessant political and legislative conflict between them and the central government. Estonia was the first Soviet republic to declare state sovereignty inside the Union on Nov. 16, 1988.  Lithuania was the first republic to declare full independence restored from the Soviet Union by the Act of Mar. 11, 1990, with its Baltic neighbors and the Southern Caucasus republic of Georgia joining it in a course of two months. In Aug. 1991, communist hardliners and military elites tried to overthrow Gorbachev and stop the failing reforms in a coup, but failed. The turmoil led to the government in Moscow losing most of its influence, and many republics proclaiming independence in the following days and months. The secession of the Baltic states was recognized in Sep. 1991. The Belovezh Accords were signed on Dec. 8 by President Y. of Russia, President K. of Ukraine, and Chairman S. of Belarus, recognising each other's independence and creating the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) instead of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan was the last nation to leave the Union, proclaiming independence on December 16. All the ex-Soviet republics, with the exception of Georgia and the Baltics, joined the CIS on Dec. 21 signing the A-A Protocol. On Dec. 25, Gorbachev resigned and turned over his presidential powers—including control of the nuclear launch codes—to Yeltsin, who was now the first president of the Russian Federation. That evening, the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin and replaced with the Russian tricolor flag. The following day, the Supreme Soviet's upper chamber, the Soviet of the Republics, formally dissolved the Union."

3080,"Honestly a great game. I love how realistic it is, and I am surprised it's free! As someone who likes WW2 era aircraft, this game is perfect for me because I get to fly my favorite planes every day. I like how every vehicle has a different feel to it. It makes the game much more exiting and I recommend this to everyone considering downloading it"
3081,Those of you looking at getting started in this game in 2022. Don't. Just Don't.
3082,It's okay.. it's fun to play with friends. Play if you like tanks and planes.

3084,"Drive your tank for 2 minutes, die in an engagement that lasts a couple of seconds.
Most game time goes as driving game. The game modes are outdated. There is only dominion mode.
Depressed men playing this game for hours to get a couple of minutes high.
I also suspect there is engagement based matchmaking, my anecdote:
I played like 10 plane games but then I switched to the tank one. I got 2 kills in my first tank game and 3 kills in the second, and after that it wasn't that lucky for me. But the first match I bought my fixed turret tank destroyer I got 5 kills with only 16 rounds, I made them all count. Had the enemy been like it had been like 95% of the time I'd die after 2 kills probably maybe get 3 kills in that game at most.
War Thunder has no competition. Had I had a better GPU, I'd play something else."

3108,"This game is a cancerous piece of trash. 1. Consistency seems to not be in  Gaijin's vocabulary, sometimes you die in a single shot to the front of your heavy tank, then in the same match your light tank gets blasted from all sides, but you survive till the end of the match. 2. Balance is wayyyy of, some vehicles are borderline unplayable. 3. Naval battles are a boring slog. 4. Helicopter battles exist. 5. In a game where audio cues play a large part in spotting enemies (spot enemy first = get first shot = win) the sound effects are awful (in the rare cases that they work). 5.5. Wanna become deaf?! Play with jets ! ! ! 6. PAY TO WIN, yeah it's a free to play game, but when the repair cost of a mid tier bomber is 30k you're gonna be broke in no time, which means that you can't repair your vehicles, which means you can't even play, which means you have to buy in-game currency for repairs or wait hours. 7. Single player missions are garbage, go here shoot 30 planes X10. 8. Can cause severe addiction.

3122,Fun game to play casually or to get wayyy into the details. For me WT scratches the itch that I think CoD and other big FPS games do for others.
3123,What a joke of a game 100 hours down and still in rank 2. Such a pay to win scheme either you have your research docked by half or pay their premium bullshit and move on up in the game. Either that or your stuck in the worst tanks imaginable for hours on end going 15-20 mph and dont worry you will be spawn camped the whole time as well. Straight garbage.

3129,"if you want to self harm without leaving any scars this game is perfect, you will be mentally wounded, pushed to the point of wanting to die just to be dragged back to the addictive hellscape that is war thunder. Even if you can mentally survive the historically inaccurate bullcrap that is the Russian tanks being made almost impregnable because this is a game made by the Russians ant the state tells them that the t34 was in fact harder to kill than the tiger XD if you can look past that utter cancerous nightmare then you have to contend with the constant urge to buy premium tanks or planes to avoid the 300 hour grind to get modern stuff......... *inhales* *sigh* if you can get past all that then you will be utterly addicted come join the club! honestly i do recommend the game despite its many many many flaws, i look forward to getting killed by you in some ridiculous way in the future. XD"
3130,"Progression is garbage, community is garbage, balance is garbage.
Holy hell is it even more so evident with just having sealclubbers like crazy going ham at this current eventa nd how broken the event vehicles are.
Screw this game, save your soul.
I'm gona play fucking fortnite."
3131,"I don't get the 78% positive reviews, as soon as you leave the reserve vehicles this games going to shit.
This whole game is just designed to sell you premium and premium currency, i mean you can play without premium but you would have to be REALLY good to enjoy yourself playing and/or play Russians (tanks atleast). 
The last years they keep pumping out Modern stuff but completely negleject to actually balance the game, instead they slap their arbitrary BR on every vehicle they add. Its completely bollocks how their vehicle tech tree is looking, you have to grind and grind and grind, just to unlock ONE vehicle thats useless the next 20 hours you play with it. 
You have to pay to unlock the vehicle and then again to ""train"" the crew, so you cant just switch them around, they have to be on the same spot again or oh well its another 50k down the drain. 
Without premium its abysmal to grind for anything really. With cheap rank 1 vehicles you can only research up to rank 2 and with Rank 5 vehicles you can only research back to Rank 3 but not 1 and 2. 
Except of course you buy a premium vehicle. With premiums you can research any Rank vehicles, they also give massive bonus research points and ordinary currency multiplier. A BR 7.0 premium gives massively more Exp and money than a normal 7.0 vehicle. 
Their map and game mode design is also horrendous, tank battles are almost always brawls at 5-500 meters. if you dont kill with your first shot theres a high chance you are dead before you can even shoot a second time. 
With swedish tanks its so bad you get shredded by 7.62 MG bullets the whole time, they have good ammo but that doesnt matter since half the enemy team is T-34 which should actually be easily penable. But Gaijoobles decided for some reason that the T-34 need indestructible objects inside the hull, so even if you pen the hull, theres till some invincible object blocking your kill. 

The whole BR system is complete and utter BS, their game modes are BS (so boring to capture points each and every round), The grind is bad with premium and almost unbearable without premium.
This would be the only game i play but the greed bad design choices and blatant ignorance for their customers is just too much to give it a positive review. Its sad theres no other game with such high fidelty models and damage systems but its not worth it anymore."

3136,I would suggest this game for people who have the time to play it the way it works is you either like it or you that is my opinon
3137,"ok, what the fuck (I ONLY PLAY WITH TANKS, PLANES SUCK ASS)
overall the game is great
the mechanics are cool
the physics can be wonky but are also good
the community is
debateable
but heres the catch:
if you get to the area between tier 4 and 5 the skill level goes from casual gamer to fucking real life tank operator
like holy shit i cannot play theese tiers without getting assraped (sniped) by some bastard hiding in the bushes on the other side of the fucking globe, meanwhile my tank goes at a weak speed on both turret and driving

so that was my experience with realistic

now whenever i play arcade its the opposite
THE GAME IS ACTUALLY PLAYABLE WITHOUT YOU NEEDING TO PUT IN 1k+ HOURS INTO IT
like COME ON how has barely anyone addressed the fact that you need to become the best player in the world just to play RB on tier 5, i just want to grind vehicles and grinding on arcade is complete ass

sometimes arcade doesnt even feel like arcade, people still sweat their asses off

overall if the learning curve wouldnt be like trying to teach a toddler to operate a commercial airliner it'd be a 10/10, for now its a 5/10


call me trash all you want, but this is my opinion"

3155,"Arma 3 is great if it wasn't for Battleye and their completely unexplained global bans designed to force innocent players to have to repurchase again only to be banned again.

It's unfortunate that the developers hubris leaves them believing they can treat thousands of innocent players like garbage while the next generation of Arma 4 will become a complete flop compared to up coming competition that will be far more advanced than Arma 3 ever hoped to become.

3176,This is the best game... especially i love the navy its sooo damn cool... This is the best free game with not much system requirements and is worth spending time. This game is 0% pay to win.... i recommend everyone to download this game
3177,good
3178,Liked this game at first but too grindy and pretty repetitive. Doesn't help my enjoyment either when the developers go political
3179,Worst game you will ever play. Fun at first and then you get good enough to notice all the bullshit and understand its that crap that kill you most of the time. That and the companies greedy mentality that pushes away veteran players and entices new players to buy $60 premium tanks and planes. On top of that the way they punish f2p players is awfull. In the end the pain is not worth the 2 or three good memorable moments that  the game offers. Don't play for to long and you'll have some fun with the games novelty. if you really get into it then you are going to start to hate it.
3180,THIS IS THE SHITTIEST GAME EVER WORST FUCKING MATCH MAKING IN HISTORY
3181,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is
"
3182,"very fun, but you will pull your hair out and forget about getting the abrams, too much grind"
3183,ballsack
3184,"I have thousands of hours in this game. Despite the awful grind, the pay to win, the Russian bias, the cheaters, the lag...

I can't stop playing it. In its' best moments, War Thunder has the potential to be absolutely awesome. Great dogfights, cool action, a fun flight system for good ol' arcade dogfighting.

To new players, if you are not prepared to spend money or grind, I recommend it with a word of warning. But, if you stick with it, you will have some bad times, and some REALLY good times. I really do enjoy War Thunder, but I take AMPLE breaks, some of them lasting months. Granted, I also really like Escape From Tarkov, so maybe I just hate having fun.  

Yeah, tanks are a thing too. Tanks are alright. Boats suck. Screw boat matches.

Disregard the snail holding the gun to my back. That in no way has affected my review whatsoever. I swear."
3185,"This game has a really bad stigma about the fact that all of the players hate themselves, other people, and the game itself.

It's absolutely true.

I absolutely cannot recommend this abomination of a ""free to play"" video game, however I can say with confidence that I will continue to torture myself by playing it."

3205,Bad game because i didnt get to bomb the enemies base cause the enemies all died and i got 0 lions and i wasted my 150% lion booster
3206,I am in immense pain
3207,This game is really meant for people that like sim games and or are enthusiasts of aeronatics/ tank history. It is far superior to Warplanes simply because it forces you to get good with the planes you have and the progression scales with the current tier youre on. It also has 3rd generation fighters and is going to introduce 4th in the coming years. The progression is slow but they have premium for relatively cheap which gives you double rewards. At the end of the day its an average FTP game with the microtransactions and premium items. The gameplay is good and it keeps me coming back.
3208,love the game and how long it takes to unlock everything
3209,fun game but the more you progress the more you realise its a pay to win game the premium users have even special tanks reserved just for them
3210,pretty good i like it
3211,GOOD GAME
3212,GG
3213,"Loving and hate relation with the game.

It is great if u ask me (i love tanks allot!), but there are times that you can burn it and just alt f4 after 1-2 games.
Getting in to the higher battle rank games without knowing any details (where to hit / wat ammo / how to block shots / etc. ) you will die allot, read ALLOT, and not make any money or progress.
My advice, read up on information, ask for help and try to play carefull... defensive even better.

Premium tank or account does help mountains, especialy in progressing past the trees, but honestly it is not needed if you know your stuff.
PS: every half a year there is a massive discount on the 180 days premium, totaly worth it if u ask me wait for this!

Good luck!"

3236,The game is realistic and fun to play.
3237,"it made me depressed and lost all possible brain cells, I recommend"
3238,"This game requires you to earn an in game currency to keep playing and progress. Ignoring the fact that progression is unfathomably slow to the point of absolute frustration, the way the in game currency is handled takes any fun one can have out of the game. While you start out having plenty and it may not seem a problem, as you move on you have to start playing well above average to even out.

As someone who is ok with losing in most games, I simply cannot be in this one. Every loss is so absolutely frustrating that I can't even focus on what I did wrong to improve since I can see I'm bleeding money. Most wins are not enough to recuperate losses. To add on the additional problem of seal clubbing mixed with players who grind longer having better versions of the same plane and pilots with greater ability to spot the enemy, handle g-forces, etc, (or crew with better loaders, gunners who find it easier to aim, etc) it becomes very difficult to find enjoyment.

There is a good game here hidden behind a monetization system that cares not for your time, money, or enjoyment (as the premium accounts barely help, and the premium vehicles only marginally help as well)."
3239,"Like pain and suffering but can't afford to pay a Dominatrix? Then boy has Gaijin got something cooked up for you. Looking for something to grind? Well start now and in a decade, you too can be flying top tier jets!
Don't want to wait that long? Buy a premium jet for around $100 just so it can get BR bumped in a few months and become totally worthless! Money never back guaranteed, satisfaction N/A. 10/10 would play again to remind me that life can always be worse! o7"

3241,"alright for those that dont want to read a long form of text, is it a good game,,, NO its a terrible game its one of the most infuriating annoying and unrewarding games i can think of,

now to the long form

ive played warthunder since there were only germans, ussr and the americans, the game has always looked very good and the models were detailed and u would see and learn about things u might not have seen before, but the grind was slow... like very slow,,,, even tho the roster was smaller it seemed like it was impossible to reach some of the higher tiers if u dont dedicate every waking hour on the game.. 

there were other issues like an excessive amount of spawn raping and overall toxicity but not that much more than most other pvp games, the issues just kept racking up the further down the tech tree u went however because the insane imbalance of the game becomes very apparent the further down u go, i played most of the nations on a bit and in the tanks its a little more playable and adaptable because with the planes u cant really take cover much or anything if u meet a superior plane u are pretty much just dead if they have any time in it,

someone said once that there are many different game modes,,,,, i must say i struggle to see that,,, in the end there is a point or points somewhere, and everyone running around just trying to kill the others the objectives are usually a afterthought,,, then there is a horde mode kindof that u can play against bots, wich essentially just shows u how they cant balance bots because they will be the most laser accurate things u have ever seen and just spawn in directly in ur line of sight,,,,

the sound design is usually very good,,, i say usually because they seem to change it more often then they change their underwear,

the matchmaking.... well there isnt really one u just press battle and hope u dont end up getting sent against tanks in much much higher tier than u are,,

is there cheating ??? oh boy yes there is, and it seems like the community in this game has such a lack of dignity that honestly im shocked that there isnt more blatant cheating in the game, but as some say u are gonna have cheaters in any pvp game its a reality of pvp games today,,, wich is sad but seemingly true,

the controls are fairly good and a new player can easily take up flying fairly well and or driving,,, no idea about the sailing since i havent played that much,,,

the menu and ui however are very messy and unclear for a beginner

how stable is it, its fairly stable and im sure u could run this game on a old phone but the downside of this is also there are gonna be people taking advantage of the potato mode exploit where they car just lower the graphics down all the way and see people for miles

how predatory are the microtransactions,,,,, lets just put it like this..... u can buy a ****load of bushes and make ur tank almost unrecognizable with them and u will see that alot,,, i hated when they added that feature and im not alone there, but then there is premium membership,,, if u want to progress at all really, and a whole load of premium tanks so those with little self control with their money can end up spending way more than they think on this, possibly rivaling dcs world´s amount of purchases

realistically speaking if u see the ads showing u all the cool jets and tanks u can use in this and figure u might join, u have been fooled most of them will take u ages to get to and more than half the people that join the game will play for 20 - 30 hrs realize they arent progressing at all and just quit, and i dont blame them

this is a majorly unrewarding, extremely frustrating, beautiful looking game filled with alot of toxic players and behaviors, 

note, that this is my opinion if u disagree and enjoy the game good on u, no one is taking that away from u, game on and have fun"

3310,"Has it's moments, but you're left chasing them. Time and money sink, unrewarding and unfulfilling. Addictive, in a bad way. Profits above all else - crafted to take your money whether you enjoy it or not. Anger is a powerful motivator. Best way to get out is to never start."

3315,"i loved it
"
3316,"GIOOIHGK,"
3317,"the maps are bad, everything feels small. you can have games that last literaly 15 seconds. Its even worse with the jets when their missle can lock on to you as spawn. This game NEEDS bigger maps for these type of gameplay that goes on
"
3318,"Casuals beware, Unless you spend money youll never get anywhere for example the recent event is 40000 points to be earned in a 2 day period(10x if you want all 10 medals,4 for 1 tank,8 for the other tank, Then youve got the air and navy medals) 40,000 is roughly 50 games for a rank 3 tank if you get 1000 points each game because you dont get the full 100% point value at rank 3 the higher the rank the better point value. A game is about 30 minutes roughly unless one side loses drastically so if you are a rank 3 tank users, itll take you about 5-8 hours to get 40,000 points longer if youre not good at the game, Its essentially a full time job. Here comes the spend money part, Each medal you can buy for 999 premium currency thats about 6.6usd per medal. So as I said casual beware, If you have lots of free time and no responsibilities and like grinding go for it, But the people who pay money will always be ahead of you as this is a PTW/PTA game"
3319,"my wife has left with the kids, i have developed schizophrenia, i flinch at every bush i see, my parents wish i was dead, i have emptied all my money into gaijins pockets to buy all of the premiums, just to get on every day and get bullied by a puma tank across the map in a bush, i live on monsters and gamesupps, and my home is a cardboard box because i sold my house to by more premium tanks, overall i rate the game 10/10 and everyone should play this religiously"
3320,one of the best games i have played
3321,youll get to adicted i learned the hard way
3322,like the first three ranks are fun until you need to sell your soul to the snail........
3323,"yeah its ""Good"""
3324,If you have over 400 hours on this game and haven't reached jets.... You're indicisive
3325,"This game has frustrated me so much over the past near decade of on and off playing. I started my freshman year of highschool. I am a man now. I do finance for a massive airport. My love for planes was for sure kept alive by this game. It is such a great game. It will always need work, but god damn, what a wonderful game with a really great community of sadists and masochists.

I will play this game forever"
3326,"I now play this solely because it's a way to hang out with my brothers.

Don't recommend this. The community is toxic enough to degrade the game experience, the grind is unreal (hope you have a second life), and there's glaringly obvious balance issues that the developers are more than happy to simply ignore. Gameplay rewards toxic playstyles as well.

The only good thing is that it is TECHNICALLY free to play, so if you don't want to spend any money and have hours upon hours to grind, maybe you'll like it."
3327,"pipi und kaka in pipi kakaland
"
3328,"I am in severe brain pain, please do not play this game or you will be like, if you play the game, it's your own choice."
3329,i liked nothing 10/10
3330,it's shit lol
3331,I have only been doing german tanks and im tier 3 and there is 7 tiers sooo... very fun not grindy game
3332,Game sucks there isn't even any thunder
3333,"Grindy, and not for everyone. But kills are satisfying."
3334,if you like jets id think you would like it if you like free games its one of the best jet games out there bye :]
3335,no.
3336,"It is a fun simulator but battles are lame. I'm learning to play in my Peashooter getting one hit killed by Spitfires. Lame. They should have battles with all the planes of the same tier. The maps are absolutely spectacular so just fight with your best plane, when ""pilot gets knocked out"" after one shot from better enemy plane then with your second plane just fly around away from the fighting to explore. I'm not giving these guys any of my money until they even the playing field and make it fun for the casual gamer."
3337,"After 3,7 everything feels pay 2 win, bush users are everywhere, premiums killing lower levels, and always some lvl 90 person who wipes the match."
3338,YOI
3339,"""the t-34 is made of stone BLIN""  life of boris"
3340,Shit game don't even try to play it
3341,"Gajin plz make optimization for poor laptop's videocards and let me spend my 170 fps (ultra settings) on my pc rtx 3050 to more effects. Anyway, the game is much more better than wot."
3342,"Good Soup!
Game be hella swaggin bruv
Bit grindy fam but worth it blud
But dont let Gaijin get your wallet big man"
3343,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 220 degrees C(425 degrees F).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 175 degrees C(350 degrees F), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
3344,This is cool
3345,its fun
3346,This is my favourite game. It is very good and it has good graphics and i really like games in it. It is very very good game and if you can I recomend download it.
3347,Awesome game with nice graphics and good controls there is nothing to say but play it it's so much fun!
3348,Tank. Plane. Heli. Umm maybe not Boat.
3349,"good
"
3350,good
3351,This game has lots of different ways to experience battle. With plenty of different maps and modes of play there is something for just about anyone.
3352,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
3353,"Very well done game, that I all ways seems to come back to. :)"
3354,"This game is like an abusive relationship, I love the game but it keeps abusing me , insulting me and taking my money but I just keep coming back for more and i wont get help and stop playing the game 9/10 better than WOT"
3355,good game
3356,"The more I play, the more I get addicted, I'm afraid of what's to come."
3357,I hate this game
3358,good game
3359,"poggers
"
3360,"HATE it but still Love it
"
3361,"good game 
"
3362,Dicker max atack the D point!!!
3363,"this game is sick 
"
3364,Good
3365,"Just not fun anymore.
Too steep of a learning curve for new players, could be that there is no matchmaker based on Player Level.
Vehicle match up is unhistorical even in ""Realistic battles"". Vehicles from 1942 get match up against ones from 1960 etc..
Repair costs eat up your budged and you will make no profit if you don't get good participation. Its designe to get you to buy thier stupid premium or straight up buy the money with RL money.
Even Arcade battles can net you -18000 if you loose too many vehicles and don't kill at least 3-4 People.
You need to play hundret if not tousend of hours to get a sens on where to be at witch map and where to shoot certain vehicles because there is a metric fuck ton of them. Don't expect to have fun if you don't spent your whole life in the game.
The games shoves tons of Micro transactions in your face all the time.
Then there is the ""Russian Bias"" where Russian vehicles get made a bit better just because.
It takes longer to find a arcade match than Realistic.
PvE is an Option but is delibartly designed to take longer and reward less then PvP. Its laso very repetetive and its only wave defense.
I think there can be done shenanigans with vegetation density and render distance for an unfair advantage.
Easy Anticheat.
3/10 its free and the models are nice and the overall game feeling is good. All after all you can try this but i do not recommend this and there is a reason why more people play the Wargames than this.
"
3366,its Hard And Fun
3367,great game love the grind and the realism.
3368,"With great graphics, amazing game-play, and high FPS, this game is just perfect for everyone who loves that action of dogfights 1000 feet in the air, dodging the bullets as they fly past you. Or maybe you'd like to hide behind trees and bushes as a tank, then watch as your enemy explodes in a fiery fireball. Or how about a game of battleships? Whatever your style of war, WarThunder is the game for you! Just, no hard feelings when I shoot you down, eigh?"
3369,"good game just don't like the radius of bomb explosions, like example i would drop a 1000 lbs on a guy and it would explode 3 meters away from him and do nothing but say hit, its the same with artillery strikes 
"
3370,dog fights un real in a great way!!!!
3371,A really good game if your into shooting with tanks and planes. Its a great game.
3372,"Played for like 800+ hours, it's fun at first but the whole ""free to play"" thing is just a cover for very slow progression once you get past most WWII stuff"
3373,"amazing game
very grindy tho"
3374,Hate with all my passion I wish I have spent these hours on myself but instead i worshiped the snail.
3375,.
3376,"can shoot down team8s would recomend
"
3377,"gun
\"
3378,very accurate
3379,"Its not very fun after you get past rank 3. But they expect you to spend hundreds of dollars on it, very pay to win. would not recommend."
3380,Cant play world of tanks anymore. Been playing this a long time. Since it was just Air. Now the tanks are so good I prefer it.
3381,yes
3382,"this game even though free is a pay to play night mare where tank batlles are just long range camp fests naval battles have some of the worst shooting mechanics ever
"
3383,"money and time hungry,"
3384,"If you're a masochist you'll love this game. 

It's one of those games you'll keep coming back to."
3385,its bussin
3386,"Literally the most aggressively unfun game I have ever played. And I have played League of Legends, DotA 2, and Battlefield 2042.

I stopped playing for quite a long time and decided recently to play again. I didn't play much this time around but my experience was a little something like this:

Queued for tanks, spawn my tank in, get one-shot from across the map. Spawn a different tank in, remembering where the offending enemy was (and still is), carefully try to sneak a shot at him, get one-shot by a different tank. Spawn my third and final tank, carefully cower at the back of the map, get a kill, get one-shot.

Ok, let's try the airforce. Spawn my plane, decide to climb to altitude to bully bombers. Find a bomber to bully and light it up, team mate gets a kill but at least I get an assist, however an enemy fighter is on me so I try turning to fight it, turns out my fighter is a boat. Try putting distance between us, unfortunately it's also a slug. I'll try spinning, that's a neat trick. Fucking dead. Not once could I even get my crosshair on him. So I spawn my next fighter and climb again to bully bombers. This time I don't get interrupted and get two bomber kills and a kill on a fighter that attempted to climb straight up to me. This, however, was basically shooting fish in a barrel.

Well, let's give the tanks another go. We'll try Russia this time since my friend said the KV-1 was very strong and I have that. But first I pull a ZIS whatever the fuck gun tractor thing. I find a nice little woody area where I can see the objective and wait for prey. Unfortunately I get immediately shot by some 8.8cm German skudstafuck or whatever and it cripples my tank, and because I don't have parts yet, I just get to sit there and wait for it to kill me. Well alright, take it easy, I still have the KV-1, but people are still dying like crazy to TDs so maybe I'll wait a little more, so I pull my AA for a little bit of chill back lines support crap. I shoot down one bomber, but a bomb lands near my vehicle. Fortunately, my SPAA is apparently slow as shit and couldn't get away in time and gets blown up. Alright, last tank, KV-1 time. Spawn that sucker in, and I'm on top of a bomb and die.

Uninstalled."
3387,War Thunder
3388,"the thing is. its the game u always wanted to play, its literaly perfect exept for one little detail. the other ppl playing it make it a nightmare"
3389,"idl...
"
3390,"Great Game, Lots Of Fun, Realistic, Love It!
"
3391,"Better than World of Warships by far for naval fun, and the planes are also great fun. The controls can be from arcade easy to holly crap a flight simulator hard, it is very entertaining."
3392,love the game
3393,"it good
"
3394,things go boom
3395,"Game it's okay, cool thing this is a lot of countries to choice. And nice gameplay."
3396,DUM
3397,yes
3398,Get it!
3399,This game sucks the life out of you before you even know whats happening. Once you get to a certain point in playing there's no coming back from it. Everything you've heard that's negative about this game is completely true. Would not recommend this fame unless you've got loads of free time.
3400,"Pretty realistic and you can play tanks, ships, and aircraft (jets, planes, and helicopters.) I personally only like the aircraft, but that's just me. And it's not ""pay to win,"" at least not in my opinion. The only thing you might need to buy is hanger slots, at some point, if you want (don't ""need"" to.)"
3401,"I've reached the point where I ask myself what I've wasted most on this game, my money or my life"
3402,"bad
it sucks"
3403,nimrod to op
3404,"the game is amazing, it got everything from amazing graphics to top of the line 3D models, the only problem is that when you get a wager you cant deactivate it, so please Gajin if you're reading this, please make wagers deactivate able, thank you."
3405,"It's a great game, only if you're playing it causally. If you're here to play with the advertised ""[u]Modern Era[/u]"" side of War Thunder you should look elsewhere.

If you want to unlock every vehicle in a major nation, or simply complete one single vehicle line to a top tier vehicle, within a few months or a year, you'll need to spend ""[u]Potentially[/u]"" thousands of dollars or spend hundreds of hours grinding non-stop before you reach top tier in any nation.  

The grind and game balance has always been a problem in this game, but it's because of issues like these that the monetization has only gotten worse and worse in recent years. 

So, after all that said if you do decide to give War Thunder a shot or continue to play, don't cave in to spending money and play in moderation. And if you're in it for the long haul. Keep up with your mental health, tell your friends and family you love them, and...

3406,Plane go Woosh
3407,DAMN

3409,im gonna kill myself lol
3410,DOG SHIT
3411,V
3412,"Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys arcade style shooters. Extra recommendation if you love military planes, tanks, and boats. Be warned that the learning curve for higher tiers can be steep and the game is a huge grind at those higher tiers unless you buy all the microtransactions. I've been playing off and on for years, before tank and boats were added and always come back. Anger can insue, but I still love the game, unless I get killed by a $200 premium tank that has no right being the same battle rating as its F2P version."
3413,"Early tiers are manageable for progression and can be pretty fun, but as with all of these F2P types of games, it turns to P2W very quickly about midway through all the progression trees.  If you're a grinder or have tons of money to spend, you can easily abuse the system as some of the later tier vehicles can easily run $60+ USD.  If that's not your speed, I recommend not playing this game."
3414,"good
"
3415,This game sucks
3416,"Takes 8 years to finish, 1.0 is full of event grinding tryhards. No fun, avoid."
3417,"Game had alot of potential but the balancing, bugs, and the grind of the game make it nowhere near even touching i've come to learn."
3418,It's good. Flying is very nice.
3419,Play this game if you hate yourself and hate your money.

"
3423,"Game is good, for people who do not need sleep, people who grind their eyeballs out, campers/snipers, and people wanting to lose their life
Good game tho"
3424,"Was a WW2 game then they just forgot about that and just focus on modern stuff

Edit:
I appreciate the effort to respond from a developer and if I had known they would respond I would have put more effort into the review, basically something needs to be done to make the content in the game that has been there for years more interesting to play.
The best way to do this in my opinion is to add a permanent attack and defence game mode like we saw in World War mode.
My comment about modern stuff is a complaint about how rather than working on making game play more fun such as new game modes, they focus mainly on adding more vehicles, and note that new vehicles are not a bad thing at all but shouldn't be the thing you focus on.
If new things are added to make the game fun again for someone like me who has put so many hours in I will change my review to positive."
3425,
3426,Pretty shitty game
3427,Ads make it look like a mobile game. but actually pretty decent
3428,Attack the D point!
3429,Why have i done this to myself?
3430,"Would not recommend this game. It is addictive, difficult and has one of the most toxic communities on the planet. Also some of the most pathetic chad gamer's I have ever seen in my life. If you hate yourself and want a brain aneurysm, play this game. If you want to lead a normal, happy life stay very far away from this PTW, POS scam of a game that eats up hours of you life and kills you. This game is the equivalent of chain smoking cigarettes in a damp, rodent filled sewer pipe."
3431,Game is boring as hell
3432,"very good game, kind of accurate, but it's really fun."
3433,its a free game but instead of money it costs your soul
3434,I worship the snail
3435,"""Its like federal prison it's not fun, but it has fun moments."""
3436,its ok

3441,asd
3442,"DROPS THE NUKE! Kills 15 tanks, ggwp."
3443,"game is fun, but also isnt"
3444,Where do i start. First war thunders download page makes it seem like your going to be flying jets right away as soon as you get in and learn the controls that is very very far from the truth you are 1st forced to spend most likely hundreds of hours of grinding for planes you dont even want but if you want to shorten that grinding time you can spend about 15 dollars for about a week of premium to double your rewards which if you dont get have fun getting enough money each match to cover the repair costs that you need to pay every single match and if you somehow manage to not go broke by the 3rd tier of the research tree well have fun getting the 4th tier the cost of aircraft goes from i think 50k silver lions each aircraft to 150k each aircraft and the research you need goes from 10k to 50k and you wanna know why im not even gonna talk about tier 5 6 or 7 (the tiers where you finally get jets) its because in my 70 hours ive gotten 3 tier 4 aircrafts(you need 5-6 aircraft bought each tier to get to the next tier) i am half way to getting to tier 5 in 70 hours and the grind in those tiers goes up exponentially from tier 4. so if you are willing to spend id say around 500 hours maybe more (along with a bit a cash for premium) to get that f-14 then this this might be the game for you but if your not but you still want to get good at this game your better off becoming a content creator and having gaijin give you free stuff.

3451,"How accurate the tanks are, and the variety of options in the game, light tanks, medium and heavy tanks, dive bombers to frontline ones."

3455,"kill tank or die game fun

3456,"Fuck this game, Fuck my life"
3457,best aircraft game
3458,gud game but can get repetative sometimes
3459,"This game is pay to win at its peak not to mention the downright toxic playerbase who spend as much time trying to get teammates killed as they do killing enemies and even in the case that you have a team that will play objective and play to win getting a kill is 50% skill 50% rng due to the ""realistic"" armor models and ballistics"
3460,It is a great game and although it is set up to make you want to spend money i enjoy the game fully being free to play. 10/10 One of the best games I've played.

3470,"I am a 75 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 34 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3484,"Game sucks, not balanced, getting oneshotted everywhere, yet still playing this turd garbage."
3485,the snail shall take your soul and family but in return you get war thunder
3486,"This is a great, and mostly free game (aside from additional crews, premium vehicles, accelerated research, and crew experience) with awesome graphics if you have the hardware to run it.  You don’t have to pay to win, but you do have to grind (or pay) for upgrades, crew experience, and vehicles.  Learning curve is steep, especially with green crews and new vehicles lacking upgrades…  It doesn’t cost you anything to give it a try…"
3487,"nice game, can even run on a macbook air"
3488,Would recommend if you enjoying flying historic planes. Would't recommend because of the amount of hours you need to put into this game if your not planning on buying in game currency or dlcs.
3489,do not let low rank friends play with you in realstic trust me they will hate you for a very long time

3500,fun
3501,amazing
3502,It's a hellish grindfest but once you find the gamemode and playstyle you like it becomes very fun
3503,This is a pay to win game.  If you are not willing to pay to get the best planes/ships/tanks then you are not going to have a good time. The grind is insane and takes hours and hours of grinding before you get any kind of compensation for your time or work.  I will be uninstalling this money pit of a game.
3504,Just a grind disguised as a game
3505,good game for people who r bored!
3506,best war vehicle game ever its like world of warships world of tanks and world of warplanes combined
3507,Pretty good for free to play. But progression is a real grind too much. Purchasing isn't an option considering they want the price of a full game just for one plane lmao.
3508,love this game
3509,"This game was so awesome before Russia invaded Ukraine. This game is owned by Dirty Russian invaders so they stop in game chat so no one could say what was really happening. It sucked because talking with other players during battle is very important SO DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. Update game chat is back. February 28, Gaijin Entertainment pushed out an update for War Thunder that turned off text and voice chat. “In-game chats have been temporarily disabled,” the patch notes said. “Quick commands are available in the game sessions for players in your team and voice chat is active for squad members.”
SO you be the judge of there actions I did not see World of Warships do anything like this just calling it as I see it. SO if you did not want me to connect your game with politics you should have never stop in game chat that's when your true colors came out as a puppet for the Russian  inhuman invaders other games did do this just WARTHUNDER"

3514,The game is Quite fun. though it takes a month or two to get full aircraft/tanks/battleships (whatever you choose) it can be quite enjoyable with a diverse map generator and relative friendly chat/player base. i would highly recomend it for people looking for a free-to-play game with military from the early 1900's to the early 2000's and looking for a action packed pvp with military.

3589,"Gaijin are a terrible company who want nothing but your money.

I tried to like this game, I really did. But it's Con's outweigh it's Pro's. The gameplay mechanics are great, but the game is nothing but an absolute Pay-to-Win trash bag and Gaijin know this. The game is borderline unplayable if you don't open up your wallet.

Progression is unfathomably slow. Currency does not acquire fast enough and research is just as bad. And when you finally gain enough research that new vehicle? well you better have some more in-game currency to purchase it AND train the crew!

""Why don't you just play more"" 
Well I'd love to, but it would be nice if I wasn't up-tiered literally every. single. match. Regardless of whether its realistic or arcade battles. every single match is against up-tiered opponents who you physically cannot kill, who at the same time, will kill you head on with a single shell. 

So the issue here, is that in order to gain more currency and research to unlock better vehicles, I need to win matches and kill opponents, but the game doesn't want that and instead wants me tot spend my money. So to do this, it will force you into thinking the only way to progress at an actual sensible rate, is to use your money. Don't do it. The game could be fun, but it's not. It's the Tarkov of vehicle combat."
3590,h
3591,"I will NEVER reccommend this game to anybody. I have played my fair share of hours and I can safely say, the current state of the community and the support from devs has never been lower. The following review might be long, but I reccommend you stil through it and tell me what you think in the comments aswell.

I downloaded the game back in 2014, when the game had first introduced ground battles. There were some problems, most notably tanks not being able to go over trenches. When the community addressed the problem for the first time, Gaijin would just let the demand for a traction update fall on deaf ears and continue developing more tech trees, with more  tanks, thus adding more bugs to the vast field. The trench question was later fixed in the ""Hot Tracks"" update. It was released in 2020. This goes a long way to show how little support and care the devs give for their game, [b] but the community is no better. [/b]

In fact, you would be mistaken if you thought that the only ones who try to milk content for profit and clout were the game developers. No. The community does that too. Let me tell you something: we gave up a long time ago, devs never listened to us, they just kept on adding and adding but never stopping to fix. We asked for new gamemodes, nothing came, the gamemodes are like this SINCE 2014, apart from poor naval battles that are boring and confusing and the PvE helicopter gamemode which no one asked for and is pretty ahrd to get to, considering the grind you have to go trhough to even get to a single helicopter. Why not add some new gamemodes? Maybe with fleets, air forces and ground forces combined, for instance.

Resuming what I was previously discussing about the community, it's just bad. Content creators, for the most part, milk the game's flaws into videos with titles ""Gaijin'd"" or ""War thunder moment"" where they just CONSTANTLY release videos on how they did not get that kill because of a ghost shell and have a good laugh about it. Even the players have the same problems. You can see yourself in reviews. Most of them are just people saying that the game will ruin your life, but they still give it a positive review. I can see why the game is good. The graphics are stunning, the physics, even if with some lacklusters, are very advanced. But that's not what defines a game in the slightest. The two most important aspects of the game are feedback and response, and both first and second are left unticked from the constant pressure the devs add into making every premium tank and pack look like a bargain, something that will make you finally get to that top tier ABRAMS, you just have to spend 50 bucks. Then you spend more. Then you get a premium account. Then you get bushes on your tank and buy golden eagles. That's what the game does. Instead of fixing, they provide new content which is profitable. And the community memes about it, instead of complaining. 
The game has been dead for a long time. Chat remains unused, there is no comunication, clans are dying and discord servers inactive. There is no fun left in the game anymore and no one is friendly, but thinks about how they must get the highest score possible for medals and silver lions without providing good cover to teammates, without flying in formation, without capturing points. I've played multiple games where we had the top fraggers with 12 tank kills, using the best premium, but still lost because we could not capture points. Again, there is no teamwork or concept of having fun in the game, just greed, to get to the top and then start over with another nation.

If you got to this point of the review, by now you'll know that all I want people to understand from this review is being serious about the game's issues. We tried, as a community, and failed. Then we stopped trying. What we should have done and should be doing is quitting the game for good, until the issues are resolved. Give the game the reviews it deserves, make videos about it on youtube, address problems on the forums, on reddit, do everything possible to make the devs understand the game needs to be changed into a quality product. We don't want new vehicles, we want balance. We don't want to buy premiums to grind, we don't want to drive for 10 minutes to get on point in realistic battles and then get sniped from across the map by a meta tank destroyer. We want to have fun.

TLDR = Don't get the game. Wait until the community makes sure the devs give us some feedback and the pay to win aspects of the game are removed."
3592,"funny tonks, funny planes"
3593,"Highly recommend, perfect tool for sadists and extremely vindictive people to torture whatever subject of their choice. Would highly recommend. A good simile for this game would be heroin, this game is basically e-heroin. Not wanting to admit that, I've effectively, thrown away so much of my time on this russian dumpster fire is what keeps me going. The dev team is comprised of the first drunk russian that they found on the streets of norilsk, a hamster on life support and some crazy russians that ran to cyprus cause they didn't want to pay taxes. Can't blame them, probably were required to pay quite the amount from the amount of USD they've gobbled up from players. Highly recommend this game, I would like a refund for this free game thanks."
3594,"Volumetric causing void shots. Ghost shells. nonpens. not damaging barrels. .50 caliber mgs chew through tracks like a mouse through wood. Toxic community. terrible map design. it all lies under the catchphrase: ""Skill issue"" And good god this game is fun, but these are so fucking common that it's hard to get good results in the game without being a fucking content creator of some kind. With all due respect this game and it's community are both shit, and if Gaijin didnt have a monopoly on this kind of game, i wouldnt even think of touching War Thunder ever again"
3595,"not worth, frfr respectfully"
3596,its a super fun game
3597,HEHE PLANE GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

3599,no just no
3600,It's A Really Good Game. Really Should Give It A Try!
3601,"it is very cool just a very grindy game, would suggest to people with no life"
3602,sell your soul to the snail
3603,"I won't lie to new players, this game is a mess since its earlier years.

Back in 2013 progress was an absolute pain in the butt, the only real way to progress as someone whom sucked at flying was to just get in a bomber and kiss the lower atmosphere to drop bombs on a target you can barely see until you have the experience/Silver Lions to afford enough vehicles to move to the next tier. But, with enough elbow grease and practice you'd find a combat simulator game that was a lot more casual to get into mechanically until you began to perfect your practice with your preferred aircraft model/style.

Fast forward to now, it's impossible to progress without spending enough money to take out a mortgage on your house if you want to have even the slightest chance of maxing a country out within A YEAR.
The events are painfully slow with the developers not even hiding that they expect you to pay ~1000 Golden Eagles (Their premium currency, worth roughly $6.60 USD) for one token. By the way, it can take up to 8-10 event tokens to get a free vehicle that will probably only be worth ~$40. 

TANKS-----------------------------------
The game is honestly horribly balanced, low tiers can be fun but new players be warned you will be rushed by far more experienced players with at least months to years of experience under their belts.
Mid tiers will typically be dominated by German tanks with their absolute F-you cannons/armor or Russians with their Stalinasium armor/rounds.
High tier Realism is honestly the only real fun thing in this game, but expect pretty bad balancing as well with fast pace combat that will usually lead to either you or the enemy dying within 2-3 hits. 
--You will probably also buy into this tier, DON'T. I repeat, only buy a high tier premium if you are around Tier 4-5 so you can get used to the mechanics and game play overall. I made the mistake of buying an XM-1 with a minor discount that was honestly not worth it, and I actually didn't really get to use that tank until 1-2 months later when I farmed close enough to justify using it.

PLANES-----------------------------------
I honestly just don't want to touch on this, it's fun and it's not fun at the same time. If you are new and struggle with aiming just go Russian, their early planes are decently fast and they have way too many machine guns.
The game play doesn't really get more interesting until you get fast propeller/jet planes but that is also when the grind will get painfully slow, so try to spade* your vehicles.
High tier itself is in a pretty rough place right now, as long as you fly a plane that is below Battle Rating (BR) 10 you will be spared the nightmare of having a Top Gun fan splooging his rocket load all over your poor existence.
Also sometimes the entire enemy team will be composed of F-14 Tomcats with all aspect lock on missiles while you are likely trapped with rear lock on only.

NAVY-----------------------------------
They made a lot of changes since the original release of Naval combat..... They took the tech tree and split shallow watercraft from bigger boats, allowing bigger boats to rest at BR 3-4+ while the smaller guys can start without having to deal with bigger opponents until they have better armaments. 
Most Naval combat is 3+ minutes of travel time to get in range of enemies with angled movements to avoid giving a full broadside shots to the enemy, after will usually follow a barrage of fire, head on charges, and lots of torpedoes. WW2 bombers/fighters will be dealing with small watercraft utilizing Cold War lock on missiles, most planes will end up suicide bombing you even if they could have avoided a needless death, and players will regularly attempt to beach you or ram you if it means a chance at them kill stealing.

All in all, it's not a horrible game but do not fall for the illusion that the developers try to throw up with the support of their more fanatical fans. Times are hard and Microtransactions are harder, if you play practice self control and only pay for the Premium to get a ""NORMAL"" flow of experience or Silver Lions. Without premium you may find yourself logging out after matches to avoid paying the repair fee via the timed repair mechanics due to dramatically increasing prices the more you progress.


TL;DR, good game heavily damaged by predatory monetization schemes and poor balancing, which by the way, will only hurt you as the player due to their entire balancing system being about the statistics of how new and old players perform on vehicles without actually taking the stats of the vehicle into account outside of initial release."
3604,For the kind of glutton for punishment who says hey its time for a break from Tarkov but i do love being constantly f****ed in the a**.
3605,"Ok this is a good game that has great graphics and loads of cool vehicles to research and play.  The game modes and maps get super repetitive but the maps are not bad per say.
The game is ruined by two things.  Bad Server infrastructure and bad matchmaking.  The game will constantly put you in battles against vehicles 2-3 battle ratings (BR) higher than you.  The difference in combat effectiveness between ranks is huge.  So the majority of the time you will just get stomped by superior vehicles.  The high pings create situations where you can never win 1on1 encounters because the enemy has come around a corner, seen you, aimed and fired before you even get them rendering on your screen.  Add to all this the insane randomness of shot hits and penetration and it gets frustrating.  Hell, even the insane repair costs will prevent you from playing your favourite vehicles because even with premium you will lose in-game currency per match.

My advice is to play low tier vehicles as a free to play with friends and you will have a lot of fun.  Don't give these developers any money because they don't deserve it.  I could fix all the issues with this game in 5 minutes with just the matchmaker code parameters."
3606,Primero que nada el juego me encanta pero al final lo desinstale el grindeo que le tenes que meter es exagerado los tanques estan buenisimos los graficos el combate todo lo que arruina este juego es el sistema economico desbalanceado y los premiums que vuelven el juego muy nefasto no vale la pena el tiempo que se le debe invertir hagas lo que hagas quieren que les compres algo es un p2p disfrazado

3615,very fun but lot of grinding so if your not dedicated dont play the game
3616,"best game ever
"
3617,"Here's an honest review from someone who's played since 2018, THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. You're only alive once, so why don't you go outside to get some damsels, or maybe watch that funny 3d lawyer guy, I hear that shows good. 

But in all seriousness to someone who is looking to play this game for fun, DON'T, its a waste of time, the only way for a new player to have fun is to stick to low tier arcade and Try to grind that way, which don't even get me started on the atrocious grind.

But maybe I'm becoming sour in my older age, maybe you might like playing this game as the snail consumes every last bit of you that makes you human, if that's so, then I say to you, good luck, and may RNJesus bless your matchmaking."

3626,Great Game
3627,fuck you gaijin
3628,Good game
3629,Great free to play WWII- 1980's Eras of combat for many nations. absolutely fantastic game with excellent graphics and damage models. The physics of armor are  excellently made and constantly upgraded to be as accurate as possible with the latest technology. One of my all time favorite games handsdown!!!
3630,"War thunder is a great game in a lot of aspects and as you can see by my hours played, you could say I enjoyed it for the most part. Now why the negative review? I will come to that in a bit but first the positives:

Positives:
1:It's sort of a free game
2:Seeing the damage you do in the mini HUD is the coolest feature for me personally in this game.
3: Jets,smart bombs etc etc. Cool to do when you get there.
4: Bigger tanks the further you progres which is a nice feature.
5: Can be played with friends
6: Simulator battles which makes it more realistic.

The negatives and I will put these in ranked order:
1: Ungodly amount of campers in realistic battles. Ruins everyone's fun but the camper's. If everyone would be camping there would be no game to enjoy but people don't care and come with some bullshit excuse that it falls under ''tactics'' and that is what they used to do in 2nd world war. However, they forget the part that even those campers didn't know where the enemy approaches from and in-game you do which makes this arguement absolete. Again, they don't care as long as they can camp. I propose that after a minute of not moving in an area of 20 meters you will be visible on the map.

2: Spawn camping where they will wait for you to spawn and shoot you, it used to be discouraged by getting your vehicle blown up if you got too close to spawn. This was a reasonable idea but they would still camp but then on the border of the spawn area. Now only your position gets shown and nothing happens. The spawning tank is immune for 10-15 seconds to damage but when you are surrounded by 4-5 tanks, You can do fuck all.

3: The overpowered CAS by which I mean planes. It takes some practice but can be easily learned but when you know how to bomb and shoot your cannons to destroy tanks. You will be raking in kills and tank can't do much but either spawn a plane themselves and going after you or spawning in an anti-air and hoping they will get a hit which is like 10% chance as most don't know how to lead their targets.

4: rockets and apfsds shells. Why in the hell did they add rockets to this game because people thought it was cool. I am from a war thunder time where rockets weren't in the game and neither were the apfsds shells. Where the maus was the highest tank you could get on the german tech tree. A time it took skill to kill a maus by trying to flank the tank. Now we got light vehicles/tanks (UH-S which is pure cancer) loaded with rockets which can pierce nuclear bunkers so your armour doesn't mean shit. Oh you got 305 mm turret armor, watch how fast you get obliterated by the most ridiculous vehicles who are 3 times less your size and 10 times as strong. Object 120 with its apfsds will annihilate any tank it shoots.

5: The matchmaking system is the worse thought out system ever created. In this game you have battle ranking system. 1.0 BR is the lowest while 11.3 is the highest. If you have a tank line up from 6.0 to 6.7, the largest contingent of tanks you will get, are tanks from 7.3 to 7.7 putting you at a huge disadvantage. If you thought your armour would save you think again, the 7.3-7.7 vehicles have bigger pen shells so again you will get destroyed easily without a sweat. Put the BR system from 6.0 to 6.7 and keep it like this.DO the same to other Br ranges (1.0-1.7,2.0-2.7 etc). No uptiering to 7.7 and no downtiering to 5.7. Such a ridiculous system. Whoever thought of that to be a good idea should be fired. If that means somewhat longer queu times so be it. I will wait for another 5 mins. This way the game actually gets the balance it so desperately needs and not this garbage which it currently is.

6: The enormous grind. The game is f2p and Gaijin needs to make its money from somewhere which is totally fine I get that but be warned players who pay have a huge advantage over players who dont like shorter reload times, better movement, better ranging and so on and so on.

7: Low graphics cheat: people put the game on low graphics as it renders differently than those who put high quality. For instance, buildings get rendered from a shorter distance as well as bushes and trees. This way makes it so easy to spot other tanks as you can see them through bushes,trees and houses. They (gaijin) said they fixed this issue but I tried it out and when I turned down my graphics, I could see through 4 buildings and knew exactly which way the enemy team was going which is pathetic.

So in short, do I recommend the game as of now? No, I don't unless Gaijin actually adresses these issues especially the camping problem and BR matching system. I do not recommend.

3633,goe

3636,the grind is painfully slow
3637,The perfect game for people who wish to do nothing else in life apart from historically accurate grinding and who have no outside life.     (me)
3638,"Game is not made for everyone. Harware issues and server lag is real. You have to run trough specific networks (VPN's) to have a stable connection  as the server rejects packages if you have more than 150ms ping. 

Software is buggy - except for bad RNG that has almost no logic to it ( except with certain vehicles - almost cherry picked - not limted to paid units) you also have to deal with the fact that while you aim - you will randomly hop to a new target as you fire-  can't find anything on this - so best of luck to you. 

Lastly - grinding is some what of an issue - let me explain - there is no problem gridning out. you can get vehicles easily. The problem is - you won't enjoy the game till you get to half of the tier 3.7 up. As the game play is basicly - go in - die as quickly as possible - go to next match. Very limited game play in start. 

So all in all. If you want a game you can play for 6 months till you figure out what you like and what you don't - figure out which vehicles you like are also like by the devs so that you can play and enjoy the game - then start playing the game - this game is for you. 

If you don't like six months of torture ( if that's not your thing) well - get friends to grind out your account or don't play. 

"
3639,yes
3640,This game makes me want to go on a midnight drive and find the biggest cliff to drive off of. Also Italy suffers ):
3641,If u want to have 0 pussy playy the game RN. :O
3642,"I'm sorry but I cannot in my best faith say War Thunder is a fun game.

It is a good game, yes yes. Great graphics, lots of vehicles, it's pretty cool.

That's where the compliments end.
-The game is a legal scam, designed to be as hard as possible to play without putting money into it. And incredible imbalance to people who do put money in, being able to buy OP premium vehicles.

-The game sucks gameplay wise. The penetration mechanic is so inconstant that it's maddening. One minute I punch right through a Panzer IV's front turret, and then the next shot the same shot in the same place bounces and gets you killed-, like bruh wtf.

-The game is terrible for new players. High tier tanks are so hard to play most pros just stay in Tier 3. Tier 3 is where most new players will be for a long time, it takes a long time to grind to tier 4.
So you, as a new player with 100 hours of grind to get to tier 3 now have to play against 10,000 maidenless sweats who've never seen grass. 

Have fun dying in less then 2 minutes after spawning and barely getting any RP or silver lions back cause you didn't get any kills and most of those silver lions you did manage to earn went to tank repair costs uwu

-The tanks are all balanced based on bias. Gaijin is a Russian company, guess which tier tree is the easiest to grind? You guessed it, them Russian tanks are fucking crazy good.

German tanks are stupid good too, although shit next to Russian tanks

I use the American tree. Russia doesn't like America very much. So yeah, the American tanks used to be decent, but in recent years have recieved such severe nerfs that they're shit next to the German and Russian tanks of their same tier.

If you wanna have fun playing War Thunder, run the other way. This game has fun moments, but is not fun at all. If you can get through the unfun grind for the fun moment, go for it! 

If not, save yourself the headache, waste of time, and frustration and go wishlist and download the Gunner, HEAT, PC! demo, it looks even better, has better gameplay and sound design, and the game is challenging, but fair, and every death doesn't make you wanna pull your hair out. Rather, the game tells how you fucked up, and you can learn from that fuckup in your next run.

Don't download this game please. Gaijin doesn't need to have this game anymore, and it's best if we just let it die.

3650,This game sucks. every single time you want to have fun you get uptiered and get instantly killed. I just had a game where I was playing at 8.3 br and I had activated two 150% boosters and I got killed by a 10.0 br plane with a max speed 400 mph faster than mine. Dont buy this game unless you want to spend 300$ on high tier planes and tanks

I thought ""what the hell, the worst that could happen would be that i loose a couple of WWII simulations to some 13 yr online"". well no i can safely say that crashing your plane into other peoples plane for fun is not fun. You cant even fuck with your own team mates for fucks sake. Honestly I would rather kill myself than ever play this game ever again. The graphic weren't too bad, the controls were utter dogshit and i would recommend it to you if you happened to be a dickhead. 
Id rate 2.36 of 5 stars."
3668,only play if you have time to advance.

3670,"If your gonna play this game,congrats,you have chosen warthunder over World of shit.give your soul to galjin or have them extract money from your wallet like the US with oilrigs.You will still have more fun than WoShit.Its realistic and free (play GHPC if you want a more realistic experience)."
3671,"War Thunder is a brilliant game. By pressing V to go into first person mode, the immersion is incredible. Be warned: Steam will download about 50GB. this will take a reasonably long time. Then, War Thunder will try to download another 50GB. You can change this by pressing the dropdown menu above the play button which says about 90GB and change to a smaller size, for quicker download."

3673,"I kill 3 enemy tanks, 2 assists, capture one objective and then my tanks get destroyed. End of the game results : If you lose, you are down in Lions (the game's currency), if you win, you barely get 1-2k playing as Germans, because the repairs are expensive. You play USSR? No problem, they have the cheapest tanks, I could get 3 of them destroyed and they combined barely have the repair cost of my 1 german tank. Not worth your time."
3674,gooooon

Would LOVE to have a discord channel that was synched with random arcade mode so when you go to battle you connect with anyone else that is in discord and in that same game and is on your team. Chat window text is a PIA"
3682,"Games mechanics are trash, Anything and everything pens your tank. Side scraping, angels, hull down, nothing will save you, tanks are always penned. even through your turret, in the front where there is armor. No true mechanics are even in the game, outside of the ammo type you use. Happy to have tried it and seen what it was about, however rather go back to WoT where it takes strategy to play, and takes skill."

3711,some ppl love this game but not me
3712,"lots of grinding for vehicles but its always rewarding. The game is well made, and you don't need to be super good to enjoy it (trust me, I would know)."
3713,"Fun game, very similar in function to Crossout (minus the building), same developers, both fun games.

It may have paying for some planes, but it is NOT pay to win.  You are put against similar power planes, if not identical.  No matter if you grinded for your plane or bought it with money."
3714,This game makes me want to rip my cock off.
3715,this game used to be fun now its just a big money grab. dont play it!!!!!
3716,"this game is not fun if you are beginner, you should be PROFESSIONAL otherwise they will destroy you. so me as a beginner played my first 4 hours, was not fun. coz they are always winning you and you dont understand WHYYYY they are always better than you. so you play against PRO's as a beginner"
3717,"The game is not all that fun once you get past rank 3, The game is loaded with lots of inconsistencies such as in the garage you can test ballistics on tanks which will tell you weather a round will pen or not, this does not reflect in game as the game tells you to kick dirt and that you can not pen that tank because ??? or that all the shrapnel from the round got stuck in a radio,gas tank, viewfinder.

As a free player you will not make enough money to pay for repairs as you would have to get 4-8 kills every game with your tank that can not move itself at stock and has no parts of fpe. good luck with that."
3718,Its ok
3719,"This game could be great in its genre but the developers are putting greed first and fun (maybe) second.

They will sell you crates with a really small chance to get something good out of them for silver lions (the game's free currency), they will make the grind unbearable so they can sell you Premium time and/or Premium vehicles just to shorten it a bit, they will make events extremely annoying and grindy so you feel exhausted and more inclined into buying multiple skips that can skip the entire event, etc. etc.

This game is a good example of creating problems just so they can sell you the solution.
Every game mechanic feels like is there just so it can annoy you.
The higher you go in tiers, the worse it gets! First, a vehicle will cost more research and silver lions to the point that reaching modern vehicles will take ages. Second, once you reach Tier IV/V the matches will often mix WWII vehicles with Cold War ones, making the WWII vehicles experience terrible. Third, increasing repair costs which means if you lose too many vehicles or don't do well enough you're actually going to lose silver lions.
But guess what! If you buy Premium time and/or vehicles you're going to get more research and silver lions every match!
Oh, and in ground battles there's a serious issue with many of the maps' design/balance. I don't even know how many times one of the two teams ended up being spawn trapped while the game does nothing to prevent it. Only thing you can do is leave and hope the game doesn't lock your crew for 5 minutes or something.

So, is it not fun? That's the issue!
It will make you feel absolutely miserable but sometimes, just sometimes, you will actually have fun and it will give you that dopamine rush you just needed to keep playing... only to feel miserable again.


Should you try it? I mean, it's free.
I'm not going to say ""avoid it"" if you really want to try it. It has a lot of cool vehicles from different nations/eras and there aren't many games like it.

Just know that your experience will probably suck, a lot."
3720,Not a bad pvp game but pve is clunky... still great game but you almost have to have a HOTAS to play it wirh

Each patch is more broken then the last and filled with a plethora of bugs that even the most mundane of a playtester could find if they actually cared. The balance is atrocious especially at top tier where surprise surprise their home nation of Russia dominates and overperforms. While their trash tier tanks are getting launched into orbit in Ukraine the equivalent vehicles in this game are made of Stalinium and can take everything you can throw at them and more. This not even mentioning the trash balance around close air support. I know tank sims like this are few and far between, but take it from a dude thats played this trash for the past 5 years.... it isnt worth it and you will only hate yourself for wasting your time with this trash company and this trash tier game."

I tried to introduce some of my friends to the game but it seems too difficult and is pretty ''unfriendly'' for new players especially now with all the new features, vehicule and experienced players destroying new players. On one hand I would not recommend this game to everyone but on the other hand it is the only game offering this kind of gameplay. This is no World Of Tanks, it would be like comparing Need For Speed with Forza Motorsport, sure you drive cars in both games but they are not the same.

3835,"War Thunder is often described as ""almost fun."" Having come back to it to give it another chance with fresh eyes, I can safely say that is entirely accurate. 

The vehicles of the game are beautifully realized, and absurdly broad. You can sail everything from torpedo boats to dreadnought battleships, fly anything from biplanes to supersonic jet fighters, and drive armored fighting vehicles from pre-WW2 all the way to the modern era. Driving these vehicles strikes a balance between ease of use and realism that makes it far easier to pick up than a simulator while being more ""real"" than a more openly unrealistic game such as World of Tanks or Armored Warfare (not to knock those games- they set out to provide different gameplay). 

The problem, naturally, comes in the game that is built around it. 

It's the economy, primarily. It moves at a glacial pace to encourage players to spend real money on the game. Both Research Points, used for unlocking new vehicles, and Silver Lions, the in-game currency, which is used to purchase, crew, and upgrade vehicles. Earnings are across the board pretty bad. This can give the impression one is bashing their head against a wall trying to get enough to research, purchase, and crew vehicles. This is, naturally, the point. It can take months or even years to grind to endgame vehicles for one tree of one nation. This means that experiencing a lot of the content must be sacrificed if you are to get to top tier in any reasonable period of time.

You also use Silver Lions to repair vehicles (you can, theoretically, simply not use SL to repair, but from about the middle of the tech tree onwards, vehicles take days to repair). Due to the realistic nature of the game's damage system, death can be instant and can be the result of one small mistake. Meanwhile, repair costs are painful compared to earnings. It's not uncommon to actually lose SL on a match even if you kill multiple opposing players due to repair costs (skill issue, skill issue, i know.), meaning you would have been better off if you hadn't even tried to play! Death comes easy in War Thunder, but it's not cheap. 

Stock, unupgraded vehicles, perform worse than their fully-upgraded counterparts, as they should. This isn't a problem on paper, heck it's the entire point of having vehicle upgrades, but sometimes it gets absurd. Stock ground vehicles can not extinguish fires nor repair damage. That isn't just a handicap, this is kneecapping. 

I haven't spend any money on War Thunder, and while I've heard the SL grind is less severe if you do, I have also heard the time to get from low-tier to top tier (where all the shiny toys Gaijin advertises, like the Abrams and F-14 Tomcat, are) is still absurd- on the order of months of continuous grinding for one nation. And that's if you're paying!

I really want to play and enjoy such a broad game with wonderful vehicles, but I simply cannot stand just how much this game was designed to fleece money out of people frustrated by it. 

There's fun to be had, but compared to what else the game dumps on you, I don't think it's worth it."
3836,its not worth playing
3837,I spent too many hours grinding for high tiers aircraft. I would stop but the sunk cost fallacy does not allow me to stop
3838,games price says free (its not). your mental state will fall leading to you getting a therapist

3845,"Air Battles are the prime gamemode but its just impossible I try all of the starter warplanes with no success I was lucky if I destroy  1 enemy per game even though this gamemode blow World of Warplanes out of the skies.
Ground Battles are good had some success but the are harder than World of Tanks and the tanks have better physics.
Naval Battles just sucks, World of Warships sinks this gamemode.
The visuals of the game are good even at low graphics."
3846,great game very realistic
3847,idk
3848,fun but the game downlode is to big XD
3849,"The game can be good, but It has too much cheaters.
Im in medium tank, the cheater shot ONE secondary machinegun bullet, my gunner is dead. 
This is a joke. I got this at least 10 times a day, ban the cheaters please.

3853,"This game is about the journey. If you enjoy the GAMEPLAY and don't mind getting schooled on occasion, then real enjoyment is to be had here. DO NOT try to buy your way to the top. You will be killed a lot, get frustrated, and quit. Learn how to play at the bottom first. Pick one tech tree and stick with it till you know you like the game. Only train 3 crews for tanks and ships, but have all crews trained in planes. It's fun, but its not a cakewalk. 7/10"
3854,This game makes me want to commit arson on chickens
3855,a 10 go brrrr
3856,"REALLY good game. Graphics, mechanics are good in general.
Some issues though: Requires A LOT of time to grind new vehicles, repetitive gameplay.

however, if you have spare time i would definitely recommend"
3857,gooddddd

3864,"Do you like eating severely burnt toast with no teeth? Do you also like being crushed by a hydraulic press while doing so? Do you also like being in a dark room with strange vaguely Russian-tractor-engine-sounding noises coming from the shadows?

Well then, War Thunder is for you! Welcome to a genre which only has 1 vaguely playable and fun [strike] 5am-9pm job [/strike] ""game""! Be ready to sacrifice either your soul or your credit card to our lord and saviour Gaijin Entertainment, especially if you like jet planes! Or helicopters! Or modern tanks! Or battleships! (on a serious note, don't listen to the memes saying the naval gamemode is dead, while its less populated it's definitely not and it is still fun.)

You will also enjoy the fun and balanced vehicles and teams of the game! The game is balanced off of player performance statistics rather than the actual vehicle's ability, and so nations with worse performing players (cough, Germany, cough, Tiger H1, cough, Panther D, cough, panzer 4 H) get more ""Balanced"" vehicles than the nations better people play like France! Or Italy! Or Japan! (I am so so sorry if you play Japanese ground forces). This goes to the point where in for example ground battles if you don't play certain nations you will often face opponents you can barely put a dent in head on whilst they can oneshot you from 2 kilometres away. And that's if you're NOT uptiered!

Seriously though, give some of the minor nations a go. They have some of the most fun vehicles in the game (Sweden 2.7 is my go-to fun lineup). Air battles are also pretty well balanced and are far more skill based. I haven't played enough naval to make a comment on that. 

10/10 game, I am a masochist, please help.

(Just a P.S. most of my playtime is on XBOX/PS4(which i lost the account for rip 7.7 britain lineup). Only recently got a decent PC and moved over to Steam. My proof for my experience is on my ingame profile and in the singular jet I've gotten so far.)"
3865,terrible
3866,Good game tanks go boom and plans go STUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

3895,I like the Stormpjas. It makes tanks go boom.
3896,pure hatred for this game. but i still spend money on it and still love it. 7/10
3897,Honestly a great game. Frustrating at times but if you play with friends its a grand ol time.  Playing by yourself isn't bad either it just takes time to unlock the next tier.
3898,Money greedy game. Don't even start. At the higher levels it will require you to put real money otherwise you/d stall. I'am very disappointed with this game.
3899,pain
3900,e
3901,
3902,"amazing game, highly recommend wasting 3 years of your life!"
3903,"Always uptiered, horrible grind, and p2w premiums. Boring gamemodes and short matches (so you dont get ''to many'' rewards (research points). But the most horrible thing is that non-premium players allways get uptiered, meaning you play agains much stronger tanks, while premium paying players get downtiered often (to reward them for spending real money in game). It is too fustrating to play 95% of the matches agains full +1.0 battle rating rank enemies, its just horrible, and developers are super greedy, they are selling veichles which each costs as much as a full game. Do not waste your time with this game, you will regret it, like i did, i finaly had enough after 1.000h of playing and i'm uninstalling it."

3912,"There are alot of prank reviews out there so this is forreal,
If you like action packed war games, this is the game for you, there is grinding involved like everygame so you have to be prepared, i think its best to have some sort of week to month long break if you are  getting bored.

Also YOU WILL SELL YOUR SOUL TOO THE SNAIL FOR WINS, 500+ BOOSTERS ARE HEXES AND CURSE YOU.

10/10 game, huge variety of things to do."
3913,real fun
3914,best gme ever becouse almost all of the other  jet fighter games are like over 50 bucks

3916,cool game
3917,best
3918,"The mechanics and such are fun, and it's not terribly grindy. But from my understanding the devs just go for cash and there are some broken things that never get fixed is the general consensus. Of my 2 weeks into the game, I can say map design is lopsided and there's a shitton of spawn camping once the match swings in favor of a team. There are people smurfing and no one actually wants to be helpful in game or even stop with the toxic camping to make it a game where new people like myself want to stick around. I do okay in the game so far regardless so I'm not bitching about sucking at the game, just the wasted potential to make it really good. Shame as I do have fun in the game too, it's just neglected. Good marketing though, I got into it cause of the people putting out content.

Update: played a bit more and now hovering in the BR 4.x tiers and its pretty much a similar experience, if not worse when it comes to map balance. There's no room to be a newbie with your tanks because there's no separation of experienced or inexperienced players so I'm sure I'm just fodder for someones YT channel or will be eventually. This game isn't fun as you progress. One bad round and my tanks have 2 hours of repairs or you gotta spend your Lions. At this point it's become a grind. The bad spawn camping is present no matter where and honestly if you have suffered enough you won't care when you do it to others so it just becomes a downward spiral of negative experience for everyone.

Not looking to stick around and most certainly won't spend money."
3919,"very fun but pretty  hard bc you have to alot of teirs but still fun
"
3920,its fun but very grindey
3921,"It's a fun game. When you're getting good, you'll have fun. It'll come after a steep learning curve and a few emotional breakdowns but yeah it gets fun. That or you'll spend money on the game and feel like you always have to play it until you get your money's worth."
3922,"It's ok
Sad that there is no sex"
3923,This game fucking sucks.
3924,"pretty fun game but the grind is long and i would recommend getting a premium account when you have a break from work/school and devoting a while to grinding. also sometimes you can ""get gaijined"" as most people call it because an error in the game might have made you lose a fight(i.e. your shell goes through the enemy without doing any damage."
3925,"This game it says it's free to play which is true, to start is completely free but this game after a certain length you will find yourself unable to pass a certain tier unless you dump MASSIVE(1100+) amounts of hours into this game, its not a game where you can slowly become stronger as the pay to win wall is so tall and what gives you more money, xp, its seems to influence your ""rolls"" when you get a daily prize, it's a p2w system that is corrupt as the only thing they bring is new tanks that make previous tanks even if they are the same tier temporarily useless until they release a update balancing the said tank, it is then debuffd so its then just another tank you wasted money on so you can buy the next p2w tank. You have lobbies of 30 people no-one types communicates, almost feels as if your muted or just bots are playing. Most of your team is in a clan sort of thing if you look at their name but you see them and their buddy both leave sometimes a total of 4 people will do this in a single game right from the start. I would not recommend to anyone without a true absolute love for tanks cause it might be ruined in this game and also to have a stable income cause it will take your money as soon as you feel tempted there goes 20 but before you know your spending hundreds of dollars on a game that you cant even enjoy cause you may win 1/5 or 2/5 matches regardless if you are teamed up with someone. All n all the game is a rough 3.1 out of 10.0. Score being so low not cause the game is bad itself but cause the way the advancement is structured, your time will be wasted unless you bring your credit card or mom n dads. Also VR is only for planes which makes it slightly more enjoyable but not really. 
"
3926,"Good game to end your life, but it's fun and I can't stop playing this and crashing into ground with my planes. Tanks ? What's that! I can shoot the enemy 5times and still no damage ._. then... he istakills me. 

"
3927,"War Thunder is an excellent game that has come far from its old roots and continues to improve with time. The vehicle feel responsive and the use of penetration and model damage puts combat far above their hit scan based competitors. Their f2p model is fair, but the grind can be exhausting. Expect to spend some money for the best experience."
3928,Boring game play and gross grind.
3929,heheheha bang bang boom boom brrrrrrrrrt
3930,tank go zoom
3931,don't play this game if you are not willing to put 500hours into studying specs of every plane and when you will win a dogfight

3947,WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
3948,"Full of hackers, cheaters, and exploiters that inhibit anyone from enjoying the game. I put 278 hours in and worked hard to get nothing in the end. The game constantly nickels and dimes the players for money. Play to win games like War Thunder is something to avoid."
3949,yes
3950,great all around game plus it is free
3951,just because
3952,don't play if you value your time and sanity
3953,I hate this game so much
3954,"Don't playing this game if high levels of stress may affect your health. Unless you are a communist you wont have it easy in this game by any stretch of the imagination due to the sheer amount of Russian bias in this game. Besides the aforementioned bias every game you play you're statistically at a disadvantage since the chance of you not getting matched with enemy players that are whole Tiers and BR levels above you is about %20. Its like the Russians who made this game never learned how to count single digits numbers properly, that or they're just blatantly trying to force people into buying golden eagles. Even if you buy Golden Eagles unless they're used in the Russian Tech tree you'll still get abused by people who did put them in the Russian tech tree so if you come into this game with any hopes of enjoying your time playing a country other than Russia its gonna be an extremely frustrating struggle. If you're a communist and/ or you like Russian technology then this is the game for you because the developers will hand hold you throughout your experience throughout the game. Now to be totally fair the Bias only gets you so far so if you're a terrible pilot/ tank commander/ sea captain your Russian bias wont always be able to save you. Same goes for people who aren't playing Russia, If you have a keen eye and you know where and how to land your shots you'll find success in this game, But know that every vehicle and tier in this game weren't created equally so even if you are a great shot and a good pilot your equipment can still drag you down and it just makes the Bias afforded to some countries in this game that much worse. To sum it up War Thunder can be both a immensely rewarding and infuriating game depending on your play style, skill, and which country you choose to play but it suffers the same pit falls that most free-to-play games suffer and you'll often be confronted with this. I wish the Steam review system had a middle ground option cause under normal circumstance I wouldn't just flat out endorse this game but I also wouldn't say there isn't anything to enjoy here. For now I'll recommend the game but only under the pre-tense that its fleeting levels of unbalance can really hinder the experience at times."
3955,"Call me a scrub, I fucking hate this games matchmaking, and it's not really about the other team."
3956,i had fun at some point
3957,Much good
3958,"Unless you pay real money you'll be flying dainty vehicles for 1000 hours.
I get the core model, but the game fist has to be FUN before the consumer desires to spend money on a free game.  
The vehicles do alot of damage but die easily, especially in the beginning, so alot of players wanting to fulfill the fantasy of dive-bombing into enemy lines won't find that here.  Instead, you find yourself sticking with a group and barely putting any effort in till you win. 
Overall, since it strives too hard to be realistic, it's boring.  And since it's boring, it doesn't get any money from me."

4005,the game is free but it costs your time and soul
4006,"I love this game (1,372 hours) having played this over the past 5 years. Nice graphics and sound, awesome variety of planes, ground vehicles and naval vessels. That said, I can't stand this game primarily for the two following reasons:

1. the tech tree grind is murder. The devs keep adding vehicles between  my current vehicle I'm researching and the highest battle rating vehicles in the tech tree. Just as you think you'll finally get there the devs keep pushing the top end vehicles out of reach. Grinding at the highest levels takes forever and you end up getting out matched by wallet warriors.  I have several higher end vehicles I was researching which I can no longer work on because 4 or five new vehicles have been added between me and my goal. This goes for my American, German and British tech tree. Very frustrating for someone who does not want to spend hundreds of $$$ to buy golden eagles (the in-game currency).

2. the  russian bias in the game is ridiculously painful. A fellow player once remarked that a German WW2 tank just needs to be close to a russian tank and it will spontaneously explode. A funny exaggeration but it does echo the sentiment of many players. Come up against a KV1 or JS and you may as well blow yourself up regardless of the tank your in. As for WW2 russian planes, they far outclass every other plane (whether American, German, British, etc...). True they were generally more rugged but their performance is far too exaggerated (overpowered, over-gunned, protected by some sort of invisible shield). I wager the hitboxes on russian planes are tweaked in their favor. I'm actually very good at shooting down planes with AA; knowing how to lead them based on trajectory, distance, ammo velocity, etc... . American, German, British, Italian, etc... no problem; I'll score kills. However, when trying to shoot down a russian plane it's like my first time with AA. I call BS and have thrown in the towel.

Fix these glaring issues and maybe I'll come back to the game. In the meantime I've run out of patience."
4007,very good
4008,fucking awesome
4009,"great game too much of a grind though.
"
4010,"You Will Establish a Love/Hate Relationship with this game, Play one Match and you'll be having the time of your life, Play another match and you'll be cursing the Dev's and you will be telling yourself ""Should i uninstall"" and ""Why am i still playing this"" Then you suddenly go back to having the time of your life after 2 or more matches"

4012,dope
4013,"War Thunder is a trap. For every good game you have, there is always 10 terrible ones (at least) that follow. Tis a vicious cycle that once you get stuck in you aren't getting out. The only way to not lose your mind in the grind insanity is to buy premium vehicles or accounts. If you manage to find this review before you get this monstrosity, throw away 340 hours of your short life, and are not a masochist; Let this be a warning. Pain is mandatory, brain damage that gives you the vocabulary of a 4 year old is mandatory. If you don't like any of what I just listed than run while you still can, not just for me, but yourself."
4014,this game has made me question my will to live every second i play it. i'm stuck in an endless cycle of having 1 minute of enjoyment and 2 hours of torment. every game is hell. i feel like a dope fiend stuck in a constant self destructive cycle. i cant put it down but when i put it up it makes me want to die.
4015,war machines go brrrrrr
4016,better then world of tanks

4046,This game is certainly something.
4047,This game isn't worth the time or money this game is worse than World Of Tanks on so many levels. Don't try this game out you'll regret it.
4048,its shit
4049,Totally not pay to win. Totally easy for new players. Totally balanced. Totally doesn't have 86% of your plane deaths from pilot knockouts??? I don't see why anyone would give a bad review.
4050,"game is alright, looks good, shooting down planes and having cool dogfights is fun. But the grind is long and boring not to mention you should never count on your team for anything as they will rush in and die in a matter of minutes, got someone on your 6 and you bring them towards your team chances are they leave you to dry. team work doesn't seem to be a concept for most. Some of the people that play this are so bad they will stick a head on or ram just because they are so desperate for one kill, rather than playing smart. So the game is alright, but get ready for the loooong grind and shit teammates or some other bullshit."

Fun game.... altough...
it decreased my mental health by about 80%
The grind is real.
War Thunder makes you obsessed with the game by giving you luck on your first few matches and then watching you go through living hell once that ends.
I hope you enjoy being in crippling debt most of the time as you get constantly killed by stalinium fueled killing machines. (Unless you ARE the stalinium fueled killing machine!)
...
Anyways!

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

4065,It is rather grindy and the mechnicas are horrible.
4066,very good
4067,one of the worst games ever
4068,"i cant recommend this in its current state its economics are in shambles for ""free to players"". The BR System badly needs reworking (my opinion). And the worst thing how you progress is unbeliveabley slow if you want to get unltra high tire jets for free grind your life away even with preimeum then (this is the game for you). Now how to fix this mess 1. Make it economical lose at higher tires. (for free to players) 2. Split the match maker System into catagorys of skill like (Mech warrior online). 3. Create a separate era tree for future jets ie: tomcats' phantoms' A-4B (late) A Missile age if you will. 4. New and better maps  the old maps are just dume theres no excuse gijin. Please just make maps that have close mid and long range combat on all of them."

4070,"PLANE FUN
"
4071,"I would recommend this game because its free, honestly is quite fun, graphics and sounds are good too... BUT...
This game is looking to take your money! and honestly will be taking a lot of your time if you don't want to pay real money to progress a little faster (I understand this is a free game and they need to sell micro transactions, but if they would tone down the grind for normal tech tree vehicles i could put up with the micro transactions better.) I played many years of Classic and Old School Runescape so i am used to grinding, but this game almost feels worse. If someone creates a game that is similar to this with a little less grind i will not be coming back. A good tip for this game id say would be to Attack the D point!"
4072,"Honestly no other sim game i can tell in the market. I know its reputation based on how grindey it is, or your tank getting one shot when you shot the same person in a soft spot with your best round but only getting ricochets or they somehow penetrate but do the equivalent of throwing marshmellows (looking at you USA tanks) but playing as the germans is honestly pretty fun. Well designed and actually can take a hit and throw it too. Ive played monster hunter world for 200 hours plus on console searching for the ever elusive attack 4 jewel. the grind is nothing new to me anymore. 10/10 will die again"

4098,"/!\ READ IF YOU HAVE AMD GPU /!\
The game is currently unplayable on AMD GPUs (at least the RX6000 series). Visual glitches WILL appear randomly obstructing your view COMPLETELY. There's NO fix as the problem is in the game engine itself.
It has been this way for months and Gaijin has done nothing to fix the compatibility with AMD cards. Several other people got the same problem. Appalling. 
"
4099,"Went into this with some hope of a good and fun game, but oh boy is it in need of serious work. Encountered at least 5 different bugs that broke my controls. 

It is not possible to make aircraft controls behave realistically. Inverting controls only sometimes works. The user interface is illogical most of the time. The tutorial is lacking detail. Players in matches have way stronger tanks than you do, so I can hit them twice, not kill them, then they kill me in one shot. The grind to unlock is excessive and, quite frankly, all of these things make the game not at all fun and you'd be better off playing a Battlefield game (just not BF 2042)."
4100,Good game
4101,made me cream
4102,this is my first time using steam and this is a great first free game to play for people who like history aviation and war

4115,it's a very good tank game but planes will **** you up any moment
4116,"My son and I have a fun time playing this game. We aren't the greatest at it, but it is still pretty enjoyable."
4117,"Despite the Easy Anti-cheat Engine, it's once again absolutely useless. Unfortunately the game has its cheaters, using wall-hacks and invulnerability and there's nothing the game admins are doing about it.

Land battles are just pure sniping where the game will actually allow spawn camping from your own spawn point and sniping the enemies. Any tank can snipe from 1 spawn to the other, across an entire map.

The only decent thing about this game compared to the Wargaming franchise are the realistic physics and hard-points on a target. 

But lets not kid yourself, when you get to the final ranks, it's pay to play because you will never earn enough game currency to afford the repairs to stay in the tier you started with (Unless you purchase some with real $).

Just like Wargaming, this game uses a similar monetary system of micro purchases that takes advantage of your frustrations, leading to pure rage as you start bleeding game currency and thinking that if you purchase that premium ammo allowing for that little extra penetration, it will make a difference.

Jokes on you though when you realise you purchased a full round of premium ammo, only to  never be able to use it all in a single match and does the left over get refunded for the next round? haha no.. -.-

Suckers will play and pay."
4118,"The game is fun and challenging. Big downside IMO is the game is VERY grind grind grind.
If you plan to use Jets plan to spend hundreds and hundreds of hours grinding XP to even unlock the most basic jets."

4143,"If you like your brain and your wallet don't play this game. They force you to buy premium tanks/planes to actually get anywhere in the game. All the lobbies are full of either M1A1 Abrams or T-72 A Turms <-- This tank is a pay to win tank the doesn't die and one shots everything. There is such thing as ghost shots because I guess its to hard to register damage if you die at the same time as your round hitting the other tank, so they just say you didn't shoot. This could be so good if the dev's learned basic balancing skills but it doesn't seem like they care to listen to anyone. All they do is line their pockets and push shit content. I don't usually give a crap about p2w but this game is beyond any levels I've seen, I'd say its up there with EA."
4144,"It's fun at low levels but after about battle rating 3.0 the skill curve gets so steep every enemy can aim and fire faster than you and will almost always destroy you in one hit. Frequently you'll think you've had a pretty good match but then find out you got barely anything as a reward. And compared to World of Warships, the progression is so slow that you can't unlock very much without paying real world money."

4151,"Used to play this game years back, had no idea how much missed out on."
4152,...
4153,yes
4154,"Same as every Gaijin game, a neat idea with some fun mechanics, executed terribly by a lazy money hungry developer.
This company is notorious for taking a nice game and raping it with micro transactions.

It isn't enough for you to give them a tiny bit of money, they RELY on the few people who give them thousands of dollars.
So the progression is setup for them, you can have fun grinding to get the in game currency that's needed for buying new vehicles, as well as ammunition and repairs while you're constantly bleeding money just to maintain your vehicles.

OR you can give them 50 dollars and just buy loads of the currency.

That's the way this model is set up, so unless you're perfectly fine with sticking to the lowest 2 tiers I wouldn't bother with this game.

IL-2 Sturmovik is a much better aviation game than this I would check that out if you're into planes."

4156,Snail will get u too.
4157,"Honestly Warthunder is my one favorite hack'n slash open world RPGs with dating sim elements this combined with amazing graphics and a stellar story with amazing writing, characters, and voice acting makes this the ultimate gaming experience enough to rival gaming greats such as Superman 64 and Big Rigs over the road racing. My step dad literally stopped beating me into a pulp every Wednesday night after he saw me playing this game feeling completed as a father he/I blew his brains out with a 12 gauge shotgun (Take that Jerry).

Plot 

The year is 1984 and the world is torn apart by BR compression subsonic jets are forced to fight for their lives against top tier missiles as tigers are hunted to extinction by the evil HEATFS slingers. Our protagonist PhlyDaily is tasked with hunting down the legendary crystal of BR decompression, but he must get there before the evil Gaijin Entertainment for they plan to use the crystals power to resurrect the T-14 armada and bring forth and age of Russian bias. Along the way he will meet many challenges including but not limited to stock HEATFS at top tier, painfully slow F2P grind, high repair costs, the entirety of the french tech tree, and trying to understand anything that comes out of Oddbawz mouth.

Plot Rating: 6.9/10



Game play 

Gaijin have really outdone themselves with Warthunder the combo system is crisp and fast paced the world is open and full of life and the dating sim elements don't feel shoehorned in. Ultimately if you enjoy games like the Persona series or Garfield kart then this game is for you

Game Play Rating: Tyler Blevins/Fortnite


Visuals 

Looking at old beta footage it's clear game director headache kojingles had a very clear image of what he wanted the world of warthunder to look like the visuals are clear and crisp never once did I not feel immersed in the games world.

Visuals Rating; 6/10 too much water


Final Overview

SEGA and Gaijin along with game director Fortnite Jonesy have really out done them selves with this action thriller horror survival game/Dating Sim. Overall the game has just a little something for everyone

Final score 0/10

4160,"The monetization grind is horrendous HOWEVR that only applies to higher level tanks beyond world war 2. If you simply exercise the discipline to see this as a world war 2 only game, and stop worrying about or trying to achieve any higher level tanks than that, then it's quite fun, has no economy problems in the lower levels, and can easily be played for free indefinitely... as a WWII game only, that's all. If you love panzers and shermans and spitfires, come on over! If you want Abrams and Leopards and jet fighters, choose a different game."

4171,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
4172,"If you thought that this game would be a good alternative to World of Tanks, you'd be wrong. Its clunky, slow and looks like its been made using Windows 95. Would recommend going back to WoT. Enough to see here."

4175,its good game
4176,Great game
4177,"TLTR: While I enjoy this game more than I dislike it, I in no way recommend it.

Cons:
- It has 2 flat-out pay-to-win features that is firmly reinforced by the structure of the game in general. Crew-skills ensure that you play with debuffs for a year or more (if you play consistently) unless you pay your way out of it. If you play Arcade Battles you may also need to pay for premium vehicles to not play with additional debuffs, because you need a lineup of 3 vehicles of more or less equal overall strength in this game-mode. While you can avoid the premiums by restricting yourself to only vehicles with a full line-up, you can then end up having very few vehicles you can actually play. If you play Realistic Battles or Simulator Battles only crew-skills are true p2w.

- It further has a predatory funding method in the form of gambling, for addicts and children.

- The dailies and other special tasks are restricted to people who've played a lot, consistently, have played for a while, and who do well in PvP.  A veteran of 10 years playing who enter matches against players who've only played for a few months can complete them in 15 minutes. A player who've been at it for a couple of months can struggle to do them in a 10-15 hours session (depending on what task you randomly get).

- Expect having to play consistently for a week or more before even getting access to dailies and periodic special-reward ""objectives"".

- Events are for the elite only. The special events are restricted to players who do nothing but play every day for the duration of the event.  During the current summer-event (dubbed Suffer Event by the community) I have to play 40-60 matches of 10-20 minutes each within a set 2-day period at least 4 times during August to get the minimum worthwhile prize. I haven't done the calculations but I believe I have to play 120-180 matches within a set 2-day period at least 10 times during August to get all prizes. As it happens, after 370 hours of playing I only have access to vehicles allowing 1/3 of those prizes. As it stands I don't bother with the event at all despite playing quite a lot most days. The event goals are simply way out of my reach, as have all events during my time playing this game.

- Getting in-game money is a struggle, and that assumes that you pay for your playtime. You won't notice at first because the first repairs of new vehicles are free, but you'll soon find that repair-costs equal or get greater than the rewards of matches all depending on what vehicles you use. You will rarely see youtubers addressing this as their experience in racking up money (Silver Lions - SL) is such that it's a non-issue for them, making them oblivious to this issue. But many new players come to the forums asking how they can make more SL than they loose to repairs. In my experience they most often get no answer. The vehicles have varying repair-costs however and the only way for a newish player (for example one who's played for 370 hours) is to not use the best tanks with the highest repair-costs. Starting with Russia or China helps, as most of their vehicles cost less to repair than those of other nations on the lower ranks. If you don't make SL you can't get new vehicles, can't improve the ones you have, and in the worst case you have to wait for a week or 3 to play a particular vehicle again because you can't afford to repair it.

- The pay-to-play feature (subscription on other games) is considerably more expensive in this game than in the vast majority of MMOs. Further it's far more important than in most ""free-to-play"" MMOs as you get far less SL if you don't. On the upside you can purchase their subscription one day at a time, so if you only play during weekends it ends up being cheaper than other MMOs regardless. If you play for an hour every evening instead..

- Long Grinds. It can take a year or more of consistent and long game-play sessions to grind a single nation's techtree. It also takes an even longer time to earn SL enough to purchase the researched vehicles. This assumes you pay to play. Free to play will take more than double. As such you should only consider the first 3 ranks of any nation for grinding and ignore the remaining vehicles. Let them instead come when they do naturally, and enjoy the WW2 tanks in the meantime. You'll be using them for a long time no matter what.

- The Battlepass, a second subscription you can get on top of the normal one, is very poor value. Don't get it unless you've already progressed enough along it that paying will get you a premium vehicle.

- Most big youtubers who make WT vids are sponsored by Gaijin and are cop-outs. Don't trust them. They are also veterans who haven't had a new-player experience in this version of WT. The game was entirely different when they started, and they have long since forgotten even that. This means a lot of what they say is irrelevant to your experience as how you play greatly affects any advice or analysis given in WT. You should still watch their content if you want to become good at WT, just be aware that not all of their glitter is gold. Also, almost all of their showcased vids are cherry-picked best-wins against noobs. If you see them live-stream battles you'll soon learn that they die as much as anyone else most matches and have days when they suck despite their 15 years of experience. With certain exceptions, self-grandiosing cop-outs.


Pros:
- It can be quite fun sometimes if you're willing to ignore all the above and just play for the random matches for their own sake. Forget events, objectives, tasks, and just play some matches when you fancy.

- It's very skill-based. While it has clear pay-to-win elements, you can expect a veteran using the worst tank in the game to totally trash you while using the best one. I'm not kidding. The pay-to-win elements are dramatic when you play someone your own skill-level, but differences in player-skill from best to worst are far wider than the difference between a fully functional vehicle and a fully debuffed one.

- Damage model. It's not based on hit-points and you can one-shot anyone, if you're good or lucky enough. Or do no damage at all if you suck or get unlucky enough.


Conclusion
I play it and enjoy it. I absolutely do not recommend it. It wouldn't take much to make War Thunder shine, but the devs have no intention of taking those steps."
4178,"The game provides information on all the vehicles, like when they operate, when they were built etc etc. The game has amazing graphics aswell as realistic physics. The only thing I'd recommend the developers to fix is up-tiers. :/"

Fun game, played for about 3~4 years. Started on PS4, so I have way more hours than what's on Steam.
Just now getting to jets lol."
4182,"If you are a retard enjoying playing broken soviet tanks you'll like this game. I'm not so this game fking sucks for me.
Also half of the land maps were made half assed."
4183,because yes >:)
4184,good
4185,"idk if this is a good thing but, after playing germany for a good bit ive been liking german culture, you know the occasional apple fritters and german beer, but after reading Adolf Hitler's book ""Mein Kampf"" im starting to understand what hitler meant and i can truly feel what he meant by making really bad tanks that worked effectively well against the yankees, the crooked teeths and also for the commies. One last thing everyone in germany sucks at the game, so have fun carrying, KINDA LIKE HOW THE WAR ACTUALLY WENT, Historically Accurate."
4186,HI
4187,"War Thunder is a great game for enthusiasts. It has game modes for all lovers of millitary vehicles including aircraft, tanks, ships and helicopters. In my 200 hours of playing i have found arcade aircraft and arcade tanks the funnest.
Premium vehicles are a little overpriced but its bearable. Plus they have sales very often. They have lots of countries that you can play including USA, USSR, China and others.
And now, the GRIND. 
I have stopped playing Warthunder because of how immensely slow the grinding was. It takes at least a month of non stop playing just to get to the old jets. After a while its simply repetitive and boring. 
The graphics are nice, VR support is good too although its quite buggy and laggy.
The game is quite balanced but premiums give you quite a big advantage sometimes.
In realistic battles you can play with tanks, planes and helicopters at the same time!
Note that helicopters are only available if you have a rank 5 tank or better.
overall good game.
But its just not as fun as it was when i started.
8.9/10"
4188,Great game but it takes eternity to get the jets.
4189,"This is a good game if you enjoy war movies and or other war games , although it is longer than other games but it tends to pay off after each match. One thing that does stand out though is the toxic community rarely enemys being toxic but more likely to be your own teammates they will claim you stole a kill/bombing targets or they will just whine about not getting air cover when they never asked for it, so if you plan on installing this godly game be prepared for grinding alot for planes and tanks and dealing with whiny teammates.

Give up on this terrible practice."
4218,"I downloaded it and my virginity came back, would not recommend"
4219,I love the forums where the community helps debunk misinformation and helps spread the truth no matter the cost. Seeing classified documents really helps with understanding how the vehicles and weapons work in real life.
4220,this game makes people go insane
4221,bad
4222,"Very fun game, has good physics and fun gameplay. So much to do with tanks, planes and boats. There are also massive tech trees to unlocks hundreds of vehicles."
4223,"Good game, but if ur bothered by pay to win dont play."
4224,Too much of a grind... Matches are all blowouts!!! Not beginner friendly. Lack of people playing in Air Arcade past BR 4.7.  Can't make credits in RB past 4.7.  At an impasse.  Ground battles are useless for beginners because crew skills matter so much.  Excited that I got a Helicopter but can't use it because BR is 8.3 and the only pvp for helicopters is ground RB and I don't have the patience to grind a tank to that level.  GAME ECONOMY IS SOOOOO MESSED UP!!! NO WONDER NO ONE PLAYS ARCADE MODE PAST rank 4.  It was fun while it lasted but shelving this game because you must add PREMIUM in order to play past rank 4! No CHAT IS ALLOWED!!! MAKES TEAMPLAY REALLY GREAT!!! STUPID COMPANY
4225,boom boom go bomb
4226,Almost fun.
4227,"I can't speak for tanks or ships, but I can speak for planes, so here goes.

USA: Pepper everyone with 12.7mm 50 cal, if in doubt, add more 50 cals. Try to fly in straight lines and avoid doing too many turns once you unlock planes late Rank 2 and above.

Germany: 20mm cannons. Early planes have low ammo count, so make every shot worthwhile. Never ever get into turnfights in them, especially with the FW 190. You hit people and run away, strictly boom and zoom.

USSR: Probably balanced when it comes to performance. Make sure you practice your marksmanship. The Russian planes prefer having guns mounted on the nose. Pay attention to your ammo count.

Britain: Early planes pepper enemies with 7mm, then you unlock the 20mm cannons which can definitely wreak havoc. The Spitfires can turn, but doing too many of them will make you lose a lot of speed and energy for more fights. Excellent strike fighters though, except for the Firebrand, that one is eh.

Japan: Same as the British, good turners with powerful guns. A fair amount of Japanese fighters will be quite slow compared to others, especially the A6M and Ki-43. The Ki-49 series of bombers are eh.

Italy: 12.7mm BREDA-SAFAT will give you a head start in early planes. Some of the later planes will have German 20mm cannons. They play similarly to the Germans, use boom and zoom tactics.

France: I haven't played too much with them, but a good amount of their early designs have 20mm cannons with only 60 rounds, 90 if you ask nicely. Make every shot count. There will be some American and British designs with French roundels painted on them.

China: Has a mix of planes from all the countries of the above, haven't played too much of them but it allows for a mix and match of fighting styles.

Israel: Have not yet played them, you need Rank 4 planes from USA or UK or France unlocked. They start with a BF 109 with terrible performance (IRL). It will improve from there on though.

They are all fun. I tend to play a mix of Japan, USA, Germany and Britain, though as of this writing I primarily main Japan."

P.S. Only download it if you like suffer, one tech tree takes about 600+ hours to complete."

4298,"I liked the graphics, the sounds, the models of the planes, the tech tree, and all the different vehicles you can choose from. I love how you can choose from different countries too. I would recommend this game to others because its just so fun and addicting, but the best part, it was all free."
4299,good
4300,"Look, this game is extremely unique. It offers gameplay that is unlike anything else on the market. That being said, the devs of this game seem to be allergic to listening to their community, and/or dont care about the issues presented. They'll fix bugs, but as far as providing a balanced experience you can get stuffed. 

Example i will use is Close Air Support. There is a way to play planes in their own undisturbed mode just good ole wings on wings. BUT if you want to play boats, or tanks, players can spawn in their planes as a kind of ""kill streak"". For me this is what makes the game incredibly unenjoyable sometimes. 

This is totally a ""git gud"" issue where i cant seem to get good enough at the AA or the planes to prevent CAS from being an extremely frustrating experience. But honestly, after 400+ hours I feel like there should have been some kind of improvement. In a typical match, half of my deaths are from planes i can't do anything about. 

Don't get me wrong, the game has a bug here and there, sometime hit reg can wig out, but those happen 1 out of every 10 games if that for me. I die to CAS minimum twice a match. 

I wouldn't even have an issue with this if there was literally any way for me to use my tanks in Realistic Battles. The only way i can have tank on tank gameplay is to suffer planes. 

My suggestions are two fold: 1. Give a gamemode that allows tank and ship RB without planes. 

2. Buff AA. Give it the ability to get a soft lead on the target at low levels just to make sure more people can make hits. 

If either of these things was implemented i would more than happily change my negative review to positve, because i honestly love the game, i just hate not being able to use my tanks. (and high key the toxic community who's response to any time of CAS criticism is just ""Get gud, you suck, use fighters, master AA"", etc)"
4301,yes
4302,"Pay to win garbage, micro-transactions and a permanent matching with superior tanks makes this game disappointing."
4303,The most fun pain you will ever have
4304,"It's a good-looking, smooth and versatile game. And when I say versatile I mean VERSATILE. In the launcher you get a choice of 5 clients ranging from minimal(14.2GB), which in my experience can run on a toaster, and full ultra HQ(93.0GB). them you launch in and you can choose from an enormous list of controllers, flight sticks, HOTAS, and keyboard layouts, or you can just fly on stock mouse aim. the gameplay speaks for itself and I won't spoil the first launch experience... but it's vast and very enjoyable. you can choose between arcade, realistic and simulator modes, each a higher difficulty than the former. IMO a must play."
4305,"this game is Pay to WIN. and thats it. if you want  to feel what its like to be brutally crushed over and over because you think your 20 bucks is worth more than a dlc tank than go right ahead and play it, i understand its free but that doesn't mean it should be so unbalanced when it comes to the majority of players it makes it not fun"

Many of my friends and people like this game too much, because this game have perfect community, amazing physics and for addition, gameplay is too easy for games about strategy, so, I support this game at all, and for you, reader, I recommend this game for this time, but maybe and for all time of life of this game))) Good luck!)"

4346,"This review is a bit more difficult than ""would you recommend this, yes or no?"". There are two opposing views when I think of this game, and I'll address them in a bit.

War Thunder is a product of Gaijin Entertainment, a company I am NOT a fan of. My disdain for their company practices began years ago when they silenced members of the War Thunder community (of which I had been a part of a long while ago) who had posted videos of glitches and bugs on Youtube. They would copyright claim people's accounts, and issue penalties against accounts which were associated with these videos. The practice of preventing fair and honest criticism of a product is shady at best, downright dishonest at worst. The public (in my opinion) has a right to voice concerns about the products they consume in any open forum, and that should not be abated. That being said, I understand what Gaijin did was legal, but not every legal action is the correct course of action, and I do not condone their behavior when it comes to suppressing dissenting opinions about ""features"" in their games.

-----------
The Good:
-----------

- War Thunder is a diverse platform in which several fields of combat take place at once. It is fun to interact with a battlefield where air, land, and sea battles are all taking place at once. 

- The gameplay is short and episodic: You don't have to be tied down for an hour or more in one particular match. You can get in, play through (and kick some ass doing it) and be done with a match in less than 15 minutes. This makes it perfect for when you don't have a lot of time to commit, but you don't want to sit on your hands for 20 minutes.

- The tiers are challenging, but doable: I know, I know about the ""Russian bias"" and ""Power creep"" issues (especially with certain premium vehicles), but I find that despite the difficulties, there are not insurmountable problems, and I don't believe every battle should be winnable despite the circumstances. To be frank, I like that not every vehicle can reasonably kill every other vehicle. It makes it more realistic. [ I still think it's bullshit to have almost $1,000 worth of DLC where you can pay-to-win, but we'll get to that. ]

- It's a pretty game: It's very atmospheric and (while you aren't dying) you feel pulled into the environment. Sometimes its nice to test fly around and just look, ya know? And even during combat you get a sense between strafing runs and having your wings sawed off by 12.7 mm fire that someone cared on the design team. I appreciate that.

---------
The Bad:
---------

- I do not appreciate Gaijin as a company for how it operates: This seems like a small criticism, but this issue ALONE meant I hadn't touched this title in over half a decade. I have only recently picked it back up, so time will tell how things go.

- Pay-to-win is not a concept I enjoy. Don't get me wrong, I like playing a game with some difficulty and bite. But if I'm going to put my balls in a vice and squeeze them into a paste, I at least want to feel like that was my choice. Being forced to play with people who credit card-warriored their way onto the battlefield feels less like being indulgent in masochism, than it does indulging my wall in the blood and viscera from my now flattened skull.

- It's disappointing to use ""free experience"" or whatever they call it to train units, only to see that the conversion takes premium credits to use. This may be a small gripe admittedly, I don't believe that's actually what it's called; but why hang this feature over our heads and then force open our wallets to use the experience we've earned?

- Premium features. I don't appreciate a game requiring recurring purchases to allow for more flexibility and ease of advancement. It's another pay-to-win strategy, and a blatantly obvious one at that. ""For a meager investment of [insert money here] you can get [insert time here] where you earn TWICE as much as the peasantry who doesn't spend there money here!"" That one's still harsh. (And I have played games from Wargaming, so I've been dealing with that for quite a while.)

-----------------
The Conclusion:
-----------------

War Thunder is a fun (and frustrating) experience for players at all levels. What you might lack in skill you can make up for in boldness and tenacity, and I feel as though the playing field has POTENTIAL for level gameplay (please imagine that POTENTIAL as bolded, italicized, and underlined for extra emphasis: it isn't often enough the case). I recommend the game because it is fun, not because it is my favorite or even that I would suggest it to everyone I know, I probably won't. I have only recently picked the title back up to play with my friends, and I won't likely go further than that. 

If you decide to play it, understand the good and bad (for me) are balanced enough to make this review difficult to swing one way or the other, but not so bad as to make me lean towards ""No"" on the ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" question. 

If anything I've said here has been inaccurate to any degree, please do forgive me, as I've been away for quite some time and have only just started playing it on Steam. This is simply a review I feel ought to be read, but perhaps it is best taken with a grain of salt."

yes"

4349,"you want someone to love you? yeah me too.

this game is almost like a normal relationship, it constantly abuses you, drains your wallet, and the only time you have fun is for a few minutes before you go back to several hours of pain and misery.

The only thing is, this game doesn't give you sex for you to try and 'fix it'."
4350,Good.

4356,Incredible game - so fun :D
4357,"I have been playing this game for a very long time, before they even add the UK or Japan ground vehicles, and I must say that I am very disappointed with the way Gaijin treats it community. I guarantee you that after a while you will stop at tier 3 and everything becomes extremely grindy. You will have to spend money in order for you to progress the tech tree. Not only that, the gameplay is extremely repetitive and unfun for certain nations at certain BR. It is always the same task: drive or fly for 5 minute, dive in, fight people, die, and repeat. Sure that the map have AI and objectives but those are worthless and unfun because you will be shot down very fast if you do those, even if you are a high altitude bomber. I also think that certain nations are very very OP but I am not an expert on that. Gaijin just keeps adding new toys to play but after a while you will see that they all have the same gameplay and do not offer anything new to the game. I will give them credit that they add a lot of nice looking/unique vehicles into the game and nice looking texture, but that is only it.
Overall, if you are looking for a tank and plane game that is nearly realistic and pretty graphic, this is the game for you because WT is sort of the only game out there in the market. But I hope that Gaijin change it ethic and improving the gameplay before it is too late."
4358,"The Best Worst Game you will ever play

I am not saying the game is bad, what I am trying to say is that you , YOU, The Player must not be tempted by those who want say ""hey you should try this game"", This review is solely for the purpose of making sure people make the right choice. 

I am sorry I could not have said this sooner

But for those who are now thinking of downloading this game ask yourselves, ""Are you happy in life?"", if not, this game is probably for you.

Enjoy the game, thanks Gaijin for this interesting amalgamation of a wreck"

4383,"Overall I think  this is a good game, however it is not for anybody. It has high high's and low lows. Some matches are intense chess battles against opponents who are equal to you and is incredibly intense, and others result in you being dunked on by technology or simply mechanics that are totally not in your favor. I personally enjoy the game however there are also times I'm so annoyed I want to uninstall and never play it again. But I've not spent a cent on it and can live happy knowing that. The grind sucks but is possible. Overall I don't know who to recommend this too, just give it a try. 30 hours or so I'd say to tell if you like it or not"
4384,"It's a free game, and the detail they put into the vehicles is amazing. Yes, you eventually reach a point (varying by your skill level) where you will need to pay to advance further up the tech tree, but there is nothing stopping you from having free fun at the lower tech levels.

4403,"Do not play this game
It's addictive, but it's horrible. You will get dragged into it and you will suffer
Please do not make the same mistake I did

Matchmaking is absolutely horrendous. No skill based matchmaking, but tank rating based matchmaking. You will always get matched against enemies at the top of the ""Battle Rating"" difference, making you extremely underpowered. Premium tanks are incredibly OP in most cases

Map feel horrible. It's just open fields where you get spawn camped from 1 kilometer away

The physics make no sense. Your tanks are made of paper, your 102 mm armor gets penetrated by some piddly 50mm gun, at almost a straight line, not even an angle, and you just explode
While you hit someone directly into their side, scoring a critical hit, but they still keep on driving and shooting like nothing happens
Or you can't even penetrate a flat 50mm surface with your 88mm cannon 
It's absolutely the worst, least logical physics engine I have witnessed in a game.

If you do decide to play, it can be fun until tier 3 tanks. You get decent maps and battles in Tier 1 and 2. Tier 3 is abysmal. No matchmaking and nothing makes sense.
Lower tiers will make it seem like the game is fun. You can get kills, you can die, you can play the objective. ANd that will suck you in. Do not make the same mistake

BUT IF YOU'RE STILL IN THE MOOD... Just choose Russians. Literally no other faction matters. Russian tanks literally beat everything. They get best armor, and even if their armor seems weak, they get some sort of a magical protection. They absolutely dominate everything.
There are so many factions in the game, but Russians are the only actual useable faction. Incredible bias"

4413,"This game will cause you to lose sleep over the glaring issues with this game. You will have hit registration issues, ghost shells, balance problems, and just plain BS sometimes. You'll lost hundreds of hours grinding for a vehicle just for the tech tree to get moved around and now you have to research something else in order to get to your original vehicle you wanted. You'll die of fires and broken engines before unlocking the modules to fix those issues. You'll suffer at the hands of imbalanced gameplay that is justified by a spreadsheet and player statistics as well as vehicle winrates. You will be on the edge of your seat, playing for that next big rush of seeing ""Target destroyed"" on your screen and the neuron activation that results from it. You are playing the videogame equivalent of CBT and you will enjoy every second of the pain caused by being bombed from orbit, your ammo detonating in naval, and being hit by invisible missiles in air battles . You will suffer, you will have fun while suffering. Your soul will be sold to this game.

4589,"It'll become your 9-5 job

good game, don't listen to people who say it's pay to win. It is very grindy, yes, but you don't need to spend money to get better tanks/planes/boats, paying just makes it go faster. There are premium vehicles that you can get for the funny premium currency, but they are never really objectively better than other options. It can be very fun if you're with friends in a squad, especially in planes.
It will get frustrating in the mid tiers when all the nations discover that you can have round armour that stops bullets, or engines that can actually work, but it's pretty skill based in the end.

It's got pretty realistic physics, or rather, as realistic as a pvp WW2 sim can get. Armour penetration is a thing, tanks and boats don't have health bars but rather thick and thin armour depending on where you shoot the thing, and critical parts can be shot in planes like the engine, fuel tanks, oil coolers etc...

There are also simulator battles, these are better in planes but basically it's like realistic mode, but it's more, well, realistic. VR works in it too which is hecking awesome in plane battles since you are the actual pilot, and not some omipresent entity controlling what the pilot does.

Short explaination of the modes:
Arcade - Your crew is 100% efficient and you have visual aids like penetration crosshairs and longer range of spotting enemies.
Realistic - Your crew is 100% efficient and there are less visual aids; you still have ally player name tags but you go off your knowledge of how to penetrate tanks, and enemies are spotted when they are seen or marked by allies.
Simulator - Just like realistic but your crew are as efficient as you are yourself. There are minimal visual aids and no ally player name tags, so you must go off the knowledge of your tanks and planes in general.

P.S. T-34s are my arch enemy"

4618,"If I could describe what War Thunder has become in one short phrase, it would be ""An exercise in frustration"". 

I've been playing for 7+ years and the game state has progressively gotten worse as Gaijin has insisted on adding more content, or completely and needlessly overhauling its systems, instead of balancing and fixing what it has. What started out as an air battles game with a few nations and a few game modes, with vehicles from WWII and earlier, now has evolved to include ground forces, helicopters, coastal forces, and blue water forces, 3 game modes plus events, and 9 nations with vehicles all the way to current day. Under the correct conditions, this could be a major selling point- in fact, I think Gaijin uses it as such- but, there is a problem: War Thunder is a multiplayer game and there aren't enough players for the absolute glut of content. To ""fix"" this, the devs compressed the battle ratings, (what determines match making), and now it's entirely possible for a late World War II prototype tank to face a mid-Cold War vehicle with composite armor panels and ATGMs. 

Numerous other issues dot WT, the most game breaking of which usually are fixed in a few weeks (like hovering tracks blocking out your vision while aiming), but others persist for years; many are the result of Gaijin's own discontent with leaving well-enough alone. Volumetric shells and the universal penetration calculator were complete overhauls that threw the balance into chaos and took years to resolve. Mostly. The balance in ground forces, (what I play most), is still dubious, at best, with the same vehicles showing up time and again for the BR. Then, when you think you have one of these easy-mode targets dead-to-rights, War Thunder's most important feature kicks in: RNG.

Don't get me wrong, RNG is the spice of gaming, but WT got carried away and dumped the entire bottle. The RNG and balance issues are so legendarily bad that the suffering they cause are memes unto themselves. Ammo and fuel explosions? Random. The closer to black, the better the chance of an explosion, but there's no guarantee that they'll explode... likewise, a tiny bit of random damage can blow it up. Ricochets? Random to a very high degree. Penetration? Partially random. Destroying barrels and tracks? Because Gaijin made their destruction dependent on impact angle, and movement and server syncing can upset it- yeah, random, more or less. Combine all of this with long repair times in-game and higher ranked battles turn into repair simulators with a distinct sense that the game is trolling you.

This is actually just the tip of the iceberg of the games issues- for instance, the way games are designed to progress via points, along with the nature of match making, make most games horribly one-sided. You either stomp or get stomped. Good games are maybe 1-in-30. Still, the truly sad part is that it doesn't have to be this way. The core game is very good and extremely unique... it's just that the focus, as is typical with Free-to-Play and MMO titles, is more content-oriented over other issues. It needs fixing, it needs balancing; bigger maps for high BR and the decompression of the match making would do wonders. Also, keep in mind, I'm not bashing the devs, but the leadership. Should you choose to play this game, it won't take you long to appreciate just how much content is in it. That it works at all on the old engine it's based on is impressive, but the more content that's added, the harder it will be to truly refine."
4619,"the grind is absolutely atrocious, but the gameplay can sometimes be fun as a casual player; grab some friends to make the grind more bearable, and the game just a bit more fun. 

if games that take blood, sweat, and tears to grind don't fancy your niche, don't play this game. i've played for two years and i have not even reached top-tier; given constant breaks, however."
4620,.
4621,"Overall, it's a good game. I think that the fact that a greedy company owns the game must be accepted. The bugs and issues of the game, such as terrible battle rating(BR) balance, ""ghost shells"", and poor servers must be accepted. The complaints that others issue regarding the game are valid, but do not play the game in a way that mitigates these issues. Notably, not caring about any progression or specific vehicles. Surely the issues persist, but not caring to win the game and messing around with the vehicles at your disposal with friends is the BEST option available to all players. Destroying people in a 2.3 BR vehicle in a 6.0-7.0 BR match is simply put hilarious. In truth, messing around with the players could be the heart of the game, as most join to hate the company that owns the property. I think that a shift in how the game is played is more than likely better for the experience of playing the game as a whole. These words are naive, but the players can make the game more enjoyable. 
Note: It's not worth spending any money on a game that is already free. Sometimes the daily rewards of the game that serves as an incentive for the player to log on will provide multiple opportunities to gain in-game currency, both lions and eagles. So, you could gradually save up to a specific pay-walled vehicle or talisman."

4633,no plane tiddiess
4634,"Starting playing this game for tanks after leaving world of tanks because it was an incredibly problematic game. For some reason the developer thought it was a good idea to make planes playable in the tank gamemode, and being an online game it's the most toxic use of planes ever, diving straight down on top of your tank where you can die to a fighter in the most heavily armored tanks. The devs in their infinite wisdom decided that instead of removing planes, they should make the battle rating of the planes HIGHER than the tanks battle rating that you are playing. So occasionally you'll be playing late WW2-early cold war tanks and get killed by a fucking A-10. It's ridiculous. Get rid of planes in tank battles, get rid of artillery Gajin, you completely destroyed 9.0-11.0 match making because planes make it unplayable. People play ground battles to engage tanks in tanks, not get killed over and over again by fucking fighters."

4636,"A painful starting grind, but the attention to accuracy is usually very strong (I'm looking at you, Swedish reserve tanks with APDS), and it gets pretty fun once you're off the ground."
4637,"I played this game for 1068 hours on steam and an unknown amount before that, spent more than my fair share of money on the game buying premium time and premium aircraft, and all around just put time and energy into this game with multiple groups of friends, only to log on after a 2-3 week absence to find that my account has been perma banned.  It was stated that I had modified the game in a way that was against the user agreement despite the fact that I have never modified this game at any point in time in the entire time I have played this game. To have something like this happen to me is a major slap in the face. I would not recommend this game to anyone who has a problem with losing years of work due to no fault of their own."

4699,"This game can be incredibly frustrating and the learning curve coming from most other games is fairly steep, but it can be extremely rewarding and satisfying when you finally start to understand how the game really works. This game is super grindy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (personally, that's why I like it), just take into account that the 100+ hours review filter is not really any different than having zero filters. I have 620 hours on this game and I still feel like the majority of the player base that I interact with are more experienced and have more hours than me. With all the time I have spent on this game I still am only at BR 8.0-9.0, I have one 9.7 jet and nothing Higher. Tip for new players: get to know the game with one of the 3 main nations, and then play a smaller nation so that you can complain on the forums about balance issues without completely embarrassing yourself. Just kidding, you should probably stick to the main nations for while if you value fun, or want to reach top tier and have a life. Also playing f2p after BR 5.7 or 6.7 is extremely difficult and I would recommend either stopping there or getting some premium time/premium vehicles."

4712,"As much as I would like to say anything positive about the game in a broader spectrum, I really can't. With the 200+ hours on record, most of that time has more or less been torture in every sense of the word and I'll give you reasons as to why that is.

For whatever reasons unknown to me, I may be lacking historical context of the game as it tries to replicate the realistic part of history from WW1 to the Cold War, there is just problems in the game's mechanics and gameplay that ruin the experience for it. Once reaching the turning point of around 5.0-5.7 BR (if you are a diehard player you know what I mean) things hit the fan so hard that you might as well consider uninstalling the game once you get to it and here's why in one word: Germany.
The German tech tree is in a league of its own, ground vehicles in particular, aircraft have their own strong presence that to the ire of all players who vs German mains, the air firepower is manageable, it's the tanks that ruin it all. Each other country tech tree has it's own unique line of tanks that have strong frontal armor, which is fine, right? Most fights usually will either be forward, front plate vs front plate action or flanking and easy pickings from shooting through the side of the tanks. German tanks in forward combat is horrible to go up against, doesn't matter who you are as most of the tanks in the German tech tree can eat just about any bullet calibre from nearly any main cannon from prominent tanks in the US, Russia, and other tech trees, and spit it right back and kill you and one shot
AND let's not forget that even strong frontal armor tanks have said weaknesses that are reliable to use in dealing with them, long range is a different story but you get the point here, making most tech tree matchups manageable, till you start dealing with the god forsaken Panthers and Tigers, cause for some stupid reason, both of these tanks have stupid front plates that have small, weak spots that are impossible to know about unless you have friends who know how to deal with them as well as hit reliably.

Now lets strike the one thing that Gaijin can't seem to find an answer to, the game economy, I'm sorry but this is just tragic in its own right that if I could provide multiple work arounds to it here I would. But to keep it simple, it sucks and it sucks bad. In the current stage of the game while I make this review, progress is horribly slow now thanks to the reward system. Winning players all get 100% RP (research points) and i believe 47%(?) SL (silver lions) but losing players get only 1/3 of the RP. Let's give a better perspective:
5.3 matchup:
10 kills (ground), 1 air kill, 4 assists, 1 capture, X amount of deaths = roughly close to 4k RP if you are on the winning team
Losing end? Not even 2k
This is also where vehicles in the game are reaching a solid near 50k RP requirement to unlock for purchase and these metrics are estimates and not even consistent, you can achieve far less than that too, making the grind even longer and more painful.

Final thing: Matchmaking
Again, why? In one session of playing I've had 6, again 6, back to back uptiers (1.0 BR higher than your highest BR in your lineup) and the matchmaking is based off of only 2-3 players on your own team having those vehicle BRs in their lineup, how does that make any sense? With such a large playerbase how can I end up with 6 back to back uptiers in the game Gaijin? It makes it just horrible to face off against vehicles a full BR higher than you and expect a good outcome out of it, more often than not it yields a horrible match result. Again, if I could provide some plausible solutions to this here, I would but I will lay out some of the problems I have faced and encountered while playing this. If you want to play this game as a newcomer, you are going to have a painful time learning it, I know I would've if it had not been for my friends helping me from the start."
4713,very fun
4714,i have major issues with sudden FPS drop or frame drop to my gameplay i have been finding whats wrong with my PC  but theres nothing so i need help what is going on.

4716,tonk go brrrrrr
4717,"As of writing I have ~1,400hrs 
Rank 4 for USA, Germany, & Russia
Rank 3 Britain
Rank 2 Japan
Rank 1 Italy
Rank 3 Sweden

...So i have good overall experience with the game but not with higher Ranks, but much of what is endemic to War Thunder carries through...

Pros:
<TARGET DESTROYED>
Low tier battles are good
There are a some fun premiums you can get at reasonable prices

Cons:
Heavy Tanks are often useless in up-tiers and unstoppable in down-tiers
Some Nations have such terrible starting vehicles they will probably put you off from playing them at all (*cough* Italy *cough*)
Revenge Bombing
SPGs being too niche for most situations
WWII vehicles facing Cold War ones

THE REAL PROBLEMS:

Grinding becomes exponentially soul destroying with each passing rank

BR compression is completely unbalanced, should reasonably be </>0.3 br not 1.0

Some vehicles are blatantly at the wrong BR (ex; pvkv III is completely unusable after a 1.0 increase no one asked for)

Many unique vehicles are only attainable via coupons that may go for 100s of $

Grinding upgrades for vehicles is ludicrous. Too many vehicles start with dogshit stats, with rounds that are little more than pebbles while their br is based on a round that will take you an unknown but undoubtedly unfair number of hours to unlock, or will start with crippled engines.

Gameplay is fun for the first rank or two to draw people in only to grow more and more unrewarding and grindy to push people into buying GE.
SL economy and repairs become worse as well.
These issues are drip fed to the player in the hope they will have already become too invested in their sunk cost (if they have already dropped $ on WT) or to push people into buying vehicles and upgrades over time if they are struggling which they almost certainly will be.

4718,great game in general but the graphics make it way better
4719,idk
4720,kinda fun it gets very boring each time your plane gets shot down and the adds on youtube just show mordern stuff

I instantly knew it`s a Russian developer. They pretend to be from Hungary and You won`t find ""About us"" on their page."
4724,its ok just for the fact that my planes keep running out of ammo or jamming every 0.02 seconds!
4725,"this game is fun, so much was put into the game and I have a love hate relationship with this game. out of the 601hrs I have i have bought about 2-3 weeks worth of premium, which has maybe been about 200 hrs of my play time. I have put my time into the Great Britain planes, I have jets up to 9.3 tier. and USA tanks up to 6.0 tier. this game is free which i understand the must have some micro transactions to improve the game and pay staff. the gripe that I have with this game though is that it is EXTREMELY hard to progress without premium. when you get into higher tiers your vehicles repair cost starts to creep up more and more. and eventually around tier 6+ your repair cost can be quite large sum of silver lions (in game currency) to the point where in Air realistic battles you can kill 2 players at the same tier and get shot down your self and lose silver lions in the process. and it get even worse when you get into jets the amount of lions is so small compared to repair cost. I have a jet bomber that has a max repair cost of 15k silver lions, in one game of Realistic battle with premium ( give +50% more silver lions) you get about 5.5k silver lions per base you destroy, if the stars aline you can get 3 bases and earn about 16k silver lions. this is fine if you know how to avoid detection from other fighters which can take you out very easily in jet tiers. and i have a fighter that has a max repair cost of 17k silver lions and destroying an enemy play rewards about 5k silver lions. these tiers are extremely brutal and you have to kill 3 enemy vehicals at the same tier to not lose money if you get shot down this is pretty rare even if you are pretty good at the game. without premium its even worse, you can lose so much and have so little chance to gain. Again I understand that this is a free to play game and the need some sort of in game transactions to keep the game going. the difference between premium and non premium is night and day and often for me some days you can lose so much money in just a couple games. the game is fun, but if you are looking to play for absolute free don't expect to have alot of fun in the high tiers."

4728,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

4736,"I originally played this on the PS4 and I wasn't too great at flying the planes and would end up getting easily shot down by PC players. But now that I'm on PC, I'm the one doing the shooting down. 

I would recommend this game if you're into tanks, planes, boats and helicopters. It has good game play mechanics and is very easy to learn the controls. The game is constantly full of action and is fun to play on your own or with a bunch of friends.

There is a big grind to get new vehicles which can take days, weeks and months just to get one the higher up the tier levels you go which can get really tedious and tire you out, especially if you're not gaming all the time. Some require you to purchase them, but they don't relativity give the other player a huge advantage in the first 3 tiers as I was able to easily take them down within a few short bursts, but they do eventually give advantages the higher you go.

If you're just a casual player who is looking to play with a plane, boat or tank or someone who doesn't care about levelling up then staying in the first 3 tiers will be great for you since it's not much of a grind and there is still lots of actions.

But if you're the type of person who is more of completionist or wants to get to the top tiers, then I don't recommend this game to you as the grind is far too long and honestly from my opinion it is not worth it as you can have the same fun in the low levels. 

8/10 because of the grind."

4791,the game devs need to fix and implement balance in this game and removing the bias it will make the game atleast fun and playable for everyone to enjoy for sometime the issue is that theres just vehicles in the game that are overperforming to the point that almost no other vehicles could counter it and thats unfair and not fun and yes we already know what those vehicles are but atleast consider my opinion.

4804,"Complete Un-balaced GARBAGE

To start, I have 300 hours in this game, i am NOT even HALFWAY down a tech tree, although i have tried a couple nations. Unless you have thousands of dollars to throw at the devs, no matter what BR, what nation you play. Russian tanks just win, basically no matter what.

Due to the BR system, the game is practically unplayable at earlier tiers because you go up against people with thousands of hours in the game because they want to bully people with only low-tier. UPDATE: Today i have played roughly 20 games, EVERY SINGLE ONE i was either UP-tiered, meaning going up against LATE WW2, EARLY COLD WAR TANKS going against my sherman with 60mm of armor, or in the ONE GAME I was matched against tanks of my tier, I went up against a 4 stack of players with 55 DAYS on tanks EACH. I have less than 20 hours on tanks btw.

Not to mention the premium tanks that are just better, how can you say that the pay for tanks are not pay to win, when they are literally just a direct upgrade in every way to most of the tanks.



Dont even get me started on the ""REALISM"" they try to portray. Devs had said before they don't like having concept tanks in the game, such as the mighty german MAUS, UNLESS youre a russian player that is, then you have access to MULTIPLE ""CONCEPT"" tanks that NEVER have been produced, such as the basically in-penetrable IS-7 which if you even wanted to use would set you back a small fee of $1400 Yes you read that right. FOR A VIRTUAL TANK, THAT WAS NEVER CREATED.

All in all DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS unless your a millionaire or an UNBALANCED RUSSIAN user."

tanks
balanc arrmor that so tigers are scared of shermans, unrealistic br that u can play with cold wor rocket tanks agenst ww2 tanks taking 2,0br to 10,0br and troll it with it, maps from 2014 with flying trees, grass in buildings, small old maps from ww2 where u have to play with abrams and  u can play with ww2 tanks in modern era maps but they are some times too big on old tanks, premium trees biggers than normal trees, ctrl c ctrl v tanks like russia with t 34 85 they add this tank to china and name it t 34 85 gai they add it a russian mg on roof or chinas la 11 plane with original cocpit they didnt eaven reride texts to chinas language

planes
have same problem old maps where rivers are 5meaters under the beach lakes have pentagon shape with buged wather, random building and trees ai clips true buildings, fly or random stops AAS are just pit with original texture but deeper and addet static aa in to it all maps are still from 2014 where are trees, buildings, everiting on the ground made smaller to look planes goes faster planes in this game goes slower  then normaly 

i dont want people to play this game until they balance the game for modern era and br bcos it doesnt make sence when tank from 1944 fight tank from year 61 and the newest one is on lower br (marder 7,3 1961/ leopard 7,3 1957/ maus 7,7 1944/ pershing 6,7 1944 can be in one battle and marder have missiles leopard heats and sabots but maus and pershing have basic shells

4941,Have you ever played a game that made you want to rub your balls against a cheese grater?
4942,"This game is a lot of fun, very realistic and historically accurate. There really is no game that comes close to this. The major drawback is that the economy in this game just sucks. This is probably the devs just trying to make more money. Essentially you have to get 3 kills in order to make a profit once you get into third tier of your tech tree. Once you get into that third tech tree, it takes forever to research your next plane/tank/ship, and then it costs so much that once it is researched you have to play more games in order to gain the money to buy it. Gaijin, if you are reading these reviews, please make the economy in this game more practical. Otherwise its a really great game."
4943,F*** Warthunder.
4944,"Fun if you can dig into the dirt and grind this game. Lots of playing is required to get better tanks, but still fun."

4973,This is the worst fucking game on my hard drive.
4974,"After 720 hours I can truthfully say this game scratches an itch like no other. However, after a year of updates this game has gotten worse and worse with economy changes that have turned it unplayable. If you can get your fill out of the game until 7.3BR I would recommend it. 7.3+ however even with premium account status the game is punishing and un-enjoyable. Do not waste your time on a ""free game"" that is punishing even to those who pay for the premium account status. (unless your a Russian main :P )"

5012,this game is very good and would recommend for all!(I am slowly losing my sanity playing this game)
5013,"I’ll be honest… this game was really fun to play with friends, but the grind, it’s too long for me. I feel like there was just too much updates to even get to even get to the F-14, because by then they’d release the F-22 Raptor. Yes, it’s a F2Play game but, I honestly just given up. It’s a good game, shame we can’t fly the jets or earn them fast enough."
5014,it's a very good game

5016,Playing on console unfortunately ive gotten an addiction to it now and spent money. Honestly i think id have a better time talking to an autistic grape then play this game with sanity
5017,Pain ;-;
5018,"very fun game, it requires a lot of grinding but otherwise it is very fun and i enjoy playing it."
5019,dont play this game
5020,"I really don't enjoy spending a few minutes going to a spot just to get blown up by someone I couldn't see, just do it all over again. Yet, I keep coming back to it hoping that I won't get blown up this time... When it's fun it can be real fun. But unless you're really trying to be good, it is hard to have an enjoyable casual experience. It does get addictive though... I find the low-tiers are most fun. But the game doesn't really give you any good incentives to play those tiers."
5021,honestly good
5022,"This game has its ups and downs

Ups:
#Once you find a tank/plane/ship its really fun
#It Is really good on low grade pc's
#Pretty well balanced
#You choose how to play, and don't have to learn a completly new skill set to play. Want to support your team taking points fast and getting to the back and stoping the flow of enemies on the battle feild, be a light tank, Torpedo Boat, Or fighter. Want to hold points, take out others in one hit? Be a heavy tank, bomber, or battle ship.
#Game gives you a challenge

Downs:
#Its a grind to get to a plane/tank/ship you want, boosters don't help much, and its a long time before you get to even WW2 tanks.
#Not exactly pay to win but, it is incorged a lot.
#When you get up tired, you get up tired, you go from a sherman fighting Panzer 4s, to trying to take on two tiger Ds. 

Overall:
Good game, long grind, better with friends, and over all fun once you find how you like to play."
5023,"The game has gotten grindier over the years as they've actually lowered the amount of RP you get each battle. They've also been adding more vehicles in the middle (not at the end where many might not care if they're there) of the tech trees. Additionally, Air RB has gotten sort of BS with how little time you have to play each battle. For reference, battle time was 45min a couple years ago. There's also no historic matchups at all anymore (this one is mostly a personal gripe). It feels like the player skill level has dropped at low battle ratings. Landslide victories seem to happen a lot more. Battle ratings aren't done well for some vehicles and there's compression, meaning you get vehicles you can't deal with at the upper levels a lot of the times. It's an issue for all vehicle types apart from ships. Speaking of ships, game modes aren't well done and ship gameplay is basically just W keying towards the enemy and shooting/torping. AA cannons are king for coastal boats and anything larger is basically a slugfest at range. Maps for all gamemodes haven't been updated in years and they don't introduce new maps for current generation vehicles. All the maps are sized for at most early Cold War era vehicles & anything past that can snipe spawn. Even aircraft get WW2 era maps in late jets a lot of the time, despite the fact that you get to the operating area within a minute or two. There are probably a lot more issues I forgot about, but they compound into a pretty unenjoyable experience, even despite the fact that I've played for years. Can't recommend as someone that has thousands of hours outside of Steam, even though it's basically the only game in it's class."

5032,fun ngl
5033,Good game.
5034,this game takes some time to get used to and starts off slow with a lot of losses (could be individual experience) however once you learn the controls and vehicle handling this game is very fun! its graphically sound and has well thought out damage effects. its also easy to just squeeze a quick round in. great for if you have a lot of time or a very brief amount of time.
5035,"There is no forward progression unless you have years to waste, or a fat wallet.
Avoid at all costs.

The gold-standard of predatory games."
5036,"This game requires more things then what it says,

- 2,000 GB of storage
- One Soul of the living
- Your time and money
- Your life"
5037,War thunder is one of those games that if you get killed your friends will call it a skill issue when in reality its just LUCK.
5038,its fun its a good game well made and that but if your not going to sink in hundreds of hours you wont get even close to high their (modern vehicles) even tho most of the war thunder ads are about modern vehicles.
5039,you probably hate yourself if you play this game!
5040,"if you like explosions, you might enjoy this game"

5042,Not a single game I've ever played pisses me off as consistently as this one. Definitely recommend.
5043,"For that it being a free game this is fantastic, just amazing. There is only 1 downside of which I can think of, and that is: that you have to play it a lot to unlock new ships, planes, tanks, etc. But a clear recomendation from here."
5044,dogfights are addicting (with airplanes not puppies)

5066,this game is for big tank people and is a fun game to put hours into would recommend to other tank lovers
5067,"The game is good  im not gonna lie on that, has great graphics great design   but if you wanna play it be prepared to spent a lot  a lot of time in  game. Game play will make it hard for you to get far since its economics, XP, that you earn in mission are low if you want something done you gotta do their near impossible assignments to get a tiny bit  of silver lions and to get throught the season passes gotta do even more annoying assignments to get a tiny reward that is separated by other rewards that you can only get if you buy premium in the season pass the vehicles arent that maneuverable at the start you got to modify them to get a decent mobility in them takes a long time to fully mod a vehicle the snail in this game puts so much pressure on  you to buy premium in that manner gaijin makes a profit on everything new packs, premium planes console games, and even silver lions in fact ""THERES NOTHING FREE IN THIS GAME"" ""YOU WANNA WIN PAY AND PAY A LOT"" gaijin just care about profit just another EA in my point of view.

AFTER 1558.7 HOURS IM STILL PLAYING IT AND IT IS STILL SHIT AND I HATE IT"
5112,DO NOT PLAY IT ITS TOO ADICTIVE (kinda fun tho but still I wouldnt reccomend)
5113,"Good:
Game for many hours of gameplay. Game is more fun in party with friends. Mostly unique nations (some vehicles are copy pasted). Every aircraft, tank. ship (except discontinued vehicles) are obtainable with Free2play account. I only invested 7 euros just to buy 20d premius time (only research and currency booster). You can earn Gaijin coin through events and selling event items (some are more grindy). Main price from events are around 60 GJN which is 1x 60 euros premium pack with vehicles and premium time. Premium vehicles and time will ease your grind with nations.

Bad:
Few things unbalanced. Major bugs like ghost shell and desync are still present. Devs are braindead when buffing/nerfing stuff. Repair costs dont make sense. F2P - players are not that good/competetive. Aircrafts, ships and helicopters have their own gamemodes but tanks have to play mixed battles with aircrafts where players will just kamikaze revenge kill you with bombing aircraft.

Overall:
Good F2P game to play with friends. You can get bit competetive in some squadrons. No need to invest huge pile of money into this game (PLEASE DO NOT) but some do. You will find low level players without skill and knowledge of the game using premium vehicles on high tier degrading team PvP a bit.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

5148,"Welcome to BugThunder, now with stuttering to ruin your experience even further. If you want to play this game for the ground battles, forget about it. I mostly played ground battles, so I'm gonna talk just about them. They are quite literally the most painful part of the game. Beyond the fact that players can put giant bushes onto their tanks, the balance is awful. Especially when it comes to less popular nations like France. But the icing on the cake which will make you throw your mouse and break your keyboard are planes. You will get bombed back to your garage once enemy players get salty or run out of tanks almost every game. And there's little to nothing you can do about it, especially in low ranks where anti-aircraft vehicles have their crew completely exposed and their firepower can't outmatch the planes' firepower and manoeuvrability. (R e a l l y neat way to convince new players to keep playing your game. /s) And even if they don't bomb you, the plane's engines will scream above your head for the entire second half of every game no matter where they are in the sky, thing which completely ruins the experience and also gets in the way of hearing the engines of the vehicles around you on the ground. Besides all of that, bugs and shitty mechanics will be a thing every game session. Tank shells disappear in thin air when shooting at certain small parts on enemy vehicles like machine guns or side skirts (because Gaijin is too lazy to not make them physical objects on which shells bounce and waste all of their penetration). There's also the chance of enemy tanks randomly disappearing for a second or two, but that happens very rarely. The stuttering problem is relatively new and, for the love of God, I hope they prioritize fixing it. That's about all I have to say. I hope ya'll enjoy trying out the game tho, it does have its good parts."

5159,"Expect to rage and don't expect to get trough a tech tree without buying golden eagles, panzer 3 tracks can block 75mm AP rounds and its pay to win. however its pretty fun from 1.0 to 2.5. having tanks planes boats and helicopters in one game with great graphics on console and PC for free is amazing, it's also fun with friends.

5213,"BEWARE:

NOT FUN FOR NEW PLAYERS!!! 

War Thunder allows Seal Clubbing. The game allows level 100 players to match up against level 10 players. It's serious abuse, and WT can stop it via their match maker. Let the level 100 players play each other and allow the new players to actually LEARN how to play rather than die near instantly after spawning. 

Players with 1,000's of hours of battles should NOT be pitted against someone who is trying to learn the game.

5216,"A fun and skilled/luck based game with a toxic yet fun community. The worst is for sure the grind however in my opinion the best is low to mid tier so I dont mind that much. Dont expect modern or even cold war when you first get this because unless you use real money you got years ahead of interwar and WW2 of tanks and planes. However even with its faults, cant knock it too much, its free after all and compared to World of Tanks, I dont regret staying here. Learning about what to shoot, where to shoot, where and when to drop bombs and rockets. Its something else and get such a dopamine rush seeing those burning wrecks with 8 kills and 0 deaths. I can't guarantee you'll have a great time, even at 1.5k hours I still don't at times but those moments that you actually do it. Bouncing shot after shot, kill after kill, feel like a true tanker or pilot is something else. This will be a game you either fail and quit or fail and become the next addict for the snail."

It also provides you with mostly incompetent teammates who will make you mad, ruin your game and your service record. There is many more aspects that makes this game disappointing like the maps, mechanics, Golden Eagles, and etc but overall, avoid this game at all cost."

suddenly takes ~3-5mins to enter a god damn battle sure it wouldnt be bad but your being thrown into random matches with no way to choose gamemodes no way to decide maps no way to understand what the hell any settings means all more stuff like changing crews? mate i wanna fly around PvP shoot eachother not sit and determine wtf a silent ammo does?

5299,"I can't recommend this game due to it's excessive grind and micro transactions. The developers have created a system of inconveniences that they then offer a means to pay to get through moderately quicker. The game quickly becomes more about the grind of progress, the grind to unlock new content over just having fun playing a great game for what it is. I want to have fun just playing this game and enjoy it for what it is but it's hard to do that when progress is so sooooo slow. I feel like I'm a wallet to Gaijin, they're dangling a carrot of fun for me but it's always just out of reach. But It could be closer if I just paid them money to bring it closer. It's a shame. The game is really good but their profit model is absolutely broken and it holds the game back so much in my opinion."
5300,"Okay the tanks are not a problem in a battle but the planes are still a problem to fly i dont know why is the game doing this but if i fly in a plane then its like im glitching

5323,im so fucking bad at the game (I FUCKING LOVE TANKS)
5324,Not very fun.
5325,"While there's plenty of vehicles to grind and play, the grind to get there is absolutely insane.
Not only do you need to gain Exp to unlock new vehicles, you also need to buy them with in-game money(SL). Nothing wrong with that, however, depending on the vehicles you play you need to do really well to not lose SL. Gajin also patches the economy to be progressively worse - the same vehicles now loose money overall rather being at a comfortable repair price.

Fun game overall, but way too much grind to recommend to anyone."
5326,"the ""give us all your money"" kind of game"
5327,every action i take in this game i stray further and further from god
5328,this game is really cool all the planes are super fun to fly and the tanks to drive around the vehicle design and sound is really good to. Playing with friends is also great because they have custom battles or you could even versus your friends for a free game its really good i would even pay money to play.

5331,meh
5332,very good community hardly any bugs an always feels like youve earned something when you get a new tank plane or ship
5333,a bad game unless you want to waist your time and money grinding to top tier just to find out that the rewards at top tier is straight dog water and you wont even to be able to play without losing silver lions unless you are just a blessed by gijen and are a god at this game. also very unbalanced and just really bad over all but i still play cause im stupid

5343,"the reason i would recommend war thunder is because of how fun it is to progress and how fun it is to grind for better planes, tanks and other stuff, but i will say that it is very hard if you dont know what you are doing so i would recommend that you watch a video for just tips and tricks. also dont be afraid play around a little and find you're play style"
5344,dude i love this game!!!!!
5345,"i have committed many many murders

It is very fun, if you like pain and death"

Don't play, don't waste your mental health on this crap.

5367,"Cool game, there are a few bugs there and there, but a cool game, the only massive problem, the grind and sweat to reach the max tier, after you complete planes and tanks, helicopters... a fun but long game, which can turn a normal man into a toxic if the conditions are right, just remember not to mess with heavy tanks when you are are med or a light tank!

5376,Best free flight simulator ever which you dont need a vr for even tho one is compatable
5377,"Not recommended. If you're looking for a game with proper balance, this isn't it. Gaijin are notorious for pay to win games. However, the game play seems entirely random. By random i mean: shooting a light tank with a tank destroyer 7 times with nothing but critical and regular hits, only for the light tank to repair, adjust its turret, and destroy me first hit. I've hit tanks in the green area for criticals, and I've hit tanks in the red areas (Do not shoot, too much armor) for one shot kills. The game is entirely random and I've died in one hit more to players who paid for elite tanks, than I have to players who play entirely free. In other words, the creators lean more toward players who will pay for their in-game extras (though I don't blame them for doing so, money runs the world). Each update seems to become less and less balanced, hens the randomness. Planes can kill tanks very easily in ground battles, but in air battles, you barely do any damage to ground targets. While flying planes, any pilot with an elite aircraft will have no problem picking you off. You can throttle down, menouver as much as you want, one they are behind you, there is no shaking them. Pilots and ground crew alike will pass out or become knocked out even if the shell or bullet clips an area of your vehicle that makes no sense, ie: A shell ran through the back corner of my vehicle and went all the way through, killing just the loader sitting in the back. This resulted in my entire crew getting knocked out somehow? A bullet clipped my aircraft's landing gear and my pilot passed out? A tank shell bounced off the bottom of my tank and into the ground, knocked out my entire crew without actually penetrating the tank? What i'm saying is, sure, real war is most likely pure luck, so if you enjoy dying from pure luck, this is your game. But if you want something more balanced, this isn't it. You will be shaking your head in confusion more than anything else per game hour."
5378,its cool planes go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
5379,this game is fun I am 12 hours in and I can say that I am enjoying it it has the option to pay to get items but to enjoy the game you do not need to buy them it will just take a lot longer to get them

5389,Game was fun.
5390,kind of cash grabby but eh still pretty fun
5391,this game is epik but if you want a life then dont play it this game will swallow your soul
5392,"can be very fun, but you have to slog all the hard times to get there. but it is worth it ,played on xbox and moved to pc and the controls are very easy to learn recommend advanced keyboard for aircraft. can have times where it feels you should have killed someone but that's just gijian unfortunately but most of the time it works to some degree, give it a chance  it is a fun game"
5393,War Thunder? More like Fart Thunder hahahahahahhahahhahahahha! Itzthompsen will probably like this one.
5394,Didn't like the updates. Old version was better.

5403,"1 frame per second dogshit. I was trying to game all night on war thunder because i love planes and bombs and things of that nature, this guy called master bates is homosexx"
5404,tank go boom
5405,I originally played on Xbox. And it wasn't bad! But the only really thing you play was the tanks. But boy oh boy PC is where its at! Flying is so smooth! Tanks are so much easier to aim! I think my absolute favorite part about WT is its not pay to win. I love how the B.R system keeps aircraft level in the same playing field. The game would be chaos if you had Tom Cruise in a dog fight with the Wright Brothers lol! Get the game! Its free to download so you have no excuse not give it a try!
5406,"Great Graphics
Everything has great damage models
Actually fun
Grinding is slow but worth it"
5407,"this game wants me to murder people.
get ready to give your life away to the snail.
and every time you play you're gonna thing to kill yourself.
this game is free to play because you pay with your soul.
first advice, PRAY TO THE SNAIL GODS."

For a game that is supposed to be all about realism. It has none.
If real life was like this game, WWII would of been shit boring, as EVERY form of armed vehicle would be stopped by a gentle slope. Doesn't matter what the terrain looks like, can't go up it.

If you like close games, that never happens here. Either stomp or be stomped. Just lumped into games with the first 19 other players that want to play. No concept of balance."

5436,"Great game! If the shower is too bad, then waste time on this! overall, great game"
5437,"To best describe this game in my opinion would either be A) Cock & Ball Torture or B) a free to play in disguise. What do I mean by both? Well for A it depends on who you are playing as a nation, your patience and lastly how much money you are willing to spend. If you are a new player choosing Japan as a F2P player you are going to want to uninstall in about 3 days. On the other Hand if you are one of the big 3 (USA, Russia, Germany) and spend about 60 dollars it will be relatively painless*. Why? Well for starters War thunder is not a beginner friendly game, pro players are able to get into matches with new players which is not a fun time, not saying there should be the ungodly system known as SBMM but there should be a limit on how many tanks a pro should be able to take into the field. Second, any nations that aren't the big 3 except for china are mostly disregarded by the devs so balancing is bad with them and some of the trees are disorganized, empty, or have bad BR gaps. Lastly and linking to B this game is not meant to be a F2P, the devs intended almost every player to get at least 1 premium top tier tank, it is mentally straining to play the game spending no money due to how P2W it is. If you are planning to play this or get back into it I would highly recommend buying a premium tank from top tree."

For everyone else, who is playing ANYTHING ELSE that is not russian army you are just wasting your time. 
The russian bias was a long live meme going on in this community, however since 2020 it became to be real thing and you are going to find it the hard way once you invest hundreds of $ and hours into the game. 
Russia has:
The highest win rate at top tier (and many other tiers besides).
The most vehicles.
The lowest repair costs.
Some of the best vehicles in their class (MiG-23MLD, MiG-27K, Ka-52, Tunguska, etc).
Even when they don't have a best in class vehicle, they are still very competitive (T-80BVM).
Artificial buffs to soviet vehicles, such as the lack of spall on top tier tanks.
Completely under tiered vehicles like the BMP-2M and PT-76-57.

History has shown us time and time again that people, even within large organisations, do not always behave rationally.
The Russian government is a totalitarian state, their interference cannot be ruled out. War Thunder serves as an excellent tool for propaganda, it wouldn't do well for the Russian military if it appeared weak. Speculation, but one based on sound logic.

I am not the one complaining about balance in the game often, but when it comes to such ridiculous length then i cannot be bothered to play this sht anymore."
5484,"[h1] Is War Thunder worth your time? [/h1]

[b] Well that depends on what you're looking for... [/b]
So if you don't mind time-sink MMO's, then you may be in the ball park here per say, cause you should not come into this game expecting a quick time investment, this is for all intents and purposes a long form game, like WOW as an example, you will not be able to complete this game without years of investment put into it. Though you can play this game more casually, it should also be understood how difficult it is, and how time consuming it can be to grind up a tech tree. That all said, you also need [u] enjoy the gameplay. [/u]

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The game is simple, relatively speaking, theres multiple gamemodes, but as I am mostly a ground player (realistic) I will be speaking from that front, with my limited time in air battles I can say that its definitely what the game was created around, and may be more your speed compared to ground, its a lot faster paced than ground usually, at least in arcade battles, Realistic air battles feature one-life gameplay, meaning you die, you leave, while arcade lets you use your full lineup. 
[b] Speaking of lineups [/b] in this game you unlock vehicles to fight with, you do this by accumulating enough research points for a vehicle of your choosing in the tech tree, its like a skill-tree looking system, you then buy it with the games free currency, silver lions. Vehicles get more expensive and grindy the further you go up, with the technology and time period advancing from pre-ish Ww2 to modern day mbt's. Once you buy a vehicle, you also have to buy that vehicles modifications, a vehicle is basically terrible without them so... Better grind em' up! I consider buying a vehicle, buying half of its effectiveness, you have to grind the rest of the vehicles maximum effectiveness by purchasing its modifications, these also add to vehicle repair cost, every time a vehicle is destroyed you have to repair it, these can get insanely expensive, and often lead you to not making any progress cause of how expensive they are... You can buy premium time to make more rewards per match to make up for this, with real money.

Naval is kind of dead, but you can still likely find matches for it, theres also helicopters so thats something, mind you those are insanely grindy of themselves...

However, the game is simple, you have objectives to go fight for and defend, you get punished very intensely for making mistakes, in fact, if you screw up simply by mispositioning whether in air or ground, its very common you'll just die... In ground often times in one shot. Do not enter this game expecting tanks to be tanky, you should behave like a squishy boy, even if you're in a heavy tank. The games vehicles are all ranked, higher ranks meaning advancements in history and thus usually better vehicles, you can get uptiered at least 2 tiers up from where you are... So thats uh, frustrating, this game is frustrating, using a realism vehicle damage module, meaning you have to either destroy the vehicle or pick the crew out, every part is present in a vehicle and can be destroyed, in ground you usually will find the crew knockouts or ammo ignitions are the most common ways of death dealing. Arcade is recommended for beginners, realistic in my opinion is basically the real game though, but to each their own. You will struggle with this game at first, not knowing where to shoot people to kill them, and the game can be janky as hell on occasion. Map design usually sucks, with enemies firing into your spawn from [u] THEIR [/u] spawn.

[h1] Is it pay 2 win? [/h1]

Kinda? Not really? Depends, but to say throwing money at the game will not give any advantage isn't true, but to say its egregious is also not true, it varies from circumstance to circumstance honestly. But to explain.

Gaijin likes money, so of course they'll do the typical game company thing and release a new shiny, op vehicle, and of course to get it you have to spend golden eagles, the games premium currency you get by spending real money. Besides packs and all that you buy and steam, you'll be able to purchase premium vehicles that make the grind easier with better rewards, you also don't have to buy any modifications for your vehicles. They'll then nerf these vehicles after. Theres also bushes, the most obvious pay to win mechanic in the game, they really are that deceptively good, you buy them with real money, put them on your vehicle, sit in a tree line with some bushes, and you are essentially invisible, bonus points for turning your engine off. You can also use bushes to cover up your vehicles weakpoint, or mask its front profile, making it difficult to destroy, more so than usual depending on vehicle. This is either as frustrating as it sounds, or MORE frustrating than it sounds. 

[h1] Conclusion? [/h1]

Try it yourself, its free, but consider the points in the review, if you like the game, I'd say its really not so bad. I wish I could give a maybe recommendation, but I'd say if you like grindy MMO-like games and war vehicles, and the realistic styled mechanics are your cup of tea, then yeah I'd recommend it.

[b] Pros [/b]
[*] Unique gameplay systems
[*] Lots of vehicle variety
[*] Lots of nations to choose from for all your nationalist needs.
[*] Active community and dev team
[*] Very good graphics
[*] Can be very fun and satisfying like no other game in some cases.
[*] Game is well optimized, and servers are usually good.
[*] I've hardly seen cheaters present in this game
[*] Lots of nice in-depth mechanics

[b] Cons [/b]
[*] Grindy 
[*] Pretty bad sound design
[*] Predatory monetization 
[*] Can be insanely frustrating
[*] Can be addictive, which could also sort of be a good thing.
[*] Minor pay to win features
[*] Lopsided dev additions, Naval staying kind of ignored, minor tech trees not getting the attention the major ones get despite already being the best tech trees in-game.
[*] Balance can be kind of a state of mind, aka, poo.
[*] Players can be pretty toxic, worth mentioning.
[*] Servers and optimization as said before, can be really good, but sometimes its trash, and its frustrating as heck.
[*] Ground battles specifically, has this terrible balancing between aircraft and ground vehicles, you can play both, and honestly aircraft can be great, like getting a Maus in a 6.7 match, a vehicle so unbalanced you can't even get it anymore! You can bomb it to avoid it just carrying the match... Though usually aircraft don't fit in well, and they feel more like a F-U button, like a random punch in the back of the head, and they just aren't balanced for ground, SPAA's, which can shoot them down, and other countermeasures are not as effective as they could be in terms of taking them down, so I think I need to mention that for ground mode specifically, they have been the result of MOST of my grievances with the game in all honesty."
5485,PLEASE NEVER GET THIS GAME IT HAS DRAINED HOURS OUT OF MY LIFE AND MAKES ME WANT TO SHIT IN MY MOUTH EVERYTIME I SEE MY SILVER LIONS AND THE RESEARCH OF MY TANK  P L E A S E end my suffering.
5486,Pretty game. Fun to play in short stints but to get anywhere with unlocking vehicles you need to make it your second life. Thus it feels most of the vehicles and thus most of the game will always be unobtainable.
5487,There is still quite a bit of hacking in the arcade version of the game which goes on like nothing matters.  It's strange.
5488,For free pretty good game
5489,not so fun
5490,Affirmative!
5491,"this is the worst game i've ever played. first of all you can just buy a fucking jet as soon as you start the game(totally not p2w) just buy silver lions and golden eagles to research every single plane in existence. And when playing, everyone on my team and the enemy has some fucking mach 5 jet and they have every possible advantage over a flying sheet of scrap metal from 1945. This game would have been better if it wasn't majorly p2w. And if in games my opponents and team actually had planes closer to what i have or all similar to each other and also including skill based match making this game might actually be fun like it was for the first hour of playing."

5501,"save yourself, this game isnt free to play, it doesnt just cost you money to grind a tech tree to top tier to your abrams, T-90s, it also costs your sanity becasue if you dont have money for premium, it will take you YEARS.

 it is suffering, 90 percent of the game is suffering because you get uptiers, which are just fighting more powerful tanks than you are currently in. also, bushes becasue gaijin only says that they are ""cosmetic"" even though if a tank is completelly still in a tree line, from a distance you will not see them, 

gaijin makes alot of bad decisions , like economy and br chancges, they can move a tank up a tier even though its useless, and bring down a tank that is absolutelly OP

to sum up: please release me from this suffering im addicted to this game and i am suffering at the same time please help"

5506,"A very good game ruined by one of the most horrendous grinds ever conceived in video game history. You basically need a magnifying glass to see your progress bar fill up after a good match in a tier 5 game, even with a premium account things don't really get any better. To get any sort of decent progress you need to open up your wallet and spend hundreds if not thousands of euros. If you're a regular wage cuck I would avoid this like the plague."

5517,"The game is filled with bugs that devs do not care to fix.
Opening a support ticket is a waste of time because support proceeds to ignore what you tell them and continues with classical ""update the graphics driver, verify integrity, allow it through the firewall, block background programs"" and other pattern BS that:
a) Never works.
b) Keeps getting repeated even when you tell the support in advance that you've already done all that.

As for the gameplay itself - it is awesome at first...
... and then you start playing at the higher tiers.

You'd expect noobs to camp in corners on lower tiers, but no. It is the opposite.
The utterly grindy economy model forces players to preserve tanks in order to earn in-game currency that allows you to progress. The result? Well.

Camping is gameplay.
Baseraping is the only tactics of the winning team.
Playing alone is a waste of resources and time because you'll get ganked by 4-player-squad clan butt-buddies 10/10 times.

That's it. Skill play is locked to first 2 (lowest) tiers. You can actually experience enemies making maneuvers there, the gameplay is vivid and based around skill and realtime decision making.

You'll experience the best the game has to offer within 2 days of playing the game. Then you can delete it and downvote on Steam.

Hoozah."

5545,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Besides the unbalanced Battle Rating system and some of the more pay to win premiums, the bare bones of this game are fairly pathetic. Server connection issues, random crashes, an unorganized and sloppy UI. I know the game is free to play but the grind is excessive, both in terms of vehicles and crew leveling. It's as if the developers said, Hey! I got a great idea. No one else is making tank/air/sea games, so lets make one! And then proceed to do nothing with it because you have no competition. I have a habit of staying away from Eastern European devs as they have a tendency to have a sub par skill set and a greedy mindset. Bohemia, BSG etc"

5573,"I had a hard time saying yay or nay definitively, but the game is actually well done and generally not buggy.
And it is frustrating at times, but the game is fun. Grindy, but the actual game play can be a great time. 

The monetization is aggressive, and kind of ass. 
It's not pay to win explicitly, but its definitely pay to play. If you aren't paying for premium etc, and decent at the game, you can easily go backwards. 

Lastly, if you played on anything prior to steam, do some research before playing on steam. i can only assume due to monetization, in a bid to curb exploits etc. the linking of accounts is a pain in the ass if you aren't looking into prior to logging in the first time. It works, but it would be nice to see a big warning on the front screen. This is especially true if you tried it on console and switched to PC."

5624,"please for the love of all that is holy, undo the changes you have made which allow for russian and chinese tanks to be forces of reckoning. in no way could an ztz99 rule the battlefield filled with Abrams tanks. this game still has a few kinks bug-wide, and the occasional time they come up , they limit your ability to enjoy the game. the t-34 definitely can bounce cold war tank shells and doesn't break down what so ever. the a 10 has titanium armour, yet can be completely mutilated by any rank 1 russian SPAA just by shooting the engines, which for some ridiculous reason have no armour to protect them from anything, even though the real life aircraft can perform almost unspeakable actions in the air. this game supports the prejudice behind russian and chinese makeshift tanks and aircraft, and makes a fool out of almost every vehicle from the strongest nations across the globe. this game has flipped its logic upside down for no apparent reason, and allows the most historically ineffective vehicles to thrive in cartoonishly tough situations, including bouncing shells from the american t 95, t-26 and almost every Sherman variant in the entire game, including every nation. the russian tree is overpowered just so people play it. its almost not fun to get kills in russian vehicles, which shows how biased they are showcased to be. the chinese tree is a poor excuse for a new tech tree, let alone a unique nation. china's military technology id in no way independent and primarily relies on the plagiarised designs and technological advantages of the superior nation, which somehow are almost obsolete in game, simply because they just cant take on enemies from opposing trees, especially russia and china. my opinion is not to be seen as anti-communist or racist, even though i strongly disagree with the way communist countries are sustained. nothing in the world is perfect and you cant have a double sided coin, but at least give a microscopic effort to fix these phenomena. this game is no longer historically accurate when speaking in terms of any given vehicles combat effectiveness. russian and chinese vehichles are obscurely strong compared to the vehicles that match their BR, and it makes me, and so many others disappointing from what i know i am able to reasonable assume."

The game is horribly flawed in every way imaginable but it still draws you in and leaves you wanting to come back for more simply because its a very unique experience. You have similar titles like WoT, DCS, IL2, etc, but they don't offer the same variety of gameplay or selection of vehicles and they're either too arcadey or way too technical. Only Warthunder lets you fight an M1A2 in a T-35 landship, while getting strafed by an A10A, ATGM'ed by an AH-1S Kisarazu, and bombarded by a Deutschland class ship."

5657,"It is a really fun game. I tend to stay to Arcade Battles but there are ""Realistic Battles"" that are, well..., more realistic. I am coming from World of Tanks. War Thunder is a great competitor to World of Tanks. Tanks actually die when you shoot them in the right spots. No bologna with shots ""Critical Hit""-ing your opponent. As long as you can understand the tier-ing system in War Thunder (there are inbetweens from 1 to 2 and that a 1.3 tier will perform ""poorly"" in a 2.3 tier match, you'll do great! 

tl;dr the tanks drive like go karts and it is awesome!"

But 20 seconds of repairing from a single shot and getting 1 shot is realistic sure, but not what I came to play arcade mode for. Its a fun game sometimes but most of it is just a painful experience. If you're up for the grind go ahead but for most people, its just going to cause stress."

5688,Gud geim
5689,"TL;DR, dont play this game unless you hate yourself like 99% of the players that also play this game

There is not really anything positive to say about the game other than that it is the only Tank game on the market that is even worth playing since all other competitors just have infinitely worse in-game systems and gameplay mechanics (looking at you World of tanks and your 'spotting' and 'stealth' systems). For instance, it is easy to tell Devs put no effort into balancing maps, to be specific, spawn locations. The only thing that seems balanced in this game is the Gun/shell systems. There is no spawn protection or anything to stop the enemy team from killing you as soon as you pop into the game. If your team loses the first battle from the initial spawn for a match there isn't a point in continuing to play a match since the enemy team will push your spawn and get into positions to shoot at your spawn before you have a chance to respawn and take a proper position to not get shot at in spawn. It seems that EVERY SPAWN location in this game is in AN OPEN FIELD often times can be shot at from several locations from elsewhere in the map. This is a serious design flaw in any of WT's maps. Why not add cover to the spawns? buildings? ruins? Anything? There just is no way to justify this poor design choice. It's hard to believe that this game is almost 10 years old and the devs can't design any quality maps or balance them properly.

5713,good game if you got time and patience takes a while play russian if you want to do well
5714,Good game.
5715,GRIND IS REAL in this game if you are an average free to play gamer and not a pay to win gamer
5716,"First of all, the ""free to play"" tag is a wee bit missleading, paying for premium time/premium vehicles is encouraged by Gaijin and most experienced players as it significantly speeds up the grind and helps you stay afloat (it certainly isn't a necessity, but highly useful)

Second point, you will (I certainly have) want to punch a wall or uninstall this game a few times while playing, so get some friends and joke about it, it's hard, and I've certainly wanted to throw my pc out of the window more then once, but the game keeps drawing me back to click that big, red, shiny ""to battle"" button.

Third point, this isn't a massively demanding game on the hardware (mentally? oh yes, the learning curve is pretty steep)and it can be run on some pretty basic systems, which to Gaijin's credit, means that they have a much more forgiving game then some other MMO's

Forth point, this game has a pretty steep learning curve, and as such I would recommend grinding your first nation naturally, from tiers 1 to 7 (if top tier is your goal, it isn't for some people) and then diversifying into other nations. I would strongly recommend against buying a top tier premium straight away, or even before you've gotten to that tier in-game, since you end up being more of a burden to your team then anything else.

I would recommend it as it 100% has some rewarding and funny moments, but it can be a bit rage inducing at times"

5750,Be a Tiger I and got one hit by Sherman from miles away. GOAT game
5751,"War Thunder is a great game on the surface, with it's stunning graphics and interesting gameplay. But don't be fooled, this game will suck your wallet dry and leave you feeling a plethora of emotions from angry to upset, in possibly the most effective way I have ever seen in the history of freemium games.

The process begins, and you pick whatever nation you want to play, as you are thrust into the world of War Thunder. Initially the game starts off rather well, you see that you are able to progress, starting at the biplanes in the interwar period (1920s-1930s), and eventually being able to progress to the jets of the 1960s-70s. The first two ranks are a breeze as you swiftly progress through them, releasing dopamine into your brain eventually forming an addiction, as you progress with ease through the second rank you reach Rank 3, it is here where the problems arise.

Planes here have started to become more expensive and a lot harder to grind, it is around this rank that you will consider buying a membership for a premium account, this can cost £7 (roughly) for a week of premium. From here it becomes even harder to progress, but it is still manageable to play the game, once you are done with Rank 3, a fairly arduous grind but nothing unmanageable you will reach Rank 4, things here are more expensive and it only gets worse as you climb, repair costs for your vehicles start to increase and soon enough the game gets more difficult as the skill level begins to go higher and higher. I find that here there is a wall where premium accounts are a must buy for people who want to progress at all due to repair costs being too high to handle even if you get a kill in a match.

Once you reach Rank 5 (jets) you notice a sudden change in the game, you are all of a sudden being paired with jets that are a whole rank above you, this is due to a little thing called BR compression which players complain about, but Gaijin (the company) refuse to fix. Due to this br compression you will be matched against planes that have a much higher skill than you and ultimately you will die a lot more than you did in previous ranks, the repair costs start to stack up even more here as you are finding it way too difficult to kill a single thing and some people who are less skilled than others will opt to buy more money so they can buy planes that will hopefully be easier for them to play.

You can clearly see the pattern that things only get worse from here on out.

For people who want to progress quickly through trees, they have the option to buy premium vehicles which cost varying amounts depending on ranks, (roughly £7 for Rank 1 and roughly £50 for Rank 6). Gaijin presents these premium accounts and vehicles as optional but unless you want to go through a slow grind, (I remember seeing someone say over 400 days to grind out a single tree without a premium account), you pretty much have to buy a premium account.

The devs from what I've seen and in my experience don't listen to the community at all, look back to the issue of BR compression which they refuse to fix.

There are also the allegations that the devs have a Russian bias, being that they are a Russian company, which makes the Russian vehicles better, (the T34 is literally made from Minecraft bedrock, I've seen a friend take several shots without dying and a bomb dropped practically on top of him which only destroyed his tracks.) I've also seen that the Russian repair costs are much lower, with British rank 5 jets costing around 13-15k SL and Russian jets costing a mere 6k.

If you value your wallet, I'd recommend you don't play this game."
5752,this game is super fun there are a bunch of different modes that you can play there is even a realistic mode that you can play and the game itself is just really fun to play
5753,help

5756,"My family died in the incident of 2021 when I installed this.

5758,Good game if your up for going behind the local mc donalds and doing fun stuff for the old man that lives down the street for money for GE.
5759,This game is a broken peice of freemium garbage
5760,If you hate yourself give it a try.
5761,"(Don't get me wrong I love this game, it has taken a good 400+ hours out of my life that i'm not sure I want back. But this is just honest) 

This game can be so fun if you are using the right strategies and all but most of the time you are either grinding for money that you are loosing or you are absolutely destroying the other team with unbalanced vehicles. To me it feels like Gaijin values content more than balance and bug fixes. Tbh it's cool that you can kill someone with 1500+ vehicles, but if they cant do anything to stop you it's just not fair.

This game may say free on the store page but it really is pay to win at times. That's the only reason I can't recommend this to you nothing can change that in my opinion."

5766,Don't play this game
5767,"Es war mal eins der besten Spiele ever. Aber mit all den Fahr- und Flugzeugen die mit der Zeit dazu gekommen sind, müsste einiges von Grund auf überarbeitet werden. (Vor allen Dingen BR-Dekompression etc.) Als ich anfing mit WT waren noch die MiG-15 und die F-86 die Top-Maschinen, die zwar überlegen, aber balanciert waren. Heute kann man diese Maschinen gar nicht mehr anfassen, da sie gegen Jets antreten müssen, welche mit Lenkwaffen ausgestattet und deutlich schneller sind. Von Panzern will ich gar nicht anfangen. ATGMs vom Hubschrauber und absolut idiotische Schadenskalkulationen mindern immer wieder den Spielspaß und spätestens wenn es ein 105mm Sabot mal wieder nicht durch die Seite eines BMP3 schafft, weil eine dünne Metallplatte in ihrer breite als massives Stahlteil berechnet wird oder wenn (wie heute) ein Holzflieger vom Typ Yak-9 einen direkten Treffer mit einer 75mm APHE Granate übersteht, möchte man einfach nur noch in die Tastatur beißen.

Der Fortschritt im Technologiebaum geht recht schnell voran, man kann recht schnell neue Fahrzeuge freischalten ... wenn man in den niederen Tiers spielt. Sobald es dann in die Richtung BR 8.0 und höher geht, wird der Fortschritt dermaßen langsam, dass man schneller einen anderen Tree auf 8.0 hochgezogen hat, als ein neues Fahrzeug über 8.0 freizuschalten. Liegt aber zum Teil auch daran, dass die Reparaturkosten irgendwann so durch die Decke schießen, dass man sich seine guten Fahrzeuge einfach nicht mehr leisen kann auf Dauer. Es sei denn, man kauft Premium.

Achja. Außerdem bewegt man sich schon seit Jahren immer weiter Stück für Stück in Richtung Pay to Win. Aber wer 60 Euro für nen Panzer ausgeben und dann nochmal 3 Euro für jeden Zweig zur Tarnung drauflegen möchte, ist hier absolut richtig."

5800,u like fly plane? u fly plane. u like drive tank? u drive tank. u like boat? u sail boat. u like apache attack helicopter? u fly apache. u shoot missile it go boom. i do a fly.
5801,I would rather die from radiation poisining after experiencing world war 3 78 times and getting shot by and F-22 Raptor while in a Sopwith Camel with an engine that sounds like a dying horse than play this game. Also you might get a drug addiction from this game. Just a heads up.
5802,I produced more sweat playing this game that when i banged you mom
5803,"Starts off nice and fun. Then it turns into a soul destroying game.

just like real life."
5804,depression
5805,"It's definitely better and more realistic than the other one. In spite of that... Don't. Just don't. The amount of time it takes to get to the ""fun"" part is horrendous. And when you get there, it turns out it's fun only sometimes. Also, picking anything other than Germany or USSR is just intentionally gimping yourself, it's not even funny. And don't get me started on the RNGod, you're gonna have some really dark thoughts because of that. Overall, a really unfun, though addictive, experience. Do not recommend."
5806,Worth the download. Worth the play... and is still entertaining

5809,Very fun game reccomend
5810,"Pay To Win at the purest of essences, terrible personal experience, very good time killer though."
5811,this game is insane they optimise the graphics so you can even play on a toaster while still letting it look realistic. at first it is hard to learn but the tutorial helps but you can learn how to play better after a few hours of playing and overall it is a realistic game that is fun and enjoyable
5812,don't play this game

They say that its ballnced but only thing that Tiger 1s are better is mobility. The IS-2 is 5.7 but Tiger 2s are 6.3 and above. If you want to play germany then good luck killing KVs IS Tanks and T-34s. T-34s machinegun has like 100mm of armor.

5865,"Let's be clear here. I play this game and there are times that I enjoy it. I plan on putting in more time after I post this review. However, the baseline on whether a review should be positive or negative, as described by Steam itself, is ""Would you recommend this to other players?""

Simply put, no, I would not. 

Having played the Air battles, Ground battles, and even dabbled a bit in the Naval battles, I can say that War Thunder wants most of all to present a 'realistic' portrayal of combat. Ground battles being the gamemode I have the most experience in by far, I will be discussing them in particular. I obviously do not know enough to rate how 'realistic' it actually is, so instead I will rate this as any reviewer should: As a game. Meant to elicit fun. 

Put simply, this game is just terrible for anyone looking to just play a game. There's horrible grind not just to unlock new vehicles, but to have any chance of surviving in said vehicles as they do not by default have the ability to repair themselves nor the ability to put out fires (fires particularly will kill your tank if allowed to burn). The feeling of unlocking a new tank is always followed by ""ugh now I have to unlock all the modifications for it to be remotely playable."" 

Compounding this issue is that there are threats that most ground vehicles are utterly incapable of dealing with to any reasonable capacity, namely, planes. You would think in a game mode titled ""Ground"" you wouldn't have to deal with anything in the air, but nope, you would be wrong, because artificially inserting aircraft gameplay into game modes it has no business being in is a War Thunder core design concept. While ground vehicles being able to get air support is realistic, the simple fact is when I'm playing Ground battles - and particularly Ground Arcade, literally not meant to be realistic but rather a just-for-fun gamemode that still earns in-game currency and research - I want to fight other ground vehicles, not worry about being bombed instantaneously upon leaving my spawn.

Which brings up another serious issue that the developers have abjectly refused to do anything about for years - spawncamping. Maps in the ground arcade and realistic game modes will have at most 2 spawn points. If those two spawn points are both being camped by somebody with a tank capable of getting kills, you are screwed and may as well leave the match. 

AA vehicles are also a contentious point, because while their individual shells are generally far less powerful than a shell fired from a tank cannon, their general combination of extremely high mobility, extremely high fire rate, extremely high turret traverse rate (how fast the turret can turn relative to the chassis of the vehicle) and lots of ammo storage makes them in many situations more lethal than actual tanks. This is while AA vehicles at most BRs fail to make a dent on the enemy planes because, simply put, hitting a plane at all is extremely difficult without proximity-detonating ammo, which is unavailable for the majority of AA vehicles. Therefore the natural conclusion is to hop in an AA and run riot over the battlefield, rolling over enemies one after the other because unless somebody actually manages to kill you before you remove their ability to retaliate in any one of a half-dozen ways, you'll get away scot free.

And it's important to address the reason why they get away scot free as well. Unless you are playing with friends in a voice chat, you do not have teammates in this game. The game will tell you that you have teammates. They will show on the map in blue (by default) icons. However, there is a reason War Thunder players have a saying of ""teammates are just enemies in blue."" See, while winning matches gets you bonuses, individual kills/assists and capturing points give currency and research. Therefore, """"""friendly"""""" players are incentivized more to shoot at enemy tanks than actually defend or support their allies to any degree, even if they are not actually working towards winning the match by doing so. A good example is the common situation of your team not bothering to defend already-captured points in favor of attempting to camp the enemy spawn. This means that if you are being shot at by an enemy tank and are on your last legs, trying to repair your tank, generally any nearby allies will ignore you entirely and only try to shoot the enemy, leaving you to die so they can snag the kill. The game reinforces this behavior by having kills be far more valuable than assisting a teammate with repairing etc. 

One could argue - and many have argued - that many of these issues could be fixed by just having a game mode that doesn't have planes at all. Then you're not dealing with bomb-spamming, AA vehicles have no right nor reason to be there and as a result could be safely shifted up in BR as reasonable for the purposes of said game mode or banned outright, and it's entirely based on your skill in defeating enemy tanks with well-aimed and well-timed shots, not who has the best plane. However, given that the War Thunder community has been asking for this for literal years, and the developers have studiously ignored this request for this length of time, I doubt this will ever occur. 

The game is free to play, but that's too expensive for the amount of frustration it will give you."

5912,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Between the unacceptable pay to win mechanics, the terrible gameplay for ships, the absolutely terrible community of teammates who deliberately ram causing you to crash, and the absurd grind for planes and ships (which are part of the pay to win mechanics). My biggest problem is the pay to win trash they put in this game, like how EVERYTHING costs money, even repairing and resuppling ammo on your vehicles that you own after every match, the fact you can only really get more crew slots with premium currency, and how much it seems to pressure you into buying the premium currency. Also, another issue I have is the toxic teammates who will literally go out of their way to ram and crash you, specifically in planes, and the fact they face pretty much no consequences. So basically if you want to play this game, better be willing to spend real money on virtual trash."

-If you are in a tank battle, but you have more than 20 planes in that side? -No problemo! you need at least 1 tank for your preset, and you allow to bring all of the FUCKING PLANES TO A TANK BATTLE. Only bombing no skill needed.

But it has serious flaws. Poor balance in absolutely all modes and vehicle types, except for the arcade. (It keeps things as simple as possible! Nya!)

Also, this game has a high entry threshold! Nya! 

Not a few broken in-game mechanics. The developers don't seem to want to take the time to fix them at all. The economics of the game have been severely damaged. It will take much time to overcome the path to the top. Especially if your skill to play is not great.

However, pumping all sorts of equipment is still enjoyable and fun. But most planes, tanks and ships can still give a different feeling than you expect from them. Nya!

The game is useful for fans of military vehicles and history. The developers have a conversations with the players, but seem to barely listen to them.

Bottom line is 7/10."

5945,"[h1]Why you should not play War Thunder[/h1]


*To make this review a bit more interesting, you could try taking a shot every time the word vehicle is mentioned*


As of now I have spent almost 200 hours on this game.

I do not think you should waste your time, and definitely not your money on this game.
Here is why.

[list]
    [*]Gameplay
    [*]Micro-transactions & Pay to Win/Play Mechanics
[/list]

[b]Gameplay[/b]
First off is the grind. This is what the whole game is centred around, and this is what you will spend most of your time doing.

[b]Lineup[/b]
Before entering a match you can select a lineup of low tier vehicles, designated with the ""Reserve"" battle rating (BR).
Each vehicle has a BR which determines the rank of you and your enemies vehicles. This also helps to indicate what era the vehicles belong to. However this is not always the case, I will get into further detail later.

Your lineup starts with two open slots, to which one vehicle can be assigned.
You can purchase a few slots for Silver Lions (SL), which is the normal currency in the game.
However, if you then want to purchase even more slots, these will have to be bought using Golden Eagles (GE) which is a premium currency you will need to spend real money on obtaining. I will get into more detail later.


[b]Game modes[/b]
You have the option to play either ""Arcade"" or ""Realistic"" game modes with either aeroplanes, ground vehicles, helicopters or ships.

Arcade is as the name suggests this mode is more arcade-like.
Here you get aim assistance which works by either letting you know how far to lead ahead on planes, or where to aim on a tank to be able to penetrate its armour.

Besides this, close enemies are also marked with a red outline.

Vehicles also move faster, and tanks for example will move their turrets faster as well.
This is to entice a quicker way to play the game. This will earn you less currency (SL) and less research point (RP) when compared to ""Realistic""
RP is used to research the next vehicle with a higher BR.


Realistic on the other hand attempts to be a more serious way to play the game, and the one which me and many others have spent the majority of our time.

In this game mode the vehicles behave in a slower and more realistic way.
You will not have any aim assistance, or outlines on enemy vehicles.


[b]Balance[/b]
Here is where my first issue with this game arises.
The game will match you up with other players based on your lineups BR, which is determined based on the vehicle with the highest BR. Here the game will either ""Up Tier"", ""Down Tier"" or ""Evenly Tier"" you against enemies.

This is in place to assert some sort of balance to the gameplay.
However in its current state it is far from perfect.

It is worth noting that based on my own experience, it seems more likely that you will be up-tiered in most matches.

One example being up-tiered in WW2 vehicles by getting matched up with cold war era vehicles, instead of other WW2 vehicles.

Since there are big leaps between these two era's when it comes to technology and performance, the cold war vehicles have a big advantage. This is obvious and leads to a bad experience for whoever got down-tired.

Of course this would be acceptable if we were talking about early WW2 vehicles vs late WW2. 


Now in Gaijin’s defence, this is most likely necessary in order to get people into matches faster, instead of spending a long time in queues.

However the community has complained about this for years, with nothing being done by the developers.


[b]Hit Registration[/b]
My second complaint is with the hit registration in the game.
You fire your weapon and if you hit an enemy, a small window will display what happened to the enemy you shot, and whether or not the vehicle’s modules were damaged or if the vehicle was destroyed.

During this moment the system will also calculate whether or not the shot penetrated the enemy's armour. Here a phenomenon known as “getting gaijined” comes up. There are many examples of this online, and it basically boils down to you hitting an enemy in a spot you expect to penetrate. But the game decides that you didn’t.


[b]Good Parts of The Gameplay[/b]
Now there are of course also good moments in this game, which is what has kept me from uninstalling it so far.

Getting into evenly or up-tiered matches, and straight up just being lucky does make this game feel good.
However I believe that the developers have managed to refine these types of matches, so there is just far enough between them for you to keep your interest in the game.


[b]Micro-transactions & Pay to Win/Play Mechanics[/b]
Now this part of the review ties into the gameplay, since the main goal of this game is to reach the top tier vehicles, the developers decided to include micro-transactions.

These include the following.

[list]
    [*]Golden Eagles
    [*]Premium Account
    [*]Premium Vehicles
    [*]Convertible RP
[/list]

[b]Golden Eagles[/b]
The GE currency is used to speed up your grind, or to give you an advantage over your enemy.

Here is a price comparison of the amount of GE you can buy in-game.

To speed up your grind, the GE can be spent on instantly unlocking extra equipment for your vehicle, purchasing 3D camouflage to make important parts of your ground vehicles hidden, and also make you harder to spot.

[b]Premium Account[/b]
Buy spending either real money, or GE you can purchase a premium account status.

This will currently give you the following bonuses.

+100% RP gain from all game modes.
+50% SL for *active actions in **random battles.
+100% SL reward for battle time in **random battles.
+50% SL from other game modes.

* Active actions are all you do ingame, like capturing a point or destroying an enemy.
** Random battles are modes inside the arcade and realistic

Besides these benefits you also increase the amount of missions, which gives rewards.
You are allowed to exclude some maps from you map pool.
You get an extra 2 slots for stickers on you vehicles (not camouflages)

[b]Premium Vehicles[/b]
Premium Vehicles give +100% RP and 2x more SL, and can be bought for GE.

A high tier premium vehicle will set you back around 60+ EUR

Do also keep in mind that if said premium vehicle is in let’s say tier 5 and you are researching a tier 7 vehicle then the amount of RP awarded towards that vehicle will be diminished, just as it would with a regular tier 5 vehicle.

[b]Convertible RP[/b]
This part ties into the part about GE.
At the end of each battle when you are rewarded, you will also save up some convertible RP.
This can be spent freely on research of any vehicle, at the cost of GE. 1 GE = 45 RP.

This is set in place to entice people to spend real money to skip the last part of your grind for a new vehicle, by unlocking it a little faster.


[b]Conclusion[/b]
The concept of this game is great, but is executed in a very bad way, and entices people to spend a lot of real money in order to progress at a reasonable pace.

My only reason for still playing this game, is that there really is no better alternative out there.
World of Tanks is an option, and is perhaps better or worse in some aspects. It is a game I have also spend a lot of hours in, but not one that I would recommend either. These games are both equally frustrating and equally money hungry.

My advice is to save your mentantly and wallet from this excuse of a free to play game, and find something better to spend your time on.

I hope you all have a great day :)"

5947,"I love WW2/WW1 and cold war aircraft and have always wanted to fly aircraft like the ME 262/ME 262-U1-U2,etc. and warthunder delivered on my dream of flying these amazing aircraft, although the dive-rate for the ju88 and ju87 and other dive bombers is unrealistic, they are still fun to play and would reccomend the game to others."
5948,"Fun, realistic-ish exciting."
5949,I tried to kill myself because of this game.
5950,after 10 years of this game i have found out that i am an animal
5951,Probably the best free to play of all times
5952,abhorrent balancing and servers
5953,I cant Recommend this Game but also cant say its not Fun. When you get some Homies and Play some Air or Ground Battles its fun but actually Grinding for stuff is a Pain in the Ass. Its even more Painful when your PC is a Complete Potato
5954,do not activate high percent boosters

5958,"A good game, I rammed into someone with a plane and it was worth it."
5959,Tried the game after a while. It's worse than it was when I quit. Huge br spread in every match. People driving around in tanks cosplaying as bushes. More likely sitting in bushes in a tank covered in bushes. The training and unlocking new vehicles is still a nightmare. Every scummy thing the company can do to make an extra dollar. Don't download this and don't play it.

5964,"The game over all is fun, granted it does take a LONG time to get stuff without paying micro-transactions.

If you need support with War Thunder and you have to go to support.gaijin.net , I wouldn't recommend it. I've only had 4 tickets with issues with the game and it's safe to say their support team is either incompetent or not knowledgeable enough to help with issues."

6001,Nothing is ever fixed
6002,bad
6003,if there was an alternative i would be playing it cause i hate this game and gaijin who refuses to fix core issues and just keeps adding more crap. Everyone knows the grind in this game is worse than any other game. So the way around that is to play for the game play itself except the maps suck and are a stop gap timer to the spawn camping in each match paired with poor match making both in who plays against who and what plays against what. Pair those things with people abusing glitches and texture issues every match and it leaves you with playing for the grind and sheerly cause there is no alternative.
6004,GUN GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!
6005,"It's a wonderful game (If you pay for it), the armored combat and somewhat realistic physics are fun (if the game lets it happen) and a great time waster if you have nothing else better to do. And the grind? I hope you have a permanent premium account and a backup bank account just to afford a mid-tier vehicle. Overall fun BUT only because there's nothing else like it."

6040,"This game wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the grind. The grind takes months to finish a single tech tree, even with a premium account and premium vehicles which grant additional researching and silver lion earning bonuses, and there are multiple of those, eg. there's an american tanks tech tree, american planes tech tree, american helis tech tree ans so on and so on."

6042,FREE
6043,"I've been playing this since 2016. I thoroughly enjoy it, but in order to enjoy it, don't worry about the grind...just have fun playing in each tier. Every tier has it's own pros and cons for gameplay...but if you only want to play top tier and buy a single premium vehicle to try to grind a whole tree...you're going to have a bad time. If you just jump in with premium, you are going to get clobbered by people who have been playing for a long time and have superior knowledge from maps and techniques, to weak spots on specific vehicles. Mid-tier is probably the most well balanced and fun, around the 4.7 to 6.3 mark. The grind is long, but it's not a game that's designed for you to have everything instantly."

6052,This game aint free
6053,started playing war thunder when it was just planes back in the day and have recently got back into it just to find everything is still biased and unrealistic. certain countries are nerfed into the ground because the people who play them are actually good at the game while other countries are buffed beyond belief because the players dont know what there doing and it just gets worse with every update. this game is horrible but ive spent too much time playing it now to abandon my friends. The only reason id ever suggest playing this game is if you hate yourself(im looking at you tarkov players). also why to the turrets pop when youre ammo racked on every tank but the ones that actually do it in real life
6054,"trash game, the devs make it as difficult and as cancer as possible so players would spend money thinking they can finally play the game and have fun, but it will still be cancer.
uptiers 24/7, get killed at spawn by a plane bomb, and grind that only a nolife basement dweller can have the patience and time to do.

The economy is terrible and they change unnecessary vehicles to make them weaker or more overpowered exp: the Zero's got nerfed, and the Fw 190 D-9 got buffed with br changes. They decide to add more modern vehicles instead of dealing with early tech tree problems which is terrible because the grind is so long you will be spending 90% on those Tiers with problems. The community is mostly terrible and unhelpful especially people that buy a high tier vehicle with no previous experience. 



Id say give it a try and please play the early vehicles for  a little while maybe till tier 3 before buying a jet or modern tank"

6092,"Wow. Just wow. This game is a big pile of shit. War Thunder is the worst of the military games out there; heck, I have more fun staring at a wall than playing this piece of shit game.

You can tell the the developers spent a lot of time making sure people experience the play-to-win model of the game and to have the terrible experience of grinding out pointless vehicles for thousands of hours. Here are some examples of what I am talking about:
1. You only need to play with no brain to have a good time playing this game, which means you can feel no emotion as you are insta-killed across the map.
2. [REDACTED FOR HAVING GOOD OPINION]
3. [REDACTED FOR HAVING GOOD OPINION]
4. [REDACTED FOR HAVING GOOD OPINION]
5. [REDACTED FOR HAVING GOOD OPINION]
6. [REDACTED FOR HAVING GOOD OPINION]
With that in mind, the game is simple enough that my 5 year old nephew was able to figure it out how bad it is after a few rounds..
Course design is brilliant and immersive, not to easy or difficult, plenty of fun and beautiful landscapes to get lost in. Furthermore, the online community is shit; the first person i played with was a grandpa with ptsd from World War 2, who knew the games inaccuracies like the back of his hand, he literally told me how much he hates life after playing this game.

There are hidden Germans on every course, lots of fun!

To conclude, this is a terrible game priced quite low for what i normally expect out of free title. Worth selling my soul to play - a steal if on you get it on sale. What are you waiting for? Play literally anything else! Better to spend thousands of hours in your life doing something not as degenerate as this shit.

6106,Highly technical specs on these vehicles but pretty straightforward gameplay without toxic interactions. I dig it
6107,"Very hit or miss game. It has many strengths and weaknesses but overall pretty enjoyable, especially if you dig ""realism"" and war. Its worth picking up and trying out, and if you get into the game, here are some suggestions. First, make your keybinds comfortable. Second, if you want to spend money on this game to ease your grinding, buy premium account time first, its worth it and its pretty cheap. Third, DON'T BUY TOP TIER PREMIUMS! Limit yourself to nothing more than rank 4 for premiums until you have at least 100 hours on the game. This will make life way better because your tm8s wont be upset about you being absolute trash and dead weight. Also you won't get destroyed every match if you buy a lower tier premium. You also get a huge research point penalty if you research low tier vehicles with a top tier premium. I said what all needs to be said, enjoy the grind fellow comrades, and I'll see you on the battlefield."

Un-Nerf The Bomber Gunners THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Its cool fine shoot me my plane pops like a balloon ###k it whatever, but you could at least make the gunners shoot back. I shouldn't have to space bomb or fly at treetop to get a bombing run in. Its pretty bad having to fly and manually control the gunners. Y U DO THIS? Your catering to terrible fighter mains is ruining the game. 
If people want to shoot at planes that don't shoot back create a special game mode for them.

6153,Starts off as a good game. As you progress you are punished more and more.  Repairs begin to cost more and soon you will run out of lions and are forced to pay for premium.  This game is now a grind and you are constantly chasing a carrot on a stick.  This could be a great game but the dev's have destroyed it with greed.

I would stay away from this game if your thinking of driving the iconic tanks of ww2 they will take you forever to get to and then it wont be fun getting killed because you cant dedicate 70 hours a week to leveling up you tank."

It's an easy to learn tank fighting game with realistic enough physics and amazing graphics."

the company is extremely greedy and adding cash grabs every update for the wallet warriors and without premium the grind is just pure pain.

War thunder can be fun sometimes (mostly not because the grind is horrible for f2ps like myself)

so i would give it a yes and a no, also fuck you gaijin"

6259,"Fun game if you run in guns ready to fire, but if you camp or wait for someone to come to you its pretty damn boring!"
6260,"The game itself is good, don't get me wrong but what the hell is it with the Russian tanks. They are too overpowered and no where near accurate, you have players taking you out in one hit from across the map or better yet some how some players seem to be able to shoot through two or more walls and you have the same tank fully leveled up. This game in the early stage tier 1 and 2 was great, yeah there was a challenge but it was balanced, further on from there its just a joke. Russian and Chinese tanks being OP, like for real? the Russians and the Chinese in ww2 had some of the weakest tanks out there. Devs fix this game and for ********* do something about the matchmaking and cheats its making the game unplayable."
6261,This is what I call a target-rich environment.
6262,"amazing
"
6263,Great game all in all just takes a min to understand how in depth it is which it is very very in depth. Just wish was more customizing ability.
6264,how do i land a plane
6265,"I played this game a lot on xbox and then crossed over to PC to start over. I have a few things to say...

I know I have the experience so playing is much more than someone starting out. As an experienced player, I've pretty much unlocked all T1 tanks for Italy, China, and more than half in Germany without much effort in less than 6 hours and that's decent. So unlocking tanks isn't that hard IF you know what you're doing. Even in T2 and T3. It doesn't take that much effort if you play for medals. The best I can recommend? Play the tutorials no matter what your combat focus (air, land or sea) but do them all and pay attention. They are dry, but they do help - and you get rewarded generously for doing them in-game. 

Secondly? For tankers - Your enjoyment as equally as your frustration hinges on the Battle rating on the tanks you field. If you field a 1.5 battle rating or higher tank in all slots the odds of you facing tanks that are tier 2 or better are increased. And this is bad for people who aren't prepared to face it because your T1 tanks (or just tier 1 fewer tank level) are hot garbage against higher tier tanks. With some heat rounds, the right maneuvering, getting in close, and the distraction of your piers getting decimated, you might be able to take one out if you know precisely where the weak points are - but don't count on it.

For Flyers - don't kamakazi ground units while playing in ground warfare. It looks cool - but it doesn't work.

For Navy players... what can I say other than your going to likely be terrible at it until your not.

For all Players: Always unlock the repair stuff and crew replacement stuff first. Nothing is more frustrating than dying in a fire, or sinking in your own ship, because you don't have someone to fix it.

And this is why I will recommend this... Keep your overall battle rating low if you don't want to fight the next tier higher vehicle more often than not. Mix up your composition, don't just take the best vehicles you have all the time or your just going to face things you can't beat.

"
6266,ye
6267,ass

6269,gyay good game
6270,"it is very cool but they should ad the f-22 fighter jet
"
6271,so played the game and completely hated it.  research doesnt work or goes to random shit i dont want.  some how any time i land a plan the game automatically kills me and destroys the plane.  its completely unplayable and not worth the time to sit here for 2 months to accomplish one single research or weapon upgrade.  i dont know how this game even has players in it since its terrible and a pay to play system.
6272,"i fucking hate this stupid game. Its so grindy, ill play one game and get buttfucked the entire time, then proceed to GET NO FUCKING RESEARCH"
6273,"My soul has been ensnared by the snail again, first Crossout, and now this. 11/10 suffering, my french tank gets flipped over by ricochets and one-shot by hydrogen molecules that hit me a little too hard ,_,"

6275,Good
6276,"THE GAME IS AMAZING
"
6277,"I really like this game. It is very immersive, fun, and strategic. Whether you want to play casually or grind out everything, this game has it all. one bad thing is that the grind to the top jets (f4, f14, mig 21, mig 23) is very long if you dont get a premium account."
6278,so much flippin fun (if u have good planes or jets or tanks or boats
6279,"This game is like meth except its infinite 
"
6280,if you enjoy pain and suffering this game is for you!
6281,Good
6282,I would rate this game an uninstall out of 10. You're shown real quickly that you're a free to player.
6283,this game is a great fun way to waste your time. just know you don't need to buy anything but it will make your time worth your while. (paid to win)
6284,"Too many blatant cheaters. Cheating is motivated by the developers as there is no EAC protection on arcade matches.
No report option for cheating either. Also Gaijin has bad support lost expensive items in their other Gaikin game to account compromise from their side, and they are so bad they asked me what I had."
6285,graphics r incredible
6286,TARGET DESTROYED
6287,"You might think about this game whatever you want but if you are honest you would have to admit one thing : THIS IS GAMBLING. Not only is it infested by bots and cheaters, but it also punishes you for playing it and trying to get you in a ""premium loop"" without premium there is no way that you can keep the silverlions (one of the the 3-4 currencies - only crossout is worse). The devs surely think that the standard user is STUPID and you should show them that you are the opposite. Game should be renamed to ""war gamble"". Best example? AI Assault mode...You play it for BOOSTERS and yet you lose a shit ton of money just for getting said booster. You spawn and instantly get hit by 4539745334 aimbots...you are constantly downtiered...the AI is buggy as fuck and even starts flying sometimes(yeah - just play it and you will see flying heavy tanks that still hid you mid air while in flight). BEST THING IS : You wont be able to use your boosters whenever you want...they got a ""bb date"" xDDD....Shameless, greedy devs...Its  so obvious - there is no reason to DEFEND such a politic. NEVER FORGET : WITHOUT US - THEY WOULD CRAWL DOWN THE STREETS LOOKING FOR !-REAL-! JOBS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

6298,boom
6299,A very long grind
6300,"The game is fun, but the grind is unreal, It has taken 6 months to get close to rank 3 aircraft, and once you get there you can't even play with those planes as the repair costs are more than you get from games. 

The higher up you go the worst this gets to the point where you can't actually ply the game with anything higher than 2.7 planes. 

The fact you have to spend lions to repair planes after arcade battles ruins it and means you'll basically be playing with WW2 planes forever. 

Haven't played tanks much, didn't really enjoy them. Same with ships. 

In conclusion, this is a grindy, pay 2 win mess that exists only to offer small amounts of joy for free, and then empty your wallet rather than spend months on end to try and get planes, that you then can't afford to repair anyway. 

"
6301,Don't play P2W games in 2022 if you have self respect
6302,fun
6303,"Each time I play ground assault aka tanks, It keeps crashing or lagging. I canplay a few seconds and than it just keeps me on the lo0ading screen
"
6304,"Overpowered premium aircraft and ground vehicles mixed with a fundamentally unbalanced and outdated formula form 8 years ago gives you a game that rarely teases fun then has those who payed up strip away any semblance of the word. Add broken mechanics and you get even better ""realism"" when rounds from a high velocity cannon just disappear into another tank."
6305,try this game out it is fun
6306,"very fun game but impossible to play with friends not explained to invite a friend you can only play with a friend if he creates a new account but thats just not smart, nothing is really explained like controls  etcetera."
6307,god bless this amazing game don't know how my life would be without this masterpiece of an art

You can spend days grinding away to get a single tank that is identical to the last one except with 1km/hr more speed or 10mm more armour plating on the rear quarter panel or some extra wood on the side.

Don't even need to mention how annoying planes are in tanks. Get a kill on a guy? He'll just baby rage, get into a bomber and bomb the entire hectare you inhabit.
When/If you try to do the same, Gaijin says go fuck yourself and spawns enemy fighters directly behind you.

If you want to experience great 30 minute missions like flying in formation escorting bombers over the English channel, the single player or invite your friends missions vs the computer are just outstanding fun.

Remember: Just level up like we used to do before micro transactions!

The battle ships and ocean combat in this game is GREAT.  So many ships and boats to choose from from all over the world. Firing the main guns on a destroyer, huge guns and  shells from 15km for example gives the feeling of ocean shaking explosions. 


Pros:
- Super fun combat at any skill level. From slow 100mph dog fights in biplanes to bombing enemy city from 30,000 feet in a flying fortress. (I love playing the tail gunner and knocking the fighters out the sky)
- Open ocean battleship combat is so much fun with 1000's of real ships and boats from every country in WW2
- The game is very educational. I see all these Tanks, Trucks, Ships, Boats, Planes and then watch them on TV documentaries or read about them in the In Game Wiki. 
- The game is updated and patched frequently and has a very active player base.
-  Fantastic and realistic graphics and animations. 
-  Entry level skill to realistic simulator  settings easy to swap around and experiment 

Cons:
- Turn down the in game voices (they become repetitive and sound dated) example: ""Serves him right"" When you shoot a tank for example""  Whats your status? On Time and On Target""  while in the plane. 
- Would like to see more single player battleship and tank content ( I haven't see it all yet at 360 hours of game play)"
6363,:(
6364,ive got some time in the game its fun when you learn the machanics the devs have some dumb practices ive been around enough i remember the very good things like races for free planes like the  p02 its fun but some people will never see the old days because of a high paywalls hard grinds good people and he bad you will have fun bringing biplanes to top teir bombing with ur buddies swarming with your friends getting a solo 10k double ace that bomb shot that juke of a life time with ur attackers slamimng each other getting you that 2k pop and then a 4k to follow seeing a rare plane slam into the dirt with a bad pilot or that lvl 1 pop ur entire team solo then die to base aa its what you want it to be i love the game amazing 6-9/10 devs v game
6365,"Love it: interesting battle, various of vehicles.
Hate it: Endless grinding."
6366,"the games is very fun and enjoyable! tech tree is difficult to make there way up but is very fun to get new aircraft,ships, and tanks. i wish they would make it a little easier to get new aircraft,ships, and tanks. also i think they should bring back the submarines and i think it would be cool to see aircraft carriers. i also think they should add a feature where you can play with a friend in the same plane as a munitions expert/gunners. other than those recommendations it is a overall fun and enjoyable game to play."
6367,  fun  with alot hell to dish out
6368,"Please stop before it's too late 

10/10 would recommend"
6369,Very disappointed absolutely no thunder whatsoever. However exceptional and phenomenal sunsets/ sunrises.
6370,yes
6371,was aight
6372,PEW PEW USSR
6373,"I mean its a videogame, technically"
6374,brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
6375,The game is a ton of fun. I highly recommend the game.
6376,"BEWARE: This game is a grind in every way and will take A LOT of time to get good and get decent vehicles. (This game is played/made in a way that you having fun means you ruining it for others, you wont always be having a good time as with any game) Other than that, it is a very historically accurate game and is fun to play most of the time and is a rewarding game to rank up and get better at."
6377,its full of fucking hackers that can turn on a dime in air and have inpenatrable armor on the ground it used to be a fun game now i cant pen anything hardly or out turn another fighter
6378,"Honestly a garbage game. I wish they would stop begging me for money and free advertising, if the game was worth a shit it would advertise itself and people would spend money the fact that you guys have to beg for money every time someone launches your game means you're doing everything wrong. You seem to think that the lack of user retention is just due to global ADHD levels rather than taking responsibility for making an absolute shit game. I mean what does it say about your FREE game when people don't even think that price is worth it?"
6379,if you love grinding 24/7 then this is the right game
6380,"If you end up in this community you either become a trans girl or a nazi, no middle ground"
6381,"ATTACK THE B POINT . thank u . sorry .   hmmm game very grindy and take long time to get the ""real"" tonks . but when u do its get more fun and enjoyable  ... please nerf T34 i hate that tonk"
6382,"this is 1 of the best miltary combat... battle games 
"
6383,"As of writing this, WT is like a really good book i cannot put down.
If you had told me 10 years ago that this would be one of my favourite games, i wouldve said youre lying lol.
But its true, WT takes me back to my childhood of building scale model jets, planes & ships with dad xD
except you get to fly and operate them!!!
From tanks to planes to jets to naval battleships, its all there.
PVP/Co-Op and Single player campaign maps to name a few.
Do yourself a favour, just try it. Its free and even the grinding to unlock/customise vehicles is some of the most fun Ive had in a long time."
6384,"Very good game, really good for ppl who like to play realistic battles."
6385,its good i love knowing military secrets
6386,"This is best game ever make most realistic tank,aircraft game my bro have 4k or more hrs in this game and have like 3 or 4 country on rank 7.no life boomer 
"
6387,still a waste of time. game is broken with invisible fucking tanks now that nobody can shoot. Want to keep your sanity? Play something else
6388,play if want to suffer
6389,"planes go fast, monkey brain happy"
6390,should i uninstall this game
6391,I hope the gaijin dev team's kids die and they have to watch their children's rotting corpse getting lowered into a grave.
6392,anjay
6393,"Honestly this game is just boring, after you die you spawn all the way back and you have to drive there/fly/swin there in your slow ass plane/boat/tank, I also found it hard to encounter enemies. I was driving around looking for someone to kill, but there was no one or they were all far away, and by the time I got there they were dead. Not fun, don't recommend."
6394,"If you have a bottomless pit of money then this is the game for you. 

Like playing a match and then having to wait days until you have enough coins to pay for vehicle repairs? 

Like being fleeced by the developers, come and join the fun. 

Seriously its an utter slog."
6395,FAVORITE GAME!!!
6396,"Quite pay to win, without premium grinding tanks and planes is pointless and takes too long. After 5.3 you will always be uptiered. Would only play until rank 5.3
"
6397,Yes to Waste life
6398,Good
6399,"yes
"
6400,"Very fun but i hate CAS
"
6401,good
6402,unbalanced online match at any battle rate
6403,"The game's vehicle destruction physics is really impressive and the dogfighting is really fun. That's all I can say, but for the low low price of free, it's worth it."
6404,"I have had a lot of fun with this game and if you want to play early WW2 vehicles i would highly recommend it 
If you want to play anything later than tier 3-4 then it is still fun but the grind is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I've continued to grind is because I honestly cant find another game that comes close to the amount of content and play style War thunder has to offer. If they fixed the grind but charged 30 bucks i would totally pay it."
6405,lol
6406,its a fun game but its gridy and anoying some times but mins that its fun. (PS. USSR as toooooooooooooooooo over powered)
6407,I hate this game
6408,Great game but an extremely pay to win long grind.
6409,If you want to play a game that would just bring you pain and depression this is the game for you
6410,its cool
6411,"This game is great but for some reason i cant access fighter jets and I dont know why? can anyone tell me how to get them?
"
6412,"Good game ,but the grind is pain"
6413,i hate this game with a passion but dont get me wrong its good but if you ask anybody who plays it often they will tell you the despise this game but keep playing so yeah!!!
6414,I hate it but still playing it
6415,best war simulator ny far
6416,nice game
6417,"planes go zoom, tanks go boom, helicoptor helicoptor memes, we don't talk about boats"
6418,funny war crimes
6419,"说真的，BWD接手之后的战雷真的   很   让  我   失   望   ！！！！！！！！
我从初二开始接触War Thunder，到现在大四，用句老话，眼看他楼起，眼看他宴请宾客，眼看他楼塌了
这是我这一路以来最真实的感受，说实话真的很难受，我很喜欢体验坦克和飞机的驾驶感觉，我也很希望驾驶冷战，乃至现代载具
但是越往后面玩我就越发现我越玩不下去的感觉
首先是最让人恶心的地方
Seriously, I'm really disappointed with the War thunder that BWD took over ！！！！！！！！
I began to contact War Thunder from grade two to the present senior year. As an old saying goes, watching him build, watching him entertain guests, watching his building collapse
This is the most real feeling I've had all this time. Honestly, it's really hard. I love flying tanks and planes, and I would love to fly cold War and modern vehicles
But the further I went, the more I couldn't play
First, the most disgusting part

1.收益
举个例子，我们拿维修费和击杀收益来做比较，美系中后期载具普遍维修费在6000~9000  更有胜者要10000+的维修费，杀一个地面载具给多少？？？？    ——————1500   ，占领一个据点的收益  ———— 3000   这个是在不开VIP，不是金币载具的情况下
所以一局要杀几个人才能回本？至少得占一个点，击杀2人及以上，但是现在的游戏环境只能这么说——————难，在大多数情况下都是容易亏本的，而且不要忘了，你这钱赚来是要去买其他载具的，不是为了赚钱修车的，和着就是贷款打工一个道理？！？！
而且中后期载具的购买外加成员组基本都要100 0000+的费用，也就为了买个车打打修修几百局而已嘛，一局十几分钟而已嘛，
我呸！！！！   BWD的吃相真让人恶心
1. The yield
For example, we take the maintenance cost and kill revenue to do a comparison, the United States in the middle and late vehicle maintenance cost in 6000~9000 more winners to 10000+ maintenance cost, kill a ground vehicle to how much ？？？？ ——————1500, capture a stronghold revenue ———— 3000 this is without VIP, not gold vehicles
So how many kills does it take to make it back? At least have to account for a point, kill 2 people and more, but now the game environment can only say —————— difficult, in most cases are easy to lose money, and do not forget, you this money to earn is to buy other vehicles, not to make money to repair the car, and is a loan to work a truth? ! ? !
In addition, the purchase of vehicles in the middle and late period plus the cost of the member group is basically 100,000 +, which is just to buy a car to play and repair hundreds of rounds, and it only takes more than ten minutes for each round.
I pooh ！！！！ The way BWD eats is disgusting

而且这收益计算也很奇怪，收益应该是 基础收益*（载具收益加成+加成卡+高级账户），从以上的收益模式来说等级越高的载具收益越高，但是奇怪的地方来了， 我有XM1 （9.3权重 五级金币载具）和IS6（7.0权重 四级金币载具）两辆金币载具，在没有VIP没有加成卡的情况下两者占点的收益都是5000左右，在开了高级账户的情况下都是10000出头一点，而且我用我朋友的叙利亚T72AV试了下也是10000出头， 我真的很怀疑收益的计算系统？？？？
And the earnings is also very strange, revenue should be a basic income * (vehicle gains bonus + bonus card + senior account), from the above level of profit model, the higher the vehicle returns, but a strange place, I have XM1 (9.3 weight category five gold COINS vehicle) and IS6 (7.0 4 gold vehicle weights) two gold COINS vehicle, In the case of no VIP and no bonus card, the revenue of both points is about 5000, and in the case of opening a premium account, it is a little more than 10000. Moreover, I tried it with my friend's Syrian T72AV, which is also a little more than 10000. I really doubt the revenue calculation system ？？？？


2.匹配机制
我相信这是困扰很多老玩家的问题了，大家玩德系5.7 和6.7 经常被拉壮丁吧，也就是匹配到比自己的权重高1.0的载具，导致维修费爆炸而且收入微乎其微而且像新出的载具BWD根本不用脑子做平衡，很多新载具一出来基本就是大杀特杀，然后下个版本权重拉高，刚出的时候把下面的环境搞的生灵涂炭，权重拉高了发现自己又打不下去了，真的很垃圾，比如说曾经的XM1 is6 意大利的防空超跑，这些东西现在还能玩嘛？  二战房混进来一堆有硬芯穿甲的家伙，虎王和IS7打  9.3拉到10.3打   玩的车被各种机动，主武器，和其他方面有剧烈优势的载具屠杀，有意思吗？   如果你是个低血压患者或者是个抖M的话我强烈建议你玩
2. Matching mechanism
I believe this is a lot of old players, everybody plays ashkenazi 5.7 and 6.7 is often pull force, which is matched to the higher than its own weight 1.0 vehicle, leading to upkeep explosion and income is very low and as new vehicle BWD no mind to do balance, many of the new vehicle basic is a out big kill, kill, Then the next version of weight pull high, just out of the following environment to make people, weight pull high found himself and can not play, really rubbish, such as XM1 IS6 Italian air defense super car, these things can still play now? Ww ii has a bunch of hard-core armor-piercing guys coming in, tiger King and IS7 tanks in 9.3 and 10.3 are being massmassed by various maneuvers, main weapons, and other vehicles that have a huge advantage. Fun? I highly recommend it if you are a hypotension sufferer or a jerk


说真的现在这个游戏是真的让我心累了  收益不充钱的话基本没有，匹配机制一塌糊涂，有时候服务器又要爆炸，累了，真的累了，我曾经热爱这个游戏，我热爱这个将我带入的二战坦克飞机大战的游戏，他陪伴我初中到高中到大学再到现在我快工作了，但是自从他被BWD接手之后感觉就是一个认识很多年的朋友为了利益背叛你，累了，无言以表

Really now the game is really let my heart tired don't charge the basic no returns, a complete matching mechanism, sometimes to the server and explosion, tired, really tired, I used to love this game, I love this brought me into a tank of world war ii aircraft war games, he with my junior high school to high school to college and now I'm going to work, However, after he was taken over by BWD, he felt like a friend who had known him for many years betrayed you for interests. He was tired and speechless


我从今年开始已经一分钱都没有给这个游戏了，虽然安东在的时候它很魔法，但是我现在希望安东回来，BWD现在正在把这个我曾经无比热爱的游戏带向毁灭

I haven't given any money to this game since the beginning of the year, although it was magic when Anton was around, I want Anton back now, BWD is now driving the game I once loved to ruin
"
6420,"very active community. Dev's care about their game and frequently tweak and update. The game is very time consuming, lots of time played to get to better tanks, planes and boats. However, if you appreciate or dont mind the grind, the game is very rewarding. low tier is alot of fun especially once you start to learn the game."
6421,it's ight
6422,"If you have the time for the grind, its worth playing"
6423,再让bwd这样搞下去这游戏迟早药丸
6424,good
6425,gooooooood
6426,good
6427,"gooood
"
6428,"War Thunder is not a game, it's a lifestyle. The grind is infuriatingly slow, and there is just no way you'll get to play every single vehicle in the game. Choose your nation wisely."
6429,Im ammo.-
6430,"If u dont plain to buy  dont waste time here, cause u will be wasted fast on field from paypal players.I was try to do progress without any investment but its finished with alot losed battles(most of them was 1 shot 1 kill)."
6431,I Played this simply because i cant be bothered to pay 44 pound for the fa18c hornet on dcs and tbh this game is pretty fun straighjt away you chose what you want to fly/drive i chose avaiation the tutorials were super helpful and deatailed and the flying mechanics are somewhat realistic alotugh i would say the G-Lock overload could be better like make the screen go dark instead of it going red
6432,Never ever play this game. The mechanics and general gameplay is horrible and needs alot of revison to be functional. The game is frustrating and rage inducing and is targeted at people who will willingly pay 50 pounds for 2 or 3 vehicles in game
6433,"good game, would recommend"
6434,3/3
6435,"cheeky but karlis better
"
6436,it good
6437,The best World War 2 and Cold War experience in regard of military vehicles
6438,NO
6439,
6440,cool dude
6441,"I game has been a waste of my time, Time I could've spent doing more useful things in life. But here I am with too many hours on the game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone, unless you are a lowlife with nothing to do other than to skip taking showers and play this game."
6442,I love this game. It also makes me want to jump off a building. Take from that what you will
6443,Super grinder and painful but there are moments of joy
6444,for your own mental health dont play this game
6445,Tanks
6446,"is it good? yes. BUT there are many things that need to be improved but have yet to be addressed. the game is free to play, so the developers have to make money some how, and i get that. the ""blind hunt"" order is overpowered and in a 1v1, its so broken, that whoever will win basically comes down to who pops their blind hunt order first. please for the love of god gaijin, fix that. its so anticlimactic as well. you would think that the last two people alive on each team in an air realistic battle getting ready to duke it out would be exhilarating and climactic, all to just get boom and zoomed from a random direction is so insulting to both players."
6447,I do not like the Pe-8
6448,"most bullshit ass game, with an awful dev team, and a complete money suck

10/10 definitely reccomend"
6449,Its a massive grind but a fun grind
6450,ppl very stinker but good but no but yes
6451,"game good, is tank, much wow. honestly though Try it for yourself if i have 650hrs and rising it has to at least be semi entertaining"
6452,"If you like grinding for hours just for another vehichle. good game
:))))))))))))))))))))))))))))"
6453,"please help me 
"
6454,ABSOLUTLY EPIC DUD BUY NOW IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY GREAT GRAPHICS AND COMMUNITY
6455,I recommend it but your soul belongs to the snail after downloading it
6456,"you never rage more in your entire existence anywhere else, than in this game. All negative comments on this game are most likely true. And people who get a single kill in a tank RB battle, then get into a plane and just strafe and bomb tanks for 90% of the game, should be skinned alive and set on fire."
6457,Its a fun game i rely enjoy it
6458,"great from a technical standpoint, but gameplay is multiplayer only and a miserable experience I can't recommend to anyone."
6459,yes
6460,Constantly crashes since last update. Fix your game
6461,Gaijin is incapable of making the game balanced and enjoyable for every nation besides the main 3.
6462,Play this game if you wanna die because your ammo rack blew up from 500 yards away
6463,"great tank game, but the grind is painful for me i feel like i could go through my entire life again before i got a 10.0 br tank besides the grind and the fact you'll lose a decent amount of your battles unless you are a god or have a decent team that does objectives. but if you dont care about winning and dying allot its actually a very well put game."
6464,eh
6465,good game but get ready to rage alot
6466,"WOW! I thought that I would have a great time playing a ""free"" game that lets you fly planes, drive tanks, and use helicopters on a online game sounds great, but it is truly teriable!!!  If you play with tanks,  you will experience getting shot through inpentrable buildings, unfair deaths, monstersly bad mechanics, and a total anilation of all your brain cells! After a update to the planes, it is impossible to fly them at all unless you have a real pilot lisence. Nobody likes helicopters. If you are interested for a completly broken game that is unfair to everybody, then this is the game for you. P.S, It says that it's free but you would be spending $2 everyday for more depression."
6467,"Good old fashion explody fun. Great game to chill with. Different modes means it has a versatility to it. Plus the constant drive to unlock the next tank/plane/ship/gunboat is keeps you playing. 

Worth the time to download and play with. Slightly pay to win at times but in general its always a fun fair match."
6468,🥶🦧🦍👽👺😭👍🍌🐒
6469,"this game is insane such good graphics and crazy planes and tanks and boats and, well everything (besides being able to play as a gunner/infantry) overall the game is very good and well made."
6470,"give your money,life,family and all mortal possessions to the snail"
6471,BIG W
6472,"
takes months to get to top planes, tanks, ships etc people produce enough sweat to fill oceans in this game would not play to have fun."
6473,"I think i have a hole in my right wing... wait, where's my wing?"
6474,is very good game
6475,"Its a G Game
"
6476,"Presently the game allows planes into tank battles too early on.  Once planes are in, it is very hard to survive a tank game, which should primarily be tank on tank.  The balance of power between planes and tanks is very uneven.  Especially when they are bombing spawn areas.  If planes are to be allowed in tank battles, then there should be AI anti-aircraft positions at the spawn areas.
In addition, when going into a game with a highest BR of , e.g. 6.3 you shouldn't end up playing against vehicles of more than one or two BR's above you.  You should not have a 6.3 max BR vehicle fighting against 8.3 BR vehicles"
6477,game is very unevenly balanced when tanks vs aircraft.
6478,"The repair mechanic is awful.
I am not nearly close to late game and I already have to wait hours for my plane to get repaired. If you repair your vehicles by paying silver lions you get no progress. That means either way you lose...
Except you buy *premium time* or *premium vehicles* to magically boost your progress.
If you are willing to pay for this game, it might be actually fun.
But for me even if I really had fun playing this game, I just can't play enough of it because of this stupid mechanic.
For that reason I have uninstalled this game and don't want to touch it again until this problem gets fixed someway someday.
If I am mistaken for something, please correct me, but I think there isn't anything I go so wrong about, that this review isn't viable.

Edit: I just improved my grammar and nothing else in this review."
6479,"bad
"
6480,very fun [im losing my mind]
6481,"Cool game, but i hate Gajin Launcher. Acts like a virus."
6482,"(Wor-thun-dur) Warthunder: Ground, Naval and Aviation battles.

Br 1.0-5.3: Fun with friends, good but understandable amount of grinding.

Br 6.0-11.0: Endless suffering, sometimes it is a good match, sometimes you get nailed by an APFSDS and die 3 mins into battle. The grind is horrifying, weeks on end to get enough RP to purchase that M1A2 Abrams.(I still don't have it)

Don't forget about the people who spawn with a helicopter and B-line it to our spawn and ATG Missle our entire team giving them a MASSIVE lead. 

Also don't forget about the UPTIERS that happen...chilling in my A-10(Br 9.7) and this massive F-14A(Br 11.3) Tomcat comes by me at MACH 2 and I get thrown into a flat spin and die.

PLAY THIS GAME AT YOUR OWN RISK."
6483,love tanks and old war games lol
6484,"ya 2000h i've got mental health problems

ps:.next review will come when i have a girlfriend"
6485,good game
6486,"An absolute piece of trash, this is what War Thunder is. I have never played a game that had the most broken play to win and grind system. Although the gameplay, graphics, and general realism is enjoyable, being destroyed by people who simply spent money to get a ""premium"" vehicle is just wrong. You can either put 1000+ hours to get to a fighter jet, or spend some money to reach the same level. Greedy, greedy, greedy. Horrendous."
6487,Very good game
6488,"War Thunder. Wow. This game, this piece of art... It changed me. It's like something you HAVE to have downloaded.
10/10, Gaijin. 10/10."
6489,Unballanced pay to win garbage.
6490,you get to shoot other people but in planes
6491,BEST GAME EVER
6492,heheh bombs go brrr
6493,yes
6494,Ha Ha Tonk go BOOM
6495,best game ever u should give them all your money
6496,The only time I would recommend going russian
6497,shit game
6498,very good game guns go boom boom
6499,5est game wver
6500,ye
6501,"After 35 hours of play Time, I promise that its worth your time, however it is still a broken game and needs a lot of changes. Most tanks are unbalanced, and need balancing changes. I hope Gajin can fix their problems TOGETHER."
6502,"Don't grind vehicles, just play with your friends and have fun.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Dogfights"
6503,"fun
"
6504,nice game
6505,Good game
6506,its great i love it i do think it could use more newer generations in it
6507,Good Game
6508,the most consistently inconsistent game known to man
6509,"Really fun to mess around in. and the details they put into this game ARE AWESOME i like the play battles the most, and my second favorite is the boats then its prob the tanks."
6510,"The snail only cares for money. Seriously though, this game is only ""good"" because no other game has filled this niche. The World of X games ""tried"" but it's much more arcade-y. This has so many flaws at so many levels that you are almost guaranteed to not have fun. From what I've heard it can be compared with League of Legends, but worse. Oh, but if you DO want to have fun you'll need to waste hundreds of dollars so you also have that, I guess."
6511,"its good, dont trust me"
6512,"out of the 500hrs played im enjoying war thunder! BUT... it makes me want to pull out my hair plus hang myself
sometimes!!
overall very fun when you got friends to play with in pub games also fun playing customs matches with friends especially when you can bush up your tank and do Hidenseek.

If you are one of those people who scroll down to see whats here youve wasted 5 mins of your life LOLOLOLOLOLOL  
Also dont be one of them Smart Asses that say ""hey you also wasted 5 mins of your own time making me scrool al this way down!!"""
6513,Tank does Pew
6514,Pretty nice game. Good looking graphics and nice optimization. Planes are looking very well but some of them doesn't look good inside. The game is very simple and easy to play. I haven't experienced any errors or bugs so I can say that the game is well made.
6515,awesome!
6516,war thunder = advanced gaijin theft system
6517,i want to die please help
6518,POINTLESS GAME NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY GREEDY MONEY GRAB GAME.
6519,"play if you have a lot of time
"
6520,"The gameplay of the ships in the game is really so bad, I play world of warships like 8 Years.
And there is a huge difference between the games about ships really a pity"
6521,pretty cool
6522,"Fun game, fast paced, and a great shoot em' up MMO. It needs some dedication and grinding to get better vehicles, but it's well worth it if you enjoy blowing stuff up."
6523,"Unless you have daddy's credit card, don't play this game. And Unless you get 20+ kills you'll never cover the repair cost of your vehicle."
6524,"TL;DR
If you are planing on playing this game, dont other games deserve your time more than this POS. Why do i play it, idk i like to suffer.

Cons:
""free"" 
unless you pay for premium this game has such a terrible grind and even if you pay its still gonna take you hours of grinding to get one high tier tank/plane. Also the bugs are rampant, from being able to look through smoke to audio and visual glitches that make the game supper annoying.
Pros:
you can get some nice tanks and planes ig"
6525,i can feel my sanity slowly declining
6526,"Gaijin is one of the most greedy bastard corporations known to man, nearly the same level as Nestle.
They fuck over literally every player if he pays money or not. You have to play years to get to your fav endgame tanks and then cant even play them because they cost too much ingame currency to use (or you just pay to get the currency). as an example tanks that have evry bad guns get put into matches with tanks they cant pen (example: got put into a 2.7 match with my reserve Tetrarch mutliple times) yes ive played it enough to have some mid tier german tanks and the balance isnt too bad with them but its honestly just a ""get fucked over simulator"""
6527,the game is fun and relaxing!
6528,too much grind
6529,"I love it I think its one of the best games you can get whit no money (planes are best :D)
difficulty 5/10
fun 6/10
Toxik community 2/10
realistic 7/10
buy to win 4/10"
6530,tank
6531,One word : Amazing!
6532,Average BDSM person favorite game
6533,it used to run very good after it updated it it stopped working
6534,"I add a new reason to why you shouldn't play this game, when i get killed by something bullshit.

Buttons in the menus sometimes don't work. the most infamous is the leave queue button. when you start a queue, a cancel queue button would appear it its place (as you would expect), pressing that button to leave the queue is like playing the lottery, sometimes you can leave the queue, sometimes it puts you in a match. The fact that they cant even fix a cancel queue bug for 10 years is amazing. Shows that devs dong give a shit.

Bushes are a pay to win expect of the game that makes it ridiculously annoying to fight against. Bushes break up the tank silhouette, and makes it hard to distinguish what tank you are playing and where its weak spot is. sometimes it can just the tank almost invisible if you are in a jungle map. The only way to get the bushes is to either buy it for real money, or to grind everyday doing incredibly annoying missions to get it. FYI, instead of nerfing bushes, devs made it so that as the match goes on the bushes gets dirty, which makes it fit better into the surrounding as some bushes are bright green, which might not be good in a dessert map, but as the match goes on, the bush become brown and make it impossible to see the tank from afar.

Please do not play this game. game devs want money so much i feel sad that they are not embarrassed by the tactics they used to try and get money from your wallet.


The only reason this game is famous is cause it has a monopoly in the market. Its the only ""war simulator"" that is somewhat realistic, without being full realistic like needing to memories a manual to fly a plane, but.

The latest update is the best reason on why u shouldn't play this game. Instead of balancing and fixing the game, they decided to add shiny vehicles to earn more money. When asked why drones are added to the game, their response was, ""caused its a part of the modern battle field"", no one asked for it, people prefer balancing but instead shit like this is what they do.

This is the shittest game you will ever play in your entire life, with constant bugs, glitches in the game. Devs more focus on changing sound every other day, causing sound bugs,. Removing helpful features, making more premium vehicles, which are overpowered and hidden behind a pay wall. Bombarding you with message about how your premium account has expired. This is [b]not a free[/b] game, every time you die you pay a repair cost. from the in-game currency, which is used to pay for new vehicles and modifications. The repair cost is outstandingly expensive so is the price of vehicles that u have to grind for hours to get 1 vehicle, but a way to counteract this is by spending real money. Balancing is hilariously trash, with certain vehicles fighting way easier targets while other have to fight other. This is especially true with premium vehicles. The devs will not listen to your advise to fix the game, if you want a war simulator like game, go find another game and save your time, money and effort."
6535,fun
6536,good
6537,"i would recomend this game it  is so good i mainly like it because i want to be a army pilot

"
6538,WHERE IS THE DUCKS!!!
6539,Is very gud.
6540,Addictive to me
6541,"A really fun game if you like plans or tanks, its also way better when you are playing with someone who can show you the ropes. Over all the first couple of tiers are a blast not sure about the rest of the game however."
6542,For your own health don't play this game
6543,pro tip: don't play army
6544,gud game but too much grind
6545,"this game is awful, if you play this casually and don't spend hundreds of dollars on premium time and vehicles. If you don't want to spend money  you will get to maybe rank 3 on america, Germany, Britain, or Russia (good luck grinding anything else and good luck not being able to do anything in Swedish tanks until maybe rank 4) and start losing hope in playing the game without spending money and either give up or give in. just avoid the game, you want that F-14A? good luck, you want that Leopard 2A6? give gaijin your money. ill still probably play this game because im too far in but god i recommend you don't."
6546,wart
6547,"shrek is god, shrek is life."
6548,Airpwane
6549,"Fun game overall. From personal experience, you dont need to have a knowledge of what each plane,boat and tank can do. I mainly only play the aircraft battles but it makes me feel like I'm in a movie. P.S. This game is way more fun with friends."
6550,"pain, would recommend.
"
6551,good
6552,"Its a fun game overall, i had a fun time grinding down the russian tanks in my opinion 8.3/10 due to the fact that i had a problem with shells not registering after i shot something 3 times, but thats my gameplay. overall i think someone should get this if their into grinding to max level in games"
6553,"love it 
"
6554,"Just amazing , I almost wish they added planes and tanks from world war 1"
6555,it good
6556,"Its Aight.

Edit: this game is cancer but man is there nothing else like it so here i am still grindin"
6557,"Gaijin has set up a system SO inefficient to try to force people into paying premium. 
There is a reason why you will get tons of XP boosters and you will receive Silver Lion boosters MUCH less often. It's the same reason you get a 100% boost to XP if you buy premium and only a 50% boost to Silver Lions. 

Everything that comes out in the game has this mission of inefficiency in mind. New jets will come out to encourage people to spend money, not to improve the game. It's like a mobile app game just with more controls. Pay to win, different packs you can buy, planes you can only get if you pay real money. 

People have spent hundreds of dollars on a SINGLE airplane... But it IS free to play, insanely fun in matches, and you will climb to rank 4 planes pretty quickly. But after that, it's a CRAWL and premium is not cheap. For the money you could spend on another great game or two, $30, you get 3 months. You can only buy premium with golden eagles which is what you buy with real money. They funnel everything through Golden Eagles except the planes you literally have to fork over like $60 minimum for anything useful and in a useful tier. 

It is a cruel, blatantly inefficient game of progression. But hey, if you buy premium, you can put 4 stickers on your plane instead of 2. Gaijin doesn't even allow comments on any of their updates. Hmm... I wonder why. I just wanted to see what people had to say and Gaijin doesn't even allow that. There wouldn't be reviews if the game wasn't sold by a bigger and better company."
6558,"great game kinda grindy though
"
6559,i like flying
6560,spawn die spawn die SPAWN DIE SPAWN DIE SPAWN DIE SPAWN DIE
6561,"nerf russia, game will be shit until further notice"
6562,nice game
6563,Tank
6564,eh
6565,"Too painfully grindy, unless you like grinding for a month to research 1 plane ""great, now get the money to buy it somehow"" This game is fun for like week max then it gets boring doing the same thing over and over again, the only reason why people keep playing this game is the voice in your head telling you to keep going so you'll get the thing you want one day but you never will unless you spend a huge ammount of money on this game and from my perspective it is not worth putting money into this game, get some therapy instead to remove that voice telling you to keep going."
6566,"really bad game, do not recomend. :jug:"
6567,war
6568,"overall a very grindy game, however the combat makes sense (most times), visuals are stunning, many planes,ships,tanks etc, to choose from making yourself stronger and leveling up in this game makes sense, needing to play games for research, hence the grindy part. this game can be fun on your own or with friends, everything in this game is great with controls like planes turning at a reasonable rate, guns jamming, and only being able to shoot in one direction; in front of you. tanks turn slowly and give the game a bit of suspense not knowing of you will be shot during this time, bouncing up and down over hills will make your tanks cannon move along with the tank itself,not just locking it wherever you had it last,you can also turn your entire tank to make the cannon turn in the direction you want it to go even though it might be risky, however doing this could get you the advantage on your target. You cannot get the tanks cannon to go up completely, however they add a machine gun to most tanks in order to to shoot other tanks while reloading or shoot planes out of the air to support teammates, tanks also have crew members even if one or two are eliminated the others will still keep the tank going, this is one of the ways to eliminate enemies and the most common. The other ways are to target engines on tanks being much harder to do, but engines are not the only part of the tank that can be damaged, cannons, tracks, radiators, etc. can be damaged. Another way to destroy a tank is by hitting ammo, this makes the ammo explode most times killing all cremates inside the tank. this is my best detailed review of tanks and planes I hope this helps"
6569,Legitimately agonizing to endure but fun probably
6570,gun goes boom
6571,Prop plane's guns go Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
6572,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
6573,fun game to grind out if your bored
6574,i commited several warcrimes.
6575,"free game, me play"
6576,tank go boom 3x i start new game
6577,"You need to be a Masochist to truly enjoy this game... but other wise, it's just Bias suffering XD"
6578,Quite fun without all the P2W vehicles are overpowered for no reason
6579,Plane fast go up boom
6580,"terrble game impossible to grind out vehicles without selling the house to buy super expensive pay to win tanks
. also if your network has a hiccup or goes out you well be booted from the match and wont beable to rejoin it even if you got kicked at the beginning. the devs dont know how to balance shit so you have either something that is completly broken move down or something that sucks ass move up. dont bother with it chaps"
6581,Super cool game totally won't get Gaijined every game top tier is super polished and balanced :) CAS is totally balanced too Russian bias is real and don't forget u don't play to win u play to destroy ur enemies mental health.
6582,ok
6583,"- balance sucks balls
- high Br is only campers sniping from 2km with laser rangerfinders
- low Br is only experienced players sniping aswell from 2km, cause they already know the angle and distance
- Cant play Italians, cause repair cost of the Tank is 10k and i get 2k per kill...
- Just horrible overall, youre better off buying a Tank irl and having more fun (might be cheaper at the end) 
- No Premium = No Money = Buying Premium = Get used to the extra cash = Keep on buying again = End up broke irl
+ Its fun if you enjoy pain
+ Its like drugs, it harms you, but you just cant stop it"
6584,I'm almost enjoying my anger
6585,very good game the planes and graphics look very real.
6586,"This game sucks my pixie sized chode, and your mamma hot tell her hi for me and thanks for last night."
6587,vrehfawp
6588,Best jet fighter game
6589,good
6590,OL
6591,"This game is so mind boggling-ly horrible, the grind takes years and years, and without premium??? oh dont even try at that point. This game is one of the most addicting games ive ever seen, and i will still play it so i can sell my soul to the russian snail like an idiot. I might as well just go ""russia numba one"" with how much support i give this game.
Thank you for coming to my TedTalk"
6592,a-10 warthog
6593,realy good
6594,The secret to being good is playing ussr.
6595,game game
6596,"very gud
"
6597,plane make fly
6598,"good game
"
6599,it is a great game and a lot of fun
6600,Hate this game
6601,"if there was a ""maybe"" button for recommending, I would of put that. levels or tiers 1-4 are fairly easy to get to.. the rest is basically pay to win. still fun until you get to that point. Good time killer and fun at times."
6602,"this game fucking sucks man fix it
"
6603,If you dont care to give your soul to a game then this is a 11/10 would do it again if you had a second soul.
6604,gay ass nae nae baby
6605,the best game
6606,"Just, don't."
6607,Don't.
6608,"good
"
6609,"Awful

Simply put, awful, the base vehicles they give you to start the game with are completely and utterly useless, you need to fire an average of 10, 15 shots hitting the target to kill, they get one hit, two on you, you're dead.

Of course, you can get better vehicles, just need to pay the price of a full triple A game for each vehicle you want, 'nice'

"
6610,good
6611,"You will have you entire life burning before your eyes if you start playing this game. If I were you I wouldnt ever touch this game. Getting up a tier leaves you broke and if ur already broke you shouldnt play this game. Your family and friends will leave you if you touch this game. You wont have anything left by playing this, only ur pc, mouse, keyboard and screen, nothing else."
6612,if you haven't pretended to crash land your plane and re-takeoff then you haven't even played the game
6613,grindey but worth it
6614,its good
6615,"sometimes you love it, sometimes you hate it, but it is wonderful as it is."
6616,snail
6617,"this game is fun
"
6618,"very detailed real life fighter jets perfect if you want to fly fighter jets in a game!
"
6619,the game says its free but trully costs your life and all your money
6620,it is super fun and much beter than world of tanks
6621,game
6622,"The game is strictly pay-to-win and it is full of cheaters and it is the most unbalanced game that I have ever come across and I do not suggest any gamer to experience this garbage game even once. And it should be pointed out that the updates of the game are on dates close to each other and practically do not add anything to the game. And the manufacturer says that these updates are to fix bugs, but after the update, more bugs will be added to this garbage game. The production company does not care about the players of this game and only thinks about its profit from this game . Literally, this game was made just to fill the pockets of the developer company ."
6623,Very fun game
6624,"Honestly I have no idea why I'm still playing this non balanced, depression generating, life draining ""game""...  Pure masochism i guess..."
6625,Uptier very nice
6626,"when will they make high tier fun. its just repair costs and repair costs. we're forced to play low br and make new people's lives miserable

anyways, meh"
6627,if you want to cut your eyes out because of the t34's this is the game for you :)

6629,The FBI use this game to torcher terrorists.
6630,"my soul is gone, gaijin is forcing me to put this review down. please send help"
6631,very fun and good game
6632,"It's a great game ruined by a terrible economic model.

Finally grind your way to the higher rated tanks and 60% of your team will be people who have bought premium tanks and just bought one of them. So, they will die after 2 minutes and leave and 60% of your team will be gone instantly so you can't win. And this will happen in 80% of all battles.

Go a bit lower and your 1950s cool Swedish door wedge will be 1 shot from off screen by someone who managed to press the button fast enough to get the chopper with ATGM and you literally have zero defence against it. You cannot even physically point your machine gun at him.

And the 20% where it doesn't happen will be ruined by campers who are afraid to engage the enemy because the cost of losing their tank is too excessive to bear, so they hide and hope they can get to the end alive without actually LOSING money to play the game."
6633,Pay to win just look at the rip off prices of the dlc

6640,Its a good game but the servers kinda have bad ping is this for anyone else? also i have a delayed reaction time is this for anyone else? but overall its the best military game i have played

6645,"The match making of this game sucks big time especially if you're a new player. You always get matched against high level players on low tier tanks and my team are low level as well, How bloody stupid is that? LOL IDIOTS
"
6646,War Thunder is not a fun game. It only has fun moments

6661,if ur new definetly pick germany planes they get better every update
6662,Plane go whoosh
6663,absolute horrible game. Extremely pay and play to win. Unfun. bottom tier gameplay.
6664,hamburger
6665,"Pretty trash game. heavy bias in the game twords russians so if you want to win play them. along with all the pay to win vehicles that are indeed pay to win. grind years to get nothing, then get slapped in matches were you are eather such a high tier your basically invincible, or are such a low tier you are essentially just there for moral support. tank combat comes down to two things, wait or charge. 9/10 sitting in a corner with your gun trained at a location is the best move. i will say its the best tank game as far as looks, sounds and feels go for controlling tanks. however the armor dosnt work how it should, and spending 10-15 mins simply driving to get eather shot by somone sitting in a location all game camping it, or getting blown up by a plane is just.. well god awful. i cannot say much about the other modes besides tanks but if your going in for tanks just dont. all it will do is frustrate you."
6666,I really hate this game so much
6667,This is a cry for help the snail has been touching me ever since rank 2 dont let it grab u or else u wont be the same
6668,"good game dont over play it cus it will get frustrating but if you moderate your self its fun

6671,"This game is ok and fun. If you are the type of people that like war games, battle games, modern or older military type people, this game is for you and should try it out. It is super fun sometimes, and other times, super aggrevating, but over all, it is a ok game, I rate it a 6.5/10"

Pay for tank, pay for planes, pay for ammo, pay for training crew for new vehicles, pay for repairs every battle, pay for new slots, pay for upgrades... 

They try to squeeze the life out of you so you pull out your wallet, don't. ONLY for a couple more vehicle slots which should cost 5 bucks and no more. 

Great game hidden underneath a stinking pile of time consuming grind shit. 

And you bet your sweet bippy imma continue playin' it."
6678,"Well.. It's a great and beautiful game - can't argue with that - but if you aren't ready for the grind then this game is not for you. Despite being free to play, it takes year(s) of commitment and active playing to get to the top-tier tanks and planes. If you want to get straight at the modern warfare stuff, you probably gonna have to play thousands of dollars per playable country (idk haven't done the math, just felt right).

I started playing this game since its early days and still haven't got into any of the top-tier stuff with any of the countries (haven't even committed in any other than USSR, Germany and Allies...)

But all in all, great game, great fun, but nothing compared to the IL-2 Sturmovik game series when it comes to sounds and simulation.

Greetings from the world of VR."
6679,free to play and very fun highly recommend
6680,The game is fun. Be prepared for some grinding it is a good game. Also credit card is your best friend
6681,Vary good
6682,overall positive however since about 2 major patches back it has a habit of crashing every few matches which is highly annoying.
6683,can shoot people very good
6684,Fun
6685,"The quality of the game is decent and some of the battles can be fun, even if the game modes are basically just skirmish. However the reason I give the thumbs down currently is that the silver grind has gotten so bad you have to have BOTH a premium vehicle, premium time AND perform above the 50% mark to make any silver ingame. Otherwise you will ether not earn enough to cover the cost of a loss or you will only make like a few hundred silver when just selecting a crew for your new tank can be in the 120 000 silver cost AFTER you just payed 500 000 silver to get it...

Therefor I recommend people saying away from the game until such changes.
Those that say you can do this and that to earn disantly might be correct, but what they fail to tell you is that you BOTH have to have luck on your side (using gambles tokens etc) and to be skilled. Some of the tokens basically means you have to be in the top 5 to earn anything.

Even with premium time and premium vehicles, both air and ground, I have about 10 mid tier German aircrafts (no jets) I havent unlocked because I just dont have the silver to do so and that is in the context that I actually do perform well often.

In short, if you suck at video games. You can techincally pay 50EUR for a high tier premium vehicle and only be ""allowed"" to play it 30 lives (because you get 30 free repairs) before you are locked out for days because you lack silver to repair it. That shouldnt be possible, if you ask me, but it IS in WarThunder.

While I play this from time to time. I would recommend people that have never played to save yourself the hassle. Spend your money on another game and get more in return. WarThunder borders to a mobile game in pay 2 play."

6702,All in all very fun game. Displays the history of war vehicles from the 19th century. Takes a very long time to level up though which might not add to the fun if you are not a person who is into that.
6703,Good game
6704,"1. Worst MM Ever.. More or less stacked teams..

2. Bad map designs with open field around a zone.. making it camp harder/sniper harder and people forget to cap base.

3. 0 Pen or 0 DMG even with green indicator or weakspot shots.. crew die's yes but for some reason impossible to kill enemy. (Drive around enemy APHE in Ass but 0 Dmg to engine wtf.. Normal AP dmg to engine but nothing PURE RNG!)

4. Too many respawn's possible in planes fuck sake.. it feels like you got inf. as long as you camp in base and just line up for plane fight. (Ground Arcade Battle).

5. Crew Cost 50.000 for a crew i need for rank 1 tank should have a lower limit so your not limited on tanks.. (1st: 5000, 2nd: 10.000, 3rd 50.000! i don't even wanna know next!). [Some people said just take 1 of the rank 1 tanks and go full in it, and just research rest on the sideline..well i do want a could of possible tanks in battle to choose from]..

6. For some reason people are able to see across the map even if your not spotted and just spawned (through 100 tree's and bushes...is there some kind of cheat glitch?)

7. 1 Shot kill every single time if you hit enemy perfect front... but you can't kill them if you shot anywhere is, this is the worst game ever created.

I'm ending it here even if i still have a long list of negatives, but don't really wanna waist my time on this crap game.. Not gonna recommend it EVER!"

6747,"Not a bad game. Graphics are good. This is a game that evolves around money, no matter how good you are you cant kill a tank many levels higher than yours someone bought. We all have the option to spend money and get items, but, don't think your'e going to go far without spending your cash. I bought the USA and British stater packs, complete waste of money, don't buy it, items are very low level. As for other items, so to buy 1, yes 1 top tier plane, tank etc can cost you the price of buying a whole game! That's just a plain rip off! Game is full of micro transactions, deliberately set this way to make you spend money, but being this way you will have to spend big money more than once or give up your life trying to grind your way through."

6759,"Casually played for years, used to be that when I unlocked something I generally also had the lions to buy it. Not so anymore, even a few bad games at 5.0 br and you lose thousands on repair while a good game might only get you 10k. Cya warthunder it was fun but I'll never be able to crew and buy all I've unlocked now without spending money, which I'm sure would be eaten by repairs and rearms so fast it'd make my head spin.
TLDR:pretty much pay to win at this point and no longer a fun game to play casually."
6760,hahahahaha plane and tank go brrrrr
6761,this game is cancer. don't waste your time to that sh*t
6762,"very good game love it!
"
6763,its about yeah because when i did do was i thinked it was nice
6764,plane go brrrrrrrr
6765,"the price being ""free"" is a total and utter bullshit lie. the game is like a hallucinogen trip while getting kicked in the balls repeatedly. getting that one kill every 15 planes makes you move on just a lil further... if you install, get ready to give gaijin your soul and also your liver too because it will take you a millennia and another to get to tier 3. please uninstall before its too late

6766,"every single kid on this bad game runs into you , not fun and its dumb and annoying and dumb and it sucks and its bad and annoying all of them are stupid and annoying you cant even get your own kills cuz they team kill every 5 seconds with their annoying dumb beginner air plane flying techniques and its dumb"
6767,"air combat is fun but the grind is garbage, if you really wanna play just use biplanes"
6768,"its a good game but this game gives metaphysical retardation so play at your own risk.

have ""fun"" with this"
6769,good
6770,"so much to love about this game, the detail is incredible as far as the planes go.  from there its basically dog sh!t.  The pay to win is frustrating enough but the balancing just takes the the hate to another level.  when im in a 1.7 level plane there should be no way im going against a level 3 or better plane.  And eventually it ends up being a game of who can go slower and spin a circle tighter because teammates do not help get people off your back and you cant accelerate fast enough to get away from people.  Great potential, horrible execution"
6771,very nice
6772,"Would be a good game, but they let garbage players fly into people and award them points for it... sometimes their plane still flies afterwards.  People do it on purpose constantly, half my deaths are to some moron flying into me.  The other two modes (ground and sea) are dumb, poorly balanced and not fun at all."
6773,plane
6774,Honestly this is a amazing game i highly recomend it and thats it bye.

6792,"Although I do not have the amount of playing hours as other players do, I have thoroughly enjoyed unlocking all the mods for both planes and tanks. Something that I've learned is that you just gotta play for fun. If it's not fun, take a break or play something else. Don't try to actively grind for a specific vehicle, just play for fun and casually unlock stuff. This game has consumed me, with over half my play time being in the last two weeks. I think a lot of credit has to go to Gaijin creating this game with VR support. I have tried the VR mode with my HTC Vive and it's crazy that I get to experience all the planes I have unlocked in VR. The grind sucks and I think the game is mostly enjoyed in low BR tier vehicles."
6793,"Pay to win, If you grind without paying you are fed to players that pay. Controls are way extra and you never set a controller just right in this game. Nice graphics, good concept. Great game if you have no life."
6794,I love doing genocide
6795,i wuv it uwu
6796,"A God awful game with an unquenchable thirst for a Russian Bias. The physics are terrible and the tick rate is disgustingly bad. (The tick rate controls the latency of player movement.) They treat your common signing into the game as a joke, given you trivial rewards for signing in multiple times daily. I, as of writing this, am on my ~150th day of signing in, and I have gotten 150 Golden Eagles. That is the only thing worth mentioning. 

The games armor penetration stats are unrealistic and unpredictable. Planes get hit without a round colliding with them (TICK RATE!) You also can't change the round in your cannon breech without firing the already loaded round, because that totally makes sense. 
Ships are balanced terribly. 
Tanks are balanced terribly, and there are tanks that shouldn't be in the game, such as Artillery Vehicles, which are commonly found on the FRONT LINES! (They shouldn't be.) As well as tanks that were prototypes, such as the KV-220. And for the cherry on top: the German prototype Panzer VIII (The Maus) was removed on the fact that it was a prototype. Lovely, right? The Russian Bias prevails in many aspects of the game.
They allow spawn camping in their design, and do nothing about those who do it constantly. Last game, I was spawn camped twice and it has been this way for the 5 years I have played. The total ignorance of this serious problem says a lot about the developers, and is an absolutely disgusting oversight.

Also, planes and artillery is allowed in every game, for every player, on almost every tank; which is extraordinarily stupid. Artillery is spammed by every player who has it, which is impossible for one artillery battery to undertake. Planes bomb you all of the time, in ridiculous places and anyone can use them. They need a new TDM or domination game mode without PLANES AND ARTY! My Lord, how is that too much to ask for?
Modern tanks and planes fight WWII tanks in planes quite commonly. In an ME 262, it is possible to be hit by an Air to Air Missile, which the plane cannot defend against.
Ranking does not exist, so vet players can drop from max tier to min tier and kill everyone, usually by spawn camping.
The grind is also awful, requiring you to spend an exorbitant amount of money, causing the game to slowly become unfun. 

I could go on for thousands and thousands of characters, but I haven't the time or the brain capacity to comprehend this abhorrent pay to win video game.
I have played for 5 years across PS4 and PC, I still play it because it's addicting, but I hate most of the time I spend on it.


 TLDR:
Bad armor pen stats.
Prototype tanks are only allowed if they're bad or Russian.
A severe Russian bias is prevalent throughout the game.
You can't change rounds or mags in tanks without firing.
Their servers and their development of maps is terrible which allow you to be sniped and nudged forwards, allowing people to kill you easily, even from across the map and through rocks/buildings.
Their allowance of spawn kills and planes in every tank battle is blatant and obvious.
You fight modern tanks and planes at some points with WWII tanks.
Non-existent and prototype tanks are only allowed if they're garbage or Russian.
Players are allowed to spam planes and arty, causing death around every corner.
There is no ranking, so max level vets can play against noobs.
Awful grind that almost requires the spending of money.
Spawn camping is unbelievably common, and they won't do anything about it.
And they don't reward you well for playing the game regularly.

Gaijin only cares about money. They care not of their player base. Money is the only thing that matters to them."

6802,this game is not worth anyone's time or effort it takes to long to research tanks planes and boats as well as helis also you have to deal with the constant stream of cheats spawn campers and trapers the devs of this game do not care about the players only your money nothing ells the game has so many bugs its pay to win not only that but tanks are not where they need to be the german line is to over powered and there are tanks and planes that are not in the game as well as some bombs they do not want the american line up to be over powering for the 5.0 tire so if you wanna rage and get pissed off this shit game is for you takes you over 1 year just to get to 8.0 when playing on and off it

I do not want to spend 500 hours of my life trying to get the latest vehicle in the new update, and then another 500 because a new vehicle got released, and then the cycle repeats.

6832,This truly is the only game where you can have favorite tanks and planes in one game. even though this game is heavily pay to get everything its still kind to its free to play players. side note would love to see a me 262-1a/U1 night fighter with the radar equipment.
6833,This game is great yeah really... only if you like grinding whilst producing enough sweat to make europe and asia be flooded completely. its also great if you love raging breaking your pc/console and many other expensive items when yet again your tiger gets exploded by a t34 or a jumbo or like the time when a p51 mustang blasts your bueatiful spitifire in half with its ridiculous canons that scream freedom. This game is confusing full of bias leaked military info rage sweats try hards noobs trash moments and other warthundery stuff. but this game does have good sides there are great moments eg when u get a great kill or unlock a great vehichle or maybe the great realsim this game (usually) offers overall i hate it but do i and many others who hate it play it yes because we can and because why not. lol
6834,Dont play unless youre a masochist!
6835,"Not recommended because ""players"" can't play at all and ruin overall experience with their imbecility. CoH 1 is much better without that player trash messing up the game"
6836,it is  a good game
6837,hell
6838,GOOD

6843,fun
6844,"So I am clearly on BR 4.0. But somehow, the equipment for BR 6.0 could join the BR for 4.0. So what's the BR mean?
Second, the server couldn't detect the packet loss on the client. The condition is also much worst since players decide to exit the game just because couldn't play at the time and get a penalty because of that.
Overall, the graphic and the system for the game are just not that bad."
6845,Sweatin..
6846,ive only played for 37 hours and already this game is like getting tazed in your genitals whilst sitting in a pool of boiling water
6847,"This game is so realistic, my pc sounds like an F-16 when I play"

6853,"i have 450 hours on my other account, its not worth playing"
6854,i hate panthers
6855,"This game is actively bad with a predatory developer who's main aim is to make the player suffer as much as possible so they are force to pay unreasonable amount of money to ''have fun''. They refuse to polish and fix the game and just keep ramming out new content for people to buy.

If you see one of their adverts for the game you will see many cool modern tanks and helicopters you may be familiar with. Well, that tank will cost you £50, and that helicopter £50,  and that cool jet? another £50 (and this is for just one of the nations). Unless you have the time to put literal YEARS into this game, but then you will have a miserable time grinding towards the upper tier of the game.

There are many more major issues in this game, too many to list here. The game is rapidly getting worse."

6866,"This is my first ever Negative Review on a Game... I love Aircrafts and the Military in general a lot, so to be able to see some cool Aircrafts, Tanks and Ships that they occupy is Pretty Cool!

One Problem I have is the Grind... U have to Grind OVER 250 Hours just to get POSSIBLY get 1 Jet. Don't you think that is Insanely Absurd?! I'm not saying the games mechanics aren't bad as I have played a lot on console but its just the aspect of the grind that is ridiculous.

If this game just had a friendly match mode where you could use any aircraft and battle your friends all together then I would probably give this game a 7/10 but since it has RIDICULOUS LEVELING AND PROGRESSION I just Do not think that this game is worth sinking time into. 

You might as-well play DCS World or VTOL VR as they offer a much better experience and can either be realistic or not. 

My final review for this game is a 3/10."
6867,"Grind, balance problem, Playing the same map, and Russian bias. although thanks for the machine gun indicator although it took 8 years so suspicious."
6868,dont do it
6869,"Voice Chat feature only works about 65% of the time.

6870,this game is so fucking boring but I cant stop playing it 10/10
6871,Good Game
6872,worth the pain
6873,genuinely this game doo doo. the grind is trash. the economy is trash. and i don't feel like spending hours of my life looking at wiki pages that point out the weakness of the hundreds of tanks in this game.
6874,Got shot down 12 times in a Row got nothing to show for it 10/10
6875,taze your balls instead
6876,"After 1001 hours, and roughly 28 uninstalls, the game would be better with a GROUND only mode, rather everyone and their mother plays in a plane, while the others hitbox glitch more than WOT players, making any BR unplayable on the weekends The game also requires a literal no life to play, the grind is super long. Now while the game is free you will learn it is not. the price of the game goes as follows (sanity+soul)*mental health. 

The feeling of playing this game is like being around that 1 person you don't like, but he constantly joins.
The players of this game have no life and a bigger wallet for attempting to P2W the game. 
Gaijin will suck your soul, 
Gaijin can't make a good game,
Gaijin sucks.
Armor is a lie.


Simply put, do not play if you like having fun. This game was designed to cause as much pain as possible, and to induce as much pain as possible.

Only play if you miss the feeling of burning in ****
Edit: +1 uninstall, game still sucks"
6877,Why the fuck they nerf bombers so much
6878,"War Thunder. Its quite an experience. Is the game fun? No. Can you have fun playing this game? Yes absolutely. However there is so many things that are just frustrating about the game that really detract from it. One of the biggest ones is having to fight tanks a whole tier above yours which happens to me and can happen to others almost every game. This wouldn't be terrible if you could have the choice but unfortunately no matter what you don't have a choice. So you have armor that works great at your rank and oh look now your armor is pointless. Then there is the planes oh boy that's fun. I want to play a nice game of ground warfare and oh look I just got bombed, pretty much happens every time I spawn.So instead of having two separate ones like ground only and mixed battles where you can play both planes and tanks that would be fine but instead you are yet again without a choice. There are just too many things that are frustrating about this game to list, this is already more of a rant than a review at this point. So if you have literally nothing else to do and are an extreme masochist who likes torturing other masochists then you might as well try War Thunder."
6879,Suffer Thunder
6880,yes

6910,"[Second Review] No. Tired of Gaijinn removing the ability to talk to anyone, even your teammates. No reason for it. First instance I encoutered was during Russia's invasion due to the OG developer being Russian and having it scrubbed from the internet. No. Pay to win is real. You will be put in lobbies with PTW people who have vehicles that are seemingly immune to even the most penetrating ammo, angle doesn't matter. There is a real why there are so many TikTok videos indicating the ""SKILL"" issue BS that plagues this games

{First Review} [Regarding constant game crashes] Well, It started working again yesterday even before I checked my GPU driver

Still receiving game crash before even starting. 472 hours and it's only happened a few times. But been happening for days."
6911,"The game itself is great, a great free to play game with a good concept.
But the amount of pain that grinding it is is absurd. It's so grindy... and even with the boosters it's grindy.
Premium is a scam I wouldn't ever want to pay for it.

And the community is either terrible, or way too tryhard. I mean seriously, I wanted to get 4k lions off an air assault arcade game. 

This is me having had 128k and needing 132k and I got told to fly my 4.0 P-51 instead of my 3.7 P-51, and if i wanted to fly my 3.7 then I should get rid of my  P-51 and stop complaining about being a broke retard without knowing the battle rating system. Absolutely cancerous community. Would not recommend playing the game."

But what made me quit is the fact that I just noticed that my currency keept dropping for some reason despite me not buying upgrades.
After looking up the reason (I thought it was because I did rage quit some rounds), it's apperently because of vehicle repairing and amo refilling costs, and it only gets worse  the higher BR you are, you have to gain more than you lose, so you're fuckt as a new player... either don't get any progress or lose progress, I don't have time for this shit."

6996,"Ridiculous grind

Don't get me wrong, War thunder is, or at least could be a good game. Decent graphics, more variability between arcade and simulation as World of Tanks. And I also understand, that F2P games need to earn money somehow. But man, in WT it's just ridicolous.

I mostly played tank arcarde battles, sometimes plane battles. I rarely advanced to rank3/5.0 ratings and got stuck there. It takes an eternity to advance farer. Guess I will never see the high rank vehicles, which are shown in fancy influencer videos...
(Please notice that I already pay premium account, to double research points - it's like 10€/month which seems an accaptable abonement price).

Gaijin for sure offers you options to advance faster, by buying premium vehicles or convert more research points. But: 60€ for ONE f***** tank? 60€, seriously?
Ppl are complaining about Diablo Immortal, but games like WT leveld the way for time. That math was already done: Buying all premium vehicles would cost > 8k €. I couldn't figure out costs for converting points for normal vehicles, but should be way above 8k (not easy to calculate as it depends on your repair costs and success in missions).

This is just crazy. Dear gaming industry, please decide: Give me a decent game for an acceptable price OR give me an acceptable abonement offer, were I can access all parts of the game in relatable time.

War Thunder gives me neither. It let me pay for a de-facto abosystem(premium account to advance faster, but far away from fast enough) and requests ridicolous prices for A SINGLE VEHICLE. Prices can go up to 150€. I can get two full AAA games and some smaller indies for the price of one WT-tank, wtf. Shit like this is destroying gaming industry. 
Ain't anybody has time for this (grind)."

7021,ive been playing this game for 4 years but i only played it a little bit so thats why i have 364 hours it is a good game tho crazy how its free
7022,"The economy and balance in this game is terrible. Repair costs can put you into an economic downspiral, and you can consistently face tanks/aircraft a full tier above your lineup. For example, I am currently running the 1944-49 American heavy tank lineup (T34, T26s) and it is impossible to learn how to play them because you cannot *gain* silver lions without having a full on 3.0 K.D, which is absolutely ridiculous. Not only that, but I get matched against Type 61s and Leopard 1s - both of which have HEATFS rounds which can oneshot any of my tanks AND are far faster than my tank.

Map design is also terrible - large open maps may sound good in theory but in reality it can very quickly prevent one team from leaving spawn, and devolves into a sniping standoff in which most tanks don't get enough barrel depression in order to even be able to get anywhere. City maps have good design in general, would like to see larger ones if possible."

I no longer even find joy in killing enemies on the other team, the short lived joy from the tiny squirt of dopamine that was once released isn't released anymore. I only find mild solice in the thought that killing an enemy will be bringing upon them the hardships this game has bought upon me. This game will turn you into a masochist in where the only pleasure you will find in playing this game will be derived from the pain you will receive by playing it.

I'm hoping if you're here reading the reviews for warthunder you haven't yet decided to sell your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soul to the snail and download this plague on your computer, if you answer yes to any of the following question this game is not for you. Forget it ever existed, do not return.

Do you enjoy life?
Do you like more then 4 hours of sleep a night?
Would you like stability within your life?
Do you like having good relations with your family and friends?
Would you like to keep your job?


However, if you answer yes to any of these following questions this game is perfect for you.

Do you enjoy eating lead house paint and crayons?
Would you like to sit in front of a computer screen for hours a day neglecting every aspect of your life and finding no joy at all in what you're doing, all in order to unlock pixels that resemble a military vehicle only to die to a 13 year old Estonian child and his dad's credit card?
Do you have severe anger issues?
Would you like to pull each of your finger nails off with a pair of pliers?
Do you have no friends or want to lose them all?
Would you enjoy kicking a toothpick under you toe nail into a wall?"

7040,"A game I have been playing, on and off, for a long time. Although a lot different from when I started, and with it's flaws, it is a great game if given the patience to learn and progress.

It is a long, grind type game. So if that is not your taste, then will likely not be to your taste. But if you do not mind grinding, and like the WW2 time period, at least for the majority of the game, then it is at least worth a try. It is free after all.

Not pay to win, but certainly pay to progress faster. Premium account does allow for you to research new tanks at a MUCH faster rate, but nothing that cant be done buy spending nothing, although the grind can get pretty insane in late game... one of its major flaws.

I'd say it is one of, if not the best War sim out there and is worth a try if you are interested"

7058,"It's the absolute best free to play, easy to use vehicle combat game with options for low skilled beginners and options for taxing difficulty in higher difficulty simulator battles. All in all the community is generally welcoming and there's plenty of options for different types of battles and difficulties; ranging from Air, Ground, Naval, and Helicopter battles all available to play in a beginner friendly Arcade difficulty, a more skilled Realistic difficulty, or an all out Simulator experience. with support for multiple custom load-outs and control systems the ball is in your court to play however you wish."

7067,"This game has greatly affected me on a emotional, physical, spiritual, cognitive and financial level. I no longer even find joy in killing enemies on the other team, the short lived joy from the tiny squirt of dopamine that was once released isn't released anymore. I only find mild solice in the thought that killing an enemy will be bringing upon them the hardships this game has bought upon me. This game will turn you into a masochist in where the only pleasure you will find in playing this game will be derived from the pain you will receive by playing it.

I'm hoping if you're here reading the reviews for warthunder you haven't yet decided to sell your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soul to the snail and download this plague on your computer, if you answer yes to any of the following question this game is not for you. Forget it ever existed, do not return.

However, if you answer yes to any of these following questions this game is perfect for you.

Do you enjoy eating lead house paint and crayons?
Would you like to sit in front of a computer screen for hours a day neglecting every aspect of your life and finding no joy at all in what you're doing, all in order to unlock pixels that resemble a military vehicle only to die to a 13 year old Estonian child and his dad's credit card?
Do you have severe anger issues?
Would you like to pull each of your finger nails off with a pair of pliers?
Do you have no friends or want to lose them all?
Would you enjoy kicking a toothpick under you toe nail into a wall?"
7068,When playing this game I make sure to remove all human emotions.

7098,"If you enjoy Torturing yourself this is the game for you. But if you like to not waste hours of your time and hate evey single hour of it DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

It is not intuitive to get going, when you get it going it does not become intuitive.
The Balance is just Bad i feel like. And You always get seen by everyone in the Round you are playing and you can't see them for SH*T while activly trying to find anyone.

Reached Russian 5.3 / 5.7 Mid tier range"

7106,tra nii hea ma suren ära (veri on vardas)
7107,"Dont overplay it, just play it for fun idk"
7108,very clean game
7109,ONE OF MY FAV GAMES it is literly awesome i love tanks and aircraft and I hope i get the abrams tank
7110,"if you can't sit and grind a game for hours upon hours to reach the tip of the top on each tree, this isn't for you. If you can't handle games without health bars and displays upon which you can see your own and enemy health and stats, this isn't for you. If you dislike games that require you to be precise with your aim, require you to rely on teammates, or games that are relatively slow paced, this once again, is not for you. War Thunder is FREE to play, though pay to win in a definite number of ways, ultimately there are ways around it even for the poor man and the high schooler alike, it's got fairly decent graphics, even as far as great at the max if you can run it, the tanks are few and far between in terms of likeness, but accurate and an experience to learn and master. Me and my family have enjoyed this game both together and with friends we've made and simply joined squads with, from before ground when it was just planes this game was a blast, give the game until Tier 3 in a nation, also definitely try italy because they're fast and they f**kin deliver the pain pizzas. If you decide you really invest in this game, don't spend money on it until there's a good sale on golden eagles, then grab around 10000, ideally this sale will include premium days, because you want to buy 365 days of premium for cheap, honest to god the best thing you to can for yourself well before buying a premium tank is the on sale premium, life is much easier when you're not free to play. *This isn't to say F2P is impossible, honestly it's slow and tedious, and you could always buy a talisman (basically the 100% booster a tank you have to buy has) for a free tank that you really like at any time instead of the cost of buying a tank on its own"
7111,nice suffering simulator
7112,"I think this should be named ""magic thunder"" instead of ""war thunder"" but the game is pretty fun so you should play it."
7113,rage is bad

7115,so trash crashe so much so  bad
7116,"very good 
"
7117,"It's a good game but takes time to get goo planes, tanks, boats ect."
7118,"If you like tank warfare, War Thunder is the way to go. Combat is more realistic than World of Tanks.  WOT gives each tank a hit point pool that must be depleted to kill it.  WT is all about shot placement.  One good shot wrecks a tank. You have to play to your tanks strengths and be aware of its weaknesses.  Learn to use cover and angle your armor to bounce enemy shots.  Research is a bit of a pain, but if you purchase a premium tank, it will go much faster. Don't level up one line faster than another. Once you cross into the next tier, all your battles will be in that tier."
7119,Its Okay
7120,"absolutely fun, if your into a time consuming, fun, and detailed game, this is the game for you!"

7128,this game sucks it is a waste  of time do not play
7129,Grind is horrible but the casual gameplay every now and then makes it bearable 7/10
7130,"Don't buy this game, I've spent too much money on it.  The game is painful to generally play, it will never be as fun as Phly makes it look.  Good, luck to those who download this game, for this path is a path you will never financially and emotionally recover from.  Good luck, may God be with you.  Also TF2 is better #saveTF2."

7134,i would recommend this for someone who is new to this but likes these kinds of games because they are really fun
7135,very gud
7136,"Progression is slow, your slow, the enemy is fast, you can't kill anything, they kill you,"
7137,planes
7138,"As much as i enjoy the tank combat i can't recommend you get into war thunder unless you want hundreds of hours of misery and endless grinding. Ive put a little over 380 hrs into WT on PC and probably about the same back on console. Sure it might seem fun at first but once you get around to 5.0 BR (battle rating) you'll really start to see the grind and Gaijins predatory monetization, they will feed off of your frustrations by tempting you with premium and premium tanks. The BR Compression is absolute dog water and is an issue they will skate around. So while War Thunder can be very fun especially with friends it can be very volatile with your highs being pretty high but your lows being down right desk smashing rage inducing. Id have to give it a 5/10. It has a lot of promise and could be very good and it is at times but it falls short because of the devs being greedy and stubborn, they will be the death of their own game"

7154,very relaxing and fun totally not frustrating :)
7155,"This game is Heroin. You know it's bad for you, you know it is slowly destroying you from the inside out but you want it. You want more. You're sat there at work scratching your arms, clicking your fingers, thinking about the next hit - hmmm my next plane is 46,000 research and that's only around 40 more matches away, maybe less if I play really well. You get in, you fly, you've foolishly decided to play an interesting nation and then your tail is cut off in one burst of gunfire from a highly overrated American plane. You swear and throw your headset across the room, accidentally killing your cat - but you just click the next plane in your roster. Back in. Let's try again. You manage to get a kill and you feel the hot flow of dopamine hit your brain, you want more. You need more. You feel like if you stop nothing will be the same. I've been an alcoholic and quitting that was harder than not playing this game. 9/10."
7156,money go :(
7157,"Game is an absolute grind and if you arent very good then it can literally become pay to play. Maps are terribly balanced as well as the factions, may as well play as the soviets or dont bother playing at all"

7159,GOOD game

This game is actually pretty fun. I have enjoyed beaming the heck out of other jets and dropping 12 500lb bombs on AAA."
7184,sick game really good and good
7185,"I played this over WOT because people said this was more realistic and a simulation.
If this game is actually a simulation I don't know what they try to simulate. It ain't real life.
I gotta admit, drifting around with a *insert synonym for excrement as an adjective* river boat at 500km/h whilst vomiting torpedos in a cirkle was pretty entertaining for 4 minutes but the tank combat is so boring and the Dogfights are so boring and everything is just yawn inducing. 

It was an alright experiment and if you got literally 0€ and / or are still in school this would be your jam. otherwise don't bother."
7186,it shoot it good
7187,ww2 is the best
7188,okayyyy
7189,"The game is pretty good graphically and somewhat balanced, but don't get the wrong idea, War Thunder is no longer free to play (although most of the equipment is not unlocked), I think max level 3 is where you can more or less balance your finances to buy and maintain equipment, but if If you want to play with more modern hardware then you will find yourself in a situation that I call pay or suffer :).
So if you're going to thin your wallet then you'll enjoy it. if not, well you won't be the first to complain about the imbalance."
7190,"This game isn't fun, BUT it has fun moments."
7191,"Free to play, but you are gonna have a bad time if you dont pay them something. They are starting to add really stupid things that fall outside the scope of what this game is trying to be. If you want realistic and a sim, go play DCS. Otherwise prepare to hate the devs and everyone you know due to some stupid thing they have made op, or by not changing BR ratings. It used to be a fun game about 5 years ago. Now I re-install only to remember why I uninstalled in the first place."
7192,"Game currency is Silver Lions this is earned by completing battles. All the upgrades cost Lions, as does ammo replenishment and vehicle repairs. I have been playing ground forces so by the time you get to rank 3 vehicles if you do not play well you end up paying out more than you get in. This is after you have used the free repairs, so if you do not have enough Lions for repair you have to wait hours for it to be done. As you progress everything costs more so the only way I can see to get further is to spend a shed load of real money, and that is not going to be done by me."
7193,"Fucking Gaijin games, this is probably the one exception to what im about to say but either way, Gaijin has this odd track record of downloading a fucking virus on to your pc. I have not experienced this but one of my friends downloaded enlisted and then, to his knowledge, uninstalled it a week later cause he didn't like it, but when he goes and looks at his files to clear space for a new game, the enlisted launcher is still there taking up like 15gb of his hard drive. that said though, to my knowledge war thunder does not put a virus on your pc so its better than any of Gaijin's other games."
7194,"(Top Tier's summary at the end) Don't download this game if you think that this is a historically accurate game. If you want to experience this ""realistic and historically accurate"" game, expect that your pershing, panther, tiger, is2... will be fighting against cold war vehicles.

Ground battles are extremely stupid. You kill someone and they spawn with an aircraft and bomb you 20 seconds later(Enjoy your 5k repair cost.) Spawning a plane is so easy that ground battles feel like air battles.

For top tier: Let's say you were extremeley patient and  somehow you managed to keep your sanity and you reach top tier, well you will probably realize that the time and the money that you invested into this game has completely gone to the bin. Because top tier games go just like this:
1-Spawn and get killed by a helicopter from 10 km away or a yoloing helicopter wipes your team and they all leave the match.
2-You spawn again after the heli but this time an enemy positioned himself already so you will probably be sniped from stupid locations before you can leave your spawn. ( Some maps are so horribly designed that you literally spawn, drive 30 meters and snipe the whole enemy-Berlin-)"

7198,"If there's one game that hits a sublime balance, between calm and relaxing to exhilarating and vexing, its war thunder.

Indeed the road to grinding out the vehicle tech tree is tiresome, but that moment where one finally achieves a goal in unlocking a tank, plane or ship, then gets a win in it, well;  The best rewards are the ones we struggled for with a goal we knew we could reach, is the best I can explain the feeling that keeps bringing me back. 

GG's my fellow commanders, and the best of luck."

7215,"Fun game once you get the hang of it but the grind past rank 3 vehicles is crazy, if you want to get to shiny top tier vehicles pick a smaller nation like Sweden or Italy but really if you sit back and enjoy the vehicles you're using you'll have a lot more fun.

"
7216,"yeah, it's ok :)"
7217,"The grind is very hard yes but between low tier vehicles, and event vehicles (there are some that are very easy to acquire if you play at the right time of the year), there is enough easily accessible content for anyone to enjoy the game. It's up to you if you want to unlock higher tiers.

The problems with pay-to-win and cheaters are real, but fairly minor. Premium vehicles and camos generally don't offer an advantage, but bushed up tanks are very annoying. And most ""cheaters"" that people complain about are not actually cheaters, just good players, but a few cheaters do exist. The biggest problem is tank spawncamping, because of lazy map design that Gaijin has no apparent intention of fixing.

BR compression is mostly not a problem, despite the whining from other players. Only the highest tier heavy cruisers/battleships and jet planes face excessive BR compression.

If you buy some gold and play tank battles, I recommend that the very first thing you buy is extra crew slots and crew XP for your favorite nation(s). It will be a big help, in the long run more important than premium time or anything else.

(I have way more hours in this game, just not on Steam.)"

- Tank models are nice

Cons:
- Hits sometimes don't register
- Graphic settings massively impact how good you do in the game
- Objective based gameplay is horrible / executed badly
- Balance is non-existent (there are several battle ranks where you get up-tiered so much that you barely do anything to most tanks)
- In game economy makes playing high tiers extremely hard without premium + premium vehicles
"
7241,"Well here I am with five thousand hours, and I now look back to where I came from to get here other than a lot of great memories and used up time. 

If you are interested in a semi arcade, semi tank sim game and you have plenty of extra time and money this is it. The game has many pros to it, the massive amount of vehicles, interesting mechanics, and a fun repetitive loop of combat. It also has many cons, the massive amount of grind needed to get anywhere, the skill level needed to grind efficiently, map knowledge, compression etc. There are plenty of videos on YouTube discussing these topics and I would suggest viewing them if you are interested. 

However I don't think that much about what makes a game good or bad, as you can generally feel it once you've sunk some time into it. Since War Thunder is free to play I would suggest to download it and give it a go, albeit that you are likely interested in top tier game-play which you can't try out early on.I would suggest enjoying the game at your own pace, trying new things out as they interest you; and if you get bored you can always wait for the next update or event. 

Things you should consider is that if you are interested in grinding is purchasing some Premium time which very helpful for grinding, if not almost required. I would suggest getting a couple friends, a squad, or joining a Clan as they can give some great moments like world war mode. I heavily suggest learning at your own pace, and enjoying the process to top tier rather than top tier itself, as if you only grind for top tier you will burn out. 


War Thunder is pretty decent game all things considered.

7247,The combat is great! The tree to unlock stuff is MASSIVE. Fun flight fighter for sure!
7248,If you wanted to play a vr flight sim without downloading DSC this isnt it. Download DCS instead even tho its 100gb. The extent of this vr support is you can use the vr headset as a screen. You still have to play with Mouse and Keyboard which is just stupid. It also just doesnt have fun flying mechanics for planes. 0/10 dont play this game

[spoiler] my sanity will never be the same again, help me [/spoiler]


On a more serious note, this game is quite a fun game to play. With one big problem, which is what I mentioned above. The economy and the progression system needs to be reformulated a bit more, but overall the game is quite fun with all that holding the game back. If those got truly fixed up, then the game might be a lot better than it is right now."
7262,asd
7263,it was fun ig
7264,"This game is full of issues, though many players such as I still love playing it. Why is this? I genuinely don't have the perfect answer for it, because its just such a complex answer. If anything, it's probably that the game is a one-of-the-kind combined arms vehicle combat simulator. One moment I could be on the ground in a self-propelled howitzer helping my team out by taking out super-protected targets, and the next moment i'm in a fighter taking down enemy CAS. That kind of game play just doesn't exist anywhere else (at least from what i understand), and for that reason it is THE game that players like myself enjoy playing. Another part of it too is just how simple though realistic the game is too. Instead of big health bars that float above enemy vehicles, you have to take out individual components of the vehicle in order to deal damage. You also are able to control an aircraft with nothing but your mouse, and the way you can do it too is super intuitive and easy to use. Things like that is why i believe we as a player base love this game.

However, We as a community also hate this game, for many reasons. While I understand that programming is a difficult task to do (I program things myself) Many bugs exist in this game that are obvious and should not have made it past the development stage of each patch due to how common and obvious they are. One thing I will concede to Gaijin however is how they are actively fixing many bugs and making many things more historical, and from the time this Review is published there have been 56 patches that address many bugs, including the obvious ones. Another problem with the game too, is just how monetized it is. A single vehicle can cost $60, the same as a vehicle in DCS, though DCS vehicles have so much more to them than a War Thunder vehicle. These vehicles however can be more than powerful on the field when used by the right person, though ruin entire matches soon after a sale, when new players get into a vehicle with an insanely high skill floor. 
Yet another problem with the game is the game play itself. It has gotten incredibly stale over the years, for example there is only 2 match types for ground battles over the almost 10 years that the game has existed. Sure there are new maps that you can play on, but capping one or three points doesn't change much no matter the fancy new visuals (not to mention some maps are just absolutely awful to play on). This can be remedied of course by adding new game modes, but it is unlikely that Gaijin will do such a thing.

So in short; The game is a one of a kind, and is fun to play if you DON'T take it seriously or try to grind. However, the game's monopoly on the combined arms multi generation vehicle combat genre has led to painful monetization, poor implementation, and stale game play."

7361,"Only buy this game if you want to play as russian tanks. Gaijin has been struggling for far too long to make this game polished and unfortunately has completely destroyed the ability to play as any other tech tree. The game has a repair system very similar to World of Tanks and for some reason they decided to make tanks cost more based on ""potential"" instead of statistic. Heavy weight tanks are obviously going to be more expensive as a result of being able to take more shots... but no, they decided that (particularly the british) the tanks would have repair costs based on active win ratios of global players. As a result, some of the most unplayable british tanks are insanely expensive to repair, such as the fv4005, fv4202, and the conway are all tanks that CANNOT survive a single shot from anything else in the tier, but they all cost 6k+ silver lions to repair. If you want the context of what silver lions are worth, Russian tanks in the same rank that are heavier and much more strategically advantageous, cost 2 to 3k less. such as the SU 122. which might even be a higher rank ffs.

The best part is how painfully obviously garbage this system is. Because higher rank vehicles are as cheap, if not cheaper than where I am at right now. I cannot progress in the British tech tree because it loses me so much money.
I am also progressing in the Isreali, and german tech trees, and I just do not have the same problem.
The inflation of repair is most notable when comparing the German and russian tanks, with any other tech tree. If they really do want to keep announcing regular ""its fixed!"" updates, then they can start by making the game playable. In the meantime, im just gonna play world of tanks. IT TRULY IS EMBARRASSING how poorly thought out this game is.

If you're only in it for planes then your good. The developers care only for aviation and that section of the game is very good. No complaints there.
If you want to play blue water or coastal. Dont.

EDIT: This game seems to have a community VASTLY superior to WoT... therefore I am going to move back to it... GG."

TL;DR: Fun game, many tanks and planes."
7364,good game just hate rockets that is all i have to say
7365,"[h1]Best war vehicle simulator at the core, worst game and community on the outside. [/h1]

 That is pretty much the TL;DR. Without sugar coating - this game isn't worth your time/money/nerves. Any positive review for this game you see is from a player who either didn't play this game enough or is one of the people who are ruining this game, there is no in-between.

 There were several attempts at writing this review and honestly I could never summarize my hate for the community, moderators, developers and anyone related to this game. So instead, I'll just explain with my experience playing as a Japanese nation main.

 I've beta-tested this game both in aircraft and airplanes, hence I did try several nations before settling on Japan. Japan is a minor nation, Gaijin (developers of the game) hate minor nations, especially Japan for some reason. They [developers] disregard balance and only appeal to major nations, because those have the most paying customers. To give you a few examples:
[b]1)[/b]
[b]A6M2 Model 11[/b]
[b]Nation:[/b] Japan
[b]Battle Rating:[/b] 3.7 (BR is a number used by the matchmaker to make ""balanced"" fights)
[b]Introduced:[/b] 1940
[b]Survivability:[/b] no armour, no speed, relying only on the ability to turnfight
[b]Armament (that matters anyways):[/b] two 20mm cannons with 60 rounds each 
[b]Repairs and Gains:[/b] Repair Cost 3165; 90% money payouts and 130% research gain

[b]P-51C-10 Mustang[/b]
[b]Nation:[/b] USA
[b]Battle Rating:[/b] 3.7
[b]Introduced:[/b] 1942
[b]Survivability:[/b] decent armour, a lot of speed, bad at turnfights (not that they need them anyways)
[b]Armament:[/b] four 12.7mm MGs with 280-350 rounds each
[b]Repairs and Gains:[/b] Repair Cost 2888; 130% money payouts and 136% research gain

These are stats for 2 aircraft for [b]Realistic[/b] Air Battles. This is what Gaijin considers to be Realistic and fair to both sides. 

[b]2)[/b]
 And that problem is at a decently low Battle Ratings. Some time ago when I wasn't playing Gaijin decided: ""You know what? We need more money, let's sell overpowered vehicles!"" and so they started doing that. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough, so they said: ""How about overpowered premiums of the highest rank in the game that could be bought by any noob and essentially ruin the gameplay for everyone?"". Those decisions now plague high Battle Ratings. If you spend enough money - you can get a jet plane that's faster, more maneuverable, has better guns, has countermeasures, cheaty rockets in comparison to any ""normal"" jet at same BR; same goes for tanks. Essentially you get a pay-to-win vehicle that might as well be considered a cheat. (Sidenote: 80% of players at BR 8.7-10.7 in Air Battles are using a p2w vehicle, it's extremely not fun)

[b]3)[/b]
 With all that in mind - imagine if a player without a real life (usually 10+ thousand battles) takes a premium of a major nation. Yes, the match becomes utter garbage. And you know what? You can't curse at him, because you'll get reported and moderators (who are probably without a real life either) will mute you for 15 days. Think about it for a second: [b]in a game that heavily relies on chat communication, because developers weren't smart enough to make good chat commands; in a game that has 18+ pinups; in a game that has a built-in chat filter that's enabled by default; you can get muted for 15 days because you cursed at a player that was ruining your game experience by abusing pay-to-win[/b]

 These examples unfortunately don't even begin to uncover all the problems this game has, but the review will be too long and more of a rant otherwise. You can't complain to Gaijin about any of the above, because they don't care, will probably ban you and delete your post or just completely ignore it. The Gaijin that made War Thunder a decade ago isn't the same Gaijin we see today. It's full of greedy people nurturing a community that can't play without paying and essentially killing the game."

7380,so fun
7381,"really hard grind but is extremely worth it and, yes take breaks, but always keep going as you will be rewarded later. Also, if you are grinding, don't get to attracted to starting a new country, this will slow you down and will make the game a longer grind, pick a country and stick to it. Cheese"
7382,FUK RUZZIA!
7383,:D
7384,"sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my jet engine sending me to space"
7385,"I love the graphics on this game,there are so many planes, tanks, and ships to choose from and so many games to play"
7386,fucking snail
7387,"God help me, the addiction has kicked in"
7388,"warthunder is a lot of fun especially in high rank. the only problem is the endless grind that starts to be a problem at rank 3 - 4 or you can buy a premium vehicle and finish a whole tech tree in a few days to weeks in the low tier you make quick progress but you quickly notice it as a f2p player it takes several months to get to tier 6 - 7. i've been playing warthunder since 2018 by downloading it from the website and i've only played actively for 1 - 2 years and haven't even completed a tech tree. If you have a lot of time the game can be a lot of fun or you can pay to progress and have fun. Before even starting to play you should learn the most game mechanics like angling and sniper or taking cover. If you buy an premium vehicle its really balanced and not overpowered it just grants you way more rewards.

Overall its an nice game to play if you are bored"
7389,super cool game
7390,"I went bold due to the stress from this game. Is shit.
"
7391,"if you like grinding you´re soul away or buy your way up to top tier go right ahead and play otherwise STAY AWAY,  it is addicting!"

7398,"Good realistic tank game, when you are tired from tank battles you can go to air and naval battles"
7399,is like fortnite
7400,"The gameplay is extremely fun, but what kills this game for me is when you have to pay the consequences of dying. This makes player behavior very selfish by baiting teammates to go first into objectives to trade them instead or throwing the game so that they'd survive and not pay for the repairs. 

The game does not encourage good behavior by playing the objective to win. You play to not die."
7401,fun game
7402,Enjoying a lot.
7403,its seems like a job you give salary to it you like at first then this job becomes a religion consume a lot of your time and your motions you became angry then happy until you are a robot

7410,"Don't waste time. If you want to play, be ready to grind all the time."
7411,GOOD AS HELL EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS
7412,"This game is amazing! easy to master, fun to play, it has a wide range of aircraft, tanks and boats that you can use, the graphics are good, not many bugs and it doesn't lag much. War Thunder is a really fun and enjoyable game so I strongly recommend getting it, and even better IT IS FREE!"
7413,i hate this game and myself for getting addicted to it
7414,"""Ground"" RB more like CAS RB lmao. Nothing like getting killed by someone who spawned a light car, held down W to an objective and respawned to be able to kill everyone on the map without issue. AA is most vulnerable to CAS but gets almost no reward for shooting them down. Tanks are balanced based on player performance metrics alone so Wehrboo filled Germany gets impenetrable tanks at multiple BRs. Very high repair costs that provide perverse incentives. 

This is a game that is only popular because it doesn't have good competitors that provide something similar, with WoT being too arcadey."
7415,"This game is not fun, but has fun moments. If you get an booster over 100% gl surviving and killing tanks, aircraft and naval"

7419,"TO BE CLEAR, I love this game, to an unhealthy degree. And frankly it's WHY I do NOT recommend this game.
This is not a bad game, it's extremely addicting and even the grind is fun as it gives reason for the player to return, there's a BIT of pay to win but frankly it's not as bad as other titles of this nature. 
The problem this game has is that it's TOO good. You will NEVER want to stop playing this game and will never get anything done. I truly suggest avoiding the title if you're easily addicted to games like this because seriously. you will never stop playing it."
7420,I recommend this game if you want to spend your life savings on premiums.
7421,"good game to be addicted 
"
7422,3 steps to keep the game alive. 1 kamikaze 2 Kamikaze 3 Kamikaze
7423,"It's very addictive and has very good graphics and is very detailed. But when you get into a game you'll probably get frustrated by the unbalanced matches and unfair deaths. It's very pay to win and progressing in the game takes ages. I never bought premium and after 2000 hours I've not even come close to unlocking a modern tank. Maybe if you're willing to put loads of time and money into the game as well as having a quite powerful computer and actually focusing on becoming a very skilled player you'll have more fun than frustration, but I decided that despite the frequent urge to play the game, it isn't worth it as I always feel worse after playing. Now I get to sit back and laugh every time the player base complains about each new update somehow making the game worse. It's very clear Gaijin doesn't care about its players, and each decision it makes actively makes the game worse, so personally I can't recommend wasting your time on this game no matter how attractive it looks. It's a great concept with terrible execution."
7424,GOOD
7425,great game it so good
7426,"noice

7427,"It's a free tank and aircraft combat game with great detail and decent graphics.

7442,"Its fun, but will waste so much of your time and money once you get too into it, lots of lag as well, so expect that.

7452,good game
7453,"- Good Aim
- Big Learning Curve
- Sadly player base isn't big
- buy joystick for $60 you wont regret it
- Avoid spending Real Money to attempt to Pay to win cause really it's not u can skip teirs but you'll still do shit and be shit and will still have to progress there and wont help the progression speed
- If you wanna spend money spend it when your almost at the teir or already at the teir - still not much benfit but it is kinda nice"
7454,good game very addicted to grinding there are some fun moment but the battleships are the worst gamemode
7455,one of the most frustrating games to play. at first its fun but the way the game is inherently setup you quicklyt stop feeling like you make any meaningful progress in both unlocking new vehicles and in skill
7456,this game is so bad i honestly cant describe my hatred for war thunder the grind is stupid it makes you want to pay money the battle rating is completely broken this game is a steaming pile of thunder

7466,"This game is a trap. It seems fun at first but that is just so that you form a habit.
Once the habit is formed it becomes a grindy paywall that is dominated by pay to win mechanics like bush camo witch negates your ability to see silhouettes i.e. the human eyes primary identification method.  

I have almost 500 hours on one faction free to play, still nowhere near jets or helos.
You aren't going to fly jets unless you pay.
You aren't going to fly helicopters unless you pay.

This game is a trap. do anything else with your life,  don't give it to this."

7477,plane go brrr
7478,"Look, free to play and no complaints. Yes, you can pay to win. However, skill does in fact matter more. You will see people with paid vehicles getting wrecked by people who know how to play. Nonetheless, there is a ton of grinding if you want to reach the higher ranks without paying. 9/10, if the grind was just a slight bit more reasonable for free-to-play players it would be perfect. I love this game and have played this game prior to Steam release. [paid premium one time; paid for 500 currency one time]"

7486,"I like the gameplay, but I cannot stand the grind. I like causal games, but as soon as I unlocked one T4 plane, I got shredded in those lobbies. After losing my only T4, I had to fight with my significantly under powered T3 planes. So, even though I have a T4 plane, I cannot leave T3 lobbies until I either 1) level my existing plane higher, or 2) unlock other planes in that bracket. Regardless, I am behind everyone else and stuck in T3. Either way, get ready to grind out credits and research."
7487,"Honestly, Ignore the people who scream pay to win, who cry about the grind. The game is fun and unique. If you like WW1-2 era tanks, this is the only game for you to be honest. Yea some of the cooler tanks are locked behind a paywall, but if you have 300 hours in the game, they kinda earned the 66$ price don't ya think? Anyway. It's a good game, predatory business model for sure. You can win with any freemium tank though. Check out the 2.0 American tank m22 and you'll be able to kill any tank with that thing.


Im 200$ deep. Help. Help. Help.

With a little bit of practice you can have lots of fun in this game. As far as I've seen there is no game like War Thunder that will give you the same joy and satisfaction as killing tanks in a singling shot and bouncing shells from everything"

7525,It appears the Russian tanks are overestimated in armor and firepower. This needs to be correct on all tanks in armor penetration and armor.
7526,"Never in my gaming life will I recommend this piece of garbage of a game. Before you guys jump into this game, prepare for the most camping opponents you'll ever see in your life while also having team mates that have a lower IQ than a NPC in a rpg game. Constant freezing of games while if it even performs it's just for a glory moment of 10 minutes that this game is even consider fun. Then back to the upmost bs of the game can offer you. Take it from me, you'll never see rank 5 or higher without putting major time into the game or the help of the monopolizing your account to premium. Even at that I would just stick to grinding it out, just so you can see how bad people can be at higher rankings."
7527,"in terms of money, this game is free 
in terms of time and your soul, this game will take it all away from you 

decent game though"
7528,Pretty fun
7529,"Gaijin obviously wont listen to this but the game is way too grindy, you can advance to a certain point but if you wont to get to the modern stuff you have to pay for premium or be a god at this game. if you're thinking of playing this DON'T, RUN WHLIST YOU CAN AND SAVE YOUR WALLET AND SANITY!!!"

7542,becomes repetitive and boring quickly and after 24 straight losses due to incompetent team mates I quit/deleted
7543,"Game has some annoying issues..

- Pay to win... but that's to be expected
- Not very balanced, there's a lot of imbalance in the maps and the tanks.
- The maps are pretty bad, not as bad as in World of Tanks but still...
- The lighting in this game is really awful. Shadows are way too dark but the snow burn your eyes.
- Nuclear sun. I get a lot of nuclear sun maps which are awful and most of the time unfair for the team that has to fight while looking at it.
- It's a grind to get anywhere. This may depend on your personal preference if you like this or not.
- 6.0 and up I almost exclusively get uptiers
- Air battles are incredibly boring, it takes a lot of time taking of and flying to battle. I try grinding my planes in ground RB but that takes a long time.
- Spaghetti code. The game is 10 years old it's to be expected that it's not very well optimised, and it isn't. I go from 140 FPS to 60 often, which is annoying.

I have to say one thing, I haven't played 7.0+ BR, but from what I've heard it's not great compared to lower BR's.

Should you play War Thunder? 
Absolutely it's a lot of fun.
I just can't give the game a thumbs up because I feel like the devs don't play their own game and their only goal is making money."

7545,"Game is okay, unbalanced and built in a way where you need to spend hours on hours if you chose the wrong faction to begin with. In terms of Gaijin, they're quite the disgusting developer/publisher, the game is doing alright but it's quite simply a predatory setup with 0 regard for the player.

Don't spend money, if you don't enjoy a faction at the beginning, reroll early, it doesn't get better."
7546,Слава Україні!
7547,"Gaijin is a lazy, greedy developer and Warthunder is an example of why a monopoly is bad for the product and consumer.

Problems with the game.

-Arbitrary 'Balance' decisions based on average player performance rather than actual vehicle performance. The same vehicle can have different BR and repair costs because the average player performance is higher in that nation.

-Similator mode forgotten about. Teamkilling is unavoidable because many nations have clones of the same vehicle.

-Flight and Damage models are often dodgy and never get fixed because the developer is focussed on making new content rather than polishing the game they have.

-Repetitive gameplay and non-existant map design. 

-Matchmaking BR compression is laughable. Vehicles designed the 40's regularly face vehicles from the 70's LOL

-The devs have nerfed the income in recent patches  and the above mentioned vehicle costs make progression impossible unless you Kill multiple enemies per death which hilariously will over time increase the repair cost for the vehicle. What a joke.

-The high repair costs and low rewards incentivises a cowardly base rushing and campy play-style in groundbattles and Kill mobbing like the seagull scene in Finding Nemo in Airbattles. 

-The Gaijin store requires you to spend money within a year to use it even if you have spent $100's in the past and came back to the game after a hiatus.

-If you measure the grind by event rewards playing this game is effectively like working half american minimum wage.

The game is simply not fun to play and the company has earned the right to go out of business as soon as competition emerges. Gaijin has straddled this niche and should be punished for their short term money grubbing mindset.
I would not recommend this game to anyone who hasnt played it for years in the past and unlocked vehicles from before the RP system.  The time investment and grind simply is not worth it. Go outside, touch grass, find love and live a real life."
7548,if you like grinding ur life out youll enjoy this game

Edit: Stay in low tier and play for free. No point in making this game your second job just for the right to be one shot in your 7 br tank twice a day. 

Seriously, only play this game if you feel too good and want it to stop.

This game is essentially LoL but with armored vehicles, meaning that the people are just as toxic, sweaty, and don't shower. Don't bother buying a high tier premium tank just because it makes the grind to your favorite modern Tank/Plane/Helicopter easier, trust me, you'll regret going up to that tier without having experience, stay at low tier where it's actually fun, where you can get away with goofy shenanigans.

7597,Spend hours grinding higher tiers. Get to BR 5.0....    want to kms. Push on get to 6.0-7.0 have some fun moments. Everything else? Aids. But Tomcat cool though :) p.s. i hate the Panther D
7598,uhh reallly like
7599,Makes me sad
7600,ITS SO FUCKING LAGGY EVEN WITH THE LOWEST GRAPHIC SETTINGS!
7601,"twice
"
7602,i
7603,its just good
7604,pog
7605,the game runs much better than i though! it can get up to 110 fps with a gt 64 bit 1030. i exspected it to get to like 50 fps but the game isnt too graphic
7606,steep learning curve but rewarding.
7607,Very fun indeed
7608,good game it aint a warcrime if i win
7609,NERF M4 PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7610,"Arcade is highly recommended to start out. Realistic does give you more in terms of rewards, but you have to play it knowing you can be one shot, or shot down by anywhere. Blindly rushing any objective can end poorly 9 times out of 10. Work with your team, join a clan or platoon and learn from them. They have good tips and tricks. For tank battles I can't recommend using binos and range finders enough. They are helpful and can save you from being sniped from across the map. Don't forget to angle your tanks when fighting, and this goes for both your hull, and turret. Missed your shot? Rotate it left or right to ricochet the incoming round. Can't pen the frontal armor? Aim for the barrel, or if he doesn't notice you wait for a side or rear shot. Tracking enemy tanks to potentially sacrifice your tank, but guarantee his death via team mates is always a worthy play."
7611,ita nice i like it would not recon for players that dont have much time on there hands
7612,I put 4 days worth of my life into this and feel like I've aged 40 years.
7613,gud
7614,Dont Start playing if all you want to do is play jets. it will take 250+ just to get to your first jet and most likely over 600 to get cold war era. just accept you will be stuck in props for a while.
7615,"nyes
"
7616,"The damage model in this game is awful. Constantly just railing enemies with shells from every angle I can find and nothing happens but ""Hit"" If you ask the player base for help all youll get is the same BS speech ""Well thats because we know what were doing, sorry youre trying to play a game that makes players think"" like hey dingus, im asking you for help here. But nope.
Should you get this free game? Absolutely not, walk away."
7617,very nice game i like
7618,"This game is good and i like it, but i rate it a no. There are a lot of reasons, first you have to grind a lot in this game, second as time progresses and you climb the ranks up, your behaviour would probably start get more angry. Last but not least the dlc pack are over priced. You can get a better game with $60 or you could feed a whole family from McDonald's. I would recommend you NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME. Unless you like pain or does not have nothing to do. Still the game is still pretty good."
7619,Plane go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
7620,"If you like grinding get this game, if you like learning mechanics and TACTICS get this game, if you like planes get this game. War thunder is a free game so expect to open your wallet if you want to progress faster, it never requires you to do so. I'm currently sitting at tier 5 jets and I love this game but be warned it is not for everyone. If anyone wants to squad add me Dracks2"
7621,Good.
7622,I hate it
7623,"the snail will reach you even when you dont think its there, its there, its always there"
7624,its an epik game
7625,Its fun at first but after a few hours of gameplay i started to hate everything about it.
7626,this game is trash do not get it if you like sweaty lobbies and the game constantly f%$^ing you by putting you in higher battle ratting tanks just so they can squeeze a few bucks off you by making you buy premium DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
7627,"This game is to full of people running cheats, every round 1/4 to half of both sides are running cheats to allow them to speed boost and kill instantly or to repair while in the air without the need to land, then there is inf ammo and the list just goes on and on.  This could be a great game but until they clean up the cheating there is pretty much no point to play it at this time."
7628,hgjhghfghfg
7629,"Great game, even more fun on simulator mode with Hotas joystick"
7630,yes
7631,Russian Bias
7632,"the game is free, but the cost is a little bit of your sanity."
7633,9/11
7634,"uh. game! thats for sure! its... its game! i think it is... eh. only if you want hurting! 24-7!
graphics decent
game fuin i guess
very grindjingin
youll never get top tier!!!
dont trust gaijin!
also dont buy anything! it isnt worth it"
7635,great graphics
7636,"I played a couple games as a plane and tank and I was overwhelmed by the volume of things to do, all of which seemed to take a lot of time. I'm an old WoT Blitz player and I don't want to touch something like this again."
7637,I am beefy tank boy.
7638,"The game is decent, I'm a plane nut, so I've really only spent my time so far on aircraft, and though the flight controls could be more realistic, it's good for any average joe to pick up on to get into the dogfight, but I'd rather someone I'm fighting know how to fly, and not just follow a 5 minute tutorial on how to use your mouse to fly a P-51 Mustang, that's just not how it works. The P2W aspect of the game is also quite disappointing, as for a multitude of reasons, first, I would like to fly certain models of aircraft without having to pay, and go up against other players. The Test Flight procedure is quite nice for flying that craft, but I would like to fly and attack other people. Secondly, there are some seriously jacked planes that will beat any other in a dogfight, higher tier specifically. The USSR has a Bi-Plane with high caliber machine guns on it in rank II, that can out maneuver any other craft and gun it down with ease. Third, and last, the pricing for most of the DLC you can order, are above 30 US dollars, usually, and it's all really overpriced. Overall, the game is great for experiencing what a skirmish would look like during either of the world wars, the Korean war, or the Vietnam war. The variety of aircraft is great, plenty to choose from, and it's almost completely realistic. I do recommend this game to others if they are willing to grind a little bit for their most loved aircraft, as I have gotten some that I am satisfied with and can dogfight with great efficiency. Good game."
7639,SOUND GAME
7640,this is a fun but hard game
7641,fun game definitely a large skill ceiling. and all around a good time with your friends

7661,i love this game but sometimes i get salty
7662,"When you first start playing War Thunder, the need to get new tanks is big but not so hard after all. After setting foot on the tier II land, you will start to understand that this game is not so easy after all. At tier III, you feel your time being wasted as you try to get to that king tiger u really wanted at the start of your journey. When you reach tier IV, you realize that this game costs more then ur time. Is it worth it? Depending of how strong you patience and you wallet really is, yes. Its fun, sometimes..."
7663,yes suffering is delicious
7664,"Good game but gets VERY grindy at rank 4+
Also, learn the game BEFORE you decide to buy a top tier premium for 60 dollars and do nothing trough the entire battle (unless you get destroyed in the first few minutes, match upon match)."

7674,"I very like the game there is a lot of controls and a realistic flying experience there are also different game modes and different planes, tanks, and battleships to unlock as well as different countries"
7675,My Soul is falling apart more and more but I cant stop.
7676,"Really fun and nice game, destructible items. Graphics are amazing, theres alot of grinding to get more vehicles especially in high levels but its worth it.

7680,This game is Dog shit it takes you around half of your life to be able to rank up your planes and tanks i do not recommend this game to anyone unless you are on your death bed.
7681,"This game is like world of tanks, warships, and planes but so much better. Five out of Five. The grind may take a very long time to get new vehicles but its definitely worth it."

7718,this game drained me of all hope for my future while i consistently played it. and got me addicted to gambling
7719,"Grindy, but don't spend money and unlock a whole tree and you will improve as a player. If you attempt to buy higher tier items or vehicles, you will be placed with better players and enemy gear. Don't take extreme shortcuts with this one."
7720,"great game, can be grindy and frustrating until you learn the individual vehicles, but is very rewarding when you do well"
7721,"good game, thats all."
7722,Tank game without the WoT bs would recommend but the grind is horrendous. And it feels like getting in a match after like 3.0 everyone is out to get you and nobody but you also enemy planes can go suck my ballsack
7723,Fun
7724,"I have played this game for 6 years, I play nearly every day and hate it and the grind with every fibre of my being. It's my favourite game. Would highly recommend if one doesn't mind a little mental torment in order to progress."
7725,the grind is real
7726,cool fun
7727,great alternative to World of Tanks. Though the micro transactions are hella expensive. And the game is horribly optimised.
7728,The more you play this game the more addicting it gets. Playing war thunder is like a crooked stick going up your butt not a fun game unless you play as japs or germans
7729,"the funny snail has my family

good game if you dont take it to seriously
(play china and italy)"
7730,Fun but grindy game when it comes to ranking up in tiers but if you have the time and patience to play war thunder then it can be a great experience.
7731,figured out how to sex the plane!1!
7732,"Early Game

Game fun for thew first 10 hours and only in tier 1 get to tier two and be constantly up-tiered and die in 1 hit from a tank you cant see from across the map the grind is absolutely unbelievable you realize at about mid tier 2 and early tier 3 ground combat isint even fun anymore and i completely regret every second that ive played ground combat. Aviation is pretty cool tho and each time you die it just really feels like a skill issue and not a How much money have i spend situation"
7733,Transphobic developer.
7734,Transphobic developer.
7735,"Before I played War Thunder i had a small wee wee, no friends, no boyfriend and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
7736,Good Game
7737,bad lol
7738,get away from it while you can
7739,already maxed out american tree and its hela fun after all the hours
7740,I hate this game
7741,this game is ass the grind to top tier makes me want to jam firecrackers in my eyeballs
7742,I have played for a long time since the Alpha version and Beta. I love all of the older tanks and lower Battle Rating/Tiers. It is easy to get back into after taking a long time off. It just seems like there is just too much compared to what it used to be. The map selection are small still. More maps are needed. It is free to play and you can unlock pretty much everything. The grind sucks and you can pay to get further faster. All in all fun just feels so much more bloated.
7743,"good game
"
7744,"Good Game. Good Engine, but a bit biased toward RUSSIAN Tech.
I think the matchmaking is somekind sussy in Terms of Premium vehicles...but this is standard.

Thumbs down because of the War. Im sorry Gajin... maybe quit Moscow and Putin?
Gajin is VERY sus. Super sus."
7745,i sold the house to play war thunder in real life. bought myself an f-14 and shot down 3 passenger planes until I ran out of missiles and fuel. 10/10 would recommend
7746,Pretty good game steep learning curve though so youll have to be patient to learn the game
7747,gone me
7748,i feel like an actual tanker being shot and killed by a british tank i couldn't see 400 miles away
7749,"BAD GAME DONT BUY
"
7750,wierd and fun
7751,"Pay to win. Eventually you will run out of in game money. Too many things you have to pay for. Who thought paying for crew training, to drive something you just research and bought, was a good idea? Seeing as how long this game has been out i don't see any great changes coming."
7752,Welcome to your new job. We know you'll hate it here.
7753,Best steam game for Mac
7754,it is good
7755,realistic
7756,ahhh america is broken so yeah..
7757,fly high
7758,"the game is fun, a lot better than the world of tanks, world of warplanes, or world of warships games. a word of warning though low tier is full of try-hards and most teammates won't help you and some will even actively try to ruin the game but once you get the hang of things you will have the time of your life."
7759,Its fucking shit
7760,cas in ground battles
7761,"This might actually be the biggest rip-off on the steam store. And it's free.

Completely fucked, front to back"
7762,very good
7763,"its fun



plane go brrrrrr"
7764,to many people cheating in this game and to many pay to win kids
7765,"stupid people shoot stupidly and thats how missiles hit the eternal city of london
and god save the queen may she rest in peace"
7766,Its Great!!!!
7767,"DON'T LOOK AT MY HOURS ON THIS GAME aaaaaand nevermind. well anyway, i have been gaijined and the snail has consumed my soul. hours upon hours of getting overpressured, absolutely nagasakied by american planes at tier 6- 7 is  an experience you will get in this game. you can forget your dreams of flying the modern helis and planes because, boy oh boy, you will be spending the next hundreds of hours grinding a certain nation, just to give up, and come back to it later. all roads lead to the snail. once in a while you will get 1rd place, most of the time you will sniped halfway across the map by a tractor with gun (looking at you bt7, shopping cart with cannon). anyway good game, will recommend, i rate this 7 snails out of one morbillion golden eagles."
7768,Play this game if you hate your life
7769,good
7770,awsome game
7771,My favourite combo is ALT+F4
7772,there is a lot of bias towards the Russian tanks and seem unfair this game has caused me so much hell I have almost broke my keyboard because how unfair the Russian tanks are and how everything is just a 1 shot I have spent money and the game and was not worth it
7773,"I have never seen game with more technical issues than War Thunder. Sometimes even restart of the game didnt help. 

Unfunctional piece of shit."
7774,great game at first it was a lil hard a boring but ones you play for a lil its really fun
7775,Seems really fun game
7776,best game but very toxic cuss if you cant handle cod games or games like this dont play but if yes play play play/very toxic
7777,16.5/20
7778,this game is awesome really realstic grathics and of vehicles

7780,awa-203
7781,.
7782,"much fun, just dont rage quit, we all lose sometimes"
7783,pretty fun. the grind is fun(at least i like it). though don't expect to get jets anytime soon.
7784,what a fucking trash can of a company.
7785,"This game is more of a simulator than anything, the grind is daunting, everything matters and the learning curve is steep. Overall good game if you're looking to invest a lot of time into it."
7786,grind for hours just to get a new plane only to get team killed off spawn by some premium plane
7787,Fun But Very hard when new most people when u join now are leveled up and there guns are way better then when u dont have much
7788,"The best bar none, But the grind will be painful if you don't have the MONEY!  Last night almost a 113.000 thousand players speaks for itself. Yeah it's that good."

7805,"Don't get me wrong, warthunder is amazing for a free-to-play game but but Gaijin doesn't care about game balance or about the community at all. Most of the warthunder youtubers genuinely care about their community, but gaijin only wants money. The silver economy is broken and will hardly reward you as much as it used to. All the cool jets and mbts in the trailers that you see can only be unlocked after months or even years of tedious grinding. Only get it if you don't mind the grind, and even if you do please do not buy any premiums until gaijin fixes their game."

It's easy to get frustrated over badly implemented mechanics, prevalent bugs and heinous balancing decisions. Thankfully I've only spent about £35 in total on this game over 8 years which is great because with the £1 per hour of enjoyment scale that's perfect. It's shit I am addicted to it for some reason. Do not take my play time or anybody else's into consideration."
7810,"Hate this game, but keep coming back to it."
7811,"Despite all you may hear and see, the game is actually good. It's fun, it's challenging to play, your skill matters and you will learn a lot of mostly real and historically accurate things about all the vehicles (don't confuse this with historical accuracy and realism in general though). You may need to adjust your expectations a bit, but I really like the gameplay as such.

The level of grind and sweat required to get to unlock even just late ww2 vehicles is insane though. It's motivating, yes, there's always something more, it's even a hook to play more, but you can forget anything top tier for the next few years, it takes that long. (And ""premium"" subscription is more like required than giving you much of an advantage, but I don't have a serious issue with some monthly sub cost for a game like this.) Just ran away if you still can."

7863,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

7924,"Just don't play this, take this from a player who is addicted to a very unhealthy game. It cost to much to have fun in this game, and I'm not just talking about money, this game takes away your sanity, from unstoppable amounts of CAS and amounts of BS that happen, to having new updates filled with premium tanks that make top tier unplayable. If you think you can play low tiers and starting tiers and have fun in this game, think again, you'll only run into noob crushers and seal clubbers that are max lvl and have over 500 hours in the game. Trust me its not worth it to put in so much time in a game where you might have 1 moment with friends that is fun maybe every 3-5 months. The game is full of bugs, that aren't always game breaking but are extremely annoying. I hate to say this, but from my perspective its the truth, if you plan on playing this game for the ships or for the tanks, DON'T, air players will bully tf out of you and there's no game mode you can play in to stay away from air players and still make decent amounts of research and money, Ground RB eventually becomes air RB with tanks as a second feature, ground arcade just isn't realistic (obviously) and you don't make even close to the same amount of money and research as in ground RB, naval RB has planes in it, I cant say how bad since I dont play naval in war thunder all that often. To sum it up simply, don't play this game if you are expecting non-stop enjoyment. But if you do still plan to play this, good luck."

7978,"This is a ""fuck you and I'll see you tomorrow"" game. (FWI I'm talking about air combat since thats what i play) Because all that happens each game is two teams are just go in the middle and are told to fight, it's just a confusing moshpit where you get one or two kills and die bc there are like 10 other enemies. Than eventually one team dominates and than occupies the air space, and since everyone on the other team died at random times, the other team just trickles in one by one to get killed by the ever growing swarm of enemies. I would be lying if I said I never had moments where I felt like Maverick and barely won a dog fight and got a rush from it, but they are few and far between compared to the amount of times you either just get steam rolled or steam roll. Even steam rolling is a bit boring since most of your kills get stolen. Also it's grindy as fuck. So many tech trees, so many planes, so many silver lions (in game coins) and reaserch points (whats used to unlock planes). It's also like Rainbow six where you can ""technically"" get everything without paying but only if you sell your soul to the game.

TL:DR Fun but grindy as fuck and sort of unfun gameplay loop all for few moments of a rush from narrowly winning a dog fight. ""Technically"" free to play but the only way to unlock stuff in a timely manner is paying for it or selling your soul. If you want to play with jets you could become a pilot in the military faster than getting to them in this game."

8030,"
I dont really play this game in steam, I use the actual warthunder app thingy. But its safe to say that you shouldnt install this, as the snail will take your liver if you do not play atleast 8 hours a day."
8031,good game
8032,"This game is not worth your time. Is it a good game in it's core? Yes, absolutely. Is it actually a good game? Hell no. Don't be fooled by those trailers with all the modern fun stuff. There's little to no fun to be had in this game, you are basically forced to spend your money on this game because of how unbearable the grind is, game itself is more buggy than Fallout 76 probably, devs don't care about you or the gameplay quality, they care only about money. Do not play this game. It will drive you to suicidal state where your life becomes misery. Fuck you Gaijin fix your broken game"
8033,"Unbalanced, toxic game with bad economy.
Some nation is better than others.
It is unplayable, in higher BR the game will force you to buy premium."
8034,Nice Game :)

Me starting to play this game coincided with my life taking a downward spiral with the lust for big pew pew and cool plane being my sole motivator

I have given my soul to the snail and shall eternally slave to it

Long live the grind"
8039,shitest game ever made
8040,"You need to have friends for this one
And you need to take everything lightly

8041,"the game mechanics and visuals are great. the only thing bad is that you get in the game with professionals right when you start. this is very annoying when trying to level up as a beginner, but when you got good stuff its pretty nice

(i also played alot on playstation)"
8042,love this game :)
8043,"The grind rivals asiam mmo's.
The balance, is... there is none.
The rules of the game modes, who knows. Bombers are free kills do not fly them unless you want to be shot down after 5 minutes of trying to reach your target(you will very rarely ever reach it), if you want an automatic favorable spawn position, at altitude instead of runways and close to the battlefield(yes for some reason that exists in the game) get an Interceptor aircraft and most of them are equipped with bombs. Why? Who knows. But you basically get free points either by bombing the bases or being halfway near the bombers who can do next to nothing to defend against you.
If you want to look at vehicles. I guess it's a decent model viewer."
8044,amazing

8069,"You know those people who slave away for half of their life doing a job they hate because they want to save money for their retirement. [b]""I'll suffer in the present for a better future!""[/b] But we all know those people will be 60 when they retire, and they'll be too miserable and old to enjoy their life.

This aforementioned example perfectly describes insanity and the average War Thunder player.  

Imagine grinding away, day after day, and finally unlocking a brand new shiny vehicle; but then you need to pay money to buy the vehicle, then pay money to assign a crew to man the vehicle, and then pay even more money to make that crew better at manning the vehicle. Oh, but then after bringing that vehicle to a match, you find out that it runs as smoothly as that computer you found laying around in your local landfill. Turns out, you've spent all that money and time grinding for the most defective version of the vehicle you want. Jokes on you, now you have to spend even more money and time in order to upgrade the vehicle so that it's remotely functional. [b]Ah yes, this is the true War Thunder experience.[/b]"

8092,great game
8093,I wanted to play this with VR...after over an hour of getting it set up it wasn't fun or anything worth playing. Devs don't seem to care if you can play with VR either as they have done zero work in pushing a set up guide.

8099,If you are wondering what tank game to choose War Thunder will be the best
8100,i want to see if my new toaster works by chucking it in a bath because of this game
8101,"before I played this on steam, I played it via a gaijin launcher, so I have waaaaaaaaay more hours in this game than steam suggests, around 100 hours more. And even then with 200 hours (all spent with the soviets) in this game, I still am at BR 3. You have to play for weeks to unlock a single vehicle. You want to play multiple nations? well too bad, you'll never get out of BR 1. You want a strong vehicle? too bad, all stronger vehicles are ""premium"" and cost real money. You want to play in modern times? too bad, getting there easily costs thousands (yeah really) of hours. 

This game has a very good concept, that I have never seen before. That makes it such a shame that gaijin is an absolute shit show of a company, they hide in niches, so that they have 0 competition and can absolutely load the game to the brim with micro transactions and the inability to make any progress if you play f2p. I sincerily hope that whoever made these horrible anti consumer decisions gets shot in a fusillade."
8102,"Driving across the map for 4 minutes only to be one-shot by someone sat in a bush 1km away is not my idea of fun gameplay. I do not want to miserably play War Thunder for 100+ hours so that I can one day be the player sat in a bush.

EDIT: Played for an additional 116 hours and I'm still not the player sat in a bush one-shotting everyone else.
EDIT 2: Nearly 200 hours in. This game makes me irrationally fucking angry. I have no idea why I'm still fucking playing it. I fucking loathe War Thunder.
EDIT 3: Just over 300 hours played. I am sometimes the player sat in a bush one-shotting everyone else. I am now chasing the dopamine hit of ""target destroyed"" at every available opportunity. Also, Germany suffers.
EDIT 4: 400 hours played. Jesus Christ what is it with 1 death leavers?! "

8106,"I am a player of multiple years and over 1k hours. It is now at this point the most frustrating to play that it has ever been. Poor economy that doesn't reward you for getting even a positive KD/effect which forces and rewards selfish behavior in game. Players do NOT work together. Gaijin, the developer/publisher, is wholly monitarly motivated and only acts on the basic impulse of ""Add iconic vehicle with a pay wall, ruin matches with inexperienced players with thick wallets, profit."" On and on the cycle goes. Everything in this game wants to suck you dry. Unfortunately it's the only game of it's kind, and you will see me playing it to get my itch."
8107,"Just a fun game, and its totaly playabl even thou its for free. Personaly i bought a beginners pack just to support the developers."

8111,"1 quart vegetable oil for frying

1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy

5 medium potatoes, cut into fries

2 cups cheese curds

Directions/Instructions Checklist

Step 1
Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). While the oil is heating, you can begin to warm your gravy.

Step 2
Place the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Make the fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.

Step 3
Place the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them. Ladle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately."

8113,"If you want play warplanes sim combat...on your computer using mouse and keyboard.

This is it...runs on dx12.

I only play the planes...   Gaijin got this on right.

Beautiful graphics ... throw physics out the window on bi planes...love it."
8114,"i have been playing war thunder for 8 years, and lately the game has become extremely crappy, the over time the ingame currency Sliver lion has been tweaked to a reduced levels compare to 2-4 years ago, if that wasn't bad enough the additional changes to the repair cost has been absurd, many planes (non-premuim) around past rank 4 costing often 8-10k SL and even worst 13-20k on above rank 6, which makes impossible to break even unless you get 3 kill on a lose, even premium account doesn't sometimes cover the cost, combining both of these problems makes it a joke to even try to grind the top tiers, 

add to the fact that at the top tiers thanks to power creep, a lot of lower BR planes such as mig-15 and F-86 will have to face Mig-21s, lightings, a-10, which are equipped with missiles and with exception of the A-10 can out speed the mig-15s without any problems, bare in mind most of these aircraft that the mig-15 and f-86 are facing were designed in the 1960-70s, often you would be placed about 6-7 / 10 times at the bottom BR, this along with the power creep of new premiums being introduced at lower BRs with 95% of the original stats of the tech tree variants just makes all of the matches in RB unbearable

all together if you want to play jet, either be quite good with good platoons to make the higher tiers a bit less tedious on the economy side or you buy premium, the lower tiers in arcade mode are the only good thing about war thunder theses days, the BS of Gaijins ""balancing economy"" is not as bad as it is on higher tier, plus there is less power creep, right now i only use war thunder to help me with choosing colours for my models that i paint."

8129,very fun and great game to zone out in
8130,this game is great for giving you the sense of what aircraft and tanks and boaats were like back then in ww2 and more. I personally like the aircraft side of warthunder because of the variation of aicraft from all the spitfires to the f14 wich was just resently  added because of release of top gun mavrick

8157,"[h1] How to have fun in War Thunder [/h1]
Step 1: Install
Step 2: Discover Customizations on the craft
Step 3: Using the Flip and Mirror Make Smiley faces on all your tanks, boats and planes. 
Step 4: Find a Friend to Play with on Discord and both of you smile together
Step 5: Focus on being ridiculous instead of competition 
Step 6: Don't move up a tier until you have multiple vehicles of the same (BR) then play same (BR) rated vehicles

Overall Review: Don't spend much money, Don't worry about the grind, you don't need it to have fun.  Low tiers is where the interesting funny stuff happens.

Edit: Extra Steps
1. Spend under 10 dollars to buy a hat or a bear
2. Start Roleplaying with your in game friend with the tanks, moving your barrel up and down to talk to eachother
3. Play the Italian Tanks, they're smol and adorable 
4. Remember, anything you spend, you're never going to get back.  So only do it for ""FUNNY"".. never to competition, if it is competition, that makes you vulnerable to getting angry.
5. Always assume the enemy is more skilled than you, so giggle and tease them with your hats, adorable eyes and smiles."

They rope you in with the low tier vehicles and hold the higher and newer tier vehicles over your head to give you something to grind towards.  You basically need to buy premium if you want a realistic hope of unlocking new vehicles.  The more and more you progress the less and less balanced and rewarding playing becomes.  Only reason I keep playing is because this seems like the only game that has this variety of vehicles.  Please send help."

Its not pay to win as some of the purchasable for money tanks suck complete ass. My only complaint is tank combat is just a camp fest, i feel like if there was infantry to support or a frontline to push people wouldnt sit so much. Rush middle with light tank suicide then select a far range tank and camp the objective kinda dumb. Also some of the maps are realy poorly put together its like they said ""oh this looks cool"" and didnt even play test it."

Причем, интересно разные нации пробовать, например, я играю с техникой СССР и Франции, они разные, со своими плюсами и минусами. И игра со своими минусами все же скорее хорошая, чем плохая, поэтому рекомендую. Да, зверский донат, монетизацию и пр. осуждаю.

8249,nice
8250,Recommend. Air units in VR.
8251,"This game is nothing but a toxin which makes u addicted to it by putting forward some fancy tanks or MBTs or modern jets, and the missions and challenges will definitely drive u mad as well as the Ping and PL....... After fighting, struggling and suffering for a whole day and finally find out that ur money is much more less than the beginning, i believe no one could stay calm and leave the emotional damage behind. As we all seen, the whole game is killing every (mostly) player's enthusiasm.

PS: Prepare something soft such as a pillow when u wanna give vent to ur anger when u are being pissed of by this S**T"

overall: 10/10 do recommend"
8279,"""War thunder is like a toxic relationship that ends with anger, but after a while you start to think that it's gonna be better this time so you give it another try and the cycle continues"" - said by TheWall, 100% accurate.

On top of that, imagine you just downloaded game, playing for first time, and you have to deal with 100lvl that live in game for years that have way better experience in game. Every game like this.

Dont try this trash, just forget that this game exist, just like with world of tanks thats even worse."

The game is very nice but very hard to research and most of the time up tierd in battle , thats why i play most of the time on top tier. This game will eat your time and nerves. But i do recomand the game 200%
Enjoy and have patience"

8326,Trash
8327,This game is the single most frustrating pile of ass I have ever had the misfortune of getting addicted to. From trying to play a tank only to get frame perfect bombed by some asshole to having to fight cold war atgm spamming IFV's in your WWII tank this game is the most buggy unbalanced disaster I have ever played for any significant amount of time. If you are thinking about playing this game for the first time because you think it looks cool don't. Only pain and misery resides here leave before you get hooked on it too.
8328,game made me to become a masochist
8329,This game is pretty bad. Balance is all over the place and the grind feels infinite. The in game economy is pretty terrible too. But its the only game like it out right now so I guess I have to keep playing.
8330,Over 3 years since naval got added and the French Navy still isn't present! Where's the Richelieu Gaijin.
8331,Honestly the game can be a grind and a bit frustrating but its worth it in the end. Just dont spend money

Being allowed to play aircraft and ground vehicles, such as tanks and armored cars that date from the beginning of armored warfare, as well as some warships while being in the same game is amazing to me. Playing through so far I have had fun and do not see it stopping any time soon."

Honestly, I love the vehicle models. I miss the old orchestrated music though. Mozart and German planes was the best combo ever!"
8340,awful
8341,good game
8342,The game is really good but sence its free theres a lot of in game purchases and pay to win. without paying most of the game is not there.
8343,Addictive. overall fairly balanced in the beginning but as you progress there are more and more WTF moments reagarding damage in combat. To much of a grind if you want to advance to the modern units and too many kids using exploits.
8344,"1. Install War Thunder.
2. Play 25 hours of War Thunder.
3. Sell your soul to Gaijin.
4. Have a jet!!
5. Go into deep depression."
8345,"plane mode good. tank mode bad

awful launcher, everytime i want to play the game i have to wait 3+ hours for the launcher to update it instead of letting steam do it when i dont want to play. probably wont be able to play this when i feel like it ever again."

Great game"
8363,"I like tanks, and planes, this game has tanks, and planes. 
Keep in mind this is a FREE to play game, and obviously money needs to be made somehow so the grind IS REAL if you dont have a premium account, but the premium account is worth it, if you are at least a decent player, you will advance fast. 
But I play it because I enjoy the game-play and mechanics of the game so I dont even notice the grinding most of the time. A premium vehicle will help you progress in the game faster, but it wont give you any advantage in battle , so if you suck, get better before you expend your mom's hard earned money. 

8.5/10"

8374,"After almost 500 hours of game time...War Thunder (WT) is a game I can keep coming back to for a fresh, enjoyable and, immersive experience. The game offers a wide variety of game modes, vehicles, tech-trees and I have yet to reach a point of wanting to play any other game of this genre and style. I really appreciate the way the @ ""Devs"" approach creativity and realistic gameplay while at the same time, draw the player into the world of WT, making them feel part of this creative process. Thanks for all the hard work guys!"
8375,"this is a cheap copy of a more polished game. you will have more fun putting you nether region in a mouse trap then playing this game. for a arcade tank v tank game the turrets maneuver far to slow, the main guns reload at a snails pace and for some reason your crew opening their fat eyes seems far too hard since you will get spotted before you spot the enemy. if playing some form of tank game is your kind of thing go play WOT."
8376,"This game sucks, don't even bother, you will get Gayjined anyways"
8377,I like depression
8378,prepare to lose your soul sanity
8379,its free nad a good game but you have to grind it out
8380,"War Thunder is very boring. It’s not satisfying, thrilling, or even unique, it’s just boring. It might be unique in the sense that there really isn’t another game out there as detailed and within the same scope of War thunder, but it’s also safe to say there are several games out there better at doing one of the various means of play War Thunder shares. War Thunder is boring because it is slow and unbalanced. It is both physically slow, in the sense that most early tanks for instance, can only crawl across most distances, and god forbid you encounter a small slope. This snail’s paced gameplay is also the result of imbalance because you don’t really have this problem with tanks on the Russian and German skill trees, so choosing to play as say the italians starting off is almost akin to intentionally gimping yourself. But of course the deeper down you work into a certain nation’s skill tree the more balanced tanks feel, however it can still take so astronomically long to get to that point it’s hard not to get focused on the pile of garbage standing between you and that sweet-spot of balance. This slow, mismanaged progression can also lead to very boring gameplay. When playing tanks, it is so much easier to perform well while sitting still in one very cheeky spot, racking up kills, than actually playing proactively and PTFOing. When playing in aircraft, it’s infuriating to pump what feels like hundreds of rounds into enemy planes only for them to squeeze a single burst in your direction and kill your pilot. It is agonizing to drive your tank up 90% of a hill only for your engine to give out right before you reach the peak and fall back down. Spawn camping is also an endemic problem on most maps for tanks. Not only because a lot of levels treat the spawn zones more like barrels full of fish to shoot from overlooking hills, but also because gaijin(and a lot of players too) seem to think of this as a non-issue. A simple byproduct of a fair vehicle-simulation shooter.

8381,plane and tanks yah
8382,pain without reward

8393,The digital equivalent to cock and ball torture
8394,It's Alright.
8395,"Eh, game is fun enough, just too grindy and pay to win."
8396,W
8397,very good game
8398,"The game can be a lot of fun but also a huge pain, low tier ground forces tends to be the most fun tier to play since there's more of a chance of surviving a hit from tanks. High tiers is just a roll of the dice if you get one shotted by a tank across the map who is just barely visible. A-10 go Brrrrt"
8399,yes
8400,epic
8401,I have no life 10/10
8402,"i got raped by a pz 3 and a bt 5 in my team

it was shit and i cant do anything about it, and i died because a bomber ended my suffering.
only for them to respawn and raped me again

it was really shit
"
8403,"It's a good game but you shouldn't get too invested on it like I did and probably a lot of other people too, you're better spending that time touching grass or going out and having some drinks with friends or alone, try cycling.
If you get easily addicted to grindy games this is a no no. 
This is a totally f2p review."
8404,"Nothing bad to say about this game.
It's free. It's not pay to win. It doesn't take a monster PC to run. It's crossplay, which means it most likely won't die out later as the console player base is very loyal, and the community is chill. Every War Thunder discord I've went into, every person I've ran into playing the game, all of my experiences with people from the War Thunder community have been positive and enjoyable.
Can't say that for too many games. Most games these days are a pile of donkeysh** and most these companys making these sh** games, need to be removed so that they never program another game again, but War Thunder is not one of those games.
War Thunder will be around for a long time, I just hope they add more modern jets later."
8405,very fun committing mass genocide and war crimes
8406,"I haven't touched grass in that whole 166 hours, I totally recommend it!"
8407,PLANE BOAT TANK HELICOPTER
8408,becasue i love having the feeling of getting tazed in the balls while i do a kamikaze against enemy planes and having to grind for litterly two hundred fucking hours just do get a new plane
8409,I now understand how that one roman emperor got a stroke from being extremely angry.
8410,"I have been looking for a game that has tanks, ships and planes. Its like world of tanks, world of warships and a plane game all in 1."
8411,Too much grinding required so not fun.
8412,ally's arent really allies they hit into you and stop you moving so the enimy kills you in 0.1 seconds
8413,"This game is ONLY about RNG. You aimed the weak spot or even the side armor, your shot still got bounced back.
And most importantly, the helicopters always ruin your top tier experience."
8414,"So, I'll say I have 32 hours on xbox. I have played this game for 11 hours and have unlocked 2 or 3 planes. Do you happen to see an issue with this? The progression is painfully slow unless you fall into a very specific set of gameplay standards, the dogfighting is fun and all but can be repetitive in arcade. Realistic battles are as slow as the progression, I mean would you like to fly for 5 minutes only for someone to have a single bullet hit your pilot and have to do it all again? This game needs a serious progress overhaul in general. It seriously panders to players who will pay money for stuff, you can purchase ""premium accounts"" which grant you a 30% or so increase in research speed along with downed repair costs. Oh yeah I forgot you have to pay the in game currency to repair your plane, needless to say this leads to frustration and fear to using new planes.

Overall 5/10 good dogfighting, horrible progress."
8415,"If you can stomach the grind, this game is very enjoyable."
8416,gooodgame
8417,"Superb game
"
8418,"all players in your team in enemy are bots, you have best tanks and even shittiest tank one tap you with shittiest artilerry, when you shooting at them like 10 times and they get just a hit"
8419,"sucks ass
"
8420,"if repair costs get removed, it would be even better, but still good"
8421,i love the new update
8422,"Play to feel Pain.
Pay for less Pain.
There's nothing to gain"
8423,would recommend however this game is a slipery slope as you can get very easily addicted and bankrupt even if you try your hardest not to just look at me i actually spent money on the game i have resisted for over 6 months and all of a sudden they hit you out of the blue with a sale enticing you in with promeses of reduced GRIND but you will fall to them eventually no matter how hard you resist you will spend money on this game.
8424,fuck  u Gaijin
8425,"i have ptsd, when i told my dad i was a A10 player he left me within the micro second with the milk. Don't play this game kids if you don't want your daddy to dissapear"
8426,"Got banned for  cheating with third party softwear but did no such thing, 600$ worth of in game purchases for nothing hopefully this does not happen to you."
8427,I want a Jett :(
8428,"balance the game please
"
8429,Fun
8430,super hard to get stuff just to grind and mostly everything is over priced but i see why they made it to much money.
8431,It's hare to learn but fun when you learn all the controls.

8434,you can crash your jet into things. 10/10
8435,Fun game
8436,"If you absolutely hate yourself like I clearly do, this the game for you."
8437,!
8438,"game sucks, would play again"
8439,Good enough for the memes but not for the money
8440,Super grindy but consistently come back to it from time to time. Fun to hop in a game and shred some kids
8441,only starting to suffer
8442,The grind is too hard and it's really pay to win.
8443,good game but yeah bug
8444,"matchmaking horrible and gaming economy that forces you to spend money on it
my sabre f40 9.3 everytime i play versus mig 21 and phantom II"
8445,"Once you play, you're gonna have a love hate relationship with this game. 10/10."
8446,"War Thunder is like a drug. You will have best time in the game at the start and see all of the cool tanks and planes, But as the months go on it feels like your chasing the dragon trying to get the great feeling back. But it's just pain, and pain, and some more pain, And then a great game, then more pain then you just wasted money on premiums.

10/10 would play again







(please help the snail has me hostage)"
8447,"Great aircraft and vehicles form ww2 to almost modern day.

8448,hi
8449,"the most painful grinding game
"
8450,non penetration

(although the people that play american tier 1 planes are absolutely retarded)"
8452,"A free action game and you can select real locations where wwll battles took place. Choose between an aviator, a battleship or patrol boats shooting at torpedoes, and tanks. You can research dive bombers and better tanks and some more battleships. I like this game because it can be a fast or slow paced action game sprinkled with strategy."
8453,"Insufferably grindy for ftp players, and a fortune to buy your way to the tops tiers.
Save yourself the time, and stop playing."
8454,war thunder is fun but it sucks when you get shot down

8463,very good if you like having your soul sucked out of you
8464,kj
8465,The Snail will feed on your soul throughout your game play. A very interesting way to suffer that no other game provides.
8466,A very good game full of everything you ever wanted to fly/ drive/ sail
8467,Unless you have thousands of hours or hundreds of dollars to waste on this game progression takes literal years

8490,"Not happy that my son soccerguy_12 had saved and purchased the A-10 package for $100.  and his account won't update it and it is not available to him.   Worse is the fact that there is absolutely no help in solving this issue.
Steam says not their problem contact software company.
Software company has a horrible help support endless loop, and then they send you an email saying the issue is resolved and nothing changed.  And for that this game will always get a 1 star rating until they fix this for him.
soccerguy_12   one day hopefully someone will solve this for you.

8491,fuc* that game but i love it
8492,"It fun, a real grind though."
8493,It's complicated to understand.  But it's a fun game to play if you are within your vehicles class rating.
8494,the fact that an aircraft with 4 7mm guns can instakill a heavy bomber makes this game unplayable

8513,pretty laggy tho
8514,not worth the heartache lol
8515,"Its a bit hard starting off but you will soon get used to it, Here are some in game tips
1. i reccomend doing all the tutorials first and then get started in games

2.i would start off in tanks and get used to it, and then planes, and then ships if you want, i dont like ships that much but its not for everyone.

3. Save your GE (Gold Eagle premium currency) for things that you really need, dont spend it on boosting research unless its worth it

4. Dont sped your SL (Silver Lion main currency) all at once, i would save at least 50k - 70k

5. Before you spend anything on boosting research or buying a plane, always test drive it!! i made that mistake many times and i was left with 0GE (Gold Eagle premium currency) and a bad plane

Thats all the tips i have for now, :)"
8516,I like it.
8517,"good game
"
8518,Its 50/50 for me on one hand i love it on the other hand i hate it so much if you like tanks play this 100% but if this is your gonna be your main game hell naw its really sweaty and tryhardy 75% of the times so like i said 50/50
8519,"it's a piece of crap, the battle raiting is idiotic made. I use only 1.3 Tanks and Im in match with 3.0 antisocials. I always get one shot no matter what tank I use, not recomand it, delete it from your account!"
8520,amazing
8521,I like tanks
8522,the ships do not sex
8523,This game is really fun but at some points it can be a bit confusing on how to upgrade the planes and the tanks is also really fun
8524,"not very good at it, doesn’t mean it’s not a good game"
8525,I love suffering
8526,Pretty good game
8527,this game has come such a long way for being a totally free game. sure there's pay-to-win option but this game is one i cherish
8528,top gun maverick
8529,"Graphics is a bit scattered in FullHD resolution even with 4X antialiasing (100% render-scaling), needs more work on graphics utilization and optimization. Game texture is on point.
Gameplay is okay, ordinary MMO
8/10"
8530,i would not recommend because its physics are absolute trash and is full of people that only want to play the game and not mess around so its very boring as well
8531,"good game so long as you dont make it an objective to get everything, you can have fun just playing the reserve tank. And best thing is game runs on any potato with minimum settings thats why I like it. ofc there are many scummy practices but this game simply has no alternative in the market currently."
8532,fun and unique game but has very high repair cost of vehicles ;') still fun though
8533,wrd
8534,it`s the most realistic tank game that u can get rn
8535,"Things to do in war thunder:

1. leave the game"
8536,This game is an actual scam. Steam should be ashamed for allowing this on their platform.
8537,the game is legendary !
8538,gREAT GAME
8539,War Thunder needs Greece.
8540,crashes under linux and racist userbase

8552,"Spent more then 500 euros on this game.


I think the mafia is after me.


shit"
8553,I love the historical reference to all of the vehicle's looks and how they would have been back in their time. The game mechanics are incredibly realistic and i can't think of a better game.
8554,end my misery
8555,this is fun but boring once you play for a long period of time
8556,"good for killing germans
"
8557,ALL HEIL HITLER!
8558,"If you're looking for a game where you drive around for 5 minutes on a tank that does not more than 20km/h just to non-pen a T34 variant AND to get instantly killed by it, this is the game for you"
8559,One of the best shooter games i have ever played.
8560,"It ruined my sleeping schedule, my productivity, and my entire life. The grind from 3.0 to Jets absolutely broke me. I recommend."
8561,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
8562,"This game is free to play , but it will eat your money . So it should only be played by adults , that have spare time and money . The great thing about war thunder they keep updating . One day they will bring out the Canadian Air force Avro Arrow

8567,"Pro tip: go for the players with the controller next to their name. they are on console and suck


pro tip: dont play this game is so addicting its nails on a chalkboard if it was a game."
8568,"Addicting, money pit, with Russian bias....  so 10/10"
8569,
8570,good game
8571,reminded me of how my grandpa has sex with a spitfire and then got discharged from the war.
8572,fun
8573,"literally the only reason this game is even still relevant is because there is no better alternative but the moment there is i'll be dropping this game immediately and never coming back; gaijin has the collective intelligence of a fossil, 90% of maps are unbalanced, you WILL be up-tiered almost every match, CAS will end any and all fun your having, killcams that show the exact location of the player thus enabling revenge kills which only further fuels the toxicity of this game (CAS is usually the way this is achieved) honestly i feel like i could make a list long enough that it'd take you the amount of time i've played this trash to read.   i'd rather be addicted to hard substances than this game 100% so if you haven't yet played this game don't do it ever, this game needs to die so something better can replace it...which is sad cause i can see so much potential with this game but gaijin is to worried about whale farming to care just like most game companies nowadays"
8574,it good
8575,If u want a FULL GRID AND JUST GIIME UR MONEY THIS IS GAME FOR YOU ... i does not mater how much money u sunk into this game even with premium u cant farm money .. the BR system is shit does not work as soon as u pass 7.0 so if u want it like that go ahead ..... all in all amazing game for real one of the best i played but too bad the Gajiin dev as soooo gready -.-
8576,everything
8577,Monitization is becoming more blatant and unapologetic. Repair costs are insanely high meaning even with premium you'll still rarely have credits for anything else
8578,stupidest fucking shit ever. like bro fuck off dont fucking play this game
8579,A amazing game that has such cool graphics! It is such a good game!
8580,good
8581,cold war jets are fun
8582,Pain uhhh i love hot men
8583,HELP ME OUT OF THIS HELL HOLE
8584,"war thunder has a much more realistic damage model that are historicly acurate!
also world of tanks is more of a point and click tank game so 10/10 and war thunder>world of tanks"
8585,do want to die well perfect this is the game for you
8586,yes
8587,Neuron activation
8588,Great game! Graphics are pretty good and enjoyable gameplay. Takes awhile to get use to the controls. Really like the historical side of the game with the vehicles but the grind of researching new aircraft/ tanks/ ships is extremely slow.. Not sure why the research system gives you such little points throughout the game.. Plenty of updates and Development. Would like to see more historical campaigns! Definitely worth picking up - 7/10
8589,its good mane
8590,good game when you win but when you lose bad game
8591,cool
8592,this game makes me wanna bash my head against a wall

8594,"It is so awesome sometimes it has its physics moments but it is the best game ever for war. Realistic data, reliable format, and great buffs."
8595,not even t2 and ive already decided to sell my soul to the snail. dont download. even tho i have 3 hours on pc i have hundreds on console.run while you can. SELL UR SOUL AS I DID MINE. fun game for trolling. GET GAJINED. run
8596,if this game had a taste that was attributed to it the taste would be rat shit
8597,"honestly, the best war game I've ever played, the graphics are 10/10, the gameplay 9/10 (if you rage easily dont buy it)"
8598,"Funny game, recommend if you have no life."
8599,Beutiful
8600,i love it
8601,Great Game. Nothing bad to say and the game allows for so many possibilities for every war aspect
8602,american plane class is mid
8603,Cool game if you wanna waste your life
8604,not good
8605,ill let you know when i get cool shi
8606,basically requires money to progress in the game. Actual gameplay can get exhausting real quick in tanks and even worse in planes.
8607,biggest mistake of my life do not play unless you want to become a slave of the snail
8608,very gud
8609,"Love the pay-to-win aspect of this game, makes life great"
8610,UGGHGERTGGT
8611,"Please hear me out before you judge. This is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. There are a lot great things about this game but there a lot more wrong with this game. One of the reasons I went into this game is because I really want to battle with my favorite World War 2 vehicles and some modern ones too. But here are some reasons why I stop playing.
This game is not fun to play it is down right frustrating. 1. You spend so long trying to get anywhere in this game. The grind is insanely long to the borderline of insanity. I've gotten further in the two of the World of games. (World of Warships and World of Warplanes.) Than I ever did in war thunder. I see past the bells and whistles on war thunder. 2. The company behind  war thunder are greedy as hell and do everything they can to get your hard earned money. 3. After a battle if your vehicle gets destroyed you have to wait for vehicle to be repaired and the higher the tier the long the repairs. You could use your silver loins to speed it up BUT you need sliver loins to buy new vehicles. 4, Tech tree vehicles are outclassed by their premium vehicle counterparts. 5. WAY to many events. 6. I can't get over the fact that Gaijin advertise and says war thunder vehicles are ""authentic and historically accurate"" when they do whatever want with the technical specifications. I'm a gamer and I love great games that developers pour their hearts and souls in. But this games has been straight up ruined by a greedy company. And I hate it when a great game is ruined by greed. Please im begging you save your saintly and don't play this game. Thank you for reading. (P.S. will edit if i think of some others to say.)"
8612,"POS- devs can't even do updates right. ""we fix the br match making"" 2.3 vs 4.0"
8613,This shit hurts my bones I hate it
8614,vr war thunder is dog shit do not like it its bad i cant even fly and it crashes way to often
8615,fantastic game.. definitely 10 out of 10 would recommend
8616,"Game is nice, but is as imbalanced as a game can come. Most of the time MM gets you with enemies that oneshot you and you even scratch their armor."
8617,good game
8618,good game
8619,"Garbage russian game that favors their tanks, I've made it to tier 4 and had enough. The rabid fanboys are gonna advocate how there's no russian bias, but try it yourself at tier 3.3 - 4, how retardproof are their tanks... all their T34, KV1 variants that magically bounce anything regardless what penetration values the projectile has, when you finally pen, then the magic door hatch on T34 or gun mantle on any of those tanks will absorb all damage even from a nuclear blast. So in order to kill em, you have to meticulously aim for the weakspots such as lower front side of the hull or the area around the front door hatch, whereas any other tank, especially german tanks get one shot almost all the time, no matter where the hit pens. 

Absolutely sickening, how people with those tanks can play like absolute braindead apes and often pass by pretty much unpunished, because the stalin blessed armor be like trololol and bounces or absorbs any incoming shot. Try to play like em with any other tank from other nations and see how it will work out for you. 

I'm not gonna bother with anything beyond that, don't wanna know how many BS tanks await at higher tiers... I already know playing  beyond tier 7-8 is a miserable experience and without a premium account you will go bankrupt. Premium tanks cost as much as a triple AAA game, just lmao. If I had to, I would rather burn money on some shitty anime gacha game than on this dogshit company."
8620,very good
8621,"uhh ok
"
8622,._.
8623,drtdga
8624,"it is very fun when played with friends
"
8625,"The game abuses it's players, it makes you want to punch your monitor at times, yet you still end up coming back. It's a massive grindfest and one of the only games to make me cry. 

Fair warning to also not sell your soul to the Snail, despite the temptation."
8626,"Game is good, but Steam version is pretty bad. Better get it from dev's website."
8627,Plane go zwom
8628,very good game.
8629,you spend 100000+ hours for like rank 2. and pay to win
8630,"amazing game!
i've had a lot of fun playing this game, but its pretty hard to research vehicles in Russian tech tree"
8631,this game sucks
8632,"its a cool game but u need to grind so much or pay the gameplay is always the same and getting boring after every match. but if u just play one round dont care that u will never make progress if u didnt sepnd money its okey i played it 60 hours free 2 play and unlocked like 0 new stuff 
"
8633,real fun a bit grindy but its still bearable
8634,Snail.
8635,i hate every a5c player
8636,"You will regret it.

This game is a complete waste of time, money and mental wellbeing and gaijin will have absolutely no shame or remorse into making you pathologically addicted.

If you have been lured here by some ad or a video showing something that, i ensure you, this game is not going to be, please, please close this page and avoid this game like the black plague and let this god forsaken comunity rot into a spiral of misery, self destruction and fake positivity.

I don't know what else to say (even though there's a lot) to make you go away from here, so I hope that some of you reading will accept my suggestion, It won't help me much but hopefully I'll be able to sleep better at night."
8637,"its fun
"
8638,"Insanity is defined as repeating the same exact process over and over again while expecting a different result. A players relationship with this game is insanity, downloading and uninstalling the game dozens of times hoping that each time they pick the game back up the results will be different. They are not. If you want to have fun, be willing to pay up."
8639,War Thunder
8640,"This game is fun yet pure pain, you will question your sanity after playing it game"
8641,"good very good!
"
8642,really fun gameplay - but theres a huge grind even with the premium pass
8643,"I need therapy.
"
8644,ive played this game for two days and im even father than iv ever gotten on xbox highly recomend for pc
8645,All the diffrent countries
8646,don't play this game. Gaijin doesn't care shit about player complaints they care about money. map design is suck. unbalance at all. and a new update just a new Vehicle and a new event to get your money
8647,Gud Game
8648,"If you are thinking about getting into this game in 2022 - Do not bother.

The grind takes forever, and then you have those who've played the game since 2016 who keep fighting in lower tiers, wich basically know every single weak spot. So you will experience situations of you putting 5 rounds into an enemy with no kill - For him to rotate his turret and kill you in 1 shot."
8649,please end my life i hate this game please make it stop please make it stop stop stop stop stop stop stop
8650,"Oh look a decently fun game, would be a shame if it was pay to progress and takes thousands of hours to get somewhere decent"
8651,It's alright
8652,be cool & fun
8653,"Good game in general but the community can be quite toxic if you like fast paced games would defiantly recommend it.
7/10"
8654,War thunder is fun.
8655,Great game for military combat! If you're able to survive the grind then it is truly fun to play especially with friends
8656,Its fun and its free...if you're strong willed enough to not buy anything for it.
8657,100+ hours gameplay full of pain. and that damn snail really laughing back there watching me suffering
8658,"It's like meth, people tell you not to try it. Yet once you do it is the best thing ever, the rest of the world starts to turn black and grey. It hurts you but you keep coming back. All you can think about is the meth/Warthunder."

8677,"this game is ""free"" but not really. unless you spend a good amount of money on premiums you wont get very far in a reasonable amount of time. other than that the flying is pretty fun and enjoyable :thumbsup:"
8678,Says free to play but I've had to buy multiple new controllers
8679,"waste of life, my type of game!"
8680,really good game sometimes not because of any gaming issues but just because of country bias. they try to balance it out but it just ends up giving bias to another country cause they slam the country that everyone is complaning about
8681,its good
8682,Shitty fucking game that has so many unnecessary updates that don't even fucking install or give you file error half the time. Crappy game shouldn't even be on steam.
8683,good
8684,Nais
8685,very good but i would love if the creators would give a bit more free things to its players but on the other hand this game is really realistic in all way also the pvp is realistic

8690,"Had a good time playing this game. It's not pay to win and the damage model is really cool, it's the best tank game I have ever played.

I stopped playing when I hit tier 6 in every faction I was interested in. The grind gets miserable and I just stopped enjoying the game. I still recommend it because you can get many hours out of it and it's incredibly fun."

8693,"seems like the game developers don't want to curb the cheating problem, People seems to be able to shoot through two different sets of bushes/cover and make perfect shots instantly.

EDIT: still tons of cheaters. You can't even leave a review for cheating, you can just complain and then say other, and plead your case. Also there are youtubers that are asking if they should download modded versions of the game. So no faith in the anti-cheat."

8700,"Takes way too long to get to the vehicles I know you want to play, game is basically a cash grab (the amount of money they are pulling in is F***ing insane for a F2P - You would think I'm lying if i told you). So don't play it, sometimes it's fun, but most of the time it's not. I'd say 10% of the time it's fun, 90% of the time it's not fun."

8720,Easy and fun to play works fine on Linux (Debian 11) low graphics setting with Ryzen 7 and AMD Radeon integrated graphics.
8721,"the game is good. the satisfaction of playing well and progressing throughout the game and unlocking new vehicles will never get old. its fun, and i like it a lot. but there is one HUGE issue i want to address. well 2. its the games detection system. and inperticular, frendly fire, and leaving the game. now, freindly fire is bad, but some times you get penitalized for things you didnt do. say for example. your flying normaly, and your teamate trys to have some fun and accidentaly kills you. no big problem, except that you just lost a lot of lions and research points. now that on its own isnt the big problem. the main problem, is the leaving game penitalization. inparticular, crashing. on so many fucking occasions, the game would crash whilst i was joining a match, and i wouild have to wait 9 minutes just because the game decided to be a dick. but the real sting comes from boosts and wagers. you loose progress for games you couldnt play, or do, because the game crashed. now it wasnt so bad because you could originaly rejoin the games you crashed. but now? nothing. so war thunder, this game is incredibly fun. the game feels great, and so far it hasnt gotten old. but gajin, PLEASE fix this crashing issue, or reintroduce the rejoin crash system."

8744,I now have dopamine deficiency
8745,"While this game has many many shortcomings, after logging over a thousand hours, I can say that it is one of the most satisfying military hardware based games ever made. Seeing ""Target Destroyed"" is a straight dopamine hit. Very fun, but potentially infuriating. Grind is terribly long at higher ranks, and some mechanics are hard to learn/annoying to deal with. But I'd say it's overall worth trying."
8746,"Good graphics, planes are much nicer than you might think. I'd rate this more than 10 stars."
8747,good game very nice
8748,the game is good and it gets a 7/10 from me just because its so annoying to die in this game but on the other side it is so satisfying to get kills in this game so that evens it out
8749,"plane

8750,"Great game, takes alot of hours to learn how to play correctly, that being positioning and knowledge of opponents and what tactics to use with certain vehicles. Otherwise it can be a really entertaining and at the same time stressing game, I would recommend playing with friends to have the most fun, nothing better than someone having your back in a tight situation.

8768,"Graphics and layouts are awesome. Movement is great also. But there is a lot left to be desired on the programming of this game. Being a programmer for 20 years, I know these problems can be fixed if they want to do research on this game. But as of yet, they haven't addressed them. For instance, their map will show no enemy near but in reality there are 3 enemy a few hundred feet away on the other side of the building. Also their legend will show your only damage is the tread on your tank, but you can't move your turret or shoot even though all personnel on board are okay and no other damage indicated. They have said they addressed shooting thru mountains and certain buildings, but yet the enemy still has the capability to shoot thru solid rock mountains for the kill. Now long range kills are good except certain people can shoot across the total map without seeing the enemy for the kill. I am sure if they address and fix these problems this game would be totally awesome. But as of now I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this game."
8769,this game is just pure love and hate relationship I comeback to play this game from time to time and leave because of how Hell the grind is.
8770,"I have played this game since the open beta way before the steam hosting and... well, it is not the same anymore.
So much to say why, but the most annoying feature is the economy. despite the game is free to play, you can no longer enjoy it as such. it get harder and harder for the average players to earn a fair amount of RP and SL that push quickly this player category out. lots of players don't really ""play"" the game because they found no value to play objectives, or ""high risk, high reward"" as it's not worth for them.
The remaining player base is premiums users, or hardened vets, and can't recycle...
The game became more and more frustrating about grinding crew and vehicules, with the single aim to make you bypass it with real money. At this stage, it's like casino addiction...
They are very good at creating 3D models, but if you want them you need to work, not playing, and to be annoyed by the stock effectivness of it. it's a ""military encyclopedia visualized""
Last but not least is the game design, battles objectives are always 1, 2 or 3 strategics circles across the map... nothing more... and a repetitive sickness...

The only way they keep players in this game is by adding new hyped planes, tanks and ships, that people want to come back a look at. this is Gaijin game schedule developement since the modern era were added. but i think they struggle as they started to fix more and more bugs spread across the game developement years, way too late...
and there is way more to say about balance, comunity behavior ect....
This is war thunder, subscribe or step aside"
8771,THIS GAME MADE ME BUY NEW VEHICLES 0/10
8772,"The game as a whole is currently in shambles, top tier premiums, power creep and the broken russian lineup at top tier have completely decimated my enjoyment of the game at higher tiers. I sure didn't grind Japan for as long as I did for this shit show.

Previously I would recommend the game to anyone but I can't say I'd do the same today.

TLDR : Gaijin has fucked the game"

8808,"Needs better mac support, but the gameplay is great."
8809,"Maliciously addictive game that preys on natural dopamine reward responses. Unlocking the next vehicle which you pray will be better than the last but never is. The progression of vehicle trees traps unsuspecting gamers into a downward spiraling loop which never ends and doesn't lead to the miracle greatest vehicle, this  never satisfies the dopamine hit we so desperately crave and endlessly seek.

5 out of 5,
the designers we're meticulous in every aspect except the one true thing we crave. The golden gun boi."
8810,"i like tanks, this game has tanks, what more can I say?"
8811,e
8812,"I can't recommend this game due to it's excessive grind and micro transactions. The developers have created a system of inconveniences that they then offer a means to pay to get through moderately quicker. The game quickly becomes more about the grind of progress, the grind to unlock new content over just having fun playing a great game for what it is. I want to have fun just playing this game and enjoy it for what it is but it's hard to do that when progress is so sooooo slow. I feel like I'm a wallet to Gaijin, they're dangling a carrot of fun for me but it's always just out of reach. But It could be closer if I just paid them money to bring it closer. It's a shame. The game is really good but their profit model is absolutely broken and it holds the game back so much in my opinion."

8831,"I've played this game for some time as ground units, since I'm really into tanks. Insane amount of bullshitery is almost in every game. You can get stuck for life in smallest rock, and 50% of your deaths will be from planes after you drove 5 minutes to get to the action. A lot of players uses cosmetic bushes to hide themselves in realistic battle mode so it is almost impossible to find them, which is almost pay to win. I had fun in this game ngl, I really had fun like 30% of the battles, but the rest it is way too flustrating and tilting."
8832,This game is ok if you do not pass tier 1 after that its all about pay to win and you can barely damage an enemy tank even if you maxed out your free researched vehicle not a game to play unless you want to dump tons of cash this is a pay to win game do not waste your time leveling
8833,great game

8866,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

And it is very much possible, you will delete this game after some time.

But you will also return and play it, have fun like a little kid when your tank's shot travels through the entire enemy tank shown via XRay and your tank bounces an enemy shot due to realistic modelled tank designs.

8919,very fun game i run it on low graphic laptop and still has good frame rate
8920,Playing over 1 year now This isn't a free game every match cost you a piece of your sanity until you are left with nothing but regret..... 10/10
8921,very nice
8922,"do not waste your life on this garbage game i wasted 6 years of my life on this piece of trash yeah sure lower tier is fun because you can actually get kills but once you get in rank 2 or 3 tanks thats when things go down hill. planes or helis bombing you from nowhere, atgms hit you 1,000 meters away and theres little to no counter measures for any of the tanks, stupid little italian cars you can barely hit destroy you with rockets. now i played as the russian faction and let me just say it is the weakest faction out of all of them. you dont get sabot rounds at all when literally everybody and there mother has them at tier 4 i believe along with heat rounds but russia? no...fuck russia you get slugs bruh and its like shooting peas at other armor because they cant pen for shit. this...game...sucks. its ass just dont play it. it is absolutely positively 100% pay to win and the amount of money of time and money i sunk into this game. if i could i would take it all back. its not worth getting new tanks because the thought process gos something like this
1.not a good enough tank? oh ill just get a new one
2.not enough lions? thats okay ill just buy some more with reall money
3. okay the new tank i got is not all that great i guess ill just buy another
4. really wish i had a better tank
5. none of these tanks are good and im just getting raped
6. everyone has a better tank
7. kay this game is pay to win and i just dont have a good tank 
8. i think im just bad and need to get better
9. nope everyone just has better shit they payed for
10. yeah this game just sucks and is super unbalanced 

please for my sake and yours dont get this game"

8939,"If you're looking for a game that will take thousands of hours or dollars to reach the late game, this is it.

460 hours in, and I'm barely halfway through two tech trees. Currently, to unlock a single vehicle with the average research points per game, I would need to play ~130 games. These are 10-20 minute matches. On average, that's 32.5 hours of gameplay to unlock a single vehicle at BR 7.0. It goes up to 11.0 currently, and the RP costs even increases at those levels.

To purchase the research of this vehicle, you would need 2889 of the currency bought with real money. This costs around $20 USD.

Additionally, it feels as if there is a mechanic that places you in losing matches as soon as you start doing well. Almost every map in this game is unbalanced - it is way easier to spawn camp and defend on one side than the other. Mark my words: if you start doing well and earning a little too much RP, you will find yourself on the worst side of every map you play for the forseeable future. Ironically, I've noticed this rarely happens when I have purchased a premium membership.

Egregiously, any premium vehicle purchased gives you a massive bonus on research and currency - but be ready to fork over $20+ for a single vehicle.

In short, this game is a bit pay to win, and MASSIVELY pay to progress. Unless you spend over a thousand hours in this game, I doubt you'll ever make it past mid tier in a single country's combined forces. You might reach top tier if you focus only on Air, Sea or Land singularly."
8940,Game... good!
8941,I spent way too much time on this game. But in general it's a good game to grind but also to relax and try and play if you're fine with playing low tier forever.
8942,"Much like the military doctrine of the United States, spend enough money and you will win the war."
8943,"Actually, i hate this game, but i keep playing because i am a dumbass."

Ab 6.7 Battlerating ist das Spiel auf Arcade unspielbar. Und ""Realismus"" macht kein Spaß weil alle schwitzen und mit den Flaks spielen als wäre es einfach nur Rush B.

8970,"its pretty frustrating to play and trying to play with your friends is difficult
most of the time in the ground battles mode you are just getting one-shot basically not even being able to deal damage to the enemy tank 
Constantly matching with people that have way better stuff is really not fun it feels super unforgiving for just being new
all the cool stuff like helicopters and modern tanks and planes need 500 years each of grinding just to get

In conclusion the game sucks, go play outside or something instead, go play catch with your dad that you probably have"
8971,my life is a never ending cycle of pain...
8972,i really like the game its fun and relaxing
8973,"Horrible new player experience, I don't recommend anyone who hasn't been playing for a long time to join this now. A veteran with maxed out Tier 1s can match along with Newbies. 

A near complete lack of PvE, and whats there is repetitive (1 type of mission for Air, and 1 for land)

The plane combat IS a lot of fun, however."
8974,"game is very aesthetic and really makes you feel like you drive or fly an actual real tank or aircraft but its unbelievably pay to win, unless you are prepared to spend a lot of many, don't even try"

8986,"great game (better than wot) but if you are searching for free tank game were you can just drive in peace, this is not the game. 5-12k repair cost on every single vehicle above tier III. (you only get 2k for 1 kill)"
8987,"Не надо сюда заходить,не надо сюда донататить. Это игра убивает тебя морально,она в первые часы кажется хорошей,но когда ты узнаешь что такое : объемные снаряды,без урона в борт 120-мм НАТОвскими ОБПС которые просто сжигают осколками в 2000 градусов челов в реальной жизни - в этой игре не на наносят урона вообще,как это должно быть. Карты вообще отдельная тема 90% карт - это неиграбельные поля по которым ехать до точки вплоть до 1.5km на танке который едет в среднем 25-30 км/ч. Что насчет игроков - то все плохо,многие  стоят дрочат где-то у камней перед базой,ехать вперед никто не хочет особенно на рангах повыше и разработчик с этим ничего не делает. Только поощряет.......
Игра подрузумевает себя как реализмо-подобная,но от реализма тут не осталось ничего,это WOT только без ХП. Игра делается чисто для пиндоса-коммюнити,а как известно пиндосы не любят соревновательный и сложный геймплей - им нужен фан,а фан в этой игре на пиндосов предоставляется достаточно : непробития в борт,непробития сильнеших орудий мира по ЛТ - это все пиндосы называют весельем. Ну вот им и дают,а мы СНГшники которые любит более соревновательный геймплей сосем огромный член самца улитки.

В заключении хочу сказать,что я перечислил далеко не все проблемы этой игры,я только начал рассказывать. Не начинайте играть в это если вам жалко свое время и деньги. На данный момент это игра неиграбельна.. Это игра не трейлер нового патча,тут все не радужно,плюсы конечно же есть : Реальный музей техники,предствлена большая часть существующей техники в мире и все это прекрасно детализированно и более менее приближенно к реальности,довольная неплохая летательная техника и летательные режимы которые не были изменены сильно с 2016 года и до сих пор довольно играбельны, И это все плюсы к сожалению.
Оценка игре 2/10 - чисто из-за музея техники и летку

Right now for example i need to restart the game after half a match cause im not able to spawn due to a bug, and this happens every match i had for the past 3 days..... It is just trash. High tear matches are so compressed you will end up in a Me262 fighting an F4 or a Mig21. Matches were tiger 2 is faicing soviet MBT's......At rank 5 jets is so hard to grind with no premium account is not fun anymore also you have early jets with no rockets facing almost top tear jets where you dont stand a chance cause they will just point and click, then you unlock some rockets but you dont have flaser and everybody else dose ... it fells like your in a constant disadvantage and this is by deign. I wont spend 1$ on this pile of crap, not until it is fixed. The bugs and the unbalance is getting worst and worst each update. To be honest the game was way  better in 2018-2019"

9016,"Ground RB:

You kill people with your tank. 

These people get angry.

These people spawn in plane and fly to your location they saw in their killcam.

People attack your location in their next plane or tank. Sometimes win, sometimes lose. Or they try to bomb you.

Game would be better if the killcam wasn't around. Please turn the killcam in Ground RB off.

There's a few other problems to name as well, such as the cashgrab shop, the general toxic community most games with a few rare friendly faces and the general meta that changes due to weird implementations in order to ""balance"" the game, often making one vehicle the ""king of the meta"" until a new balancing patch is released that affords this benefit to another vehicle."

9031,"The absolutely incompetent support team(they are russins, maybe that's the reason), 2-week conversation zero results.
A small number of new players. The game is pretty much outdated because of the progression system, to play on modern vehicles you need to invest a lot of time, or money, so if you start to play wt today, forget about M1 Abrams for at least a year, or half-year with a premium account. Also, gajin silently supports russia terrorist state.
Game is totally balanced by profit if you buy elite T-34 ricochets and impenetrability or penetration without damage will happen much more often than in the base model.
Summary
The game is too old to start investing your time in it.
The ratio of the time spent to the obtained result is one the worth, maybe the worst I've ever seen, you play a lot you will get a bit
Core gameplay stays without evolution for a decade
Do not waste your time on a game that is dying, until you get to modern vehicles it probably will be dead with 10k players around the world.
If you are interested in tanksim gameplay try ""Gunner, HEAT, PC!"" or ""SQUAD"""

9033,"Hello Gaijin Community,there is some kind of a bug a player used on me, while I was playing realistic battles with an A6M2-N, a teammate with a BF-109 shoot me off with the bullet going throughout the pilot and killed me, how can he kill me if he is a teammate, doesnt even make sense, isnt friendly-fire forbidden?"
9034,Very Fun
9035,It's a good game i like it but there's a lot of grind to the game if your really into the game and don't want to grind as much because you do other stuff or don't have time to do so i would recommend buying a 60$ Pack which come with different benefits like Golden Eagles and a 15 day booster to your account (ingame) but there is some bugs in the game when it updates time to time but overall i recommend the game 8/10.

9065,This is game is really intersesting as you can play ground rb with planes that makes the game much harder as bombs can drop on you at any moment. War thunder is a next level game where you have to manage everything and the tank doesnt get destroyed when it reachs zero health its just next level.

9067,if you look past the game being grindy as hell its pretty fun
9068,"I  had to sell a testicle and my sack to afford the summer sales and get the victory royales in this amazing game that i play all night and day. PS my gf broke up with me because she said I was ""addicted"" to this amazing game."
9069,"This game best tank game that I've played so far. 

The game damage mechanic is realistic but don't expect it to be a simulator grade, also flight characteristics too, still some bugs in it, but you rarely see them, until they update a new patch which brings a ton of bugs (currently there is a tank track flying around and obstruct gun sight). 
This game graphic is amazing flying in sky among cloud, texture on ground is great every detail on vehicle are polished however cockpit still don't match what they do on other, and it doesn't bad either. 
Every vehicle in game are based on real vehicles that are in production or prototype (/coughing E100, Ostwind 2), so you don't have to see fancy vehicle, if it isn't prototype.
Gameplay section, this game has countless hours of grinding to get a vehicle especially cold war era, so if you aiming to get it, have fun pouring 100-200 hours into this suffer hell. This game is free to play does it mean it pay to win? No, you can fight everyone, just paid player has less time grinding.
Would I recommend this game to others? Of course yes!"
9070,"This game is really fun and addicting. There is some controversy with the Naval Ships but this one thing doesn't ruin the rest of the fun. You should really get this game especially since its free, make sure when your on the launcher to download the ""Full Client"" version and not the ""Full Client Ultra HD"" otherwise your game won't download for 2 days."

9077,"Tried to play Air Realistic Battle 5 times, exploded without even being shot at after climbing for 10 minutes each match."
9078,Its a fun easy game(usually) but it has a bad grind mechanism that is lengthy and hard to grind multiple tech trees. Other than that its a good game

9086,"This game is horrible, I only got it to play with my friend and man it already is leaving bad impressions, first if you want to play with your friends, you have to log in to Facebook, (if you are in VR you CAN NOT do anything once you chose to log in) then a pop up through the steam browser will show up letting you log into Facebook and once you log in, it tells you that Facebook doesn't support this app meaning you can't even log into Facebook, the game will then soft-lock itself after this failure on a sign in loading screen that you are unable to close and you have to close the game. What game even uses Facebook as a platform to join friends."
9087,"Before I go into the negatives I will bring up the positives first. This game in the beginning and towards about 2018 was a blast. The hit registration was alright, plane spam wasn't an big issue in the slightest on ground battles. Also I will only be talking about ground battles for the tank lovers out there. I have had a blast with this game. I love the tanks you can unlock, the maps you play on, the sounds and how they have developed over time. But recently I don't even want to pick up this game to play it on my PC anymore. The reason being is the hit registration is very spotty sometimes at best. That isn't what really bothers me. What bothers me the most is the amount of planes in the sky on ground realistic battles from both the friendly team and the enemy team. Let me go into further detail with this. When most of the community didn't think about using planes in ground battles you actually had to have skill on the ground in order to win a battle. Now for some of the matches I have played it comes down to who can use bombs with the greatest proficiency or who has the most planes. Granted this is all in ground realistic battles for tanks. It wasn't terrible at first when people started using them more but in the past year it's a whole other story. When I get into a game I usually know by the time I capture an Objective I am most likely going to get bombed. I have tried hiding, being deep in a city, hiding behind rocks. It's very irritating to say the least about getting bombed just about every single match. All I want to do is play against tanks and I can't do that without having to look up at the sky and try to out smart the plane coming into bomb me. Also for those wondering revenge bombing is a huge thing now in ground realistic battles. I know I will get the question ""well what about AA""? The AA is subpar for a lot of factions. Granted you may think a 30mm Bofors gun will work very well against planes right? Well yes if they are close to your gun or are coming straight at you. The fire rate is also terrible for them as well. Now the USA has the M16 AA gun with 4 .50 cal machine guns firing in the same direction. Now when you have that AA gun working you can do okay. But if you don't a high fire rate well you better be john wick in the AA or your only going to hit them but not kill them. Now some people might think about radar shells that was developed later in the second world war and think ""can't you use those shells or unlock them for the Bofors gun""? That would be a no. You do not get any shells like that until at least 7.0 or higher that have proximity fuses. Best part is you don't even get lock on missiles until about 9.0br for AA. Until they fix the amount of planes that anybody can spawn in during a tank match I will no longer be playing this game. I hope this review helps some of you tank lovers."
9088,Yo
9089,I personally just do the air combat in the game and it's 10/10 for computer controls.

9091,This is a great game in general not really any bad things to say about it.

9102,"This game is terrible. I just got back into it after 3 years of not playing. Not only are there more bugs and glitches than when I left, but they are more gamebreaking. The pay to win aspect of this game is ridiculous. Someone can spend 10 bucks to buy enough bushes to cover their entire tank, making them invisible at range and hard to find weak spots when close up. Now that I've grinded back up on a new account to tier 4, almost every death I have is being killed by some bushcamping wehraboo at the far back of the map with a panther. the maps are terrible and not fun, and I constantly go up against 1970's tanks with advanced ammunition while I'm rumbling along in my T-34. Don't spend money on this and don't play it at all"
9103,gud game just to adictive
9104,difficult but fun
9105,epik co0l G4m3
9106,I do not recommend this to anyone. The game is built on frustration to buy into premium packs and premium itself. Repair cost is crazy and incentivises you to leave the game after one spawn if that spawn went bad. Goes really deep into that gamblers fallacy because you make the bet of do I continue and possibly lose even more lions or can I pop off and make it even

I am on edge each game, if i don't end up getting the endorphin hit i'm feinding for than i may commit hate crimes against my keyboard."

9143,"This game looks pretty good before you begin and is very likely make you enjoy at the early stage. However, after graduating from early, or WW2 stage, you may find the game is extremely poor on details. Firstly, there is no balance. USSR vehicles are always the best among all the other technology trees, from Rank 1 to 6. Please choose these as your only team. Secondly, pay to win. People may say the ones players can get without paying have the capability to fight against the ones of real money. Yes but misleading. Vehicles bought with real money always have lower Battle Ranking, sufficient attributes to face every enemy they meet, higher Silver Lion and EXP received, etc. As long as a player PAY, he/she enjoys. Last, anti-cheat is very close to 0. Cheaters will ONLY be banned when a video is sent directly to the ad."
9144,good
9145,i played this game on the official website before i downloaded it from steam for more than atleast 1000 hours i have gottnen nothing but pain yesterday i opened a crate and got an order next to a 1m crate and a 100k crate nothing but bad luck and suffering

9161,"Just like Enlisted, this game is also pay-to-win (in some cases). Grinding takes so much time and sanity that you get bombed everytime or get shot with 30mm jets. Unless you throw cash on this game, you will suffer getting killed every game without kills just by being uptierd.

I'd recommend this to people who'd offer their sanity just like dota."

9163,i have more than 5.7 hours i just got this on steam... anyways hate russians? hate germans? want weak ass armor? play this and grind the american tanks
9164,"While the grind can be tough, it can be very rewarding. This game, if you're persistent and enjoy war sim combat style games can be very fun. Overall this game is very fun and I highly recommend you try it. Of course its free and it is possible to grind your way to the top for free, just know that It will require alot of effort and at times you might find yourself playing lower BRs such as 6.0 or 5.0 to get enough SL to buy the next vehicle nearer the top. But, once again, I have had and will continue to have alot of fun playing this game."
9165,"This game is always tempting to play, having great potential to have a fun night with the boys or either the nights where you want to gouge your own eyes out, either way it's a fun job for the most part."
9166,"Do not mistake the ""Free to Play"" advertising as genuine. This game is pay-to-play if you don't want to spend 8 hours grinding every day for whatever vehicle you want.

Let me remind you that Gaijin is a Belarussian developer that has actively supported Donbas separatists and muted the in-game chat FOR A MONTH to prevent players from discussing the Russo-Ukrainian War. (As of 6/29/2022, they have re-enabled it but with a 30-second cooldown in between any and every message you send.)

Do not give these people your time or your money. I am lost, but that doesn't mean you have to be."

9169,"While the game is fun to play, it is very easy to get sniped from across the map. Half of the time, you can just randomly drive around in your tank then blow up from a shot that was kilometers away. The game also has a currency that can only be used via a premium currency and trying to get through the game for its Steam achievements or in-game medals takes hours."

9173,"Well the game itself is really great with all the planes, tanks and yes even ships, but the only problem is grinding for them so if your the type that does not like putting a lot of time into a game and grinding like hell to get what you want than its not a really good pick for you but all and all the experience is really great so even with all this games set backs, its still a genuinely a good game."
9174,Love this game so much. Changed my life from the beginning.
9175,play this game if you hate yourself

9186,"So, please disregard my hours invested. I just happened to realize the egregious dumpster fire that is this game and its development team. Hopefully, Steam is transparent and will not remove genuine reviews, because allegedly, Gaijin Interactive are notorious for removing opinions or comments that shine a negative light on their ""efforts"" towards their game, their monetization practices, and their gameplay designs.

However, to be fair and transparent myself, I feel obligated to include some positive opinions I have towards the game and it's community.

1. The ballistics, are for the environment, and the type of game, incredibly realistic and true to life. The vehicle models, behaviors, and designs are fantastic, and the historical accuracy is outstanding.

2. Gameplay, if you don't suck at the game, can be addicting, which might explain one of my disdains.

3. There is a great deal of depth in terms of replay value, investing time and effort in to further progressing in the game.

4. I haven't done anything in VR yet, though I plan on doing so, but I would most likely use it for combat flight simulation outside of DCS and VTOL VR. It is a nice addition to add that to a game that includes aerial combat.

I don't have any other positive comments, so oh boy do I have disdains.

1. Maps are egregiously unbalanced. Most maps are balanced to give an outstandingly unfair advantage to a specific team.

2. Unfortunately, as a result of the ballistic realism, especially with vehicles, certain tanks, in certain locations of the map, are blatantly unbeatable, and some specific tanks are just all around stronger, like the Panzer series tanks.

3. The gameplay is designed to punish people for not paying to win the game. If you obtain the game and continue to play it for free, you will STRUGGLE to make any progress towards higher tiers in research. Premium players will typically make the same research in half the time as they earn twice as many research credits as FTP players. The game is designed to force you to purchase something in an effort to advance, otherwise you might as well invest your money in to a 401k or retirement plan because progressing in the game is a career without premium.

4. matchmaking is broken, a lot of players will intentionally downgrade in skill level by intentionally failing to get put in to lower skill lobbies and completely dominate new players.

5. Artillery and air units deployed during ground combat matches are almost completely unstoppable unless you risk a respawn utilizing an anti air vehicle with the hopes that not only air units will come, but with the hope they will give you the opportunity to eliminate them.

6. I obtained the game, years ago, and stopped playing for these reasons, and mostly only came back to play VR mode with the A-10 Warthog. However, you either need to already be progressed far enough in to the game to obtain it, be a premium player and purchase it, or purchase it as a DLC for the price of a new AAA title.

7. Gaijin entertainment has no regard for their community and has no respect for constructive criticism or the opinions of its players. As a result, negative reviews or opinions that they can do something about, are typically removed. There is fundamentally no reason to do this other than to censor players acknowledging the flaws and corrupt practices of the company.

In conclusion, as with most Chinese nonsense, it is nothing but a way to steal money from people in exchange for nothing but rotten dog water and low quality garbage made by children in exchange for a meal a day. I genuinely recommend you treat this as a trap and a method to steal your money."
9187,The grind
9188,"progress is very slow and hours of gameplay is unrewarding. fun to start, disappointing to continue. unless you just want a free flying sim to ya know.. fly and what not"
9189,this game makes me very angry but i keep coming back
9190,wunder
9191,great concept ruined by an absolute trash can of a company
9192,plane is fly so i like the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
9193,"Nothing that I dislike about this game. Overall it is very good, accurate, and plain out fun. Thanks Steam for selling this product and thanks Gaijin for making an awesome game."
9194," fun game but hard to progress, if you spend a little time its much more fun"
9195,"If you've ever played World of Tanks or World of Warships, this is - effectively - exactly the same game. The monetization scheme is the same, the gameplay has equally bullshit mechanics, the game is more unoptimized than CP2077, and the developers (from what I've heard from long time players of WT) do NOT care about their players - just like Wargaming. Gaijin is in the Whaling business. No more, no less.

I gave this game multiple chances, and I can't not hate it. This game is NOT worth your time."
9196,"game is really unbalanced, theres no mmr so youre usually put against long time players and people so sticky that they pick up their chair when they stand up. Russian anything is the go to, german anything sucks before 7.0, most AA players cant hit anything at all. No dedicated tank only mode so every game is getting dive bombed. grind is extremely horrible, even with a premium account its horrible. it goes back to the no mmr, to progress you need to get points, but you cant get on the point to cap it, and you die almost right out of spawn after slogging the map for two minutes. not a noob, or new player, friendly game. community is extra toxic, almost worse than the DBD community"
9197,I thought my Steam and Gaijin accounts were linked and chose steam while logging in causing my account to be reset losing all my progress in the game.
9198,"They did an ""update"" that ruined the economy when the economy was  already bad enough. unless your a high skill player you aint making any money that or your playing reserves only if your afraid of losing progress. if your a new player considering trying too play this game i would advise you too find another game because this one will not respect your time."
9199,Great flight combat! Though I think making the research for parts and vehicles different would make research faster and more incentivised
9200,grind is dogshit
9201,talk to me goose
9202,Its just a awesome game!!
9203,A-10 GO BRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTT AND TANK GO BAM KAPLOW BOOM
9204,if you dont have a controller not for you as a war game fanatic i think all players should be able to play this game overall great but you guys need to fix how it only has half controller support for the menu not to play the game idk if its only for xbox controller pc players but please just please fix this
9205,pay for rides or grind 6 years for a tier 5 plane that will get outclassed anyways

PTW also.

9212,"VR releastic is the most creazy thing i ever dids, BUT NORMAL MODE. is just as goodyes. I LIKE NORMAL AND VR i like both and they both are good BUTTTT sometimes I DIEEE and im sad when I DIE so if you live and stuffs then YOU GOOOODDYY"
9213,Even dying is enjoyable to watch. Just don't pay for premium vehicles too far above your current rank and you should continue to enjoy the content.
9214,"Yes, I mean what other game offers this kind of gameplay? It is a grind, so while it is free to play I personally would recommend that you get premium when they have their sales. It helps the devs and helps you. Personally I would recommend not playing the USA as your first tech tree, have it as your second or third."
9215,it's ok I guess

Prepare yourself to say: ""Son of a bi**h"", ""GAIJIN!"" and ""HOW THE FU*K DID THAT PEN ME"".

I can say i have broken a controller while grinding (used to play this on xbox)

9240,"Very good, except the grind"
9241,Sometimes it's fun but usually it isn't. The devs are making it harder to grind and making it more expensive to just play the game normally at higher tiers instead of making gameplay better. The amount of time it takes to unlock upgrades in ships and progress to the next ship is simply insane. Gaijin is much more interested in your cash than making the game better.
9242,Good game but it is a little pay to win

9342,"what is the meaning of the battles? over time I have seen drastic changes, but now I would like to tell you my humble opinion:

1) Ground Battles - Ground battles from BR 6.7 and up are a continuous uptier. in addition, the maps that are proposed randomly are inadequate. one of the examples I can do is when you use a Jagdtiger and find yourself in a spawn in sight of the enemy one. 100% chance to receive a missile in the first 30 seconds of battle, pay repairs and exit the battle immediately. when I have this dynamic I have a 90% chance of receiving a battle defeat notification.
or we have the night battles, better with few players, 3 cap, big map and what could go wrong besides the campfest? helicopters of course...
the examples that can be done are many, from ghost shells to transformations of tank battles to aerial ones (ground RB to air RB), as over half of your team is in the air doing revenge kills by crashing into the enemy with their Premium plane.

2) Air Battles - what's the point of using a strike aircraft? for example an A10A: survive the take-off avoiding the premium F5-C crashing all the time and then 2 minutes and 35 seconds later (I also timed) your team is gone and you have just reached the first AA position on the map. needless to say, but then you find yourself surrounded and you give whoever killed you a free kill, instead you have to spend on repairs without earning anything.
Alternatively, in about 3 minutes, your team has killed all but one enemy. then you who have just arrived in the mission area ask your companions to save it because you have not yet scored points, you have just arrived but no. ""no one has to score, it is only allowed in dogfight"" for example.

Naval Battles - take for example an IJN Mikuma, you buy it to grind something. the spawn is forced into the open ocean. aaaaand wait, the best is yet to come: seconds later (SECONDS) from the enemy spawn you get a series of EXTREMELY PRECISE shots that do you several critical damage to the ship + fire (we don't miss anything) and while you try to escape, you have the others ships alongside blocking you. take a smaller ship then! a destroyer? ok. you spawn and the result is that either you get continuous fire from another ship (usually American) of the same class, or you get killed by a few shots from a WW1 battleship at 13km where in the middle there are maybe two islands with mountains and trees. I don't understand the meaning of the battles.

in conclusion, I have always gladly spent my money on WT as skins, premium vehicles etc but it seems to me that the game is going very badly. also because reading some developers/players who come to tell you ""if you don't like it, don't play it"" means that they don't care who willingly spends money often, but they rely more on the many who buy vehicles occasionally and nothing more.
I think money talks, I still have 44 days of premium time, after which I think I'll spend it elsewhere.
of course i alone can't change anything but not with my money bro"

9380,"Steer clear of this game, If you want to have a real/ social life!!!

Remember when this game was fun?
These times are long gone!

I played this a lot back in around 2014 where the ""sabre"" and it's counterparts were the latest jet planes in the tech tree.
Getting research points and thus planes was somewhat of a grind but it was bareable. And you got to those lovely WW2 warbirds rather quick. I did so for 3 nations. The game has had a steep learning curve then but eventually, with the help of some YT tutorials, I managed to get quite good.
Since the number of planes was half of what it is today, I knew most of the planes, their weaknesses/ strengthes and how to fly each plane in order to come out on top. And I would've considered myself a casual player then, spending maybe 2-3 h a day on the game.

TODAY, however, the grind is insane! INSANE, I tell you!
If you aren't willing to spend a lot of money AND time into the game you aren't getting nowhere. Back then I had so many silver lions, I didn't know how to get rid of them (as a free-to-play player!!!). Today, you earn so little of them that you can barely pay the high level tier repair/ rearm costs.

Like one of the top reviews already explains: You get paid with silver lions/ research points by performance. Low performance = low reward, furthering the difficulty of getting into the game.

Furthermore, today's learning curve is much, much more higher. Now with steam support, there are much more players there. Hence, there are much more good players there but also those who have maxed out the stats of their crews and planes. The lack of a proper battle rating system (the one in play is airplane based, rather then player based) frequently matches you up with the afore mentioned. Plus, there are much more planes/ tanks/ vehicles nowadays, which means much more stuff to learn and remember in order to win.

Thus, YOU WILL LOSE MANY GAMES - especially in the beginning. You will get LITTLE reward for that ""weak"" performance. It will take a long time to crawl up the tech tree - even as a premium member!
Be prepared to be frustrated a lot.
You will need a loooooooong breath and a lot of patience.

I for myself don't want to invest this much effort into a game.
I won't play this ""pay-to-win"" game anymore.
And neither should you."
9381,gud game
9382,"Following the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. He would drug his victim with triazolam or temazepam before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered his victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.[111][112]

Two months after the Tuomi murder, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American male prostitute named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.[113] Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. The skull was boiled and cleansed in bleach before Dahmer noted it had been rendered too brittle by this process. He pulverized the skull two weeks later.[114]

On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old bisexual man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.[114] Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;[115] he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing oral sex upon the corpse.[115] Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's body within 24 hours of murdering him, again disposing of the remains in the trash and retaining the skull before pulverizing it several months later.[116]

On April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the intended victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, ""Is that you, Jeff?""[117] Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she did observe that Dahmer was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer opted not to kill this particular victim, instead waiting until he had become unconscious before taking him to the County General Hospital.[118]

In September 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out, largely because of his drinking, his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells occasionally emanating from both the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment at 808 North 24th Street[91] and moved into his new residence on September 25.[119] Two days later, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.[120][121] Dahmer's father hired an attorney named Gerald Boyle to defend his son. At Boyle's request, Dahmer underwent a series of psychological evaluations prior to his upcoming court hearings. These evaluations revealed Dahmer harbored deep feelings of alienation. A second evaluation two months later revealed Dahmer to be an impulsive individual, suspicious of others, and dismayed by his lack of accomplishments in life. His probation officer would also reference a 1987 diagnosis of Dahmer suffering from a schizoid personality disorder for presentation to the court.[122]

On January 30, 1989, Dahmer pleaded guilty to the charges of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.[123] Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May.[124] On March 20,[125] Dahmer commenced a ten-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.

Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim, a mixed-race 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears ""just started talking to me"". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.[3]

The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to flay the corpse.[3] He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which he again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears ""exceptionally attractive"", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in acetone[126] and stored them in a wooden box, which he later placed in his work locker.[n 5] When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.[128]

On May 23, 1989,[124] Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with work release permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a sex offender.[129]

Two months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was paroled from this regime. His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.[130] On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis[131] before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high-crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.[132]

9438,"This game is dog shit, you can soft lock yourself when applying decals and have to restart the game."
9439,"he missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."
9440,"Definately a fun game to try out and if you love tanks/planes/ships or the military overall i would definately reccommend. If you are looking for an advanced game with these vehicles then i would not recommend this game because it has a more user-friendly and arcady feel to the vehicles especially the planes. Overall as a game i just wanted to try out, it is great"
9441,GRAPHICS
9442,Is fun
9443,"You know what? Fuck grass. Who needs grass when you can fly planes, drive tanks, and do whatever with boats."
9444,I got the funny number!
9445,Pretty good game. Remember allies are just enemies on blue. In other words do not trust ANYONE. I love and hate this game XD
9446,is so much fun to recherche through all of the countries the game play is awesome and fun it can be a little frustrating but its so much fun.
9447,"Really good game tho it has a problem with the pay to win system that is around the game. Still though is playable and really fun, specially with friends"

9457,"It's free-to-play and can be thoroughly-enjoyed without ever paying money into the game. That said, they (Gaijin) is *very* interested in making you spend money, so the progression can be quite slow.

Beware the currencies - there are a lot and it almost seems intentionally confusing. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER, SAVE ANY GOLDEN EAGLES UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN BE USED FOR (you occasionally get some for free, but they are mostly a paid currency with routes to buy for ""free"" - albeit with meager returns) 

If you want a game you can start up and casually fly/drive/sail around and shoot stuff, this is a great game for you."
9458,very good game (please release my family i beg you)
9459,This game makes me want to die in every form possible when fighting German mains
9460, nice
9461,"Theyre still adding some content (probably, Ive not been playing for a while) and its much more fun if you got some friends."
9462,It's pretty good and fun.
9463,very good
9464,It is very easy to pick up at any skill level. I also love the fact that you can change what types of scenarios you are battling in.
9465,aim for consle players. they sucky
9466,"most rage inducing addictive game
"
9467,"This game is not a new player friendly, it's not forgiving,highly monetyzed, very frustrating and the matchmaking sucks, this is my opinion as a new player, I tried to learn tips and tricks,how to play better ,but for nothing , I simply can't do anything to improve my skills and the gameplay experience is very poor."

9475,how is this a free game??
9476,"high settings is beautiful unfortunately i cant do raytracing but its good nonetheless
gameplay is good too
plus its free 
who doesnt like free shit"
9477,pay to win aspects with op tanks planes etc pay to win with camo that literally makes it impossible to see tanks at a distance is balanced awfully routinely putting you against people a tier above you making it impossible to even cause damage avoid at all costs.

9481,"I can let it slide with it being F2P, lots of balance issues blah blah, but the main thing that bothers me is since 2012 the game modes have been pretty much the same. 

if your a historical/semi-modern vehicle buff you'll like it."

9485,fun
9486,"Really starting to hate this game. Cannot go one game without being up tiered. Getting spawn locked by campers and being bombed constantly make one want to choose another game to play. AA needs to be buffed and planes need to be harder to get. Once you get spawn locked, War Thunder wants you to use all your tanks up or they penalize you. What is the point when you spawn and die instantly to bombs. Its not skill based, its luck of the draw and who you get grouped up with. It is also majorly bias and pay to play with premium 40$ tanks."

9488,pretty fun but its a grind
9489,Very fun game. :) i like
9490,Multi vehicles u can play.
9491,"Definitely a fun free-to-play game. There's a steep learning curve once you get into the higher tier matches, but overall its a good time as long as you're aware of your surroundings and don't drive headfirst onto the control points as soon as the match starts. 

Progression is fairly slow if you don't spend any money, but you can still move up through the tiers if you're willing to grind it out. Though there are a good number of great tanks/planes that you can only purchase with money, if you have a good understanding of the game you're not at any real disadvantage. 

The only gripe I have is that the camouflage you add on to your vehicles is only purchasable with Gold Eagles and not Silver Lions. It isn't expensive and of course this a free to play game, but the camo gives an extreme advantage in many situations."

9496,Great way to lose the last of your patience.
9497,"This game is bsiclly raping new players. i gotta admit im not exactly new to war thunder as i played on xbox for about 2 years. and while this game feels a ot better on pc, its also even more asshole. this entire game is made tio frustrate you to the point were you spend money. if youre new you just get raped. everything is stacked against you and will be because you didint played it when this game came out. STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!!!"
9498,Aeroplane
9499,"if youre willing to put in the grind then good game
fuck you leo"
9500,Russian Bias
9501,A great miltary game  that has the best tank and air plane combat!
9502,"This game has greatly affected me on a emotional, physical, spiritual, cognitive and financial level. I no longer even find joy in killing enemies on the other team, the short lived joy from the tiny squirt of dopamine that was once released isn't released anymore. I only find mild solice in the thought that killing an enemy will be bringing upon them the hardships this game has bought upon me. This game will turn you into a masochist in where the only pleasure you will find in playing this game will be derived from the pain you will receive by playing it.

I'm hoping if you're here reading the reviews for warthunder you haven't yet decided to sell your fucking soul to the snail and download this plague on your computer, if you answer yes to any of the following question this game is not for you. Forget it ever existed, do not return.

Do you enjoy life?
Do you like more then 4 hours of sleep a night?
Would you like stability within your life?
Do you like having good relations with your family and friends?
Would you like to keep your job?


However, if you answer yes to any of these following questions this game is perfect for you.

Do you enjoy eating lead house paint and crayons?
Would you like to sit in front of a computer screen for hours a day neglecting every aspect of your life and finding no joy at all in what you're doing, all in order to unlock pixels that resemble a military vehicle only to die to a 13 year old Estonian child and his dad's credit card?
Do you have severe anger issues?
Would you like to pull each of your finger nails off with a pair of pliers?
Do you have no friends or want to lose them all?
Would you enjoy kicking a toothpick under you toe nail into a wall?"
9503,fun and perfect for people who like top gun

9507,Its grindy but rewarding at the same time it balances realism and fun fairly well
9508,"big re edit, Honestly run from this game as fast as you can until Gaijin at least tries to fix the screwed up battle rating levels and multiple tanks of the same br in the same nation with huge gaps in between, and the silver lion price for repair is obscene (that's how they fix br ratings),then there are the super low resolution players that can see through almost anything in game (including hills)  there's the auto aim cheaters and the god awful toxic community.
Oh and if you are playing without a subscription you cannot afford to auto fix your vehicles (so it takes about 15 days to repair a single vehicle) if you do use auto repair you cannot afford to research and buy new vehicles, and for some lucky reason you are able to purchase that new shiny vehicle, Congratulations!. Oh but wait now you need to pay to put a crew slot onto it, and all those other vehicles in other lines of the same nation branch you do not want to play well good news, you need to research and buy them all before you can move on...."

"
9538,"good but im bad
"
9539,its a fun and interesting game
9540,"Well hello there. You are wondering if this game is for you... Belive me it is not. the game is free but it is constantly trying to make you spend money on it in order to buy a premium account. It is close to impossible to grind without premium. The game also has a issue with players. Most skilled players aren't playing in top tier. They are playing in lower tier in order to have more fun witch creates the unplesent grind for new players. Hard core players have no respect for new people and dosen't give a damn if they are making new people quit. Trust me this game is not for you unles you like to play games with:
1. Balancing issues when adding new veichles. When gajin adds new veichles (but most of the time premium or event) these veichles tend to be ""op"". They fix this by adding a extremely high repair cost to these veichles those making them unplayable for people that dose not have the money to use them. In general the repair cost is just bad in this game and gajin is not planing on doing anything about it. Just like Bethesda tends to do with most of their game.
2. A endless grind. Many factors makes me say this. From new veichles being constantly added to the game those making newer player have to grind more in order to complete a teir. However a tank i the swedish tech tree has the option to be by passed when that tree barely has any tanks compaired to Germany, Soviet and Amerika (These trees dosen't have any bypassable tanks,planes and so on). There are also big problems with the ekonomy those making newer players finding themselfs on the edge of being poor due to the enormus smurfing problems that the game has. (This isn't gijins fault but the fanbase, and if you don't agree as a top teir player then i would like to see what br you play during events).
3. A constant reminder that the game wants you to spend money on it in order to aither progress faster or earn more rewards.
4. Veteran players are abusing lower teir matches and makes sertain br and teirs (ahem ahem teir 3) unplayable. I have over 200 hours on the game and have not gotten above teir 3 due to higher teir players constantly abusing map knowledge, camping and premium veichles. In other words you won't play against players with the same amount of experiance as you have.
5. The economy of the game is garbage and you can lose a lot of money in one match. the ekonomy is just made to be grindy due to the game wanting you the new player to spend more time on the game. You won't be able to buy veichles when you progres to teir 3 or beyond due to a lak of silver lions. (The game want's you to spend money on it in order to get that money to buy the new veichles)
But if you think that these ""qualities"" are for you then go on. This game is for you then. But be aware that the game is close to unplayable if you are a new player. You will always have that one guy witha fancy decorated tank and bushes all over it that has over 10 kills in your lobby and you can't do anything to kill him. But remember that these veteran players are just fatherless and you can't do anything about it."

Each vehicle is modeled closely and accurately, it gives more immersion to the feel of the game. Though it does take time to get used to and takes practice to use all the vehicles but the early stages are beginner friendly. i've been playing since 2014 so my hours are less than they should be, i played through the browser mostly."

9562,"Pro's
-Many types of fun tanks planes and battleships
-Different countries with a variety of fun vehicles to play with
-Sometimes can be funny and fun
Con's
-Many bugs you can come against your play
-Most of the gameplay is grinding 
-ghost shells when you fired your cannon but do not do damage to the enemy tank
-As the higher you get on the tech tree the more grinding it gets
-Sadly Gajin the company can get a little greedy on the game
-Very hard to beginners players 
-can get annoying on the max repair cost
-Gonna have to spend hours a day just to get to the end of the tech tree
-Can easliy rage on this game and make you always feel anger in every death 

P.S if you ever play this game for a while and you always feel anger in every time you die try to take a break from war thunder for a little bit it will help you cool down or even. Try to take a break for a week or dont play the game for a while."

9568,"This game is alright but once you start putting in a lot of hours, you notice the russian bias. russian tanks are stronger than they should be. this is due to russian devs giving buffs to russian tanks and making historically op tanks garbage, tiger, panther etc."
9569,"Awesome Game !! Lots's of Tanks , Planes and Airships with a focus on authentic modeling and statistics.  

Game size is 45GB with 15GB additional for every Texture pack. However, works fine on the recommended GPU RC 570. Most GPU's with a 4-6GB VRAM and 4-5 T'flop performance would be fine.

9577,"I would not recommend this game for those play casually and want to keep your sanity. If you feel like starting with American line of tanks, don't. The point that you get to the Sherman line of tanks and all its variants it will mostly be a one sided endeavor of you getting one shot from across the map. Furthermore Gaijin doesn't care for player feedback for tank balance and map design because most or all maps one side will be lobbing rounds into the other teams before a single base is captured."

9579,this game is very grind heavy  and used to have plenty of issues of not doing much of what the community wanted but now i beleve the great people working on this game or whom chosses what updates to work on has gotten better at listening to the public this game is good if you simply like ww2 history and online fights
9580,Amazing game one of the best
9581,"The worst grind out of all of the F2P tank games. Worst Graphics and gameplay and next to no cheat protection. I hate World of tanks but this game makes it look like game of the year.

Also super predatory monetization

Only good thing is the damage modeling, but all the above makes it not worth it."

9585,"this game is by far the best tank game out on the market right now in terms of gameplay. it is genuinely fun to play this game. that is until you realize that this game is insanely pay to win. you will run into people with entire trees on their tank making themselves invisible. or they will buy ""premium"" tanks that have much better amour and better ammo than yours oh and also they make double money and research than you. no matter which way you slice it you are at a extreme disadvantage if you don't pay money on premium. I've already sunk to much time into this game to stop trying to get the Abrams. if you haven't played this game i recommend you ignore this game and never turn back. if you are a pay to win player you make up for a lack of skill with op vehicles. if you are a high B.R free to play baller, I wish you the best of luck in this sea of inconsistent BS."

9625,Its a commitment from the start because there is a learning curve and the vehicle progression is slow but not painful meaning you cant fly by all the low tiers which is a good thing because inn most games u play until u get the best stuff then you never touch low tiers again but this game gives the same respect to the first vehicle u get as the last one u will
9626,"A chaotic / arcade explosion party.
TANKS
First you see the vehicles : they do look descent.
Then modules in the tanks + kill shot cam. Nice!
Then you play a few hours and realize, it's just a giant arcade game with random people doing random thing. Sometimes you win without shooting anyone, other times, you kill 4 people but can't help but loose.
PLANES
Coming from IL2 and DCS, the plane behaviour just feels wrong.
Probably good as an arcade plane shooter. 
Not my taste."

9633,if you play dont expect to have fun
9634,"TL;DR: 7/10, gameplay is decent but no real improvements in all those years and the grind is hell.

Rant:
If you really (, REALLY) need your dose of MMO vehicle combat, then look no further. This game has literally hundreds of aircraft, tanks and ships from all kinds of nations and time periods. (It's also surprisingly light on pay2win mechanics for a F2P-game.)
BUT if you are also looking to get into the more modern vehicles at some point without spending money on the game or seek a game with a decent selection of interesting game modes to choose from, then ehhh... well... better look elsewhere.

I think the only reason why this games review score isn't at 20%, is because it kind of has a monopoly in the ""Online Vehicle Warfare""-genre. The only sort of contender would be ""World of Tanks""- but let's be honest, that game is kind of crap in a lot of ways, especially if you prefer to have at least some amount of realism and hate pay2win. (Looking at you hp bars and premium rounds)

9664,"Really fun game, but after playing for over a year across this Steam account and another, as well as playing with friends, I wouldn't recommend this game based solely on the fact that it takes FOREVER to unlock anything beyond Tier 1, and has P2W elements. 
You can unlock alot instantly, naturally, by paying money. OR, you can play for years and get to, like, Tier 3. Also way too much importance on the funding and currency later on, and kind of takes away the whole ""start a game and play"" thing and makes you think about how much you can play before going broke and having to start low tier again."

9676,"I have never seen a game so maliciously crafted as war thunder is, this game isnt fun its more like a job that no one pays you to do but you still eagerly show up on time and finish your shift.
but if you want a game to keep you busy and like military stuff than this game is one of the best for rewarding progression since no one can really complete it"
9677,The game is really fun to play it takes quite some time to get good planes or whatever u want to play. u can test drive/fly the vehicles which is really fun to do. its really realistic and a really good war game
9678,"Cool free to play vehicle Action/sim game. Can be frustrating due to the business model and the slowness of the grind in higher ranks though, but the gameplay is great."
9679,"The core gameplay concept is unlike any other. It bridges vehicle simulations and arcade multiplayer team battles nicely.

However, it is really grindy.

If you plan on investing your time in this game, it's better if you purchase premium time EVEN IF you are really, really passionate. For your mental health really. TIME vs $$ invesment isnt worth dicussing abt if you want to unlock a lot of vehicles. 

Expect powercreep and overpowered vehicles in every tier bracket. 

You CAN use one vehicle to unlock multiple other vehicles. Compared to World of Tanks where you have to use only predecessing vehicles to unlock them. So ask around what strong vehicles on each nation & tier is to grind stuff.

Community? toxically hilarious. Expectations are high when you go high tier as the grind, corporate bs will have turned ppl away from this games. Veterans of this game are something else sometimes.

9683,Solid 9/10
9684,"My experience:
1.) Buy swedish starter pack
2.) Wait 5 minutes in the queue for a battle
3.) Get killed by a tank that drives past at 200+ km/h and hits you in the pack before your turret can even do a 20 degree rotation (WTF)
4.) Get in a plane and die within 5 seconds of spawning
Basically its like a GTA Online freemode only with long queues before you can play and worse graphics.

Air fights are fun but quickly become repetitive as the progression to more modern planes is super slow."

9721,It's a love and hate game
9722,"[h1]The bad...[/h1]
[hr]
[h2] A chasm between gamemodes[/h2]
Arcade battles feel extremely cheap because as long as an enemy has you in their field of vision, you'll be visible on the minimap and a big red nametag will appear over your tank which can be seen through several buildings and basically at an infinite range as long as you lock onto the target with the middle mouse button. [i]Neat, huh?[/i]
Realistic battles are better in that regards but they're extremely punitive for new players, especially given that map knowledge and knowing sight lines play an immense role in this mode. [i]Ever played Dark souls and Elden ring? Child's play compared to this game.[/i]

[h2] A hit to realism [/h2]
The game adverts realism but the grand majority of the tanks unlocked in low BR struggle with the slightest inclination and in some cases they even get stuck on a lower portion of the map where they can't easily get out of ([i]I'm looking at you 47/32 L40 on Ash River, point A[/i]). Partially because of this reason, it is not uncommon for you to spend several minutes just driving towards the capture point at an awfully slow pace and god forbid if you hit a destructible decoration: those ludicrous 12 km/h will be halved in no time. [i]It's a [b]tank[/b] i'm sure it can drive over a wooden fence with relative ease, no? Welp, there goes my precious speed.[/i]

[h2]Grind? I barely know 'er![/h2]
Researching vehicles and parts is painstakingly slow and, in all honesty, the grind doesn't feel rewarding in the slightest and that's something said from someone whom played grindfests like Warframe for thousands of hours. It's there purely because Gaijin wants you to spend money to buy premium currency so that you can either assign ""convertible research points"" to what you're trying to research or straight-up by it immediately.

[h1]..and the good[/h1]
[hr]
Despite the shot fired at the lack of realism in the tank movement, the game actually manages to deliver good realism in terms of tank modules, volumetric armor and even bullets to the point where the game can become rather technical and overwhelm new players with all the kinds of bullets and MG belts that some vehicle have.
The game has a pretty high skill ceiling thanks to the different strategies you can have when fighting your foes, especially given that every tank has weak points so the best approach might not always be blasting right away at center of mass.
There's a cubic FRICKTONNE of vehicles in the game (exactly 2000 at the time of this review) buut a good portion of them are premium vehicles that can only be bought through Gaijin own version of the steam market and [b]OH BOY[/b] if some prices are high.
Last but not least... the game can be quite addicting sometimes. I don't know why but placing a good shot onto your enemy and watching it go up in a blazing fireball of glory gives you a rush of dopamine that makes you yearn for more death and murder. [i] I promise, I'm not not a psychopath... i think[/i]

[h1]The conclusion [/h1]
[hr]
From what i experienced so far, the game is not bad but at the same time i don't think i would really recommend it, especially for casual players. The suffering and grind required to get out of low BR games is extremely painful to the point where it just ruined the game for me, especially given that some countries like Italy or France have awful reserve vehicles making the grind even painful."

9773,"If I could give the game a mediocre rating instead of a yes/no, I would. It's not a good game, but isn't necessarily a bad one either.

I don't care for air or naval combat in this game, so I won't talk about the gamemodes primarily focusing on those. This is a review strictly for ground battles (Arcade Battles and Realistic Battles) from the perspective of a working adult with relatively limited amounts of time to play games.
If you are planning on playing this game without spending any money and would like to play relatively modern vehicles, prepare for an extremely tedious grind or look for something else. If you're happy playing WW2-era vehicles, the grind is very easy.

[list]
[*]Most lower-rank anti-air vehicles do a better job focusing on ground than air
[*]Needing to research the ability to repair a vehicle and to extinguish a fire, grind for the sake of grind without any reasonable sense
[*]Traction-physics were changed some while back to combat players climbing into unintended spots on maps, instead of just fixing the maps. This resulted in even less logical traction-physics which are at times borderline comical.
[*]Larger tech trees need to spend more time unlocking vehicles from previous ranks to progress onto the next one
[*]Tutorial only applies to arcade modes and is mediocre at best
[*]Not a lot of communication-options for teamplay, unless you can type real fast
[*]The game features lootboxes
[/list]

[h1][b]The bad parts[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]Map design is quite simply extremely poor from a gameplay standpoint; Unbalanced spawn points, ability to snipe from spawn to spawn, spawning in an open field, one side of the map given better cover, old tanks on very large maps, modern tanks on very small maps. There has been very little care put into the creation of most maps and it shows. This would not be such a large problem without the respawn-system, but it is amplified tenfold because of it.
[*]Engine sounds especially for wheeled vehicles sometimes just quite simply do not play regardless of distance.
[*]The game does not encourage teamwork. Defending a captured objective is a good thing to do but you won't get rewarded for doing it as your progression is tied much more directly to how you did in a match instead of how you and your team did, which leads to a lot of people avoiding playing the objective in favor of personal progression. This is slightly less of an issue in RB compared to AB. Personal progression generally does not win games, but it is what is being rewarded the most. I am guilty of doing this as well to speed my progress through the grind.
[*]Massive repair costs for smaller tech tree vehicles at higher tiers makes people leave a match after a single death to avoid losing more currency. Non-surprisingly by paying for a premium account this is much less of an issue.
[*]Ground Battles are called Ground Battles, but also feature airplanes and helicopters (at higher ranks) whilst Air Battles does not feature player-controlled anti-air for example. Naval Battles also include aircraft. I don't personally mind this too much, but it would make more sense to call the modes combined arms (ground, air or naval) and this has been an issue for a few friends that wanted to play tank-vs-tank but had to deal with aircraft as well and thus stopped playing the game as it wasn't what they thought it would be. In RB you also need to grind your chosen nation's aircraft tech tree, as winning without air support can be very difficult especially when you start encountering helicopters.
[*]Increasing crew-level for a given vehicle takes a large amount of time, unless you pay money in which case you can start out with a straight up increase in vehicle performance as opposed to a person who hasn't spent money on that particular vehicle.
[*]Some tech trees are an enormous pain in the ass to grind through (Great Britain is suffering and I'm just bad at playing Swedish paper tanks) due to lacking vehicle performance
[*]Swapping tech trees is quite simply a massive pain as the grind starts again, although low-tier France has been quite enjoyable
[*]Game objectives fall into three categories: (1) Capture and hold a single neutral point, (2) defend your team's point and try to capture the enemy's point, (3) capture and hold three neutral points. 1 is by far the worst one out of these, as if one team succesfully wins the initial push, defending the point is extremely easy on most maps as long as nobody is too horny for kills. 2 easily devolves into just a team deathmatch, which actually makes it the most enjoyable as pushing into enemy territory requires some coordination, which is severely lacking in this game. 3 would be good but due to map design either the points are too close together or don't have any cover, meaning that the winning move is often to play team deathmatch until you can push enemy spawn to an extent and then cap the points at which point it's already [i]gg.[/i]
[*]Ultra-low quality graphics settings make things way too easy to see and essentially turns this into a point-and-click adventure game. I played 10 games on high settings and then 10 games on ULQ and did noticeably better on the lower settings as seeing enemies was incredibly easy, sometimes you can even see enemies behind buildings that haven't yet been rendered. Probably doesn't matter too much in AB, but it's an issue in RB and SB.
[/list]

[h1][b]Some thoughts[/b][/h1]
Mechanically the game has a lot of things going for it, but is held back by greedy monetization schemes, bad design decisions and poor management. Whilst the actual combat is mostly enjoyable, anything outside of that is not. Stay in rank IV and below for sanity and healthy blood pressure if you're planning on minimal monetary investment."
9774,I must be sadomasochistic that I keep returning to this game even though I get slaughtered too many times due to its unbalanced setup. Will totally recommend if your computer can handle a literal punch.
9775,German planes go brrrrrrr
9776,Great game. Makes me want to kill my self most days. But not all!
9777,"Expect ZERO customer support.

9781,"A very fun game with a steep learning curve. I'd say don't play this game if you want something stress-free and easy. The models are good, the vehicles are accurate, and the gameplay is fun once you get a handle of it. However, the game isn't skill-balanced, and there are a lot of trolly players who will make it hard for new players."

9803,"War Thunder is simultaneously the most fun and the most boring game. You spend as much time killing enemy tanks as you spend getting destroyed by them.  While at first,  the game seems realistic, realism is thrown out the window.  T-44s in War Thunder can survive multiple  88 mm rounds at point blank range from rear and sides.  In real life, the 88mm round would penetrate the T-44 from over a 1 km.  Tier 2 tank destroyers 1 shot you from across the map. You are just as likely to feel like you wasted your time playing a match of War Thunder for a measly 50-100 XP towards your chosen vehicle that you are researching as you are having fun destroying tank after tank earning at least 1000 XP."

9826,"use to play WoT and i played up to T7 tanks, when I started this I enjoyed the change. instead of HP of the tank itself but the people in it. making it more realistic and paying a bit more attention to your shots. also on the plus side, you get the navy and planes in the same game and easily swap over instead of quitting the game.

It just feels better but sadly no artillery tanks"
9827,"-There's 20 maps (apparently),  you will only play 5.

-You will get shot in your spawn, from the enemies spawn. 

-Ground RB has planes and helicopters, on no timer or heavy price to use, with access to your spawn on the map that is only 1-3km big. 

-Russian/USSR vehicles are ridiculously buffed, harder to kill, the cheapest to repair, and have a massive win rate percentage. 

-1940's tanks are tiered against 1970's tanks. (Again, USSR gets HEATFS against WW2 tanks)

-The economy is abhorrent and the company is very greedy."

9829,"Now I'm coming from PS4, I can't play War Thunder on my potato laptop because I don't have enough space. but boy.. oh boy, do I got something to say.

This game. it's an absolute [b]grind-fest.[/b] I'm stuck on 3.0 in the american tree and had to buy premium tanks ( german and russian, because I've heard they're at least half-decent. ) to even enjoy a battle, and even then, in PVE modes, I can get deleted by enemy tanks from 'AmMo ExPlODeD' or 'CrEw KnOcKeD oUt' because the A.I has the aim of Chris Kyle.

I tried regular PVP battles before that. I can't even bother to try them now. I'm no god in this game, but there's a point to that. you need to play with people that are on your skill level, not people below, not people above. without that, the game just doesn't work.

The only redeeming features I can even think about in this game is the acrobatic servers you can occasionally find in custom battles. and that's it.

I sank money and time into this game trying to enjoy it. I occasionally go back to it just to see if It's fun at all. it really isn't. it's stressful, it's un-fun, you get thrown into multiplayer matches against players that are either gods at the game or have tanks that are x10 more powerful in armament and armor than yours.

and I haven't even started with air battles. I so desperately wanted to climb the ranks of fighters and find my way to the F-14, but with how little RP you get out of PVE battles, I honestly just can't help but be discouraged. It's saddening to see how far this game has fallen from when I played it last in 2015 ( my first time playing, i wish It was the last aswell. ) and then I swung back around ( late 2019-2020, probably. )

Gaijin. [u]fix your game.[/u] the less you listen to your loyal community the more players revolt/leave. and once again. if your not willing to spend actual money to get even the slightest fair chance in a fight, whether air, land, sea or somewhere in-between. [b]DON'T GET THIS GAME.[/b]"

9850,banana
9851,phenom
9852,"As an intro: I played this before from gaijin launcher - so steam counter is not relevant in representing of how much time I spent in this game in general.    
     
     So after some graphically impressive adds acompanied with impressive promises I desided to give this a try on my new rig (i7 12700 + rtx 3070ti) - to try it out and see whats going on in this game itself. And my expectations haven't matched reality, unfortunately. 
     
     Game is incredibly boring, uncreative and everything in it is too dated - tech game design, gameplay design etc. It feels especially good after playing other online games: BF 5, CS, COD, Overwatch. Unfortunately, this is just a ""better"" clone of WoT (despite both of this games ain't any good). 
     
     Gameplay accents on ""realism"" despite putting player into unrealistic battle surrounding. As a result - you play slow tanks on a 1 square kilometer of space with ~20-30 other tanks, with zero infantry and objectives being ""kill all enemy tanks and\or control 1-3 points for some reason"". Incredibly tealistic if you count on the fact, that many (if not most) tanks that are in this game are made without an idea of being ""tank destroyers"".
     
     Maps are plane and encourage camping from predefined spots. All of them are basic and made ib same ideology. Basically, its a WW2 styled ""massive tank battle"" with (too) straightforward ideas, and it doesn't matter what you are in: ww2 tank/plane or an MBT or jet - on a modern tank or jet you will do same and fight same as on pre ww2 one and any other in this game. And yes, you will fight on an MBT/jet on WW2 styled locations - near burning Reichstag or soviet village. And vice-versa - on a ww2 tank in modern port or city.
     
     If you throw away the ""realism"" and concentrate on competitive aspect - you won't get what you find. Matchmaker may easily drop you versus a higher level of tech or lower, despite time finding you a match sometimes baing few seconds - why isn't it possible to make it 30 seconds - 5 minutes? Or make a setting for a player's choice: to find game faster or to wait a bit for a better match? And in general - while playing, you can't find for yourself any competitive value in the process.
     
     Despite objectives on the map being team based, there are few ways to communicate and coordinate with teammates - there is no viable voice chat and even text chatting is limited - so nobody use that. In fact, most of the time players are solo and everybody doing whatever he wants. Thats why you ain't getting satisfaction even after wins.
     
     The gameplay is made slow on purpose. Well, the gameplay itself is uncomfortable. You easily get frustrated and bored even if you kill several enemies and your team wins because of zero creativity in gameplay. Match these factors - and you will easily get bored after couple of days or even hours playing. 
     
     Leveling of tech is too grindy and tech itself often has no difference with previously opened one, making leveling (even with premium) too grindy and boring. 
     
     Graphics are generally good despite physics system and game engine itself being dated, and you easilly feel it. It's an old, poorly technically designed game with HD textures. Many tech issues: random fps drops, stutters, game feels sluggish and laggy from time to time despite being played on modern pc (12700 + rtx 3070ti). 
     
     I can't recommend this game even for those, who doesn't care about everything mentioned below, because I can't even find any real, convenient pros. Tech itself is made based on history specifications. But I can't recommend it even for those, who just wan't to try out a realisticish designed tech because of grind and prices - it isn't worth paying 40-60 bucks to try out a leopard, abrams, any other to be disapointed of game itself after couple of days. Maybe ones, who play world of tanks may find this somehow interesting, but the question to those: why are you wasting your time in 2022 playing games like that if there are a lot of much more games to play in your free time? 
     
     Value your free time and spend it visely - and definitely won't recommend you spending (or rather wasting) it in this game - most likely that you won't get any satisfaction, only regrets."
9853,don't
9854,"It used to be a game i liked a lot but the later game grind just made the game feel more repetitive and i haven't managed to make myself try and pick it up again since it just feels like u need to spend exponential amount of money on this game.

The grind is real. The devs make it stupidly hard to unlock anything, the aim of which being to frustrate you, so you buy ""gold"" and premium products to speed up the process. This is turning away new and old players alike, and one day will be the death of this game.

I have almost 2,500 hours in this game and have spent about £200, and I only have about 1/4 of the planes, let alone the tanks and ships too.

If you are new to the game, and want to get to jets as quick as possible, choose Israel. It'll fast track you to the fast-movers.

I love this game but it kills me to see the devs screwing over the players so much."
9873,love game
9874,this game is so fucking bad too many sweats op vehicles and the grind is way to long and not fun. dog shit creators
9875,"Either spend 100 for one plane or get wrecked, bad game. grind is awful."
9876,"If you want to have a enjoyable time well... you better run from here you need to sell your soul to play be careful.

9877,"cool

9880,good game but gets stale
9881,super fun exhilerating game
9882,A10 go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT!!!
9883,is very gut game
9884,i cant stop playing it husrts im hurt mentaly but im still playing for some reason
9885,its faster to get a job and earn money to pay for packs than grinding. would recommend
9886,wsredtfyguhijok
9887,"Load into a game with reserve tanks

Get matchmade against 2.0 tanks



"
9888,Good game but high tier is sad and u need to grind for hours
9889,"Pain? Yes
Do I hate it? Yes
Am I still going to play it? Yes..."
9890,jau wanna waste my entire life
9891,"I played this for too long, it doesn't show the time on steam, cuz I almost didn't play it on steam. This game is too long to grind. Game creators don't care about the community and is milking the game. Play this game if you like wwii vehicles, have fun. Don't play it for toptier vehicles, cuz then you will suffer a lot unless you buy  a premium. This game is basically pay to have fun. Some tips: no armor=best armor; play the big three (usa, germany, ussr) to suffer less, buy stuff if you really like the vehicle and not just to make grind easier cuz most likely when you get the vehicle you were grinding for you will be dissapointed, know enemy vehicles weakpoints, french lowtier tanks are piece of garbage, Italy has the smallest tank in the game and a formula1 and they have probably worst top tier tanks or britain has idk either don't grind it's not worth to grind it to top tier, this game is russian bias, when you use HE rounds against heavy tanks or top tier tanks aim to the roof cuz it has the weakest armor and is an almost guaranteed oneshot. And most importantly attack the D point!"
9892,"After playing this game for about 500 hours I can say that this game is unique. There is no other like it but that doesn't excuse it's egregious grind and balancing issues (especially when it comes to BR compression). Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good game but the more you play it, the more you'll end up hating it due to balance and grind. The first couple of tiers is easy to grind but later it becomes a huge slog, not only that, it becomes more of a slog because of tank repair cost making it twice as grindy. The only way to truly enjoy this game is with premium and even that's up for debate. 

I'd give this game a solid 7/10, it's definitely not an average/mediocre game but due to it's grind and forcing you to purchase a premium account is a big no-no in my book. Premium should help enhance the game, not be a requirement."
9893,n
9894,I am In love with Air combat and I don't have time anymore DCS so WT is the perfect solution to people who love air combat but do not love complex Flight manual's or  Stick Rigs!
9895,good game
9896,sometimes gives a lot of headache and makes me want to kill myself but I have played for too long not to recomend it.
9897,i have spent 290 hours testing vehicles ._. totally recommend
9898,"yee, me like"
9899,do not play this game
9900,Very interesting game. So much action. 10/10 very good game.
9901,"Was actually really enjoying the game until the latest update with buggy textures that literally obstruct your screen when youre trying to aim. went from 140fps to barely hitting 60 now aswell. the game is extremely P2P. 

sure you COULD play through the game without spending a penny if you dont mind:

-playing 300+ games to unlock a single vehicle
-constantly being outclassed by a player that just spent money to buy a premium vehicle 
-overpowered decals that allow players that pay to hide their tanks with bush decals you can ONLY BUY WITH REAL MONEY that give a massive advantage in realism mode
-Dealing with buggy textures randomly that completely obstruct your view and get you killed
-random frame drops
-toxic teammates
-one sided matches
-getting killed the second you spawn on some maps
-playing what feels like the same 5 maps over and over again
-constantly getting pestered to buy premium one way or another when you login or try to use anything on the store
-Terrible support if you have any account issues
-Russia bias
-buggy hit registration (a shot that scrapes the side of your tank can sometimes insta kill you and other times a clear side hit on a tank can ricochet from point blank range
-arcade mode is flawed with its planes feature you can spawn in and instantly jam your gun so guess what now you get to fly around for another 40 seconds without any weapons while you wait for the timer to finish so you can go back to your tank

Positives:

-cool tank graphics when you hit someone showing what happened to the shrapnel and the shell (even thought half the time it isnt accurate to what actually happened)
-planes feel pretty nice

final note: the game is fun for about aslong as you can tolerate mindless grinding with the same vehicles over and over again with no variation

maybe instead of players leaking classified tank documents they can leak how much money gajin is making from premium without actually improving their game lmao"
9902,i like the game but it is gonna take you along time to get to modern day tanks and jets so be careful bc you might spend alot of money on this game
9903,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It will suck you into it like a meth addict and you will never be free. This game is less balanced than a needle on its head and the matchmaking algorythm will make face stronger vehicles than you 9 out of 10 times. Everything here is a danger to your mental health, including everyone playing with you. The community for this game is one of the most toxic out there, worst than Call of Duty, and the devs never, ever listen to player suggestions, as well visibly not playing the game, because they make all of the wrong decisions all of the time. They are only after your money. This is a warning. If you download this, there is no going back..."
9904,"step 1 play game, it sucks. step 2 unintall. Congrats you have completed the war thunder experience"
9905,Very realistic war game
9906,too grindy innit
9907,Infuriating yet addicting. It will drain your wallet.
9908,"I doubt anyone reads reviews for ""Mostly Positive"" or higher rated f2p games or that anyone who does havent played this game yet but in hopes that someone came upon this review I made sure to leave my 2 cents to spare the mental health of some of those people in touch with their psyche and how manipulative tactics work. This game is pure frustration hidden behind good looking models, and flashy explosions. 
 It is obvious for many but as we see in ""Mostly Positive"" ratio not that many, that games are made for money and money alone, not for players, our entertainment, respect or any humane approach to us other then possible contents of our wallets and the same goes for War Thunder. Players call it F2P, some (mostly kids) call it free game, while it is free to install and play as much as You want it comes with plethora of manipulative tactics such as horrendous grind and monetizetion of any and every part of the game so that player will get frustrated enough into easing some of that frustration by paying into many possible and I would say crucial micro transactions if one wants to get access into the features of the game in any faster amount of time that will be still frustratingly high. Amount of vehicles You can take into battle will be limited by slots that You can pay for effectively meaning that those who have more can stay in the match longer then You, vehicles come with price for vehicle alone, for adding it into the crew, for teaching the crew how to use it effectively despite You could have already spent time and or money on that said crew and then You even pay for dying in the match, using ammunition etc so You will be paying for everything in the game with ingame currency that is called Silver Lions that gaijin is much and much better at balancing so that You will be starving of the more and further in the game You are effectively pushing You into investing into the game to buy the said currency, to buy premium time or premium vehicles.

Gameplay alone is again something that is made to look, flashy in the means of models, explosions, sounds, kill messages and post penetration camera views, which will make sure to keep You in and away from the real design of the game that is based on chasing the carrot. You will either be clueless player who never had idea about tanks and planes etc and just sinked in and You will be amazed by all the possibilities and effectively outplayed most of the time by people with more knowledge or just simply more ingame time. There is no skill based matchmaker and not even a slightest try at adapting one from the devs, You will be mixed with every player who has chosen vehicles of certain BR which is the way the warthunder classifies what will You encounter in the game by picking said vehicle. That will also be influenced by players trends in the means of which BRs are most popular and most likely to be paired with Your choice and also by pure steered matchmaker that is made to frustrate You as You are more likely to be matched into unfavourable odds once You start showing up in the higher part of Your team score more and more often.

While my time spent in the game might contradict my negative review the answer to it is simple, there are barely any products of war machine oriented games with atleast some focus on realism, which this game has, I also tend to be unlikely to leave things once I am invested in them and there is a lot of time investment and things to collect, create in this game. It is in the end made to be addictive product based on serving players with quick doses of dopamine, a very dangerous and irrespectfull marketing tactic meant to create a bond with player just like drugs, alcohol etc do. That is why I have decided to make this review in hopes of maybe saving one or more people from wasting their time and mental health on this game. Many of my gaming friends made pass on it based on understanding of how it is designed and I hope I might save a soul or two here too.

9917,good game
9918,the game is good but to play you have to give your soul to the snail god
9919,"War Thunder is by far one of my favorite military based games. The gameplay is superb and this is still the only plane simulator that I have played... ever. Overall, I love the game, but play for the sake of playing the game. Don't play for the grind."
9920,Game is hot grindy garbage
9921,uhh tom cruise f-18 hot
9922,Funni Plane and Tank and Boat.
9923,good game play some of the tank games are a bit suspect as it takes a few hits to kill a tank but they can 1 shot you with ease very long term game but not something your going to upgrade everything overnight but
9924,Nice
9925,cancer
9926,This is a good game but gaijin could not design a map if their life depended on it. Getting cross map spawn sniped at every BR is not fun. Its bad game design. Stop making maps that people can spawn kill in. Stop uptiering people into brackets where they have no chance of winning a fight unless they have been playing for 200+ hours or know every tanks specifications. You are pushing the newer people away from the community by doing this. I hope that another developer makes a tank sim game and competes with you. Maybe the you will listen to portions of the community that struggle with your design decisions. You need to address things like flickering tanks and inconsistent/ghost ammunition. The protection analysis is almost completely useless because it does not consistently show me what should and should not happen.
9927,Great selection of military crafts. I actually enjoy the grind in this compared to other games. Feels more earned.
9928,"This is one of the most fun and Entertaining game that i have played. Its graphics and details are amazing.
I like that you can play Air, Ground, and Sea Vehicles"
9929,"Shenyang F-5 doesn't have the nice blue/grey skin the J-2 has.
J29D's tracers bullets were removed."
9930,awesome game so glitches but what game doesn't have the odd bug if you can ignore the odd bug then this game is one of the best games. up there with world of warships and world of tanks. 4.5/5 in my opinion.
9931,im being paid to write a positive review for this game
9932,"not too fun. broken kill cams, god awful terrain, rendering problems, shells exploding mid air for no reason, heavily encouraged to pour your entire bank account into the game, the list goes on. I have generally had better 'war thunder' game play from gmod addons.  tanks are always cool so Id give it a 1.5 out of 5 for that."
9933,"dont do it, its a terrible terrible black hole and youll get sucked in and never be able to get out, all in all a pleasant experience albeit very easy to get a bit too invested in it
"
9934,"Yo 7.0-8.0 is dog shit.
Can you hook a homie up with a bump to a 8.0, 9.0 or 10.0 Deutsche tank?
Every hour you see on my account has been so I can play a leo2.
Just give me a leo2.
Sadge.
War suffer."

9936,game is mid 👎🥱
9937,"Fun, its hard to get into the groove, but it eventually gets fun. You start getting kills as you get more game sense, and its super cinematic

9938,the game is about you sending money and ragging

9942,It's good. A bit of a grind but it's good.
9943,its not free to play beacuse you have to pay with your soul.
9944,used to be good until the danger zone update which screwed my fps up for no reason whatsoever (60fps to around 30-20) now even going to 1fps during the starts of battles and don't even ask about bugs because they never fix them
9945,good
9946,u shoot planes

9948,"Everybody plays the meta while you play for fun or you just like a certain tank designs, you will lose about half the matches you join. After about Rank 3 or 4, you will lose about 80% of matches you join. Remember, if you want to win, play the meta. You will die constantly if you don't. Almost at 100 hours and its been just a slow and steady slope of losing battles."
9949,Grate game if you love war stile games.
9950,Pay to win and seal clubbing fest. Yet it is very addictive once you get past the veteran players owning you in the first 2 minutes of the round. I returned afters years away and the cheating problem that was plaguing the game in the early years seam to have lesson alot more. What did increase is a player base that is more about team players screwing the team and teammates to get a kill. This is more evident in higher tiers the game play in tiers 6 and bellow are more enjoyable. So if there was a meh vote that's is what I would select instead of a thumbs down

9996,"This game is great at times and at others; infuriating. Once you reach rank II on a decent tech tree you are almost addicted and must commit to it. Don't grind the USA or German tech tree (Unless you are getting the Pz.VIII MAUS) as they are annoying and you WILL transform into a g-noblin. Maybe try the British tech tree if you hate yourself, it has decent vehicles however Gaijin hates us Brits and make our tanks terrible. Russian tech tree is pretty fun, there is no such thing as Russian bias, so shut up. China and Japan, nobody plays and if you are weird you can play the Swedish tree. Play France if you like Croissants and suffering and maybe try Israel if you want to cheat. There is the regular bug or as everybody calls them 'Gaijin's' (""I've been Gaijin'd"") which can be pretty annoying and inconvenient. The RP rewards are unbelievably low, for example I got 550RP for 6 kills and one deaths (for comparison 4 kills is good and an early tank requires 40,000RP).

So finally, in conclusion; play this game and don't care for progress, it will make you sad or agitated. If you really wanna have fun in this game play it with some friends, it can help a lot. Good luck with the grinding of over 2000 vehicles. But, most importantly: Have fun!"
9997,good
9998,fun
9999,In this game i find  development and research   quite satisfying as you progress trough game .

10001,"good fun, can play for free, dont have to spend money if you dont want, and no ""BUY THIS N THAT"" crap all over the screen. though it does show you what you would get vs what you got if you had their premium, and some planes are worth grabing from their store, though if you choose not to, you wont be SOL."

Also, the menus and controls still feel a bit clumsy and overall there's still some polishing to be done even after all the years the game has been out. Not an awful game, but not the best F2P experience out there either."
10007,1 year for jet seems fair
10008,good game but dont buy anything
10009,"Every update breaks more then it fixes, and the devs are the ABSOLUTE LAZIEST when it comes to actually fixing real problems.

Naval is also OVERRUN by cheaters. EZ Anti-Cheat does not catch scripts so you have a team of mostly player bots farming 24/7. If EZ Anti-cheat is so easily evaded, then imagine how many other cheaters play the other modes."

10022,"This is a P2W game with insane grind. If you havent started playing yet than stop and dont play it. This game recently has high frequency of crashes too. Also please never give this company any money, its not woth it and you can spend them in a better way. Another thing is that devs are not transparent and one of the most horrible things in this game is ranking system of vehicles which they refuse to expand because they say queues would be too long. And before you start playing anyway you might wanna look on Internet these vehicles and think twice again: All variants of Spitfires, G91/R4 or R3 idk which is premium one, R3 AA, Puma, Mig-17AS, AV-8A (amount of flares), Mig-21pfm, Leopard A1A1 L44, Turms-AV, Turm 3, Ariette (its a small aircraft), BI, VT1-2, Black Prince, Brumbar, Draken, Vigen, Veak40, WZ308 (those numbers are probably wrong), Wiesel with atgm, M901, all variants of Strv103 (also known as S-tank), Pvrb and same type of vehicles in other trees, Ascender, and there are more broken ones who far outmatch vehicles on the same br but dont get higher br and when you meet them they will be pain in the ass or some of them will easily delete your entire team in moments such as VT1-2."

10026,"worst and most unbalanced game i have ever played
i would rather play team fortress 2 with the whole enemy team being spinbotting bots than this shit
fucking pay2win garbage"
10027,yh nah v good
10028,"worst game I have ever played. If you like drinking orange juice after washed your teeth it's your game.The random 1 shots, you get killed by a fucking lightmachine gun. If you want to play a more rewarding, fair, fun game play world of tanks.

edit: It's a good game i just lost 30 games in a row."
10029,"This game is very addictive and if you have problems with addiction you might find yourself in financial ruin after playing this game for too long. You will keep coming back because it is fun to destroy stuff and you want that tank or plan so keep investing time and money. It is absolutely fun.

But...

If you want a certain plane or tank or ship you must first go through the painful process of researching vehicles you absolutely do not even care for. Why is this? Why do I need to pay money or use my valuable time to research crap I absolutely don't want?

Imagine going to a grocery store and wanting to buy yogurt but you are not allowed unless you first buy some milk. Just because you are the store-owner doesn't mean you can do whatever you want in your store.

This is the reason why I am writing my representative in the EU to investigate such games and I recommend you do too.

Maybe this marketing method is not illegal but I still think it would be good to have an investigation into this.

Be careful when getting into this game. There is no way where you can set on maximum amount of money spend per month. You are on your own and if you are not careful you might find yourself near financial ruin."

10034,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

10067,this game will keep you from interacting with your family.
10068,"Basically just a bad drug. Fun at the start, when you don't know anything. After a while of playing, you finally get a feel for it. After that, you'll start seeing the bugs, hit reg issues, ghost shells, components absorbing shots that get you killed (engine, tracks, fuel, breech, etc), fuel and ammo not exploding after you hit them WITH a tank shell. Apart from mechanics and the like, you are on your own. No teamwork, no relying on teammates, nothing. If it does happen, it's rare. Outside of gameplay, everything is focused on you spending real money. Premium account is required unless you want to spend anywhere from 1 to 3 years to get a single nation to top tier. Premium vehicles to make it easier to earn experience and/or to buy your way to a higher BR. The marketplace for buying and selling tanks, skins, helis, jets, anything. If you buy this game and get even remotely hooked, you will spend money to make things go faster. I've seen it happen to people who said they wouldn't do it. If you're fine with putting up with all of that and still having to sink months and even years to get to high BR with multiple nations, buy the game. Otherwise, don't even try it. Treat it like heroin."
10069,"I would recommend this game to people because you get to feel what is was like back then with all of the planes, tanks, and ships. I would recommend to use planes more often because it's more fun in my mind."
10070,I threw my life away for this
10071,The tier RNG in game is tragic and the game crash and the game close 3-4 times every time i play

Unless the community changes or the game itself changes in a way to discourage this behavior its practically useless, dont bother waisting your time."

10089,"Ahh War Thunder, how I love thee. This is a game for depressed people with trouble saying no. It is a game that will do terrible things to you and yet, like a toxic ex girlfriend, you end up crawling back. Overall id rate war thunder a 34 out of 47. I know this rating is atypical however to have fun in this game you have to forget everything, including bills and your kids. At first you may not want to pay the snail any money but by hour 30 you will have your card down like the back of your hand."
10090,"Its quite overwhelming when you first launch with so many things to configure adjust and discover.  after you stop sweating and screaming in frustration and actually play and figure it out, it is quite fun.  All jokes aside its a bit confusing at first but it doesn't take long to figure out what to do and it is pretty darn fun."

10100,"Well is a fun game to play, little hard but fun"
10101,its perfect game
10102,"very fun and stategic game 
pretty accurate history and vehicles"
10103,"If you want to fire a 20mm rotary cannon and do basically nothing to a Soviet MBT but sound badass while doing it, then this is the game for you!

In all seriousness this game is pretty solid. It's not what I would call free to play (free to start is more accurate) as I would say a premium acc is all but necessary to make decent progress. After about 800 hours and a few premium vehicles I have most of the US ground tech tree and around half of the Chinese and Israeli ground trees. This is a game thats a serious time investment even after forking over some cash... BUT and this is a very big butt, There's nothing quite like ripping tanks apart with the A-10's GAU 8 cannon while dodging missiles from the enemy SPAA only to be blown in half by a HE shell from the main cannon of some random tank on the opposite side of the map.

This is a very skill based game and some match ups just aren't fair.  Get over it, there's not much you can do about that issue other than look at what you did wrong and try to play more passively until you know the map layouts and understand what your specific vehicles (as well as the enemy's) CAN and CANNOT do! In CQC I'm very aggressive in something like the IPM1 or ZTZ96A but hang back or support other players in vehicles like the M3 Bradley and PTL02.

As far as Air RB goes I'm still very inexperienced but have had quite a bit of fun in the Supermarine Spitfires and A4E Skyhawk. It's very clear that the skill ceiling is very high in the air modes (pun intended) and that it's going to take significant time to understand what to do in each vehicle.

Naval? Haven't played it and don't intend to until they finish working on mechanics.

Overall I'd say that if you're looking for a game to replace 90% of your time gaming and enjoy fairly ""realistic"" interactions between military vehicles then this is about as good as it gets.


PS: I will one shot you and drink your tears :)"
10104,"Game is not realistic enough
We need to leak more military documents"
10105,I was asked to revise my review and my tank came back so
10106,It's a game and you can fly
10107,I absolutely would recommend this game. I really hate it but continue to play it with my autistic friend. I'm sure hes autistic as he asked me when Russian tanks get good. Did I mention Soviet Bias. I might end my life if i continue to play but oh well. 100/10
10108,holy shit the fucking grind is so ass
10109,"THIS GAME IS MADE TO MAKE YOU ANGRY SO YOU BUY PREMIUMS. waste your money somewhere else, from someone who's made the mistake."
10110,"Its Pretty good. Its kinda like a more realistic combination of world of planes , tanks and ships. One thing I would like to see is having people play a planes match with tank players on the ground playing their own tank match.                                  
                                                   Overall This game is good

"
10111,"Naval is absolute hot garbage 
Terrible RNG mechanics, wonky aiming system that does not reward careful aim but just plain luck
Strong bias towards an unnamed nation (motherland)
Cannot believe i gave these devs money."

bad game if you dislike grinding cause there is a lot of grinding in this game and dislike microtransactions 

but if your like me and bored and want something free and good to play then get this game
if there was not a f**k ton of grinding and microtransactions i would give this game a 10/10 but overall i give a 7/10"

10136,Don't try this if you have problems managing your money. I have spent a lot on this game and fully regret it seeing how little they care for their players. To be able to complete most event for free you would need to devote yourself to this game and stop enjoying it in order to complete objectives. If you intend to play this game strictly to progress down the free research tree's for the many country available in this game then give it a try. The game itself can be very enjoyable even if it's also frustrating at times. I love this game and intend to keep playing but would like to see changes to it's predatory monetization. I will consider changing my review to positive when make vehicle tickets tradable. Having to grind an additional 50 battlepass tiers just to sell a plane i paid and grinded for on the marketplace is bullshit.

Developper: Yeah sure, and if you get three kills we will even grant you the ability to use a bomber!
P: Oh nice!
D: But we’ll tell the enemy team that you’re calling a bomber.
P: Oh…
D: And they will be able to call fighters to prevent you from dropping your bombs.
P: Well, I guess I’ll still have a chance to drop them before they reach me.
D: And we will make sure that they spawn at the same time as you and right behind you so you can’t do anything against them and you’ll get down before you can reach anybody."

imagine, sucking putins cock so hard, that you as a russian dev team, make the russian tanks the strongest in the game when its more than historically inacurate that some russian tanks were in fact INFERIOUR.
not so in this lidl game, in this game, you pick russian tanks, and with a little bit common sense in how to play, you win, all the time, always.
its so grotesque, i had to laugh how embarrassing this game is. and ive played it a long time.

10219,"Most recent patch broke the game so bad I can barely play, no matter the settings I get over 100fps with stuttering and artifacting so bad it is unplayable."
10220,"fun game but issues that keep it from a game i want to play a lot 

first of the the game play for the most part is great id say im a casual player but ground rb is a ton of fun and nothing feels better then pulling off a good flank or learning a tanks weak spots then using that against them, the damage setup is pretty great as well and each tank looks great and the art style is solid.

the issues i have a re few but they stop the game being fun

the first is up tiers, this alone is not a big issue but other issues make it worse, it often feels like the game is using you as fodder, again you get this with most games but here other issues add to make it worst

bushes, bushes are pay to win sure you can ""earn"" them but they are a cosmetic that on some maps make you near impossible to spot and even upclose can be used to hide weak spots so you can't ID the tank they also don't come off when a tank is hit or a tank uses a gun covered by them so it feels like the realistic aspect they could play is gone (use them to get to a good spot well hidden) and are something players to pay get a big advantage.

repair costs, these are what ruin the game for me, when you're trying to progress into the higher tiers they become the main thing that stops you, you're already paying for the tank, then the upgrades THEN ammo most of the time, then you can get slapped with repair costs, if the matches were balanced and fair sure ok but they are not you WILL get up tired and on some maps its super easy to spawn camp so you can get a brand new tank and not even want to use it.

your only option is to see the tanks you want and grind for them and not even use the tanks you unlock to try to save, that or grind hard on lower tiers to get lions, some defend them and say ""balance"" but just no the only reason i kept playing i won a million silver lions the progress was so slow and the set backs could be so annoying i was ready to quit, the worst part is the game WON'T show you repair costs unless you go to your inbox and look at the battle report message so you can think you're fine but all the while you're losing lions,

overall the game i fun but some systems make it so i just don't want to play anymore i'm not opposed to grind i have 1500 is warframe but this grind feels bad and cheap and lazy

10223,good
10224,"I absolutely love this game. Sure, it takes either a huge amount of grinding or a big hole in your wallet to get to the higher tiers, but i still have fun. The highly detailed damage system, the fact that it even has break-off speeds for landing gears and flaps. It even has an a time-based fuel system. Recommend this game to anyone interested"

10237,balls
10238,"the main thing i hate about this game that the devs could take out is that when u take town an enemy plane 60% of the time u will crash into them, i think they should remove collision when an enemy plane is shot down to avoid instant death even after success, if they did this then it would me the game much better, until then im not recommending this game just bec of a small pesky problem they have."
10239,Very enjoyable. I can recommend it.
10240,yes
10241,if you like buying a new table every two weeks its a nice game.
10242,"I fucking hate this game and would never recommend playing this to even my worst enemy, so instead of writing an in-depth review explaining why this game is such a waste of time and space, I will instead write a step-by-step guide on how to uninstall it and or remove it from your account.

1. Navigate to the banner on the top of your screen and click 'library.'
2. Locate 'War Thunder' on the left-hand side of your screen (game titles will be in alphabetical order, so it should be towards the bottom of your steam library.)
3. Right click 'War Thunder.'
4. Hover over the 'Manage' option.
5. Click 'uninstall' and or 'remove from account.'"

"
10249,"Don't play if you don't want to waste your time. Sure, the first couple days can be fun, but once you begin climbing the ranks, the game gets infuriating and you're going to need to spend weeks to continue. I'm not even talking about all the unbalance there is and the pay to win bushes..."

10253,"If you like model airplanes, and first person shooters, this game is for you. Consistently high player counts and other modes for land and sea battles.

The time commitment to unlock better vehicles quickly ramps up, but the first couple of tiers are easy. If you want to upgrade from prop planes to jet planes you might need to spend real cash to unlock it because the time commitment to unlock high tier vehicles (like jets) without paying is insane."

10276,Possibly the best flight sim in the F2P genre. There's nothing that gives as much depth in flight model and damage system. The pay to win is also quite marginal. Can recommend for a great time regardless of skill level
10277,"I just recently started playing and I feel like the game is not for new players at all.  I wouldnt spend anymore money at all in this game until you get to late tier 2 or early tier 3.  You get to a point in the game where you just feel like everyone is cheating or has some sort of secret sauce you dont have.  I love the setting, I love the detail, I hate the gameplay.  Everything about it just pisses you off.  Get good is what I hear all the time, if the game gave some feedback loop I would understand that comment, it doesnt."

10330,"Riddled with Pay to win, Bias, and a slew of other things this game is either for the rich, or the Russians. For a game so centered on realism they seem to make a lot of crappy mistakes that love to bite each other in the back. Whether that be artificially nerfing/buffing a vehicle to suit it more to its br, or changing a vehicles br it never truly feels realistic nor are they consistent. It doesnt make sense ww2 era vehicles face guided missles but here we are. It also doesnt make sense how some things are br placed. Like the Marder a1 vs Marder 1a3. They are the same damn tank aside the fact the marder gets access to a round with like 15mm more pen yet its placed at .7 br higher. Or the german tam vs the tam2ip. In every aspect the 2ip is either the same or better, there is no downside to the 2ip, aside the fact its a premium vehicle so you have to spend money, yet they are the same br, definetly for sure not pay to win. What I hat most about this game is with how terrible it is I still find it addictive given its the only game of its type, WOT sucks harder.

Untill they fix the obvious russian and prem bias im not spending another cent on this game."
10331,It's not World of Tanks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10332,awesome
10333,"Warthunder. It can be great, it can be awful, but i cant help but feel like its gone down the shitter.   Gameplay itself is fun, i have to say, But the matchmaking is so fucked, to the point that its unplayable in the higher tiers for certain nations. They dont even try to balance it either. You will see tanks from 1945 going up with tanks from the late 80s and apparently this is how its intended to be.

They keep throwing in new tanks and squeezing them into ww2 settings so newer or people that just wants to enjoy the core gameplay gets a bad time and so that they will start coughing up money.

After the ww2 tanks the game goes to the shitter, armor stops mattering and everyone 1 shots."
10334,game ish gud
10335,Save me from the local random...
10336,
10337,sell your soul btw i have 2000 hours on console
10338,Fun Game to play with a group of friends or solo. I wish the premium vehicles were slightly more balanced most of the premium vehicles do feel really overwhelming. Over all game-play experience is good through tanks and aviation.
10339,"ATTACK THE D POINT!
ATTENTION TO THE DESIGNATED GRID SQUARE!
"
10340,"War Thunder is a very team oriented game and requires patience and good judgement at times. It can be very grind based and may take awhile to find a country or play style you prefer. But once comfortable and you gain the basic understanding of the game, the entertainment improves. Also the focus tree selection is enormous and has a lot of variety. I do recommend that every faction be played to enjoy the selection of vehicles and to challenge yourself to improve your skills."
10341,shittest fucking game ive ever played fun for 100 hours till some shit cunts decide to butt fuck you and water board you with their shitty T20 or anti airs. takes the piss. If you're looking for an additional fund to your gaming setup to renew equipment because of the pure skull fuck you will get this is the perfect game to waste your life in.
10342,If you can buy premium time and grind through the lower tiers the games pretty fun.

10382,"War thunder is an exceptional technical achievement, it's combat gameplay is one of a kind, the level of detail is spectacular, but the gameplay itself is incredibly unrewarding and even at times can be disgustingly unappealing. The sheer amount of playtime required to progress in this game is unacceptable, I cannot expect the average player to have the thousands of hours of free time that is required to progress the game. The amount of progression materials you are rewarded at the end of an average multiplayer match is insultingly miniscule, meaning you have to play the same vehicles for multiple dozens of matches to unlock new vehicles and repeat the proccess all over again. On top of this, after these matches you are cited a repair cost for any damaged or destroyed vehicles you played that game. This cost increases with the teir of your vehicle, which means that by the latter portion of the game you will be spending more time playing with lesser vehicles than the ones you work so hard to unlock just so you can repair them. This creates a soul crushing, grindy gameplay loop that is not at all kind to any of the games players whether new or expierienced and tends to destroy the will to play for any new players who don't have the time or patience to play as the same couple of vehicles for dozens of matches in a row. This all wouldn't be as great an issue if the combat was fast paced and exciting but even in the casual gamemode ""arcade"" the combat is very slow, very short, and very unforgiving. You will spend minutes just getting to the enemy players and you'll likely die shortly after unless you see them first, or they're just bad shots, because damage in this game is realistically simulated and getting hit by enemy fire can range from being an annoying nuisance to immediately lethal. The unforgiving combat mechanics would forgivable if the rewards for exceptional combat performance were also exceptional, but they're not. The only rewards for playing this game is either the relief you get after you stop playing it or the regret you feel for spending a tenth of your lifespan getting your first jet."

[please release my family its been 17 days]"
10474,YES
10475,the game is fun but you have to deal with rammers and team killers.plus most the time you get I-VII backups all the time watch is annoying and if the arrow gets close to lets say a 500+ lion booster it will automatic lee go to the next booster that is near it even after it is on the 500+ lion boosters edge plus don't get me started with how Money hungry the company

10487,plane :)
10488,shit game with shit people
10489,"Great game for those who wish to grind harder and longer than a blind welder. Very cool game, just infuriating to progress through, but if you're playing for fun stick to BR 1-4 as there are some very fun vehicles like the locust, sturmpanzer, and everyones favorite the L3 33CC"
10490,"You ring the doorbell, this game invites you in, gut punches you, suplex slams you, spits on your face, takes your wallet, laughs at you, and then throws you out. You stand up, collect yourself, and you ring the doorbell again, hoping it'll be nicer this time.

It won't. I hate this game.

Do I recommend it? Hell yeah, no one must escape the pain, we must suffer forever together.

And by together I mean alone, because no one is here to save you when you're chased by six planes, and your 10 other teammates are busy fighting a single plane while you scream."
10491,it is  grate game
10492,epic gamer mom ent
10493,yes
10494,My only complaint about this game is my bois take too long to ready up in between matches.
10495,Do you enjoy enjoy pain and suffering??  if yes download this game and if not just save urself the time and go outside or something
10496,yes

10500,play on xboc and pc very fun but dont have a life now
10501,"I absolutely love this game, it is currently my favourite game. You don't need to spend money. However, like all games, if you play it for years you will get bored."
10502,really fun game a real fun grind but can sometimes be pay to win as you can't access any of the premium vehicles without purchasing them.
10503,If you're anyone like me playing who plays a lot of VR games this is not a type of game to play in VR it has terrible support and honestly annoying as well since the controls are heavily carried by a keyboard or so instead of potentially working with Quest Headsets and others.
10504,"Sadly the only game which pretend simulating tank & plane battle. Game has a monopoly on its genre and the devs know it.

Plagued with balance issues acknowledged by all players, matchmaking made to match against players with tanks with a much Higher Battle Rating, devs decisions made to incentive players to spend money at every corner, updates adding graphicals issues.

It's just pain, curses and no fun."
10505,DONT PLAY THIS GAME IT CREATES AGONY PAIN AND ITS A CAUSE FOR EVERYTHING BAD IN THE WORLD !!!!!!!
10506,I fucking hate this game<3
10507,good game

10521,Fun
10522,"If you keep paying Gaijin, you keep having fun.
But of you don't keep paying Gaijin, this game is misery"
10523,"Continual refusal to address fundamental issues with the game (Map design, spawn camping, power creep, poorly thought out Battle Ratings to name but a few) makes it impossible to recommend the game.
This is a great shame as the actual business of driving tanks etc is very entertaining — probably best in the field.
I played for a while many years ago, when it came out, and again more recently.  The problems that drove me away from the game the first time are still here and, as far as I can tell, there has been no attempt to improve anything.  In fact, if anything, it's worse than it was before.

New players: Steer Clear.  You may be able to avoid some of the problems in the very early game, but as soon as you start progressing it turns bad.  Typically, not long after you decide to spend some money to get over some mild inconveniences.
Returning Players:  If you stopped playing because of problems you had with the game design, sorry, best move on — nothing to see here.
Current players:  If you enjoy the game as is, great!  I'm glad that you do.  I just hope that the shrinking playerbase doesn't end up affecting you.

To add:  The CAS situation is out of control.  If you want to play the game for ground forces, don't.  Especially if you don't already have the aircraft to play cas yourself.  Grinding the Air part of the game, just so you have options as a tanker is Not. Fun."

10577,Yes.
10578,This game is the most realistic and fun flight battle simulator maybe ever and thats just the aviation which is my favorite. The game has been updating for years and I see a bright future for it. Would recommend.
10579,I'd rather waste my life on drugs than to play this game but since I have nothing better to do I play it.

After 100 hours of playtime i have decided that this game.
Is full of Flying Fish. And tanks that have the armor strength of glass.

10588,Big epic Actually not greedy devs
10589,Its ok but play dcs
10590,"This game sucks, I keep coming back every so often but really, don't even start. And whatever you do, don't pay for premium"
10591,"Good game. Grinding can be daunting, and the in game currency speeds up progress, as you would expect. There are a few premium planes that have bang for their buck. Different playstyles allow for a flexible experience."
10592,"Great Gameplay. Devs break things at times but the gameplay is pretty good. The community is fantastic too.

However the ECONOMY is made by a 95 year old white politician trying to preserve minimum wage and child labor from 1873, but its actually inflated like 2046. 

play about 60 games without a premium tanks or premium time. Make about 10k-15k credits a game with some tier 4 vehicles. Decent games with 6 kills in a majority of them. Repair cost ends up eating more than half the ""profit"". End the day making 70k credits.

Repair is another two whole levels of Bullshit BTW and the team that ""designed it"" need to have their breeding rights revoked. 

First off Repair cost is based off of global play by the whole community of that specific Vehicle. The more everyone plays that specific vehicle the more it will cost to repair that vehicle. So any vehicle that turns out to be decent with a good ""credit multiplier"" ends up getting overplayed and its repair cost is blown out of proportions where a lower tier vehicle will have way more repair cost that a top tier vehicle.

Part two of the Reta*d*d Repair system. Keeping this with the Realistic gamemode lets say you want to avoid Repair. Theres this thing called Free Repair.

Currently Im at Tier 4 tanks with Italy as well as planes. The tanks for some reason have a 5-7 day repair time and thats with me having maxed out my Repair crew skill to reduce it. So me who just wants to sit here and play my Italian tanks all day and make progress i cant because ill be making pennies on the dollar thanks to how stupid repair works in this game. its not finished there either. Lets say you decide to move from your Italian tanks that need repair to your Italian planes and fly a couple of arcade matches for fun. Well that means you just removed your tier 4 tanks from an active crew and the repair time is now 30 days. Okay so lets say you want to buy more crew slots so you can have more spaces to be ""free repairing"" your vehicles. you gotta pay real money for the slot and NOT ONLY THAT sometimes it will cost you over 30k credits just to ""train"" the crew to the vehicle. That means in the slot only those specifically trained vehicles can fit in so you better not have a tank you want to play in a vehicle slot thats repairing another tank.

I know people will just say dont die then. well its all to damn easy to kill in this game. Almost anything is a one shot and if you dont shoot and wound them first youll most likely die first anyways. Like yesterday i had a game in my Italian M18 and i got a flank on 6 tanks, easy free kills in less than a minute. 
Thats 6 people who now have to pay anywhere from 3000-6000 credits to repair the tanks they were driving , while i made a cool 1500 per kill because, economy. There is literally a plane in the Italian tech tree I remember that had like 27000 repair cost. I think it was the G56 and you made like 3000-4000 per plane you shot down, meaning that if you didnt shoot down 7 planes (a majority of a RB lobby sometimes) then got shot down yourself you'd loose money.

Gajin will say Why TF you hung up on Italian tanks we got 2000+ other options. Gajin STFU dont tell me what i want i dont care that there is 2000+ other vehicles. Half of them are filler ""stolen and leased"" american and or German vehicles in other nations tech trees. Thats not variety its convolution. I wanna work down my Italian tech tree without the bullshit before i move over to another tech tree. 

If you ask me the Grind and Economy earn this game a HARD PASS. Gajin just sucks."
10593,"Does not allow anti vampirical rounds for any vehicles, this should have been added with the F-14 in order to bring garlic into the modern age, please consider this gaijin, we count on devs to go on a crusade against vampires, thus garlic bread should be added."

10596,HoDoR
10597,worst fucking game in the world dont play it you will get brain damage and u are going to want to kil yourself so i dont recommend you to play this ass goofy doofy moofy shit game.
10598,"This game will make you want to shoot yourself in the face. You play a game, die, pay $10,000 in repair costs, repeat. You will grind 10 hours a day to unlock a vehicle that is sub-par, only to realize you have no money left to even buy it. The game is built with a pay to play aspect which causes F2P players to have a really bad time. Albeit, I will still play the game because I want to cosplay as Tom Cruise in the F-14. Buy if you hate yourself."
10599,Long grind but its a f2p game

10604,I love how there are so many planes and other things you can get. This is the first time i have ever played a game like this and i really like it .
10605,Bruh.. to play with a friend you need to create a squadron and to create a squadron you need 16 just to create one. That has to be the most retarded decision I have seen in a while in a game. I think Ubisoft has had better ideas than this...
10606,wherethe problem at? im spinnin off these percs like im a laundry mat
10607,Its just an amazing game
10608,This is the best war game I have ever played.

10610,"Every update makes the game worse and worse. I've played WT for 900 h and I would not recommend it. 
The game based neither on realism nor any other kind of logic. Non sence maps espically for low tiers, where you better call it Tanks driving simulation. Sometimes when I make a kill it wouldn't be counted after the end of the game (although through the game it shows me that the target was destroyed by me). And a lot of other annoying glitches and non sence. That's why today I've decided to quit this game.

10619,"Solid core gameplay subverted by multiple blatant money-milking systems and unnecessary complexity. You are essentially gated from most of the post WWII ground war content by paywalls of hundreds or thousands of euros.

10646,Good game. a challenging one tho
10647,"Maybe one of the best tank and aircraft games i have played. War thunder has a unique way with hitpoints. You dont have a 100hp, instead you have models in your tank and plane. (engine, fuel tank, crew members, ammo) The game has a battle rating system to determine who you play against. Lets say your tanks have a combined battle rating (BR) of 3.7. That means in a match you can face against enemies with 2.7-4.7 BR tanks. But it lacks a SKILL BASED matchmaking with i don't like. Your account can be level 7, but in the 3.7 BR match you can play against people of any level. I hate getting sh*t on by no life 5000hrs level 100s. Overall the game if fun, realistic and free to play so give it a try."

10653,"dad? where are you
"
10654,"After 150+ hours in this game, playing since 2012, I can honestly say that people shouldn't play this game.
Gaijin have gradually made progression beyond tier 4 almost impossible without a premium monthly subscription, and the situation is only getting worse.
While the game is a lot of fun and quite addictive once you get into it, you really don't feel like you're making any progress at all, and there's nothing you can do about that outside of giving Gaijin insane amounts of money.
What started off as a wonderful and more friendly alternative to hardcore war flight sims, and later World of Warplanes (and later World of Warships / Tanks), has turned into a painful cash grab.

I honestly cannot recommend anyone play this game unless they're happy to spend uncomfortable amounts of money on it."

10672," I reconmend this game because you can feel like a real world war 2 pilot/ soldier use tanks, battle ships, avation and helicopters. If you a fun of ww2 this game is perfect for you."
10673,"War Thunder is awesome if you love air combat. Great flight mechanics and easy to play.  My dislikes about the game are #1 Too many newer players complaining.  (Which is sort of Gaijin's fault.)  And #2. Gajin gives no incentives to win matches as team (gameplay is too individualistic).

1.  Newer players don't respect the art form, they respect plane. They expect instant gratification along with thinking that if they upgrade their planes they will automatically turn into Tom Cruise.  But the bottom line is if you're an awful pilot?  You'll get shot down no matter WHAT plane you fly. Because they climb when they should dive. They fight when they should run. They work alone not with the team.  SO they grind for the better plane and the end result is the better plane is a Dragon ....................... but the pilot is a Penguin.
Mix that with a desire for instant gratification and you have unwarranted complaints about the game. 

# 2   Gaijin gives NO incentives to work as a team in a team focused game.  It rewards individual accomplishments rather than team accomplishments.  Because of this some players will throw the match for their own personal agendas.  This frustrates players who are trying to win. which turns them into spawn campers (because the extra effort isn't worth it anymore), and creates arguments within the match.  IMO Gaijin should penalize the side that loses and reward the side that wins.   But that's just me..... :-/

OVERALL?   This is an Awesome game!!!  No other game can touch it at the moment.  The only thing it TRULY needs is new TYPES of missions rather than just the same ole' Domination and ground strikes that influence TEAM effort."

10683,i am addicted to this game and i hate it i have been getting cyber bullied every match and its getting to much for me to handle gaijin give more attention to your community's chat problems and toxicity problems and make it to where you can find teammates on the game playing solo sucks

10694,"Warthunder's strongest selling point is variety. Combat on land, air, and sea, with hundreds upon hundreds of vehicles spanning nearly a century of technological development. While progression is painfully slow and punishing without spending real money, Gaijin provides very few opportunities to pay to win the game, far fewer than any other free to play game. There are other, more true to life simulator games out there, but Warthunder strikes an excellent balance of realism and accessibility. Give this one a shot, I avoided Warthunder like the plague for years, thinking I wouldn't enjoy vehicle combat games versus more traditional shooters, but this game is just good clean fun."

10705,This game takes a lot of time to even progress a little. 140 hours just to get tier 3-4.
10706,this game sucks. it wont let me fly f-14 tomcat from Top Gun for free. i hate this game i never play again
10707,GD
10708,fun game
10709,"I play this game 80% for simulator air, 20% for ground. I want to talk about air, because the gameplay is a lot of fun and flying/dogfighting in VR is a lot of fun. Enduring Confrontation is a great gamemode and I enjoy it thoroughly.

Now, I didn't come here to submit a positive review, so I'll skip straight to the problem.

The economy in this game, to put it lightly, is fucked. I have a premium account, I fly premium jets. I typically have a 2:1KD of players I kill to times I die from ANYTHING.

If I get a solid 15 player kills (not to speak of the dozen or so AI kills), and die 7 times in total, I LOSE MONEY. I lose money after PAYING FOR PREMIUM AND A PREMIUM JET, while performing VERY WELL. This is just fucking outrageous.

I never rant and leave angry reviews, but this game makes me angry. I can't play the game mode I enjoy without spending MORE MONEY on currency so I can fly the jets I like to fly, even if I perform exceptionally.

Gaijin, seriously, I just don't get it. How can you be so so greedy that a premium account with a premium jet isn't enough for you to throw me a bone.

Fun game ruined by shit economy, even World of Warships is more generous and that's saying something.

THUMBS DOWN"
10710,"Great affects, many options to battle, effects are amazing. I prefer to use a joystick, but difficult to know what settings to make, very detailed. It is not the same controlling aircraft with a mouse,"
10711,👏 Jets 👏
10712,Just don't
10713,>:)
10714,"This game seems like a lot of fun. but u get thrown in with no actually good tutorial, you will probably wanna rush up to the tiger 1 and smash out those pesky m4s, but you will soon find out you cant actually pen those m4s, but dont worry they will slap one shot into you and either kill all of your crew, or activate your ammorack. this is a game of almosts. you almost got to shoot someone, you almost had fun. if u plan on playing this game make sure to make you plan a head a few weeks to start turning your turret around, and dont get the panther. 

That’s how it feels at the start but give it a few more try’s and you will get there, have to be patient. Once you spend a hundred hours or so that it takes to learn the maps and Armour layout it gets easier. But at the beginning it always feels like you have to work to enjoy, the learning curve is steep. I offen get frustrated playing solo, this game is really cool with friends, and in that situation strives."
10715,Addicts don't normally recommend the substance that ruined their lives to others...
10716,"Shithole company is one of the greediest ive ever seen. If you dont spend money, progression is a snails pace while you go up against guys in PTW tanks that can 1 shot you from across the map in the absolute thickest part of your armor, but you cant kill them with 7 or 8 shells point blank because for some reason the thinnest parts of their armor are invincible.

Just for example: the tanks your allowed to use are determined by ""research"" which is just an outright mobile game feature. Its something meant to limit your abilities unless you pour 4000 hours into the game, or just a convenient $40 here or there. They sell Tanks on their own in game market place like Skins in CSGO, and use their own Crypto currency shill shit. 

Oh but don't worry, Gaijin generously put something called ""convertible research""that you can use to unlock any tanks research! ...that is, as long as you pay a huge fee with in game premium currency. They pretty much piss in your hands in the tutorial and give you like 150 GE. which is less than .99 cents worth of premium currency. awesome. So the only two ways to play the tanks you actually LIKE or WANT is to open up your wallet to gaijin and pay *extremely* inflated prices for these tanks. some of these tanks cost upwards of several THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS and you can ONLY UNLOCK THEM BY PAYING FOR THEM WITH CASH.

And lets say, for some reason, you DO decide to spend, say, $6.60 for the second Currency package. Not only is this not enough for literally anything just one tier above the starter tanks, this also will probably be stolen from your pockets due to the predatory practices of their Item Shop. The ""Trophies"" don't explicitly *say* that they're just some random expensive loot-box, out of which you get pretty much *nothing* unless you beat the statistical anomaly that is the rigged RNG of one of those to somehow get the tank the trophy pack offers. How they show that tank in the pack bothers me though, since they just explicitly say ""CONTAINS"" directly on the picture of the tank, which *makes you think you're just buying the fucking tank unless you read fine print*

In short, this game is just some long running cash grab by one of the greediest companies I've ever seen, and that's with Nintendo running around on the market. Gaijin sucks. Which really blows because without all of these issues, the game could be really fun."
10717,"I strongly and i mean strongly do not want anybody to play this game, warthunder is a mess of a game with a rival that is on the same par. Here is the good, vehicles look right. That is all that is good, now for the bad. Warthunder's ballancing makes no fucking sense. Your telling me that a Yak 9 at 3.7 can meet a KI 61 which is 4.7 in the same match. Japanese planes have for some reason stupidly tight turns that are not possible. meanwhile the game is constantly asking you for money and without paying a penny the game is a grind. Then tanks which make even less sense a T34 from 1941 can meet a PANZER 4 H in the same game and the H was being built in 1944 i bet when you reach 5.7 you just meet a god damn abrams. In arcade battles everybody can see your planes weaknesses no matter what. for planes its a bit fun in arcade but if you go to realistic in planes may goid have mercy on your soul. you have 1 shot, 1 singular shot at the match and if you are new you are gonna get shot down immediatly because high level players are always in low tier battles. then in Ground arcade everybody can see what will and wont penetrate your tank and in ground realistic you are either in the bottom of the leaderboard or at the very top because of the issue of high level players. this game would be better if realism was at its core and before you say it, no this game is not historically accurate at all, its like saying COD WW2 is historically accurate. The only real fun you can have is in the mission editor and Ground Assault Arcade. Low level naval battles are fun for a second but once you get a tier higher you get sunk faster then the Empress of Ireland. So in all I under no circumstance support and recommend this game. plus the fact that the devs have sent money to Luhansk and Dontensk during whats going on in Ukraine so yeah (TLDR Fuck this game, Fuck its Devs, Fuck its balancing, Fuck its ""historical battles"" play something that isnt made by gajin."

Premium helps but it still takes a long time. I've played for almost a year now and I'm only mid WWII tanks in two nations not far in planes or naval."
10785,This game is really fun! I just want Japan to be a little more powerful.
10786,cool planes good game
10787,I like flying planes
10788,i adore this game as it is the peak quality of real time air battles and represents the entire air enthusiast community with their wide range of aeornautical devises. Dans the futur je vousdrais un AC-130 car cest tres amusant. een en meisje en vrouw? i love this game so much and i would like to see war thunder in the cinemas as a prequal to danger zone. High way to the danger zon. ba ba ba... high way too the danger zone. high way to the danger zooooone!!!!! god i love that song. I losten every day it is my most favorite song from top gun the movie. I would also like to see top gun in war thunder that would be pretty cool eh? Anyways ive said a lot already but this game is so inpirational and it means that i have so many things to say about it. This game reminds me of minecraft. iithink there should be a war thunder mod in minecraft where you an battle each other. My favorite feature about wart thunder is the world war 1 roleplay servers which really excited aout the future of our relation ship. Theres a girl at my school who plays war thunder. Shes so leng and the way she flys that jet...WOW. Especially when she flies that MiG-21 S. It makes me drool in awe. On monday i am actuallly going to the tank museum. The tanks in this game are are ma favorite! teanks are very cool. tanks are fun. tanks are amaazing.tanks love everyone. please subscirbe to my youtube channel it is 5iz2. i have minceaft kill montages on skywras. i am a growing influencer who needs some friends because i am very lonely expet for that stunning girl who flies that MiG-28 S in here high heel stiletos. girl you fly n ghetto. with them brand new high heel stilettos. smell like rose petals. heard you're a ropck star heaevy metal well im a pop star lets get to together.

10804,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

10808,"I hate this game, i am only on era III and it is just too much grind. I do not recommend, plus it is pay to win."
10809,"I havent played in a while and my friend told me that gaijin reduced the credit and exp gain as well as increasing the amount of exp needed to research a tank? wtf man this is just worse than wot now

Edit: after playing more all the fun stuff i like about the game aka the tanks just gets worse and worse the more i play lmao.

like the ""maps are historical"" excuse to not make any actual balanced maps is annoying even for the amount of hot garbage maps in wot it isnt really possible  to get sniped across the whole map.

Also as for the researching id say any game like this is gonna be a grind , buying a week of premium made the grind a lot more fun and enjoyable then without however WT research tree needs to me more clear and what i mean by that is the fact that im able to research a tank , get it fully researched and then get a pop up saying im unable to buy it because i don't have the previous tank researched is the most infuriating thing ever. Why TF am i ABLE to research it if i CANT actually buy it?!?!.

Like idk the game has so many good points about it and so much potential but i cant seem to find them since all i do is cope and seethe. Now watch me in a few days launch the game instead just to play against the snail.

P.S I don't know why the snail bothered to respond to my review, like instead of responding to negative reviews from someone who is seething respond to the actually well writing negative reviews."
10810,not that good at the game but I can say once you get used to it the game becomes pretty fun.

10812,hell
10813,"BEST GAME EVER!!! IT FILLS ME WITH JOY AND HAPPINESS, NO ANGER AT ALL :thumbs_up:"
10814,"As a former console player, i used my console account to continue my progress on pc, but later realized that console accounts do not have the same privileges as PC accounts do, such as gaijin marketplace, and certain crafting events. You cant even test drive certain vehicles. to unlink your console account to your pc one is an annoying process, and they freeze your account. gaijin says that it'll be done in 2-3 days, in reality it takes 7+ days for the apparent heavy ""workload"" that i'm currently still waiting on. honestly it would be much better if gaijin had a decent customer support which would at least e-mail me to keep me updated, because many people have money inside this game and to lose your account is like losing 1000+ hours of your life when you could be doing something more productive."
10815,"the game itself is good...
But its pay to win , unless you have premiun account yoy play 5.7 get paired with 6.3 , you get 6.3 get paired with 7.0.
all purchases with real money are an absurd to BRL currency
Russian tanks suck in comparison to german ones...
it just sucks to see a good game be destroyed by greed"
10816,very good 1940s japanese simulator
10817,Bruh
10818,"good overall game, but the grind is extreme and the only way to the top is that.. and can take a LONG time. if you pay your way. you will be unable to fight the others and die broke"
10819,You should only play this game if you don't have anger issues tbh ://
10820,"this game is reaaaaaly p2w, don't even bother downloading it, it takes like 100GB anyway and you rarely win a fight unless you buy their premium stuff. STAY AWAY"
10821,yes i like game suggest (please release my family(
10822,"The game itself is very well done.
The game aspects are also very nice but if you are not exeptionaly good then from Rank 4 (end of WW2) you will have no money to spend without buying money or buying a premium account. Even with the premium account the progress is painfully slow.

So in the end i can´t recommend the game"
10823,if you have no life then you will love this game
10824,"I Have played this game since 2017 and there are some things I must say about this game. Overall the content is all their, vehicles, maps, tanks, ect. However my problem with Gaijin is that as of late they are ignoring and outright making the game worse. Gaijin has been ignoring the worsening Battle Rating (BR) compression in air and tanks. Anything above 6.3 in air RB and you automatically get put up against cold war era jets while your in a Jet from the WW2. This can be especially frustrating when your just flying a super prop and have to face up against aircraft that were developed 5 to 10 years later, aircraft that have better weaponry, speed, missiles, flares, you name it. It also doesn't help that Gaijin has also nerfed The economy to the point. That you have to have 3 to 5 kills to break even at high tiers. This game forces players to spend real money to Grind and to break even with the economy. Gaijin in their infinite wisdom is making the economy really really bad. The only way to break even is to fly with a squad mate, but even then most squad mates only want to fly at really high tiers.

The only reason people play this game is because Gaijin basically has a monopoly on the World War 2 Simulator Genre."
10825,"play it if you like nazi's, WWI, WWII and in the future WWIII live
"
10826,For the love of god don't play this game im already sucked into it but if you want to keep your live dont play this.
10827,a 10 goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
10828,The progression system in the game is in chronological order in terms of history. It will take you a while to get to the modern tanks and planes.The planes and tanks look realistic to their real counterparts and the damage system in the game is very immmersive and your bullets actaully hit where their supposed to and you can get a slo mo view of your bullet hitting another tank and watch is blow up its very satisfying.
10829,"Few games have made me consider uninstalling the game in the heat of a rage-quit more, and even fewer games has made me throw money at them for premium accounts and vehicles at the same time...

Make no mistake, this is not a free-to-play game. The grind is so goddamn massive without a premium account running that you'll die of old age before getting to top-tier... But man do i love this game at the same time...

I really love the game, but with the amount of grind involved and the mechanics that constantly push you towards spending money on premium-account time and premium vehicles I cannot really recommend this game to new players unless they already have friends who play and want  to join them :/

Gaijin, why do you make it so hard to love you???"

10872,"Unfortunately, this game is highly addicting despite the rage-inducing tendencies and endless crying as you constantly get bombed or gajiin'd. There is decent gameplay and ""realistic damage models"" for ground vehicles that feels like it only works half the time (although more like 4/5).  As someone who has grinded this game and had plenty of fun moments, I still question why I play this game whenever I do haha. I have more consistent fun by making fun of the game and talking trash about it. Sleeping is more fun than this game as it literally sends you into a rollercoaster of joy, despair and deppression.

For reference I have 150 hours on console, and about 200 hours total on pc between the gaijin launcher and steam."
10873,its good
10874,"Pretty good for first 100 hours, only 900 left til I tell others I play this game."
10875,wheraboo for life
10876,This game is the best action game i have ever played. its a 10/10 But you get banned for having too many vehicles?
10877,"pain, tech tree length can eat my ass. Grind is not worth it. 10/10 will keep playing"
10878,Pain
10879,"Really recommend for the realism have, I have not had this much fun on a game in awhile and always is something interesting in the updates."
10880,Easily the Best Military Vehicle simulator
10881,yes
10882,i was forced by gaijin to thumbs up it SAVE ME PLEASE
10883,"Honestly, this game can be total garbage. To start off, I have noticed that I am being ranked with people way above my skill level. This normally wouldn't be too bad, however I normally play the aviator gamemode, where dying isn't very fun as repairs could kick my ass if I had gotten higher level planes.

Second, the lock on is very glitchy. On console it works just fine for me, however on pc, it works like shit as if they turn, your cursor is no longer on the screen making shooting and aiming impossible.

If you play this game, I highly recommend playing it on controller or console. either way this game was just a let down for me as I had high expectations for this when I was downloading it."
10884,really fun
10885,good game
10886,"Too many bugs after the update of danger zone. Different bugs appear at different time in different games, Even the same map with same game mode has different bugs when u play it.

10896,"You'll have fun with first tier vehicles, around the end of tier 2 and so on it becomes a painful grind. Expensive vehicles, expensive ""repair cost"" and expensive upgrade but not so much currency earned after each match, your blood will be suck dry if you don't pay for that premium subscribe, also I don't think Battle-rating system works as it should"

10913,"has been renamed to ""pain"" on my desktop should explain it 8/10"
10914,"I love the realistic battles. Although it takes a long time to grind and they kind of make you pay to grind easier and it's the long game. The grind is too much but the game itself is polished and fun. If you take it very slow and just play when you want to play in a few years you'll have top tier stuff but know it's a major grind. That's how they sneak a few bucks from you here and there for premium accounts to grind faster but the game itself is very beautiful. So, take it slow, enjoy don't focus on getting to the top just work toward what you want and enjoy the flight."

10969,"The grind is absolutely stupid. If you want to bypass the grind, expect to spend a ton of money. A single premium in this game is $60, which is outrageous.

Gameplay itself is crap. PVP is full of sweatlords who hang out at the lower tiers for fun. PVE is boring, stupid, and requires you to cheese the map every round, otherwise you'll just be aimbotted from across the map by the AI.

Spend you time and money somewhere else."
10970,fun
10971,"Its a fun game. But it seems like they "" encourage  ' you to pay. You're in a battle getting picked off one minute by better tanks. The next your killing it the next game. The tire system seems just for show. But it is a fun game, ive paid nothing. But you can easily tell who does."

10978,help
10979,"Good Game. The grind is pretty intense though. You're gonna buy a premium tank or account at some point just face the facts, you can't realistically make progress without it at higher levels - a serious person with a life does not have a choice or you won't progress. And this game is one of the more expensive when it comes to premium accounts and vehicles. 

It's a fun game though different game modes means different ways of playing for different people are available. 

Start with Russia the grind is less cringe, Avoid UK and Germany the Grind rough. 

Overall good 4/5."

Once you start getting like any other it starts to be very cool. Like any other free to play game. The is no pay to win really you can do nice stuff for free and if you want to progress faster you can but some Premium time and battlepasses."
11025,"Great game, although it can be very frustrating. If you are new to this game, expect long grinds and long waiting times for getting new vehicles. Also it is easy to find yourself putting tons of money into this game.
On the other side of the coin, getting kills and wins grants huge satisfaction.

11032,"great game for a VR/PC expierence of flying driving aircrafts ground vehicles like planes,tanks,boats and choppers"
11033,"So it's not really a bad game. Just feels like a massive chore to get through the research part and getting to the next tanks.

All of my hours are me playing with T1 tanks and on rare occasions trying T2 Swedish tanks. But it's not really helping because then everyone else has better tanks than me and after my T2 tank dies I have to use my T1. Not that fun.

I kinda wanted to try out the later Tiers but I believe I'll be stuck in the lower tier for way too long.
Unless you throw money at the game that is. Which I'm sure the game is meant to do.

So my experience so far? Well I hardcore mode and picked Swedish tanks. Basically I get one shotted A LOT. It's a bit annoying.
I have gotten kills, I have won games and stayed to the end. I've also gotten one shot kills too and it feels good.

But overall I believe the game would be better if you could get through research a bit quicker because they have a ton of tanks now. Even air planes, boats and now choppers. 
People would probably stay for longer if they could try out more and new tanks instead of grinding one tree tier for hours on end."

11035,"If you want to get beaten by Gaijins bullshit system for no reason then play it

for the people who havent played this game BEWARE cuz every time you have ""fun"" in this game the devs will take it out and make life easier for the russians and americans cuz i simply cant see how a Sherman (one of many) can shoot a Tiger H1 through the front armor

In short this game has just constantly gotten worse and worse

PS.: Gaijin please next time when we are in Realistic mode make the ammo pen realistic as well cuz i can sure as shit tell you a PZGR 40 Will not only pen 44 millimiters of armor

11063,"Isn't bound to any one type of vehicle, so there's hours of fun to be had with not only different landscapes, but also different perspectives of modern warfare. 
Not only this, but historical background about each unit is given in its profile. So in addition to having great fun, you might also learn something. Who knows, that knowledge might enhance your game play even further.
The effects and graphics are stunning even on low resolution and the movement of all of the units, save a few of the aircraft, are extremely realistic!
multiplayer compatibility could allow for inter vehicle type combat, but perhaps that comes in later? Possibly my only gripe. 
Without question, best modern TECHNOLOGY warfare game out there!"

11069,"Just don't play it. 

It's a soul-sucking grindfest. 
If the fact it took them EIGHT YEARS to put a rewind button in replays but had plenty of time to push out a perfectly timed ""Top Gun"" themed update (packed to the brim with premiums!) in time for the movie, that should tell you everything you need to know.
They have also taken the time to make the very planes and tanks you grind out for months, if not years to get, so economically unviable as to punish you for playing what you've earned. Wanna drive that Leopard 2 or Abrams? Wanna fly that F-4 or Mirage? Better hope you have an undefeated streak with multiple kills or you will bleed currency like a severed carotid artery.

TL:DR 
Don't play. You grind and then get punished at the end."

Gaijin i do wish you made the engine sound of the abrams a little quieter so it could match its nick name Whispering death. in some ways its better than world of tanks as in it provides a more real experience instead of HP you have what i like to call a mechanical system where there's a accurate model of the tanks, planes, and boats interior. so if your like me and enjoy military machines in a good free game this is it."
11101,yes
11102,"Very good game, and has fairly realistic damage and combat. I've played for a good time beyond my visible play time and its definitely better than others."
11103,"Over all very good, can sometimes get frustrating, but very fun"
11104,Its an okay game
11105,"alrighty so i had a much longer in depth review but when i switched to dislike it deleted lol besides that i dont really like this game many things are wrong with it only keep playing because there is no alternative to this game i will sum up what i said and all the issues. 

1) arty - imo it needs to be removed it may seem super fun and satisfying when you get a kill but the more you played the more you get killed by it so please gaijin remove it entirely 

2) mid tier jets its what we call ""missile thunder"" since the only thing that happens is shooting each other with missiles 

3) sometimes the physics engine doesn't work right if i have 301 mm of pen at 10m and i shoot something with 20mm of armor i should pen it right that's what i though but noooo i didn't and died to it wtf gaijin

4) fpe (fire prevention equipment) and parts - when  you first get a new vehicle you wont be able to repair or put out a fire which never go out by themselves, to repair yourself you need to research the parts modification for your vehicle and to put a fire out you need to research fpe so please every time you get in a game type FREE FPE AND PARTS! in the all chat every game if we get enough people they should listen 

5) if you think you should get done with a tech tree in a month good luck let alone an entire year 

in conclusion if you choose to play for the same reason i still do there's no alternative, please don't be toxic and don't be a bad person and don't sit in the back and snipe its not fun for anyone

ill write another review when i make it to 1000 hours"

11149,"so you decided to pick up war-thunder? Well that is a great action of bravery, i hope to see you at war with the German tanks. ( chuckle ) alright, ill stop the role play and get to the point. 

War-thunder has some properties that some people don't like but you'll find out of them later in game.
The realism of some battles is fun and the general feeling of a strong tank being shot and tanking every round and that tank is in your control. That feeling is great.

11153," liked air combat little but ground battles are fucked up masochist hell hole .

spent hours buying Stug3 aand i get blown by 1BR tanks. no matter how much you anglke or how welltrained crew is you will get blown unless you have premium account.

basically it is pay to win. i m fucking done with these bullshit multiplayer tank game.
And for aircombat IL2 is far better game. IL2 sturmovik 1946 is far far better air sim than this sorry excuse for multi player arcade game.

You spend hours buyinga and learning  bf109 f4 and it still cant boom and zoom 2-3 BR planes not even bombers.

11165,anjime bilek pov 😅☝
11166,what an infuriating game
11167,its really fun and interesting to play as the different factions
11168,if you want to become addicted to a game that just involves flying planes and screaming slight racial slurs with your friends (and threatenting to drop thousand pound bombs on peoples houses because they killed you with a spitfire) this is the perfect game for you. but get ready to invest thousands of countless hours into the game just to get one shotted by some random ai thats controlling an anti aircraft gun. usually happens every single game. have fun!
11169,"I've been clean for 6 months now and I've honestly never felt better. War Thunder has been on a downward spiral for so long and I'm concerned for all the new players picking up the game. The grind is aggravating and intentionally so because the devs know people will pay for premium time to ease the frustration. It's because of this and the recent economy changes which slowed progression to a near halt that the playerbase has been so much more toxic, selfish, and generally on-edge. It's no wonder chat was banned for three months, but it's not the players' fault. Update after update Gaijin continues to develop their cash grabbing schemes while actively neglecting the dedicated players that time and time again willingly violate international law for a chance to influence the game in their image. 
    I don't mean to say noone is allowed to enjoy things, but me and so many others who have been playing for years share the same sentiment about this game. I only hope more people can find the strength to quit. War Thunder is one hell of an addiction, but I promise you the withdrawal is better than the grind."

11182,"i have spent days playing this awful, horrible, and unfair game. my mental health declined rapidly the moment i decided to start playing along the ussr line of ground and air force. there is no bias, not at all. this game is full of 14 year olds that are either complete braindead or for some reason, autistic level geniuses that are capable of staying still for the entirety of a match just to get one single enemy vehicle destroyed.
do you want to have fun? you wont find it here unless you read and investigate every fucking tank and plane you match up against.

11204,"This game hurts to play...... but i like the pain so i keep playing.The amount on grind in this game is on a scale i've never seen before,i've had more fun in minecraft digging through a mountain. Warthunder can have its moments though few and far between especially if you play Americans (which i do) early American tanks (everything before and including WWII)  dont have the armor or fire power to go toe to toe with other nations, meaning if you have any American tank (heavy included and any other tank under a battle rating of 6) and you are directly facing a German panther in any of its variations your dead end of story unless your will to live kicks in and you the destroy the barrel (a very small target) you my friend get to see another day, but keep in mind you only disabled them for like 30 seconds alternatively if the panther shoots you in the center of your tank your dead, your american tank cant penetrate the front armor of German tanks. You are Effectively the underdog so you have to play like one, if you see a tank look for a way to face its side or get really good at destroying tank barrels because your never going to win in a gun fight fair and square. That being said i still like this game i just dont want people to play this game expecting to see all the modern vehicles really quickly,ive had this game for 3 years playing on and off and im just now getting Vietnam era tanks. if you do pick up this game i wish you luck."

Look, we all play this game because we don't have another option. Yes, everything that people say about it is true. The grind is unbeareable if you don't have premium tanks and the ground maps need to be updated for modern comba, but there's a problem going for months that hasn't been fixed by the devs. THE MEMORY LEAKAGE. After 2 or 3 matches the fps drops to less than 30 in every map, making it unplayable. I swear this has been happening for months, everybody is telling the devs about this problem and they haven't done shit about it. ""LOOK AT OUR NEW JET"", while not fixing a fundamental problem. If you think is not that bad, I have more than a 1000 hours in ArmA 3 and that game is god awful in its optimization, WT is currently worse than it."

11241,"Forget about the new content, it is almost never relevant to you as you will NEVER reach that level. It is basically unattainable unless you have a lot of very good games in a row over a period of a few months at least and even then thats only for one country."
11242,good
11243,"I tried to like this game. I really did. I've given it several tries both on and outside of Steam totalling about 500 hours played together and I've enjoyed most of it. The game is fun, realistic, but ultimately rather frustrating to play due to many scummy practices designed to keep the players playing (I'll get to that soon).

So, I should probably start with the obvious. The game rewards being good and punishes being bad. Which in and on itself is something I fully support... but only if you put players at a level playing field.

When you get a new tank, you first need to research the modules so you will be nothing more waddling hunk of steel with a toothpick attached for the next couple of games. So you join a match, go to a decent spot and get hit from god knows where by an RU-152 ice-skating around at mach 3. Your gun is blown to bits, your engine is wrecked and you can't even repair yourself because your crew somehow forgot the existence of a cogwheel in the brief amount time it took you to retrain them for the new tank. Now you have to ask your team for help and wait 8 minutes until someone maybe notices you, or simply give it up and go to garage.
You've achieved nothing, have been nothing but a burden to your team and got back to your garage knowing all that with but a poultry sum of experience and money. Oh and did I mention you could actually LOSE progress? So you better hope that the gearing up won't take you too long because you WILL go bankrupt.

Second issue makes the issue 1 all the more infuriating. There isn't a system by which the matchmaker would sort out the experienced players from the the inexperienced players other than the rank of your vehicle. That means that you can easily lose just thanks to the enemy team getting 5 players who played this game since the stone age while yours didn't.

The third and last issue is the one which I hate the most. The power your credit card has over this game. You can play the game ""normally"" and spend thousands of hours grinding without ever getting to the rank 7. Or... you could just take out your credit cards and get the same progress is 1/10th of the time! There's legendary vehicles like Katyusha, Brummbar or Centurion ACX, all locked behind a paywall that you cannot pass without taking out your credit card. You can buy camo and place it on your tank, giving you a competitive edge over your enemies! For the small price of 3.30 euro of course.
But I think you can get those very rarely from the spinning wheel of daily rewards that so tentatively goes over all the luxurious rewards you think you can get, only to land at that one, single 10% booster you need to play 2 hours daily to actually get any use out of. Unlucky! So they even gave you the option to double the camo on your tank for a monthly fee, so you can live out your dreams as a moving bush.

All'n'all. The game is fun, I enjoyed it. It's realistic and enjoyable for both new players and experienced ones alike. But it's also designed to be as frustrating as possible with a simple fix to all the frustration being money. I guess that's pretty realistic as well...
Anyway, if you got this far into this outburst of mine. Thank you... and I'm sorry. I needed a place to vent after I sunk so much time into this game hoping it would get better eventually.

Rant over.

11258,If you love realistic war games with tanks and planes that are all usable because of balancing then this game is not for you 10/10

11276,"the game is fun, if you can get a round were there are not 10 planes in the air just bombing your tank, some try hard with all the tress on their tank and finally if the penetration was always consistent life would be fine. cas needs to restricted to 3 planes in the air per team or something, trees need to be taken out for they are an unfair advantage that you have to pay for. other than that if you get a game where you dont want to throw yourself out a moving car after its done than its no problem."

My Tank driver gets knocked out faster than my dad when he gets back from work. In summary this game tests my sanity every game with my monitor fearing getting punching into. 10/10 play with friends"
11280,fun
11281,10/10 would recomend
11282,after playing this game for over 1000 hrs ill say this for a free to play game this is a good one yes it may be abit grindy but the time it takes to max out a plane or tank really helps you get better before moving on to higher tiers and to be honest you dont have to throw money at it you can litteraly get to top tiers without having to spend any money tho getting some premium time and mabye premium plane/tank/ship that you like helps abit. if you like a game with mostly realistic flight models and a dev team that constantly pops out updates try this out.

They took away the silver lions bonuses for the premiums that I had bought and I didn't buy those planes under the assumption that those bonuses could go away. Had I known that I would have given no money to this game. It's unfortunate, I will probably still play, but I am out of SL's to be able to play at the tier that I want and I could get better (and will with time) but I shouldn't have to win at the game to be able to keep playing the game at a certain battle rating."

"
11337,"game is free, it only costs half of your life time."
11338,"Unfortunately like most games like this one its a huge pay to win type game with premium accounts getting best vehicles with high damage barely any reload speed etc the first game you play is the only good fair game you play as you have 0 battle ranking and therefore even when you fight someone with 3x the battle ranking you currently have you will only be up against other BR1 players which means that you can actually take being shot more then once and you can shoot them more then once to kill them its how the game should be after the 1st game I'm always up against enemy players who all have BR's of 2 to 6.5 which means most of these guys are way further down the tech tree then me or they are ridiculously better at the game which doesn't really make it fair by any stretch of the imagination pair that with crap like gun jamming pilots falling unconscious or extreme reload times and you have yourself war thunder

War thunder is a game that looks great but when you only last 5 mins in battle because your fighting enemys that have way higher battle ranks then you the cinematics wear off pretty quickly if they scrapped the pay to win crap and forced player only with a BR difference of 1 to 0.5 of a difference to face off the game would be a lot better every now and again i get a game like this you know when this happens because you magically go to being at the top of the leader board then you get a high BR rank all of a sudden your up against people who have a BR of 5 you get 10 games like that then your back to a game you stand half a chance in again i cant recommend playing this game at this time until they sort the matchmaking out"

11391,this game is great
11392,"I do not recommend this game to people who are looking for a game to play long term. 

However, this does not mean the game is ""Bad"" by any sense of the imagination. It's the contrary actually, The game is beautiful with amazing detail in terms of the visuals with amazingly detailed vehicle models and weapon/destruction effects. 
If you are are a lover of war machines that float, fly or rumble across the ground with semi-realistic battle characteristics this game will be enjoyable. 

Now, the reason I can't recommend this game is due to how the end game content is structured and released. As well as end game and new maps that are contradicting to the modern mechanics that are actively being added to the game. This portion is specifically talking about ground forces. My Ground forces playtime is not comparable to the tiny bit a time that I have with planes or ships. 
The late or 'End"" game for Warthunder is an absolute mess that is reminiscent of a test server or sandbox accept for the fact that is's actually on live servers. The modern vehicles and their weapons systems are great but they feel out of place with the maps that we currently have. These new mechanics and features feel like they are being bottle-necked due to the size of the maps in Warthunder. Some nations ideology behind the intended use of these vehicles are poorly represented in game due to the maps and the game modes. This is very apparent when grinding through the German and British Ground force tech trees for example. The top tier British MBTs are considered bad not because of the vehicles characteristic but because the game simply does not support the ideology because the use of challenger MBTs. Instead the game modes force these vehicles to be aggressive on really tiny maps that completely disregards the ideology that Gaijin balances into these vehicles. Resulting in them being considered ""bad"" or "" Not Competitive"". Which is really a shame for a game that goes into such detail and tries it's best to be semi-realistic. There are many examples of this in game that will make grinding through tech trees a real hell.

This brings me to my next point, progression hell in the form of Gaijin intentionally making stock grinds as terrible as they absolutely can be, Creating an ""artificial problem"" and selling players the ""Fix"" in the form of allowing players to purchase modifications with Golden Eagles. They do this aggressively with many tech tree vehicles that nearly make them unplayable and forcing you to either endure many battles of absolute dog shit or circumvent the dog shit by giving them Money. Just to give an example, a few of the top tier MBTs only have HEAT available for the stock vehicle while putting the better APFSDS at tier 3-4 modification level. This means you will have to use HEAT at top tier for a while before you can get the better shell types. At top tier nearly all of the modern MBTs  are nearly impervious to HEAT. 
The same idea does with multiple vehicles that only have APCR as stock ammo that you have to grind through for the vehicle to finally be usable or even remotely fun. 
Not only do they do this with Shell types, but also with Thermal and Night vision modifications, Fire extinguishers, repair kits...ect. Imagine playing top tier MBTs without Thermals, no APFSDS, no FPE and no repair kits. And you are expected to either grind through this shit or give them money. They create so many problems and sell the players solutions that should be Quality of Life improvements. They monetize heavily with Premium vehicles every update, events and with premium account status bonuses. They have no excuse to completely disrespect their players time with stupid marketing techniques like selling QOL improvements that should be standard game QOL updates."
11393,Once you reach 3.0 you start to get messed up my modders who shoot you through buildings and mountains. They really have to fix this problem. I payed for premium (which I now regret) and now im disgusted by the sportmanship of some of these people who mess up the game for everyone. Fix it or youre gonna lose a lot of players if you havent already. Im out.

11430,"War Thunder is a great game that does a good job of balancing pay-to-play and regular players. The BR system ensures that paying does not give an overwhelming advantage and keeps the game enjoyable for all. With that being said, expect to put in a ridiculous amount of time if you want to advance to higher BR without paying. Progression is slow and costly. This seems like it is done on purpose to entice you to pay which makes sense. If you want to play just to enjoy the early game definitely go for it. If you're expecting to fly jets and the latest tanks, give it a pass."
11431,its a amazing game
11432,"This game clearly does some things right and you can definitely have a lot of fun while playing it. But there are so much glaring issues that I have to talk about.

[b] Map Design [/b]
It's clear as day that gaijin has 0 clue on how to make maps that would be actually playable. Most of the maps are just not playable with tanks, like sure, they are realistic, but they are not designed for tanks. Nobody comes to play war thunder for the realism, because realism is not possible with uptiers and downtiers.

[b] Uptiers & Downtiers [/b]
I'm going to try and simplify this: Let's say your vehicle is at tier 6.7 (usually late WW2 vehicles) you have a chance when in a match to face off against players that either are lower or higher than you. For example if enemy vehicles are at 6.3, 5.7 then it means you got downtiered which usually makes your game a lot easier because of your superior vehicle and skill. But it's way more likely that you're going to be uptiered, (booster are basically going to make you always get uptiered) which makes you get pounded by enemy players with early Cold war vehicles who make your vehicle 80% completely obsolete. It wouldn't be such a big issue if it wouldn't happen every one or two matches. It's honestly just terrible game design, it's not fun and no-one likes uptiers, like literally no-one.

[b] Pay to win [/b]
No matter what anyone tells you, this game is 100% pay to win. You can purchase ""premium"" vehicles for real life money or in the marketplace which usually ranges somewhere from 40$ to 100$+. These premium vehicles are usually experimental models of typical vehicles who got up gunned or up armored. They are usually at the same tiers as their typical counterparts but lets say with a lot of benefits. First of all the vehicle itself is usually superior to others of it's tier, and they pack something called a talisman, which helps you grind research points (used to unlock vehicles)

[b] Terrible economy [/b]
This game's economy is shit. You have to be the best of the best to make up for your losses in the match. There are 3 currencies in the game: [u] Silver lions [/u] - Basic money, used to purchase normal vehicles, their modifications, repair them if destroyed in battle (basically if you get killed you have to repair the vehicle), [u] Research points [/u] - used to unlock vehicles and their modifications. [u] Golden Eagles [/u] - can be bought by real money, has a chance to drop from a lucky wheel box (0.1% or something like that). Used to purchase premium vehicles, can be exchanged to silver lions or can be used to boost the research progress of unlocking a tank, can also be used to buy lucky wheel boxes, battle passes. talismans, vehicle backups and everything else in the game. Now This system itself is pretty scummy, but the really major issue is with silver lion ration between getting and losing them. To simplify - if you don't perform really really well in a game you will lose money, bad streaks of games basically result in losing tens of hours worth of progress. You will usually find yourself with 2 or 3 researched vehicles that you cannot purchase because of lack of silver lions. It sucks.

[b] Pro Russian Devs and Russian bias [/b]
Gaijin (the devs) were originally based in Russia if I'm not mistaken. It's clear that the Russian vehicles are balanced to favor the Russian Team, The Russian vehicle repair costs are cheaper than any other nations, the Russian tech tree also has the most and the best premium vehicles, For example a Modern Russian MBT - T80BVM has a max repair cost of 3,960 SL, while a modern German MBT - Leopard 2A6 has a max repair cost of 5,410 SL, now this isn't the best example of the level of unfairness in the game, but one of the Japanese little cars with a missile launcher that can't kill anything has a 11,000 SL repair cost which is insane. This persists in lower ranks as well. It's clear that Russian Bias is in this game and there's no denying of it.

[b] The FUN [/b]
There is some fun in this burning pile of shit. You can definitely have a good time. There is just something so satisfying when you play your cards right, get 4-10 kills per game and win. It's so satisfying. Although there is some fun to be had here, there are so many issues which prevent you from enjoying this game

I don't even expect people to read all of this, just wanted to get my anger out. Still going to play this game because it's the best MMO tank game out right now."

cons:

- confusing at first"
11445,"Its an abusive ex girlfriend. She berates you. Her behavior has no logical threads. And when you think you have her figured out and happy, she'll spit in your face, drain your wallet, and sleep with your best friend's neighbor.

But when she's good in bed, when you wake up in the morning and she's got breakfast waiting for you with the smile and care of a loving housewife, you'll want to put a ring on it.

Okay, metephors out of the way.

Avoid this game.

It is not friendly towards casuals. The skill ceiling and curve is impossible if you're just looking to play this game and kill time for a little bit. Yes it has ""arcade"" battle modes that are a bit more forgiving but the skill curve to adapt to them, even at the beginning stages of the game, are a grind-a-thon of annoyance, inconsistency with game mechanics, leveling up skills, grinding the tech tree, and just overall frustration.

And if you aren't a casual, you will also hate this game. You will either hate the fact that your favorite plane/tank/ship is not the indestructible war machine you *think* it is, you'll hate the RNG applied when you actually do hit your targets and do zero damage, you will hate how you have to deal with aircraft in ground forces mode, you will hate the economy, you will hate anyone who criticizes your chosen nation, you will hate the community that hates this game, you will hate other players for their lack of awareness, you will just hate everything (don't believe me? Take a trip over to the discussion forums and just see the salt mines at work).

Maybe once in a blue moon you'll have a good game or two, but that's only if you can completely detach yourself from any emotion when playing this game, are able to just focus on scoring your points, and just moving on. The moment you celebrate and the moment you think you're having fun this game will crush your gonads in a vice."
11446,Just dont play this game
11447,this is a cool war game

11456,plane go weeee
11457,Very tedious game
11458,"This is one of the absolute worst games i've ever played.

I'll start with the positives, it has very satisfying ground combat with different parts of your tank being damaged depending on ammo types and where you aim your shots. Finding a target 1km away, zeroing in on your target and landing that perfect shot is immensly satisfying. And the game has lots of tanks with different guns and ammo types to learn about and adding replayability, but that is sadly where the positives end.

Now to the negatives, if you are solely interested in playing tank vs tank combat or atleast ground vs ground combat this game isnt for you, you are gonig to be constantly killed by different types of aircraft and an absolutely excessive amount of ATGM (Guided missiles) and often you have 0 chance of defending yourself. This gets even worse with players being able to respawn because when you find yourself in a good position taking out a couple of enemies you can be damn sure one of them respawns in an aircraft and comes back to kill you. 

And theirs to my knowledge no way of playing against only ground vehicles so you are stuck getting bombs dropped on your head ruining all the fun.

The maps are absolutely terrible, alot of them consists of really open spawns with dense hard cover in the center, which means ones you loose the center you wont get there ever again. This results in lots of spawn camping which makes the games absolutely terrible even if you win, because either you loose the center and theirs not even a point respawning, or you win the center and all your opponents leave resulting in very short unsatisfying battles.

Also, progression is extremly slow, even with a premium vehicle, premium time (Which is way overpriced) and a silver lion booster you wont make much money. And alot of the tech trees have extremly similar tanks one after another that you either have to buy even if you want to skip it, or you have to progress through the exact same modifications on basically the exact same tank again before it gets decent enough to play. And you also have to progress through large parts of the tech tree even in you are only interested in a single tank because you have to unlock a certain amount of tanks in each rank to be able to research tanks in the next rank.

And lastely the game looks absolutely dated, these graphics would have been okay in 2013 and impressive in 2007 but in 2022 they look god awful and the UI is EVEN WORSE."
11459,Suffer.
11460,This game is always fun! Never lets me down when i'm digging for a past or modern war zone. My favorite branch to be in is the Air force. I LOVE the Swedish as they have such good looking planes. and so does America and Peoples Republic of China (China) or Republic of China (Which is Taiwan).

11471,"It Is a fun game... don't get me wrong and I will always recommend this to anyone.

But for the love of god, the Era mix up is some top grade BS. WW2 tanks against ATGM's etc, it would be a whole lot better if there was era blocks for different tiers.. but hey as Gaijin don't give two fucks, I guess us WW2 tank lovers just have to put up with the fact of having shitty ass ATGM's thrown at us.

Oh and another thing, the planes in ""Ground"" battles a good mix also.. would be grand to have a game mode of just TANKS and that's all. If you're gonna throw planes in with tanks, might aswell add the even bigger boys on the water :)

Also another slight thing... If only cross platform could be toggled on/off would be grand.

Despite those two cons (imo and i'm sure a few others agree) it is a fun and engaging game. The grinds can be fun, the different variations is fun and getting those Kobe shots from 2km+ away is *chefs kiss*"

11475,"This game has tons of content and is fun, however please be warned: the farming required to play your favorite vehicles without paying for premium or buying golden eagles will be significant. My recommendation is to start out playing as a country with a small tech tree, that way you can progress to more modern vehicles more quickly, and play through the bottom tiers before spending anything. At that point, if you still enjoy the game, maybe invest in premium or a premium vehicle to boost your farming."

11491,"it requires a lot of grinding, tanks are pay to win and it is extremely repetitive but overall fun if you have no life"
11492,"To me and my friend group, War Thunder is a team-deathmatch arena shooter in slow, lumbering armored vehicles; its emphasis on tactics, measured precision and light vehicular management instead of twitch reflexes makes it palatable to older gamers who can no longer keep up with the esports-y multiplayer shooters of the world. This one quality barely allows it to transcend its many, intertwined issues with its matchmaking, match design, and F2P grind.

We exclusively play a mode called ""Realistic Battle"" (RB); a midway point between the goofy, tactics-free ""Arcade"" mode and the oppressively hardcore ""Simulation"" mode. In RB, teammates are usefully tagged in the mini-map and HUD, but enemies must be called out manually or scouted with special vehicles, adding a layer of stealth-action. Between its variety of physically simulated vehicles and chaotic combat, it can be a good ""situation generator""; its best matches are fought down to the wire with risky plays and clutch moments.

Unfortunately, those games are few. The peculiarities of War Thunder's F2P grind and lack of thoroughly conceived match design means 20-40% of players on either team are playing in bad faith; running match-sabotaging farming metas that the game fails to punish. Half of the matches are a blowout, decided by which team has more committed players rather than quitting after their first death.

This phenomenon can be mitigated by playing in a large enough friend group (4+) of competent players; it's possible to enjoy winning streaks by virtue of stacking a side with good-faith players. But solo, the War Thunder experience can be quite demoralizing, especially when you play with factions and tiers that have a concentration of poor or bad-faith players (e.g. mid-tier Germany).

This game has been around for a long time and the devs have exhibited no will to fiddle with their gameplay formula, so I expect these issues will never be fixed. War Thunder can be a good game under the right conditions, but an oppressive one otherwise."

Tier 1 (ground): Bit dissapointed that there are around 50 vehicles to research before I see anything relatively modern, but I came here for world war 2 era stuff anyways, not too big of a deal breaker. Seems balanced, P2W almost looks impossible at this tier. Only complaints are how almost every game at this level is half AI, with some ""smurfers"" (idiots who have already mastered the game with 11.0 stuff and decide to go hunt newbies in lower tiers) and then regular new players.

11538,"As one of the many OG players in War Thunder's community, I can say that it's an incredibly biased game in multiple ways. It's the lack of player feedback that gets my downvote, with Gaijin literally ignoring their playerbase and not fixing any of the crucial bugs in the system, only adding and ""fixing"" BRs by removing vehicles that were originally perfectly fine."
11539,W game
11540,I LOVE THIS FTVBFN
11541,good
11542,"Don't play this, just don't. Unless you plan on playing very specific tanks and spending the next 3 years of your life grinding to get them, don't even try."
11543,Aerial combat in this game is pathetic. There's no maneuver you can do to escape someone once they're on you. Especially once your're in a dogfight with someone of a higher rank. It's an uninstall for me.
11544,"this game is soo cool i cant even play wihout my mom XDSDDD!!1Q!!1!
"
11545,Well since I am always playing as a ground player I would not talk much about the air and navy so... Can you dev just make some adjustments to let us ground forces only players feel better when we get killed by some n**bs who only need to press SPACE and do nothing while we have just arrived to the battlefield with no further actions?
11546,"""its not about the destination, its about the journey"""
11547,Good game
11548,Best game ever
11549,"game is so good i almost cried. its a grind but its worth it. However, i wouldn't know because i am so bad :("
11550,"Don't sink your time into it.
You will hate it, love it, or both.
Its like League of Legends but for tank nerds 
This game is pain and i'm married to it."
11551,"This game is gayer than League of Legends players during pride month. I was in my KV-1 that I work 40 hours to get and in my first match I was slowly making my way to the point when I saw through my binos a little baby stuart sitting on the point waiting to cap it when I open fire upon it with my main gun and when I hit it on the side I was granted the no damage text that made me confuse, but then the stuart found me and lined up his shot and when his round hit me I bursted into flames like a fucking blow torch. Btw, why in the hell is it over $100+ dollars to buy a T-62. This make Diablo Immortal micro-transactions look good."
11552,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA very grindy game
11553,Great game to waste your life on
11554,"so cool and fun
"
11555,good
11556,"This game is going to kill me. I have been grinding Israel and I don't know why but I cant stop. This game is like a drug, you cant stop playing. Help me."
11557,"Fun! Until your bank account is empty... The game is so pay to win, and most of the time gameplay involves getting one shot by someone with a ""better"" tank even though its the same battle rating, stupid germans..."
11558,this game has so much to offer. I have been playing for years and cant keep up with the all the new stuff. years of fun ahead if you choose War Thunder
11559,death
11560,"the game is awesome I have a lot of fun playing it, recommend this game for anyone who loves vehicle based combat games :)"

11564,good game
11565,One of the best free to play games out there. Very enjoyable and definetly worth a try!
11566,fun and realistic
11567,"This game isn't free, costs precisely 1 soul"
11568,repair times measured in days?? fk right off
11569,play
11570,I have been beaten and left to die and that is better than this game. 10/10
11571,"The tank side is fun.  It can be frustrating, but that's the nature of the game.

If you use a stick for flying though, the game is garbage.  After all these years, it's still very difficult to fly with a stick.  It is definitely a handicap.  If you don't enjoy flying with a mouse, you will have to go elsewhere for your flying."
11572,bad

I have wasted too much on this yet I shalt not stop.

11576,"fun game but can be painful to grind, play it if u like tank games with realistic mechanic."
11577,grind is ass but overall game is amazing
11578,wooow
11579,"It's fun for the most part. Just ignore the fact that you wasted years of your life, hundreds (if not thousands) of your precious dollars, and nearly all of your sanity just to get that one tank you wanted so long ago. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to people with more money than brains, or hundreds of hours of nothing better to do."
11580,nice
11581,this game is really fun
11582,;]
11583,Pizza time
11584,play air realistic on br 1.0 so you can lose your mind
11585,fun and interactive
11586,rlly good
11587,Its a good game I guess it can keep you occupied for a bit and then after 30 minutes it gets repetitive but it's all for the eternal grind of death
11588,"Love the game, love the graphics...just love it."
11589,"Honestly, this game is fun and nice, until you realize that ""the grind"" is complete bullshit and the game is extremely unfair to new players or players that aren't paying to play the ""free"" game, yes i get it they need to profit too, but many games that exist are free and profit by being reasonable, war thunder is completely unreasonable, you need basically a year to even reach the top tier vehicles of just one country, most of the SL income you make goes to the unreal repair costs that set you back even more, not to mention the immense premium only vehicles that are way too overpowered to tempt players to buy them while making the game unplayable for others, literally all these perks (vehicles/camo/extra income) is acceptable to an extent if one would argue the company needs to profit, but making the grind so unbelievably long is just ridiculous, one needs literally years to even unlock vehicles for 2 countries, paying most of it for repairs and low income while the game says it's free to play, in reality it's not the game is literally unplayable unless you pay, hence i uninstalled it just one week after downloading it (spent 63 hours playing it and i can already see this is gonna take me till 2024 to unlock the stuff i want), my recommendation is not to download it unless you're willing to spend money on it, cause the game is not free to play at all."
11590,yes
11591,"I love and despise this game 
"
11592,"After only playing this game for a few hours, this game will make you laugh, cry, and spend all of your hard earned money. The grind is mostly impossible without spending money for premium, or golden eagles to make the progression easier. Overall, pretty ok for the average gamer, but if you hate your life, this game is for you.          100/-10-23+1.234"
11593,Pure torture!
11594,bad
11595,"This game is flagrantly pay to win. Unless you have friends who play and you want something you can just slowly plug away at, or unless you have a really stacked bank account that you could use some help draining? I wouldn't really advise anyone to play anything with a PTW platform. I've long been of the opinion that that particular business model needs to go extinct and even if it happened tomorrow? It still wouldn't be soon enough for me. Having said that? I also have complaints that aren't based on the PTW model.

Such as the fact that 'Arcade Mode' really isn't all that 'Arcade'. Just about any tank shell from any tank on a similar or higher tier than yours? Is basically guaranteed to kill you. Some will do it more slowly than others by first killing your driver or gunner, or setting your tank on fire. In either of those cases? You're basically paralyzed and left out in the open for everyone to shoot you. If the game is feeling particularly merciful? That shot will, instead, just kill your whole crew in one blast and let you respawn in with a second tank.

I haven't tried realistic combat mode yet, because frankly, if Arcade mode is that much of a nightmare? I'll need to buy a new keyboard, mouse, and possibly a monitor for all the rage that 'Realistic' mode would inspire. 

Also? Matchmaking doesn't exist here. Completely new players are tossed into the muck with all the veterans who decide to go back to their tier 1 and 2 tanks just to troll. Ultimately, the game itself wouldn't be half bad if it weren't so impossible to do anything without first shelling out fifty bucks for their 'gold eagle' currency. Researching new tanks, planes, ships, and boats? Well, you'd probably get faster results watching paint dry. I started off by spending 15 bucks on starter packs. I imagine I would be hating my life for having played this much more if I hadn't.

Still, there are plenty of players out there who really enjoy this kind of game, so I can't say it's entirely bad. It just really, really is not what it says it is. The Cake Is A Lie. And so is Arcade Mode."
11596,good
11597,"It can be fun to play but the Company is f*cking Dog Shit, Also the game is not as fun to get into these days a little less grind then some competitors but still games with alot of Grinding just isnt a thing people look for anymore, but if you are looking for a game to jump into that and dont care about having the best planes or tanks or shit give it ago otherwise steer clear and just say Fuck Gijin."
11598,good game but my brain cells is dying bcs Germany
11599,"its lousy, lousy game"
11600,"best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!
"
11601,good
11602,"Fun. Learning it is weirdly rewarding, but be prepared to be awful at it for a good while. Stop and do something else when you start getting frustrated and you'll enjoy it more. Watch videos, read tips. It helps a lot.

I should mention that it's not really pay-to-win like I was expecting. Lots of grind if you aren't paying for Premium, but honestly it kind of works; the extra time spent unlocking things for free gives you time to learn how to game and maps work. Better in the long run."
11603,Wow that was very cool
11604, this game make me mad
11605,fun
11606,"great game, awsome graphics, campain storyline is pretty solid, extrorndry battle phisics, defenitly worth the money"
11607,"Having Spend hundreds of hours on this game(On Xbox and Steam Combined) I can say I have a decent amount of knowledge and an opinion on the game.
1. It's Free to Play which is a upside BUT YOU NEED TO PAY TO PROGRESS, Playing without a premium time(which u need to pay for) is really hard, you're not gonna progress efficiency, Gaijin is Cash Grabbers 
2. The Game has ALOT of Glitches and Problems with it such as shells bouncing/Penning where it shouldn't and how a Unbalanced certain tanks are and Spawn Killing omfg the spawn killing is insane, it's not about who can cap the first point, it's about who can get to each other's spawn and spawn kill first, the worst map designs ever I've every witnessed.
3. Gaijin makes the grind long and hard, you have to trade in ur sanity to progress, but most players don't do that so they go and buy the top tier premiums tanks and get smacked because Top Tier is a Shit show and a total different ballgame, 

There's a lot more reasons why I'm sure u can find people talking about it. Playing War Thunder makes u almost have fun and that's why u get hooked on it, I do not recommend it, but ill trade in my sanity for it because Russian Tanks are Sexy"
11608,Good
11609,Its a Very cool game Because of the Variety of the Veichles
11610,i think this game is amazing. good tanks and sounds. a great sucses

11618,fun game love playing. wish theyd bring in submarines
11619,Im new player. Match maker is horrible - on 5 games I got colosal 4 losses and 1 win. Low tiers full of sealclubbers in fully kited one shot tanks and planes. No fun just frustration.
11620,oui oui
11621,"I played this game for years, and it just keeps getting worse. From exteme repair costs on fun vehicles, to the battle-rating system becoming so compressed, that you fight semi-modern vehicles in your WW2 tank. It really does not make sense, it's not fun most of the time, and everything wants to take money from you. 
It is incessantly Pay-to-Win, more so now with further traps like crafting events or otherwise. Shame, such a potential went to waste."
11622,do not get this game it will make you spend lots of money and can make you depressed cause of the grind dont get it
11623,"Be careful, you could get addicted to this game like crystal meth"
11624,wry fun
11625,"it is fun killing other tanks, planes, and ships"
11626,"I'm just trying to play a damn game with a faction I like and it's a total shitshow going against any other faction. I shouldn't have to grind for literal months to get to a point where I'm halfway competitive. I legit play this solely because my friends play and have been for years and even they agree that playing as americans in the start is just a crapshoot and it's just not fun. I don't want to have to study enemy armor for days to understand where exactly I have to place every round for the admittedly immense plethora of enemy tanks. Especially when every enemy tank is almost gauranteed a OSK on me and my teammates.

Edit: I still fucking hate this game, but it's too late for me now."

11636,"Being a WWII aviation enthusiast, I love this game, and anyone of a similar mindset will have hours of fun playing this, especially if you have a squadron of friends to accompany you. However, I can confirm that flying in the low level tiers is much more fun than the high level tiers. I'm achieving 7:1 KDs as opposed to 1:1 KDs (if I'm lucky); the dog-fighting is more intense and exciting and there's considerably fewer one-shot kills from overpowered (Russian) aircraft. Gaijin seems to think that the .50 calibre machine gun is better than cannons for air combat, which is not the case. All bombers need a serious buff; the Lancaster was [i] not [/i] made out of soggy cardboard and fully upgraded AI gunners are unable to hit the side of a barn at fifty paces. 

I have little interest in jet aircraft so I can't comment, but if you enjoyed the likes of Tom Clancy's HAWX in ye olden days then I think you will enjoy War Thunder. 

In terms of the naval and ground warfare, both have a more arcade-like feel than World of Warships/Tanks. New players will have an enjoyable time as there isn't any camping around in foliage only to be suddenly sniped by an invisible Tiger. I do get the distinct aura of playing a Playstation 2 game when I'm riding around in tanks.

If a more realistic or immersive feel is what you're aiming for, then I would probably point you in the direction of WoWG for all but the aviation, in which War Thunder is the trump card. I particularly praise the simulator mode, but it would be nice if a group of friends could all operate the same aircraft. That may be asking too much though!"
11637,i love this game its so fun
11638,"The game is good, but the progress takes a lot of times"
11639,"This game is a many things.
Fun is not one of them. 
Now pain, and crying certainly is one of them but don't worry! Just when you thought the game is finally going your way... 
*Insert uptier after uptier after uptier
Mmm now that is more like it just the game we all know and love 

10/10 would be uptiered again
9/10 would be bombed by a plane again
1/10 I don't wanna fight the Puma"
11640,I put this game down for a few years. I recently tried it for a few hours again. It's just a give us money game now. I think the game is even more simplistic with tons of loot boxes for kids.....I scrubbed it from my drive. Shame on you.
11641,fuck all mumies roger commander
11642,"My Review for War Thunder:
I very much enjoy this game, but it does have many pros and cons. For one, it's graphics are pretty solid at around 8/10. It's cool to be able to drive the tanks and fly the planes this game has to offer. However, The number of cons for this game, in my opinion, has been steadily increasing. Gaijin's scummy business model is basically ""Make the grind so goddamn terrible the player pays for a premium"", which really ticks me off. There's also an issue with the volumetric shell system and ""ghost shells"", which is a major detriment to players of all tiers. The issue with BR compression is by far the worst, though. You'll have a Tiger II fighting M4s in a downtier and early-cold-war tanks equipped with HEAT-FS in an uptier. Overall, I'd say that this game is addictive and fun at most times, but the cons may detract from your experience."
11643,i like planes
11644,"I like to play german aviation, and also like to do painfull stuff in real life too"
11645,"Steam says that the game is free, but the actual cost is your soul.




















And 10$"
11646,dont play it
11647,Fun game with a lot of action and good variety of vehicles and scenarios
11648,it's a game that requires you to have premium to be a real game but for free it's fun.
11649,fun if u have no life
11650,"Awesome game! Really recommend for a game for you to try! Even though you might want to do some tutorials, the games graphics are INSANE! Might need to work on matchmaking, as I get put into 5.7 matches when Im only 4.7, PLEASE WORK ON THIS!! Game might take hours and hours of grinding, maybe when your bored join some custom modes and have fun. Overall 10/10"
11651,great game
11652,if you enjoy tanks or planes you would love this game. I don't recommend playing this game if you enjoy your own sanity. solid 7/10 would get upteird again.
11653,PAIN
11654,"Gun go BRAP!!!, only one person is happy after that"
11655,"Tried this game for awhile, sucks if you play American tanks. The game prides itself on ammo/ hit mechanics, and tank realism,,,,, bullshit. Don't waste your time or your money. BTW I WAS a tanker for 8 years,  nothing in this game is accurate, trust me, you hit a tank in the side at 500 yrds with a 90 MM gun, its done. Not in this game though."
11656,"excelent
"
11657,"As much as the game is good, PR has been madness, compression has been rampant, multiple vehicle specs leaked by players because thats your average war thunder player, as much as this game is good, nothing stops it from making you mad because of gaijin's stupid decisions with BR compression and changes, if they listened to the community even just a little bit the game would be decent."
11658,If you can get past all the bs and grinding its a fun game. Recommend you play with friend. 1000 times better with one.
11659,look like Nikita
11660,"its a fun game if you enjoyplanes
"
11661,"i love this because of two things one you can do one battle in a new thing and be good and not take days to learn it also is a great game for teamwork the way you can play hyper cross platform is amazing, but my  only problem is that i cant play with my friend who is an Xbox player"
11662,I mean.. Its alright.
11663,Attack the D point!
11664,"its fun to play and has a semi-realistic feel as far as video games are concerned. The tier/rank system is a bit confusing and the match making can be a bit wonky, but both are better than other tank games I have played."
11665,"amazing

11681,"Great game for those whom find tanks and planes awesome. 
"
11682,"one of the worst games I have ever played. I recommend never downloading this soul sucking demon masquerading as a ""free"" video game.  Its pay to win and very grindy with the only fun tiers being the first two and after that it turns into a hellhole. Overall 10/10 I do not regret my life decisions."
11683,.
11684,"I desperately want this game to be better than it is, but it has all the stuff I hate in free to play games done quite badly. It could be worse, but it could certainly be a hell of a lot better. It's really too bad, because its the only real competition to World of Tanks (which I refuse to support for personal reasons, though from what I've seen, the creators of this game have their own shady side, so they're little better) and I very much want a nice, realistic tank/fighter sim with combined arms warfare that isn't Battlefield because I like my big tough vehicles that can knock over houses more than running around with a gun.

1) The loot boxes are trash. 
I have never once recieved a tank from them. Most of the time, I recieve orders, the most impotent and disappointing idea in a game ever. Sometimes I get free upgrades or backup vehicles, but never once something worthwhile.

2) The prices are too damn high
Too much stuff is whale priced. Many tanks cost as much as a brand new premium AAA game or more on the stupid marketplace, and there are too many that are marketplace exclusive for no reason other than they probably make more money selling outside of Steam. And there, some of them can cost hundreds. Unless you can gurantee me at least 12 hours of entertainment from it (ie a full expansion or at least a bundle of 3+ vehicles), I refuse to pay more than 5-10 dollars for any in-game anything ever. Also, some of these are reskins of vehicles with no difference other than a fancy new coat of paint. Fuck off.

3) Orders are pathetic
In theory, the ability to issue an order to your team to change the flow of the battle or how they fight for a reward should be a major boon, allowing you to demand your team to do something critical or make a battle play totally different mid-way through. But instead they're useless filler for actual rewards. I've never seen anybody actually change the way they fight due to an order because nearly all of them are just ""kill some enemies"" with slightly different fine print. I'd rather see ones that can completely reverse a battle if a team is getting steamrolled, like calling in a playable airstrike with AI controlled escort fighters or AI backup bombers auto-targeting the enemy, an extra potent artillery strike from a battleship that effects a wider area for longer, or summoning a neutral tank that's 1-2 BR higher, that both sides would have to contend with or team up against. Better if these types of boons could only be used if there's a clear major difference in team performance, and maybe give some free respawns to make things more interesting for everyone. Or maybe changing the objective mid-battle, to force everyone to shift their focus and position.

4) Progression is too slow
It gets much worse as you go on, as research point requirements scale up as you progress, causing progress to slow down to a crawl unless you play in very specific ways. Just remove the scaling of research points from the trees and make most vehicles cost roughly the same. It can take many hours to unlock a single new vehicle, which is stupid because there are soooo many spread across all the nations, especially between ground and air forces.

5) Turn the damn voice chat back on and loosen the text chat limits already
Chat has been heavily restricted ever since the war started, because the devs don't want to be accused of taking sides or something despite the fact that it makes it extremely difficult to coordinate with a matchmaking team. You can only send one text message per minute, and if you send it too early, the timer resets. There's also many messages that you can only send once very 30 seconds, including ones you may need to use several times in a row, like marking multiple enemies when you're surrounded and need help.

6) Why is so much tied to tier 3?
Some modes and functions are only allowed if you have reached tier 3 with at least one or more countries, the worst offender being the wager mode, the only way to make a decent amount of money, already having the caveat of it being a risk, but also you need to have a tier 3 vehicle. Also all but one of the daily missions require tier 3s, for each class of vehicle. I've played 200 hours and have zero tier 3s, mostly because I try and play each country roughly equally. Also I don't want to keep playing the same tanks over and over and over and over. I want variety, so I'm not gonna just grind one country. Tier 3 takes forever to reach. Just please remove that requirement from at least wagers and the daily missions.

This game could be awesome, between the realism of the vehicles, the way their movement is tied to physics and the functionality of the vehicle (i.e. having a track disabled causes you to spin in one direction in a tank, having an engine disabled in a plane causes you to just be unable to use it to accelerate, either forcing you into a glide or making you lean/spiral, leading to you learning real-ish world flight physics and tank piloting tactics such as conservation of energy in dogfights and hulldown maneuvers. But it's plagued by some of the worst stuff gaming has to offer. I'd ask you to fix it, but you won't. Because why make the majority of your players happy so they all want to spend money to support you when you can abuse a handful of neurodivergent people with predilections to gambling addictions and impulse buying to relieve the stress of their lives who will spend way more money until they're penniless?"
11685,"Strongly suggest you avoid this game.  Any ""positives"" far outweigh the negatives, so I'll outline the issues:

Almost every aspect of this game is unbalanced.  Such as...
- Late '40s/early '50s jets will be placed in matches with more advanced jets with A/A missiles.  
- Every tier of vehicle (air, ground, naval) will be mismatched.  You'll find yourself frequently stomped on by upper tiers.
- Many vehicles, especially the premium paid ones, are ridiculously out of balance and the developer doesn't care.

Economy suffers from late-life game development that has gone so far off track there is no easy fix.  Such as:
- Tier 4 and higher you'll lose money, forcing you down to lower tiers just to make money.  But once you do, you'll barely earn Silver Lions (in-game currency) and be forced to grind for days just to save up enough for the next vehicle.
- Repair costs are insanely out of control and only meant to force players into the grind or to pay for Silver Lions.
- Research grind for upper tiers is so crazy it's obvious the developers intent is to make you spend money to speed it up.  Without a Premium Account, you'll spend weeks (if not months) trying to get to the latest vehicle.   Even with Premium, you'll grind over and over again in the same unbalanced matches.  Frustration will be high.  It's become a running joke in the community.  ""Gaijin Frustration.""

Developer is based in Eastern Europe but is openly Russian.  They were caught purposely giving Russian vehicles combat advantages.  They (and many of the Shrill supporters) claim this isn't true, but go into any Realistic match with a US vehicle (especially Air or Ground) and watch antiquated T-tanks stomp modern M1 Abrams.  Or MiG-15's run circles around an F-86, which actually out-ran and out-gunned early MiGs in real life.  You'll find yourself losing over and over again while the Russian team crushes.  None of it is based on reality and clearly there is bias from the developer.

There's many more issues than this.  Bottom line: Avoid this at all costs.  Don't fall for it because it's ""free.""

11686,game is not working it keeps saying disk write error wahetever i do it does not fix the problem. ever seens the update patch my game doesnt work anymore.
11687,rage inducing
11688,fun when you get more then one tank or ship but it takes about 20 minutes or less. also you need to look vary carefully in ground battles for an enemy.

11693,"I would recommend and not recommend this game at the same time.
War thunder can be a really fun game but there are a lot of things that are bad about it.

I will not talk about premium and credit making but the overall the economy of the game is quite healthy.
The game is grindy but not that much. It is quite easy to grind and go through the tiers.

If you want to play this game for fun grind some historical known tanks you can do that and have a blast.
And it is what i would recommend anyone to do with this game.
You can do that as a free to play player and buy paying as well. They are both equally doable.

I would not invest my time and play this game seriously.
This is my personal opinion.

This game does not have a high skill cap and it is not a competitive game.
There  are mechanics to learn and there is a curve.
Games like world of tanks for example are. You have statistics that matter a lot there.

There are some really big problems in War Thunder that make it really bad and toxic to play.
                                                                -MAPS
The maps are just bad. The rotations for the tier you are at are not well thought.
For example i can play with a low tier vehicle and play at a map that is made for high tiers.
Every map has a distance per square you see  on the map. And many times you just end up driving for most of the time. The maps are way too many as well and variations of them exist as well. 

                                                 -How the maps are played
The maps are not well thought there are many maps that are unbalanced and no real way of how you can push or flank has been thought off. They are way too big and in general you cannot do anything to push or flank. You have no options. Yeah they are very well designed aesthetically but that's about it. You can look at world of tanks maps and how they are designed.
There are positions and counter positions as well as opportunities to push and play the game so you can win.
War thunder doesnt have that.

Also there is way too much foliage. Bushes trees and the maps are so condensed with them that you cant see anything. You cant knock a tree down and use it as cover as well it disapears so your tank is exposed either way. They dont provide any realistic cover and shooting through them most of the time becomes just a hussle and annoying. You cannot see enemies as well and shoot them. Also spotting in this game could be so much more but it is very badly designed but that is another conversation to be had.

                                         -Spawn camping and cheesy spots.
This game has a huge problem with spawn killers, seal clubbers and campers.
You have people that  fly around the map and know a position or 2 to spawn kill you and make the game unplayable. This happens on every map and it is just bad. This is a byproduct of how the maps are designed. Cheesy hill positions or out of the map areas that you can go to that normally you shouldn't be able to.
This game has a lot of seal clubbers way too many that take advantage of that.


There is killcam. In a game such  as war thunder where some times where you are matters when you kill somoene they can see basically where you are. This leads to people target killing you in planes and in tanks in general. Another massive problem this game has is that it includes Planes in tank battles. Attack planes and bombers. People when they die they go in their planes and spawn kill tanks, bomb around the map constantly and there is zero counteplay. There are antiair (SPAA's) but they just die to planes way to easily
and they are not effective at all.

There is a huge gap between how easy it is to fly a plane shoot at the top of the tank and kill it and actually being able to couterplay that. There is no counterplay and it is just toxic because people will target you over and over just because you killed them. 
There isnt a only tank battle mode as well. Airplane fighters have their own game mode but ground vehicles dont get their own and it seems totally stupid and possibly just a money grabbing attempt to buy bombing premiums and attack fighters for people that just dont want to grind for Aviation of that country.
In sort you can take a number of tanks and planes in your lineup meaning 5 slots to fill and that is only for that country.

Another gameplay issue i see is that some tanks and countries get up-tiered when they shouldnt. 
Tanks being at higher battle ratings when they shouldnt be.
There are nations that are too good at certain tiers.

I am a world of tanks player and i decided to play this game for fun because my friends play it a lot.
I am extremely good at world of tanks and i decided to take a little break and try it out. Put this argument about which one is the better game to rest on my mind at least.

TLDR. If you want a highly skilled and competitive tank game that has stats that matter play world of tanks the game is not easy at all to pick up learn and be consistent at it you will also have to pay a lot of money to actually play the game and many people cannot afford to do that.
IF you want to have some fun and play casually not spend a lot of money basically none at all play War Thunder.

Both games are Unique but world of tanks in my opinion is more flushed out more polished and just better in every way. Overall play war thunder if you like but beware that people are extremely selfish and that  the gameplay is toxic.

I kept this sort i could write in detail about this game forever but there is no point.

The graphics are pretty good for the most part. However there are a view glitches with some of the graphic settings like Vsync, Vsync on Warthunder has a habbit of glitching you out. Don't come to Warthunder for the graphics but don't leave because of them either.

                                                                                  9/10 Gameplay
Warthunder in my opinion has the best gameplay since Bo2. The pure factor of not having to go against planes 9x better than yours and fair fights against everyone really lights the game up. I would give it a 10/10 but you do have to do quite a bit of grinding to get the really good planes.

                                                                                    8/10 Mechanics 
Very few glitches and bugs. Very Nice Controls. Great flying and driving. Even better gun play. 0 complaints from my end.

This game is good, and has many enjoyable moments.

Unless you have a love for the vehicles themselves, or just generally prefer playing most multiplayer games alone I think most will only get the full experience out of this game with a group to play it with.

11756,"[h1] PAY TO WIN. [/h1]

[h1] Unbalanced [/h1]

- WWII tanks fight against cold war tanks and/or armament.
- grass balls with tracks (grass is pay to use, so again, pay to win).
- poorly designed maps that allow players to spawn camp.
- tanks are defenseless against planes.
- SPAA need LUCK to kill, not skill, you may hit the plane but that's what you'll get, ""HIT"".
- console players have wallhack and aimbot embedded ingame.
- when you get up tiered you can't do almost anything else than quit, and you'll get your tanks blocked for ~6 minutes.
- poor AI and the team is almost always full of bots, bots that just stay there watching you get killed by an 1.0 tank, let it run around the spawn, go commit suicide at the enemy spawn when game's still in an early phase, without the team having control of any of the points.

[h1] Bugged as hell [/h1]

- invisible tanks, you may see a tank, aim at it and see how it just boils out, it still there, so if you don't shoot you'll get clapped.
- shells that somehow just pass through the enemy and hit the ground behind him, without giving you even the infamous ""HIT"".
- poor servers. packet loss high as Snoop Dog, and you'll see when it crashes, it just send you to the lobby and block your tanks for ""quitting"".

[h1] Broken economy and grinding [/h1]
if you're a casual player who likes tanks, once you reach middle battle rate (5.7/6.3) you will spend at least 6 months grinding for the next tanks, and it doesn't end there, each match you cant participate because you got killed by a pay to win grassball heavy tank, you'll lose in-game currency, making it hard as fuck to even pay for those new shiny tanks that you grinded for so much time. 


[h1] Conclusion. [/h1]

don't play this game, I'd quit it if I wasn't addicted to those dopamine shots when you kill another player in an awesome way.
you'll suffer and the only way of having fun is ruining someone else's day.

11870,"(Review will be updated over time)

I would like to go in some depth about my experience with this game that should clear up for a lot of people why I gave this game a negative review. For many players who HAVE played War Thunder, you already know what's about to be said here.

I'm gonna be honest you guys, this game used to be so fun back then. It's take such a huge fall in the last 2 years that at this point it's a lost cause. As of about 1 week ago from the time I'm writing this, I have uninstalled the game. This is not too many days after hearing of the F-14 being announced. This right here is where I have one of the biggest issues that I will cover now.

New Vehicles, no fixes:
Now, War Thunder lately as most of the player-base knows has been adding a lot of vehicles that game is quite frankly not ready for. Even the player-base themselves admits to this, as I have literally gone into multiple matches and asked about what people thought about it. One person said (not in their exact words) ""Wonderful how they won't fix bugs and balance vehicles, but they'll add a new vehicle like nothing.""

What Gaijin doesn't seem to understand, or at this point doesn't want to acknowledge, is that this game is far from ready for the vehicles it's been adding these last 2 years or so. Let me paint a picture for you if you are a bit lost.

(Many people who remember the Harrier release will remember this)
Think about this: A Harrier GR.1, a Jump Jet aircraft that was developed in the mid 60's. Very capable aircraft.
On the release of this plane, it was put up against KOREAN WAR era aircraft.
An aircraft from 1947 fighting against one from the 1960's. Doesn't make sense at all, right?

That's War Thunder.
This is a big example of what happens whenever a mainstream military vehicle gets released. This process will continue to repeat every single time. The F-104 did it, the English Electric Lightning did it, the Harrier did it, and so on and so forth.

I've read some of the other reviews here, and the amount of negatives vs positives are not very promising at all
""It is unrewarding, unfun, unfair and, most of all not worth anyone's time.""
To be honest, I could go on about how trashy this game has become. 
I'll let the rest of the negative reviews do the rest of the talking for me.

I will no longer be playing this game anymore. It's a waste of my time.
I'm only keeping it on my library out of some desperate hope that it will get better, but...
If this game doesn't show anymore improvement (Which it likely wont at this rate), I will be removing it from my account.

Stay the fuck away from this game. Please.

Edit 6/29/22: Danger Zone Update.

So from the videos I've seen from other content creators of War Thunder, its not looking too good.
The F-14 seems as broken as I thought it would be upon launch.
It's been said that this update has broken so many things that it has made the game practically unplayable.
Upon launch, the game experienced graphical glitches (Not too unusual for this game tbh) and in some cases for ground RB, I hear that tanks sound effects have been broken to the point where certain vehicles can sneak up behind someone and you wont hear a sound. I have not played the game by this point, so what you're reading right now is just observations from other players' experience.

Speaking of Ground RB, I should cover the issue I've had with that in my personal experience.

It's so broken. It drove me mad with how many times I've had good vehicles get nerfed into oblivion, the armor penetration is extremely inconsistent, overpressure is buggy as all hell, etc.
I'll get really specific with my experience.

Some of you who have played war thunder long enough may have heard of the Sherman Jumbo (76). A decent tank that was moved up to 6.3 a few updates back. What this would mean for this tank is that it would face kingtigers more often, and on top of that; tanks with HEATFS (Which showed up a lot).
This wouldnt be so bad if the Kingtiger variant you were facing was a (P) model, the variant with a round mantle that serves as the ONLY weakspot against a 76mm. That was not the case.

Most of the battles I've had in against a Kingtiger whilst in a Jumbo Sherman was the (H) variant; the Kingtiger that can't be penetrated from the front whatsoever unless you have a *100mm* sized cannon or bigger.
I can only assume that the wehraboos complained enough about not being able to pen the damn thing to the point where gaijin just decided to solve the issue by putting it in a spot where it had no chance. 

More importantly about this ""rant"" if you will; thanks to uptiers, 6.3 immediately equals 6.7-7.0, so trying to have fun in this tank is virtually impossible because everything you'll be facing will slap the everloving shit out of you before you can even do anything useful. 6.7 is already a nightmare in itself too, so good luck having fun there.

-------

I remember a time where War Thunder used to have historically accurate matchups in terms of countries fighting each other. It used to be the standard Allied vs. Axis combat in RB, ground and air. Now it's just a hot fucking mess where you'll get matched up with Germany on the same team as America.
And don't bother about BR decompression, because the reason Gaijin won't do anything about that is the same reason why they removed historical matchups. 

""It WiLl MaKe QuEuE TiMeS ToO LoNg""

So what?! If it means the game I'm waiting for will be FUN and FAIR then I don't mind waiting a bit. It's such a half-assed excuse for something that could probably change the game for the better.

Did you know that the bombers still have placeholder cockpits that haven't been replaced with actual cockpits since they were supposedly first added to the game? But they'll add a new mainstream overhyped aircraft like its nothing. Says a lot, doesn't it?

Okay, I'm done for now. I'm gonna keep tabs on this."
11871,"basically what it feels like to be in top gun
 10/10"
11872,"At first I didn't enjoy this game at all because  would play for the grind and to unlock the next or newest tank and that was my fun. But later as I got older I find this game alot more enjoyable when I personally sit down and research each vehicle that i play, the historical meaning and really just have fun with what I'm playing right now. everyone wants to make it far enough into the tech tree to get their ""dream tank"", but find it grueling, I find if you make every tank your dream tank and treat all of them like that, for me atleast it helped me enjoy the game. Execpt for the t 26 75mm that thing sucks"
11873,:D
11874,My money is gone aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
11875,"A very fun game with a mixed community, sure the game maybe a little rough to noobs and fps players but get the hang of this game and you're definitely going to enjoy this game and it's community. P.S. get used to the phrase ""Git Gud"" or any variation of it because it's going to be shown A LOT. :)"
11876,i just test fly the planes
11877,"Amazing game, really fun aviation aspect"
11878,you have to commit but its fun
11879,Pay to win
11880,"Pay to do most things. Fine at the start but garbage past 5.0
Basically pay to play
expensive
waste of time"
11881,"i hate this game so much that i can't keep playing and in a sense, it is like crack"
11882,Its a pretty fun game. I would recomend if you like world war vehicle. It also has some good mechanics
11883,"Overall good experience, lots of other vacuums on the market but this one is the best by far."
11884,"There should be a support group for players of this game.  I've heard it said that War Thunder is the game you're almost allowed to have fun with and it's 100% true.  The frustration and emotional damage wrought by War Thunder is a war crime in itself.  You get just enough non-BS matches to keep you hooked while Gaijin panders to select groups just to milk more money from them.

Every vehicle you research just brings you further up the frustration ladder and it doesn't get better until you reach near the top.  Until then?  Well, prepare your hind quarters for an almighty violation.  Unlock a WW2 era tank?  That's ok, you'll be facing Cold War era gear.  Your mighty 1942 heavy tank will be strapped down over and over again by HEAT-FS rounds not developed for 10 years.  Got yourself a brand new, shiny jet?  Don't worry, you'll be fighting other planes outfitted with guided air to air missiles.

To make it even better, you're required to either pay lions (the in game currency) or wait to repair your vehicle.  The costs of those repairs are *supposedly* based on the effectiveness of the vehicle but there are patterns evident that rule that out.  For instance, planes with no guided munitions will cost more than a plane just a step above it that can erase you from existance with nothing more than an afterthought.  But that plane a step above will be half the price.

The game mechanics that sounded so cool when you first read about them?  Just another avenue of frustration.  Volumetric rounds, for instance, are great until they're not.  Theoretically, the rounds have an actual volume, instead of just being the exact pixel you aimed at.  Actually, it's not even that, the exact pixel that Gaijin's screwed up mechanics decided that the round actually went.  That round has volume, but only most of the time.  Sometimes, rounds that should have bounced off due to the armor (if they were truly volumetric) just magically go right through.  

When you're not dealing with that, you'll be dealing with magic glass that eats every bit of a tank round or pilots being ""knocked out"" with a frequency that defies logic.  Probably 90% of my deaths in a plane are because the pilot was knocked out.  Doesn't matter what kind of maneuvers you're doing or the range you're at.  Gaijin decides the moment that round is fired whether it hits and nothing you do matters in that.  

And don't even start on the crew levels.  Until you've nearly maxed them out (a process that *requires* real money, FYI), they're near useless.  Want to turn?  Hope you've coughed up for the Golden Eagles (currency paid for with real money) to skill them up, otherwise, they'll black out almost instantly.  It gets worse too.  Haven't maxed out that tank crew yet?  Hope you like being killed by invisible tanks hiding behind what amounts to a stick because your crew's spotting skill wasn't high enough.  

Every once in a while though, you'll have a good match.  One where you get paired up with vehicles that are near enough to your own to make it fun and when the almighty RNG-esus smiles upon you, granting your vehicles some semblance of normal performace.  It's just enough to keep you playing but it'll destroy your sanity in the process."
11885,p
11886,"This game is very frusturating at times, and very rewarding at others."
11887,"Very fun game to get into the amount of tanks there are is amazing i have played way more than 7 hours because i did not use steam. The German, Soviet and American tech trees i would highly suggest although Japan is also fun."
11888,i hate this game
11889,i joined a match saw a retard wit ha funny tank and shit my balls. 10/10 expirience would suck mega gay balls again
11890,Cool tanks!1 i blow YOU UP IMGONNABLOWUUP btich!!!!!!!!!!!! got boring after 100 hours tbh but it's worth the hours if you got mates to play with it's so much fun when you coopoerate!!!!!!!!!!!!! amaizng game for FREE!!!!!
11891,its not good
11892,Grindfest with the UI made by 5 Y.O with heavy autism...
11893,game dumb
11894,"have a few hours and in this state... no, cant recommend it, they really need to fix the flickering in the graphics, after that... then maybe i can recommend and they surely need to listen to the community"
11895,My husband played and I just wanted to try it... now I can't stop. It's so much fun even if I hate getting killed so fast. LOL
11896,It's still Almost fun but hey we'll all praise the snail god anyway.
11897,"good game
"
11898,great game
11899,You didn't have to cut me off told me that im worthless that don't I mean nothing you know I don't even need your love
11900,i like it
11901,"fun
"
11902,greed
11903,Fun game to start testing the waters with VR Flight
11904,It takes a little bit of grinding but its a fun game.
11905,"Unbalanced piece of sh!t game.

Was an american tier 1 tank against a german tier 1 tank,
shot the guy like 7 times on weakspots (green cursor), and failed to take him out, guy get's a chance to shoot me and explodes my munition with 1 shot. 
Absolute bullsh!t.

Tried to give WT a chance but,
WoT is by far a superior game over this. (10 year player on it)"
11906,"Game's fun but they need to fix a lot, not even mechanically speaking. Russian vehicles have literal code to react differently than every other tank in the game, while being grossely overpowered, 80% of your time spent playing will be wondering how a company can get away with trying to force such a disgusting expectation of making you pay for stuff with real money. They don't even try to remotely cover it up, and nothing you say/do will make them change. The game can be fun at times but more often than not you'll curse yourself out for continuing to play it. I've spent well around $600 on this game and I genuinely regret it."
11907,Good
11908,It is fun and all. but I keep getting killed by planes wish there was a mode with just tanks and no planes
11909,The vr mode is kinda cool but overall kinda avarage.
11910,"good game
"
11911,virgin play this game
11912,Playing this game is like committing your life to a relationship except the girl hates you and at every moment non-stop beats you with a cricket bat
11913,this game is so cool I wish it was real.
11914,Should've side climbed lol
11915,"This ""game"" if you could even call it that is one of the worst pay to win game on steam the fact that you could pay to have advantage over your opponents just shows you what type of game this is. It also dose not help that enemy's will target you just based on what faction you play. Also the amount of overpowered planes is just amazing mostly every plane for the Americans is overpowered as fuck witch brings me to my next point. The fact some factions have such under powered planes like the USSR with only has a few planes worth commenting to but the rest are just down right dog shit. Thank you Gaijin for blessing us with this piece of dog shit game."
11916,yes
11917,a-10 users should die in a fire
11918,Good Game
11919,Horrible fucking game
11920,"If you enjoy watching an X-Ray of your bullets spraying and hitting the enemy crew inside their tank but not actually doing anything, and then getting 1 shot by that person you just shot; this is the game for you!

I've never seen such a noob-unfriendly game in my life where no matter how hard you try or upgrade your vehicle, you will shoot cotton balls at your enemies while they shoot molten rounds of death straight through your armour :D (oh unless you get amazingly lucky and a single piece of shrapnel somehow magically splinters off and hits a magic ammo case that isn't even visible or marked and their entire vehicle explodes!)"
11921,fun
11922,"Pain, misery and suffering guranteed.

Praise the snail."
11923,if you want to sell ur soul
11924,"Very Good Gema
"
11925,pasta medie
11926,No.
11927,"i hope you like getting 1 shot, ricochets, and slow repair times, also p2w camo"
11928,"The game needs to be fixed, with no premium and getting into a battle low tier or high doesn't matter either way cause either way the team get steam rolled hard no matter what you do. Like having the A10A you rush in the zone cause one, these planes are slow and cant do anything else but ground clear.  yes they are good at maneuvering in a dog fight cause they are slow and have a wide wing stance and all that.  but half the time you die so fast its not even fun playing the game, cause the maps are tiny and everyone rushes the middle there is no planning or team work at all in this game unless you group up or find someone. yes its a good plane shooter but half the time nothing works, like videos of people flying with broken wings and shot up planes leaking oil and gas. That rarely ever happens ever and if you do make it after what ever dog fight that broke your plane, you end up do flying to the base to repair and someone else sees you and shoots you down before you even get close to landing back at your base again to repair. only fast planes make it back for the most part. And low and higher tier planes are expensive on repair costs. my american tier line every jet i own is broke and cant be repaired, cause 1 its expensive to repair anything with out premium which is dog water in my opinion cause the people who don't want premium get screwed over hard.  This is a pay to win cause they have premium planes and tanks and boats and helis and so on. plus an open market gaijinn market place as well. like i said its hard to win and enjoy this game cause of people. people do dirty stuff clearly. like everyone head on head dog fighting is trash that's all people do to  each other, and then the f4c mine for some reason doesn't have counter measures why not that is stupid maybe i gotta unlock them, but flying the f4c is trash as well as  high tier planes, like someone always has a missle lock on me and i cant do crap to escape. Cause no counter measures, like i even look up videos of the planes i fly to Gage what im doing wrong and nothing helps. i will not support in buying a premium account when i can't even survive and make in game money with out a premium account that makes no sense and that's why i will not buy it. Changes need to be made on the game play and the maps and some jets not even having counter measure to defend themselves.  And im sure there is even more wrong with the game that more people can elaborate on that, but not fun in my opinion to a point where im always out of money cause you die fast thats dumb. who wants to play a game where you just die as soon as you see the first jet or person coming your way. Its a steam roll of a game every time."
11929,"hee hee tenk go brr
"
11930,"game is really grindy, takes forever to even get past the first few tiers which are really boring so don't count on having fun until you reach the 75 hour mark"
11931,"Very fun, recommended if you like skill, strategy, and action."
11932,haha i will never have children
11933,"Well, after over 1,500 hours in the game and reaching 11.0 in America. I feel qualified to write a review about the game.
General playing:
First off, it's a grind. However, if you set yourself a goal and identify a tank/Aircraft you really want to aim for, it's achievable.
Since the disabling and reintroducing of the chat under stricter rules, it is much more friendly.
I'm unsure how to feel about all tanks being able to repair each other now. It does help in making it a bigger teamwork experience. However, it's lessened the role taking of a scout tank/player.
Artillery strikes seem to hit everywhere except for you or the enemy player, but when it does land... glorious.
Overall, the general day to day playing of this game is very enjoyable if you are into your vehicles. You'll find yourself get mad for 5 minutes, alt-tab, watch a YouTube video and then be back for more.

Updates and Patches:
I have to say, Gaijin are very proactive with Patching and releasing exciting new content. Every few months we have a new battlepass and a update with new vehicles. They have done a great job in moulding the game to create new, fun ways to play.
With the introduction of realistic bomb craters to shape the landscape, bulldozer blades to move the ground for protection and soon, napalm to demolish areas of trees.
There's been a fantastic gradient of releasing modern vehicles and we are continually getting a taste of new technology.

Overall:
As an overall, i'd recommend this game to everyone to at least try.
It isn't going to suit you all, the grind is real and without premium you can double the timescales.
But, for someone into mechanicals, the x-ray shots of tanks and damage models are great.
IF... you look past the odd ""that should/shouldn't of penned!!!"" moments.
I've enjoyed with friends, made new ones and loved experiencing tanks through the years.
There will always be moments in this game you will become frustrated, as with any game. But... it's worth the grind.

My tips for new starters:
Map knowledge and vehicle knowledge is KEY! If you get killed by something or struggle to kill, go back to the hangar bring up the damage model and see where to shoot or how to angle your tank. Over the years, this has become ever more important!
Look forward to seeing you on the field!"

11944,its good
11945,"Not bad for a free game,not a pay to win,though it does have good camo and decals for your tanks/planes if you choose to go for things like that. It's based around your skill set no matter what your flying or driving,have fun with it,pick it up and have a jam...costs you nothing."

11953,One of the game I ever see
11954,So an update: I've played an additional 20 hours and i am still trying to research all my modifications for my top tier jet. Crazy! Some of this stuff i have to research is as much research as a Tier 2 & 3 Plane! So unless you want to not touch grass just leave this game be. FYI this game can be very fun with friends but not fun cuz of the grind.
11955,"I like tanks, I hate KA-50s.   If you are poor, you will hate this game. 
 Russian Bias but deal with it, its fun kicking Russias ass in this game. My favorite part about this game is that the Russian players suck and are easy to kill.       Because Russia is dumb and weak,   the dumb dumb developers who are Russian btw,   gives the Russians unrealistic, bull-crap helicopters that KILL Top Tier Game play......... . The Russian players are terrible because they rely on their OP vehicles.....  but the Tanks, Jets, and  helicopters the Russians have in this video game are awesome."

11962,"dont play it alone you friking dumb ass play it with your best friends and dont say omg nooo i dont have friends cunny :<
good game after all"
11963,"Ranking up via the tech tree in this game is an issue. Most free-to-play players quit around tier 5 and often become crippled by repair costs. The game is amazing but suffers from greedy game devs. You'd be lucky to reach the top of a tech tier in any nation within a year. The gam essentially cripples players for playing.  The marketing for this game is even worse, they advertise top-tier vehicles and get new players excited to play these cool cold war esc planes and tanks. yet no one will reach them. Some of these tier 5 tanks can be crazy in cost as well. you have to pay for the tank, repair costs, a crew, training the crew, etc. Im going to stop playing the game and move to another cause the game wasn't what it was advertised as, but if you like these realistic war games give it a try. I love it, I just don't want to grind the game this much. I have a love-hate relationship with this game."
11964,"This is my second account before the game came to steam. Did I enjoy the game? Yes. Do I think people should get the game and play it? Yes, but only till you get to RB 4.0. After that the economy screws you over. Unless you are getting 3-4 kills a game, scouting and capturing points. You will go into negative lions. Air RB is even worse. You get shot down in your 6.7 jet at the beginning of the match. There goes around 25,000 lions. Fun game in short bursts and with friends. Very heavy on the grinding. Play at your own risk."
11965,i have 69 hours played
11966,extremely fun
11967,"""Pilot knocked out""

Enjoy seeing that message when doing air battles, because you're going to see that a lot. You can unload a maelstrom of bullets into the enemy plane and maybe get a critical hit, but they always take out your pilot with 3 shots maximum. 

Also, enjoy wasting hundreds of hours grinding away at this game for vehicles that may be worth or not worth the time it took to get them. This time can of course be cut down by showing the game your bank account, but surely you're not a whale, right?

Don't get the battle pass unless you have rank II and III vehicles, otherwise you won't make any progress in it as battle tasks require you to use vehicles of a certain rank to complete them. This means you're going to be SOL as a new player with nothing but the worst rank I vehicles to start with. 

This game is a painful experience that will have you utilizing the Alt-F4 function multiple times on a daily basis.

But I don't hate the game. In fact, I get enjoyment from it. The grind process is pure tedium but you can genuinely have fun games that can make it all worthwhile. 

I would recommend this game in the end. It's definitely not for everyone, but it works for me."
11968,its cool i guess

11976,"It is a good game with one of a kind graphics, but to actually get good tanks,planes and boats you really need to grind, or spend some money (a lot of money)."

11979,"Did you hear about Johny Depp and Amber Heard marriage life ?
If you haven't just play this game to know how Johny perspective is
The time to grind is as long as Johny's marriage
The pain is perhaps the same if not more
11/10 will play again to pay respect to Johny Depp (After overcoming my depression since uninstalling this game after I rage quit after I got a long streak of terrible game)"
11980,I love the game the combat is very fun and there is so much choice in the vehicles you use
11981,Good game

11983,"War Thunder is a really fun game, though there are definitely things to keep in mind *before* you play. 
1.) War Thunder is not realistic. It tries to simulate realistic damage as best it can, but the system for that is extremely simplified and rather bad.
2.) War Thunder is fairly pay-to-win. Premium vehicles out-perform free ones more often than not. This is also taking into account using premium currency to add bushes that act as actual camouflage, buying all your crew upgrades immediately and not having to grind to make your crew better, skipping vehicle progression, and earning RP and SL being fairly slow without a premium account to the point that you will reasonably struggle to get enough SL to purchase new vehicles and train crews for them at the same rate that you research a new vehicle.
3.) You probably will learn that it's better not to play back-to-back. With the amount of SL earned having been decreased recently and vehicles needing to be repaired for SL that you earn, it is possible to lose in-game currency while playing unless you turn off auto-repair. Unless you're also upgrading your crew using real money, a tier 3 tank (out of 7 tiers) can take longer than 24 hours to repair.

Overall, War Thunder is not really free-to-play. If you want to experience the game fully, you kind of have to fork up some cash or play amazingly well which just isn't going to be a given for new players."

11994,will kill you mentaly fun game tho
11995,"I would not recomend this game, yes it is fun at first, but my friend is literally addicted to it, he has spent over 1,000 dollars on it this game is pay to win, the grind is far too hard in every single way, not really much to do with your vehicles but go into battles to unlock more vehicles, etc."
11996,this is so realistic and it was like when i was in a war. it help me relias you can you can come over your fear if you put your mid to it.
11997,"I really cant tell if this game is a curse or a blessing. Ever since I started I've loved and hated this game and the rabbit hole of hell only grew deeper. But at the same time I've noticed that this game does one thing really well, it makes you work really hard to get what you want. Most sane people don't want to spend a month straight grinding for a reward that's not that great. I agree with them but then this game does something that is hated by the community. People in the community hate others that ""Pay To Win"" in other words, buying top tier stuff in order to skip the grind. Now another problem with this game would be that it does not have very balanced stuff in all tiers of tanks and planes which makes it hard to play and especially frustrating for old and new players which is why this game is dying. I would only recommend this game to someone who is willing to grind, keep their cool, and willing to learn how to play the game well. If you are none of those then I WOULD NOT get the game. Sure it may say it's free but trust me you will find yourself paying to win and if you do not then you will stop playing the game. As someone who has play hundreds of hours of this game I can confidently say that this game needs work and is only for the most level headed gamers of this world."

12003,"I would highly recommend this game to any and all aviation, tank, and or/ warship enthusiasts out there. There is something for everyone who likes these type of games, and there are competitive and casual game modes as well as special game modes for PvE type battles. I have always had a great interest in machines of war from all time periods and have loved to learn more about them in such an immersive game where physics and mechanics actually exist."

12024,"This game takes too much to grind, only fun ranks are tier 1,2 and sometimes 3. After that the reward is pathetic and repair costs too much. Literally cannot be arsed to spend a months on end grinding for one tank at higher rank only to get slaughtered upon spawning and break the bank in repair costs. The only way to have some enjoyment is to spend money premium vehicles gain minimal profit and research. The only game mode I have enjoyed recently has been custom matches because it doesn't break the bank to play them and doesn't just instantly return you to hanger. Loved this game many years ago when it was fresh but now its too much work and money to enjoy."

12039,"Getting stuck on buildings ruin the entire game. half tracks front wheels clip through buildings, track catches a corner. I get moments where i want to play but i am constantly reminded that the games colliding physics are completely gone. rather play world of tanks only for that reason."
12040,"After having played this game for a long time (the 300hrs is wrong since I now play it without starting it on steam, so in reality maybe closer to 1000hrs by now) I want to write a review.

First of all I want to say that this game has great potential and if it were like a AAA title I could buy for like 100 bucks and that's it it would be awesome. The problem is however, that in my opinion this game is very much play to win in many different ways that in the end forces free-to-play gamers to become the product for whales sending Gaijin chunks of money.

For all of those, who are not familiar with this game: Warthunder is a game that offers the opportunity to play tanks, ships, helicopters and planes and to fight against other players in multiplayer battles with these vehicles. It offers arcade battles for those who just want to play tanks/planes/whatever but also realistic battles and simulation battles for those who want the full realisitc but also much more difficult experience. The game offers for each type of vehicle several nations and in order to play certain vehicles one needs to research these. While it is fairly easy to reach mid WW2 vehicles it takes hundreds if not thousands of hours to reseach completely research and get all vehicles of one nation and one vehicle type (e.g. tanks)


My personal problem lies not within the fact that the game becomes very grindy if one does not pay for the premium account (temporary booster in research points and money obtained), but rather two other things that majorly impact the game:

1. Premium Vehicles
2. Premium account

Let's focus on the Premium vehicles first of all. Besides the general fact having vehicles that are only accessable after paying up to 60 bucks for each, there are some clear benefits for these: 1. the repair cost is much much lower which offers to use them in a different play style than otherwise possible. Secondly they offer usually 2x money and research reward, thus speeding up the process of finishing one research tree a lot (this is prob the only thing I would accept). Some guy on reddit even made the effort to calculate how much one would have to pay to get every premium vehicle there is and got a value of around 4000$ - an insane amount. Besides this there is the premium account that gives you many benefits out of which I will only mention a few: you get more money and research points, you can choose (or disable) maps you don't want to play in multiplayer (as maps are usually chosen randomly) and you can play with more than 1 friend together (otherwise only 2 people can choose to join together a match).

So how does all this make the game unfair? The reason lies in the cost of repairs for vehicles. To illustrate with the swedish tank 103/A: To fully repair the tank (i.e. after you got shot down) you have to pay more than 9000 in game currency. For each tank you destroy you get usually around 1300 currency. Hence one either has to make sure not to die, or needs to destroy almost 7 enemy tanks wihtout dying to break even. In other words: if you have a 7-1 kill-death-ratio you still only get enough cash to continue playing the tank - there is not enough cash to buy new vehicles or anything. Hence you need to play very reserved, do not push to objectives and play from practically your base to be safe. Otherwise, you loose money and cannot play anymore (as without the money, tanks cannot be repaired and hence used in the next battle). On the other hand, the S103/0 - basically the very same tank but as premium vehicle - gives you twice as much for each destroyed tank (say 2600) but at the same time costs only 2000 to repair. You can down less than one tank per game and still make money to buy new vehicles. This means you can afford to play the game how you like it and not care that much: you can push the enemies, take objectives and actually play an active role for winning the match rather than being forced to be a side role in the back. One can also see it like this: either you are in the top 20% of players so that you can get the high kill ratios or you have to pay premium...

The same is true for premium. While it does not reduce the repair cost, it significantly increases the rewards for each kill and hence makes it possible to play vehicles with which you usually only play with a 1-1 ratio.

I would not mind if the game would only be a grinding feast for free-to-play players but otherwise the gaming experience would be identical. But how it is like this you cannot really enjoy the game as a paying player as you are forced to play the game in a very restricted manner. What needs to change is that the there is no longer such a difference in repair costs so that one can play the game how one wants to regardless of paying or not."
12041,Great Game. If you like Flying plans and Driving tanks from WW2 then this is the game your looking for it has a awesome online. with friendly people

12044,good game
12045,"This game's PVE is just as trash as it's horrid PVP arcade mode, it's completely pay to win having to pay for premium currency just to fast track unlock adjustment of fire and elevation mechanism because for some reason they think it's ok to predatory microtransaction tank accuracy. The PVE is total trash but is far better than the PVP by far where low tier tanks like the T-50 can meet a sherman VC Firefly because why not, most of your experience in PVE is idiotic players who are in low tier tanks that don't even belong at the tier or horribly outmatched vehicles at unfair battleratings just getting constantly killed by unfair AI and AI planes that never miss and always hit with laser accuracy and is totally unfair. Planes need to be remove from all assault ground maps, most people play to drive and fight tanks not your stupid garbage aircraft. Each rank of PVE is unfairly outmatched as well, want to drive a valentine against valentines at 2.3 well too bad it's a 2.7 and gets unfairly uptiered. It is laughable how absolute garbage the pvp and pve systems are for a large corporation that sits and tries to cram their stupid premium tanks down your throat by making them the top tier piece of annoying garbage that costs you the battle just because you can't even fight it. Anyone wanting a good decent play experience pvp or pve best avoid this game and stay out of it, it is nothing but a unfair predatory grind fest that will just spam kill you in PVE with dumb planes and laser accurate AI making it entirely useless to play anything other than their even worse PVP. You need to fix the PVE period, remove the planes and add battleratings specific to PVE that allows us to drive tanks against the top tier tanks we see on wave 3 and final wave and also make it to where players can remain in planes and have as many planes up as they want if you wanna sit and play your dumb little plane game of laser accurate bombs and rockets. The AI should not feel like they are using hitscan for hit detection because i have seen them miss entirely and hit the ground only to be hit by their shot anyways when i literally watched it miss, the AI also weirdly float over obstacles and spawn way too close to base for it to remotely be fair they also shouldn't be spawning in surrounding manors. Historical accuracy of the PVE is absolute utter garbage, idk in what fictional world you see over 10 Heavy Tank No.6s considering barely any where given to Japan anyways and were never used. The PVE and PVP arcade modes literally feel like they were created by someone who doesn't have a lick of sense in combat or how tank combat even works and threw together whatever garbage unfair little thing they thought players would like because they don't play the game and don't even know what a tank is. The premium vehicles need to be removed as AI, we don't care about them, being killed over and over by Chi Nu II and then trying to offer it as a 4.3 when it spawns at 3.7 is ridiculous and stupid and will only make players leave your game. The community of this game needs to hold this developer accountable and have them fix the PVE this is totally ridiculous and is causing people to avoid this game entirely or just flat out uninstall it and never come back. Tier 1 tanks need lower battle ratings to even be effective, french and italian reserve tanks literally can't fight most of the enemies in PVE because their guns are laughably bad, The M3 Lee is literally broken and is insanely overpowered now since it's been low tiered and more vehicles like the churchill I and Matillda should be 2.3 as well for PVE and do not appear as AI. Players want to feel powerful and actually have fun and don't act like the AI can't be lower tier cause it'd ruin the experience, tell that to the sherman 105 and T-50 i 1 shotted with my sherman firefly and all the other 3.7s who were pitted up against it in pvp. I'm not even going to go to the plane assault arcade it's probably the worst thing ever and is far worse compared to the tank assault, how about instead of defending a stupid base that is too big and on dumb uncovered terrain surrounded by millions of unfair laser AI we get to go and capture their base and fight a set number of enemies at our own BR. Assault arcade sounds more like fighting to take a location as the player against defending AI and that's how it should be because the current PVE experience is so wildly bad and spent losing nonstop due to ticket bleed and unfair AI with a base that is way too big for the dumb AI to easily just sit in. Ticket bleed shouldnt be as fast as it is and there really shouldn't be as many enemies it's just super tedious and annoying. The planes in general are super stupid and annoying in PVE and are totally not needed in tank assault at all especially since no one uses anti-air anyways. Removing planes entirely would make the PVE experience way better along with making the custom battle AI the actual PVE AI that are alot less accurate terminators that are overpowered even while driving at high speeds on rough terrain and literally crawling 90dgr vertically over obstacles, your AI sucks, not worth a penny on anything due to the obvious terrible free to play scam tactics. After reinstalling the game i had to play PVP matches of actual PVP modes and maps against bots only to earn PVE back and that was the best experience please make that tank assault PVE it was actually fun and enjoyable"
12046,Nice game Its fun to play but sometimes I get killed which makes me angry but the game is fun to play with fun and the graphics are really good I would recommend playing with friends and fight in the battlefield and helping you out and (finish the tutorials for the golden eagles and the silver lions)
12047,"the game is very historically accurate but to upgrade the plane  takes a long time, ive been playing for 6 months and im still in ww2 era planes."
12048,"A really fun game to play. And there is a lot to it. I only play as tanks and that is interesting enough to me but there is also the option to play as battle ships and airplanes. And tank battles and sea battles have the option to play as airplanes on the same battlefield as well.
Since you have three vehicles in tankbattles you need to be somewhat cautious, though a mistake will not necessarily ruin the battle for you. Teamwork is rewarded, and the community is generally friendly. There are tactical choices to be made, high explosive shell with little penetration, or high penetration with little damage? Finding a place with a lot of cover or surprise the enemy. A lot of cover can be negated by artillery fire though adding balance to the game.
Besides the battlefield there is also the researching of improvement of your tank which have real battlefield implications. As well as researching new vehicles for which new ones are added regularly with the recent addition of Israel as a playable faction. Adding a reason to play well.
The only downside I can find with this game is that recently it stopped working properly with Manjaro Linux, hope there will be a fix soon."

12106,"Review for base game: It's a great game for the concept, it's detailed. I personally didn't notice any bugs while playing, and otherwise a fun experience.

Review for VR: Its good in VR, but that's because the game is good on its own. The UI in VR is terrible, and I don't reccomend playing it in VR. Play it on a screen.

12110,The game is fantastic. Highly recommended from me becouse i played in t for 5 hours and i liked it the graphicsa are cool the planes are very well designed. and honestly a 9/10 game (Only played for 5 hours yet dont trust me that much)
12111,"I hate to love it so much. So grind, but still so addicting, please don't make the mistakes I made."
12112,Just a good game overall and realistic vehicles!
12113,"So planes and tanks are very fun and well crafted on the other side there are the boats....
 (just download the game and try it out)"
12114,"I gotta say no, honestly. While yes, it IS free to play, you'll get spanked by pay to win guys every time. The grind without paying for anything is insane past the first couple ranks of most countries, which ends up burning out people really badly. This is the 5th time I've tried Warthunder, accumulating over 5,000 hours between all of my accounts, and I think it's honestly gotten worse in recent years. Extremely biased towards German and Russian tech. 
    I generally fly, and its bad. Bombers, for one, are near useless if you play anything other than a certain couple in Germany or Russia. You'll be shot down before ever even getting near the battlefield. The gunners are horrid even with a maxed crew. Almost all of them fall apart at even the slightest hint of damage. Attackers are OK in some instances, but often are a near impossible grind as well if you don't actively play tanks often. They can be game changing if you get lucky, stay low, and ground pound. Flying is focused almost soley on fighters, and even then, the extreme bias is real. Good luck ever winning American or British matches past 4.0BR, Germany and Russia almost exclusively win up until the late jets available. Most other countries will depend on whether they get pitted with or against Russia and Germany. 
  I can't say much for the naval, as I've only really used it to fool around with friends. Last time I played, higher BR were generally full of ridiculously overpowered AI because there was such a small group that actually have high tier ships. 
  Tanks are fun for low br, regardless of country. Mid to high br, though, it really just turns into a cross-map shooting gallery where nobody moves past spawn. Get your first couple tiers of tanks, and never bother with the rest. 
 Helicopters... yes. I can't say, there's not even a normal match making que for them, so they're all throw into the same match. If you didn't buy a high tier right off the bat, you are not going to enjoy Heli fights."

It starts off as fun but after a couple of hundred hours of playing you essentially hit a paywall, since after a point you won't be able to progress almost at all. The point of that is that you will think that since you've played the game so long it would be a waste to quit now, and you'll probably end up paying for premium. Also the grind is unbearable, it'll take about a thousand hours to get a top tier vehicle OF JUST ONE NATION, WITH PREMIUM. Again, the game could be fun, but Gaijin is a bunch of greedy asshats."

12142,This is a fun game BUT my god this is the dumbest game ever I have never gotten so mad at a game in my life.
12143,fun
12144,"Spawn camping/killing ruins this game.

Die once in ground mode? More often than not you'll spawn to one or more enemy light tanks that zipped across the map and are camping with a perfect shot into your spawn. Oh there's spawn protection? Well if you don't make it to cover or out of sight in 10 seconds (most tanks are not that fast) then too bad. Oh there are no tanks camping? Phew, that's a relief (bomb drops from enemy plane in spawn) *dead*. Well at least I don't have to pay crazy amounts of silver to repair my tank that was killed in 15 seconds of spawning. Oh wait, my brit tanks cost around 10k SL to repair when destroyed.

Better switch to germany since they have cheaper repair costs and the feared Tiger 2 (aka king tiger!) whooo!!!! Oh hell there's a sherman that I can't pen his front armor. Good thing the Tiger 2 is so heavily armo- (Sherman one shots me through my front plate).

Game is not P2W? Well I guess that depends on your definition of P2W. Progression without premium account is agonizingly slow, especially if you have to slog through a crap tank line to get to their mid tier when things finally start getting good. Finally made it through that slow painful grind? Haha, the other team bought super fast light tanks with gold and now we're all the way back at being spawn camped because my stock tank pushes 8kmh when going up a slight incline, while they spent real money to get a super fast light tank with 300+ pen that can make it across the map before most of the team has made it 1/4 of the way across to the first cap base. If you get really lucky and those spawn campers and bombers get killed, now you have to deal with an entire team that just camps somewhere useless because no one wants to die when there are ridiculous repair fees for a tank that gets immediately killed and spawn when you have no chance..

The game is fun but issues that have been reported to the dev for literally the last few years, have gone completely unacknowledged and ultimately take all of the enjoyement out of it.

NO I would not recommend this game to anyone until Gaijin even pretends like they care. But who cares, they just need to put out new super fast premium vehicles to give players another edge and people will keep spending money."

12193,"The gameplay is fun. But the crappy money grabbing and silliness of the ground battles is infuriating. You're consistently playing against players who outclass your shiny new tank by 1 or more battle rank. Your nice new cannon bounces off the enemy and they one shot you. You have to repair your blown up tank every game, costing you in game currency. The whole thing is set up to steal your money. It's fun if you make custom games with your friends, but thats about it. As for ground battles, why the hell do you allow planes? There's a plane mode! I should't be getting bombed by jets while riding around in a paper bag of a ""tank"" and consistently being outclassed. It's annoying."
12194,Very good free game for WW2-era arcade air battles. Very good VR compatibility too.
12195,"Not the game to play if your looking to have fun.

This is honestly the most frustrating game I have ever played and have had the worst gaming experience with. The Developer simply doesn't care about improving the game, all they do is add new shiny vehicles that 90% of the playerbase will never reach because it takes forever to unlock stuff and people will probably leave well before they get there. The BR (Battlerating) system they use to tier vehicles is the worst tiering system I have ever seen in a F2P. It results in several vehicles being completely outmatched in a fight, WW2 vehicles have absolutely no business fighting post-war/Cold war vehicles but this game forces it instead of doing the right thing and separating time periods.

Several nations are simply outclassed compared to their competition (avoid France and Japan if you do start playing), again the tiering system makes no sense. Vehicles that are completely worse then others will be at higher BR's for no reason, but Gaijin doesn't care about fixing the issues, they just keep adding shiny new stuff to get people to spend money instead. They also mess with BR's of vehicles way to much, ruining line ups, and of course they mostly do this by raising crappy vehicles BR's and not raising BR's of vehicles that actually need to be higher.

The only time I have any fun playing this game is when I'm winning, playing quirky vehicles, or playing low BR. A game is meant to be fun, not constant frustration. A game should reward skill, not who is using the better vehicles, and even if you out-skill someone in a better vehicle the game punishes you with a stupid kill-cam that tells the person you killed exactly where you are and who killed you, thus they will come back in an aircraft and kill you (called revenge bombing). In a game where positioning and stealth is such a huge aspect something like this is inexcusably stupid. I'm not even getting into the Naval aspect, just play World of Warships. If you want to play this game do Air battles, those are mostly fine.

Tanks people payed for are still broken several years after release, because Gaijin doesn't care. Oh, and you better be ready to fork over cash for a premium tank or premium time cause you WILL run out of money otherwise unless you quickly become a god at the game. You earn pitifully little research points and silver lions without one of those two things. If your just looking for a tank game, play World of Tanks, if your looking for a tank simulator, look at every other option instead of this. Wargaming (World of Tanks developer) isn't perfect, but at least they bother to fix game bugs, have some general sense of balance and TRY to listen to their playerbase.

Gaijin simply doesn't."

It is, however, good that there are not enough premiums in game to alter game experience for other players. Don't believe myths about algorythms that nerf players based on performance. Dynamic sun makes the game more immersive and interesting. We push to get to the top tiers to play night battles, cause they are even better than dynamic sun. We should increase punishment for quitting a battle from 10min to 60min, this way everyone will get to stay in game and enjoy briliant maps like the red sands."

Graphics are great for its age, sound effects are beautiful, and overall the game feels good, although there is a large learning curve. HUGE issue with the game though is that there is about 6 or 7 ""tiers"" of vehicles, so there is a lot of variety (which is great) but once you start working on tier 3 vehicles, it will take you atleast 10-15 matches just to unlock the next tank. And that's only if you do incredible in those matches. You will normally only get about 3000 research points (on a good game) and it costs 40,000 to get most tier 3's. So It gets very grindy VERY early"

Of course I recommend the game, But!
There should be a possibility that you can opt out of aircraft when driving a tank.
For example, in recent matches I have not had a chance against the opponents due to the fact that you do not get an opportunity to enter the battle when the fucking planes come and knock you out. Excuse the language, but I'm actually right. The only times but have a chance is at the beginning of the match or if you find a roof where you can take protection. But then you can not do much more than watch when your partner becomes Schweiser cheese. What you have to do in that case is to drive a thickly armored tank, but since I follow the Swedish tree, it is practically impossible to survive from aircraft as new ones arrive every minute and you get an absolute 0% chance of surviving. I love tanks, absolutely! But what's the point of driving a tank if you've decided to fly a plane anyway?

The game itself, apart from planes fighting in a tank match, is fun and detailed, but also expect players who do everything to bring you down!"

It can be very fun, and IS very addicting, but the majority of games you play are not gonna be super fun. If there's one tip I can give new players, it would easily be this, GO WITH RUSSIA. Gaijin is a Russian company, and I am convinced that Russian bias exists. Trust me, as a US main, Russian tanks are literally invincible. KV-1' and t-34' are the bane of my existence.

Fuck the grind in this game 
Game gud"
12311,"You don't have to be  an 100+ IQ person to understand war thunder, its a great game and has amazed me on multiple platforms, the logic is not 100% sound but the fun is when you start to get your first heavy tank, it takes a long time to research a tank without eagles in my case at least, I mostly love the games mechanics and physics the developers put a lot of effort to show their passion for the war thunder project. good game."
12312,"i think war thunder is a game that nobody will truly see eye to eye on for two big reasons:

the first one being that everyone has a different 'tolerance' for what they deem to be a waste of time or money. for some people the grind with or without premium is way too sloggy. and for others like myself, i dont even notice if im grinding because im always 100% focused on the matches im in every single game. im never sitting there like ""ugh god this grinding is so annoying."" the game is just so immersive to me that while i do agree its a grindfest, its one that i thoroughly enjoy playing through because the core mechanics are solid.

and the second reason being that the grind is mainly dependant on your performance match-to-match. if you go DUMMY on some fools in one match it could equivalate to as much research points as 6 or 7 bad matches with mediocre score. this is the other reason i think alot of people cant get into war thunder, if you're trying to learn but get slapped by dudes that know every map it can be difficult to score enough research points for it to be worth playing in the first place. its a fat smack to the jimmy when you first start playing war thunder, but alot of people i know who've stuck it out over the course of many years still play to this day and i think thats indicative of something positive. 


if i had to generalize my opinion on whether or not someone should play war thunder i would say that its atleast worth a shot. try it out, if you dont have a friend to guide you than do some research on youtube. the worst that can happen is you dont like it. none lost none gained."

12330,"honestly, this game is truly one of a kind and I've been a huge fan of it for years but that's the thing. Unless you played this game way back when the Higher Br's where still possible to reach without dumping actual thousands of hours (or hundreds of dollars) into this game it's pretty much impossible to really reach the top unless it's all you do. Also the general disregard for anything their community has to say is sort of obnoxious. I'm vary easily not the only person with these issues or feeling about this and many people have explained far better than I ever could so if you really want to know why I feel this way just go anywhere on Reddit or YouTube, hell even here on the review page. All I have to say is if your new to this game or considering trying it out, do yourself a favor and don't"

12345,"A very fun game, no cussing, or inapropriate references, this is just tanks, ships, and aircraft in combat, there are no soldiers or anything making it pg13. This is a very approriate game for kids who like military strategy and online warfare. The chat although can prove problematic, so I only recommend this game to 10+ or 11+"

12365,"Nice trailers, horrible gameplay.

The JA37C was released 9 months ago and it still does not have tracers or a radar lead indicator. It's still a great plane but it is incredibly difficult and time consuming to learn the ballistics of the gun.

Gaijin doesn't improve the stuff that is currently in the game and the monetization is horrendous. They are out of touch with their playerbase and probably don't play their own game."

12377,"War Thunder is a very good game, its addictive and a great time-killer for when your life is crumbling to pieces, This game will punish you for many reasons but in return you will receive a massive dopamine boost once you get a kill and it feels good.
If you are a new player to War Thunder then I recommend getting yourself an experienced friend to guide you to victory and you will have a good time playing this game, also I'd like to say that the grind for top-tier vehicles is a very long road ahead but with enough time and effort anything is possible.

Overall I give this game a rating of 9/10, very good 👍"

12385,"*This is mainly a NAVAL review..**


UI: Complicated.
GFX: Good.
Sound: Good.
Grind: BAD.
Battleque: Decent.

*You are locked to one nation in battle, meaning you cant have your favourite ship in the US tree and use if you joined the battle in another tree.

*Getting uptiered a lot, but thats okay since ""the kill focus is not prominent in this game as like in WOWS"". Alot more teamwork focus here and teamplay does wonders.

*Once you hit 5.0 - Stuff cost a lot.
*Needs submarines and CV, alot of seal clubbing going on, too much tbh. - Raise the height of some island on some maps.

*Also i would like to see a more Skill match based on crew skill, cause it matters a lot after 5.0*"

12387,"Played for the Stuka, stayed for the pizza autocannon"
12388,"Always wanted to fight against post war vehicles with your WW2 ones then this is the game you want to have. ( Tiger E vs T-44-100's/T-95's/FV4202's, 9 out of 10 battles you will get massively uptiered) Whomever made the battlerating system is just fucking dumb. Now was my standard not high of the devs as they censored the community because if you say anything about the war or even have a Ukrainian flag on your tank, their russian playerbase will grief you until you have no more vehicles to play with in the match. 

My tip for playing this game is stick to 4.7~ battlerating (or lower) so you wont pull your hair out while playing the game and make sure to put it on realistic if you are playing with tanks because the arcade version is a joke with the hit marker where you need to aim"

12400,You heard me
12401,"only started  playing  this  game  so   i  could fly  a b-17, my favourite plane of  all  time.
it  took me  230 hours to grind  to that plane."
12402,"this is the game where i watch my drivers balls explode from a shrapnel and be happy about it. 

This game is realism meaning its hard as life, but they have an arcade that is much harder than life. the game play is great especially if you like simulation game and a potato pc. At the start of the game it pretty easy (because its tutorial) but as you go on the game become harder but its rewarding especially if you transfer to WOT. so all in all for my opinion its a good game."
12403,this game is single handedly the greatest opsec weakness of any military
12404,"If you can game the system they have setup, and have some free time and friends, sure maybe lower tiers are fun. 

However, if you're at least somewhat like me, you will probably gain significantly greater average daily enjoyment knowing the game is uninstalled."

12412,It'll suck you in harder then that one goth chick you use to bone. 10/10 but also fuck you.
12413,it is fun
12414,"Although the game can get to you quickly, it makes up for it with the thousands of opportunities that it presents for you to get satisfying kills. Even when your plane is on fire and dozens of others have fallen out of the sky, the hope for a glorious win stands tall in this game. Personally, I enjoy most of the World War Era vehicles because they aren't extremely overpowered. A quick BRRRRRRRRRT kill is always fun, though."
12415,"The game is amazing you just have to find what part your good at and stick with that, its a bit grindy at the beginning but just mess around with it and your good."
12416,p2w bs
12417,Thus game sucks :)
12418,"Great game, easy to pick up and play but can be a bit of a slog to progress to higher level vehicles. Nonetheless you can still have lots of fun with low rank vehicles so not a major issue."
12419,This game is CBT without the C or B
12420,"it's ok
"
12421,"Mostly positive, HA! That's a lie. Heavily pay to win regardless what it looks like. Top tier you cannot get money or barely make any because of repair cost. Worst is top tier air in terms of repair cost. Lets not talk about Naval, Gaijin does not care about that game mode much. If you want to cope a bit easier, get premium but that is not recommended as you:
1. Wasted money
2. You will still get clapped by the broken balancing mechanic
Overall, do not play the game. They need to learn how to hear their community, and not just spit on them on a constant"
12422,"Really fun game, it's a bit better than World of Tanks in my opinion just cus you only need one shot to kill, all you gotta do is hit weak spots."
12423,"You will have highs and lows while playing this game you will be emotionally unstable you will be so happy and the next second you are in a plane going to revenge bomb because of some tank destroyer on the other side of the lake in Poland starts to spawn kill you. You will be flanking then your shell bounces and every tank on the entire map now knows where you are. I love and hate this game. Finally, playing with friends makes the emotional unstableness very funny."

12459,"There are so many amazing things about this game. The attention to detail on vehicle models, the varying effects of different shells against different armors, and the wide variety of vehicles (both air and ground), to name a few. However I can't recommend this game. The first few ranks of your first nation grind will be unlike anything you experienced before and it will be very fun learning the dynamics of the game, the weaknesses of different types of tanks, and how to play your own tanks' advantages (same for Air). However, once you hit rank 4 or 5, it becomes painful. High repair costs, constant uptiers where your lineup is entirely ineffective, very skilled players in meta tanks who've probably been playing for years, and very high research costs all make the grind slow down to a snails pace. You may go into this planning to stay F2P, and some do manage it, but this makes grinding even worse. Soon, you'll only be getting fleeting moments of the fun you had in your first 100 or so hours, and maybe realize this game is taking too much of your time and not providing enough for it. You'll be telling yourself ""Things will be fun again after I get through this shit section of the tech tree"" but it never really is.

Other games to check out with less pain than this one:
AIR
- Ace Combat (more arcadey)
- DCS (more sim)
- Vincemus (EA)
- Warplanes (VR)
- Wings of Prey
- IL-2

GROUND
- Gunner, Heat, PC (EA available soon)
- Sprocket (EA)
- Steel Crew (EA)

12471,"now i'm over 1000 hours in this game i think i can write my review, the game can be fun, but this game is skill based in my opinion as the best players will know where to shoot an enemy's weak spot which becomes important in higher tiers and mainly against the Russians as they have the trolley armour. The grind is also insane and can take you months just to get to cold war era vehicles, with tanks generally take longer and planes are faster for some reason, however the best way to grind is to get a premium vehicle and account as this boosts your research points and silver lions, whilst yes this can be expensive you can buy pack with both in them, nut what ever you do never buy a high tier premium without knowing what you're getting into and they cost the most with all top tier premium tanks costing £51. personally i like this game, however it's not for everyone and i advise you put a couple hours into the game before buying any type of premium time or vehicles, and if you do like the game and want to get a cheaper premium stuff i'd advise getting the starter packs as they give you a premium tank and plane with 125k silver lions and majority of the factions have one."

IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SIMULATOR THIS IS NOT IT, but it is still more realistic than arcade type games like WOT, WOWS, AC or PW. there is a gamemode and vehicle for everyone and you shouldnt be interested in top tier only if you want to actually enjoy this game, enjoy low tier tanks with small pop guns enjoy the mid tier heavy tanks banging 6 rounds out of each other."

The game is amazing but is also held back by just two things that may make it extremely frustrating for other players:
           -Grind is extremely long.
           -Economy is pretty busted, being centered around forcing you to buy Premium and Golden Eagles if you don't want 
             to be spending more than a year in the game just to max out one tech tree.

I have, at the time of this review, just reached Tier III in the Soviet tech tree, so my opinion might change in the future."

"
12520,"Good, but the grind is very hard."
12521,this game will take ur soul slowly evry time u launch it
12522,"probably one of the worst gaming experiences i've had ever. Sure, it looks nice, but the grind takes a few years per tank, and usually you'll end up unlocking a teletubby shitbox that can't even penetrate a Ford Fiesta yet you get one-shot by every single enemy tank you encounter."
12523,cba to type anyhting
12524,"absolute bullshit
edit: still bullshit"
12525,"This game is fun, but I do not recommend it. Its economy is so broken that after a certain point you can only play once and then have to wait several hours for vehicles to repair if you don't want to lose SL. The repair economy is pointless in the first place, its only purpose is to make the game pay to win. The game itself is enjoyable, but impossibly frustrating. I can't imagine the amount of work and time it must take to move further in the game after taking over 3 hours just to get enough SL to buy tank I already researched. Trust me, after getting far enough, all you will ever think about is how broken the economy is."
12526,Pretty fun game but it really challenges my nerves when a sweaty Germany grinder is chasing my ass and i get blown up 5 times in a row. Solid 8/10.
12527,"This game is all about russian bias and frustrating grind, finances, and RNG, and i think I said it all with that."

12535,"Friend or no friends online you will have a blast! Ive Never had a bad time on this game, i have spent alot of time on this game. i have all German aircraft in the game and have most of all germany ground. The only issue ive had is with the BR balancing and compression issues, other then that if you played the game and hate it, its skills issue+cope..."
12536,I love this game i play it 24/7 best dowload ever i would spend all my money on it
12537,"its free, so you cant complain. its fun also. but its so grindy. you have to grind your mom to get to anything for hours on end."
12538,"The story of War Thunder is one of tragedy and grind.



It's fundamentally a good game, but I can't recommend it with all that grind."
12539,"it is fun at first but then you have to morgage ur house to get ge to progress to rank 7.
Im in too deep , save your self"
12540,good game
12541,yes if you want to lose all your money if no you would need to play it for 600 hours or some thing just to get 1 fighter jet (i recommend to choose germany and then fighters or bombers) so if you want to spend the rest of your life playing war thunder just to get a fighter jet its a game for you

Every single battle makes me want to die more and more, and each single time I get killed by a Mig I want to burn my house down.

It's like a legal form of cruel torture, and it makes me desire the cold lingering embrace of death.

12611,"This game is perfect except at everything,yes barely into tier 3 but i already feel the pain and the weight of the time you have to put in this game to reach top tier,yes the vehicles graphics and physics are very well made,but everything else sucks,from researching to grinding to not having enough silver lions,everything about this game is obliterated by the stupid economy this game has did i mention how hard it is to get enough money to buy the vehicle you just researched,this game would have been way better if this economy was actually balanced,you feel a constant inner pain when you see that you need 60 more silver lions,i am probably going to reach top tier one day and i will update this then,but for now i would not recommend this game if you want to be serious about it."
12612,"Okay, I love this game. I've been playing for years... However it is a GRIND. It also seems to be pay to win which I hate personally. But if you like play realistic tank and airplane battles then this is the game for you. Give it a shot, its free but a GRIND."

12633,This is a pay 2 win 100%. After you reach tier 4 anything the cost of new vehicles is crazy and no matter how many shots you get on someone they'll proceed to shoot the ground and 1 shot you every time run away from this game
12634,Jaguar with nuke go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
12635,"Fun Game, a lot of Grind, but the Air RB is a great time!"
12636,Delete planes from arcade ground battles.
12637,I'm into military stuff but mostly into planes. Almost everything about this game is positive. The only thing that I don't like about it is the fact that it takes days of grinding to advance deeper into the tech tree.

12659,Played on and off for about 5 years recently came back to it to actually properly grind it out. Only con is that if you actually want to get somewhere progress wise in the game unless your a god at the game you do need to chuck a bit of money into the game. On-top of that once you actually get to a certain stage it starts to take a toll on your playing purely for fun stance.

12667,"This game is so unimaginably fun and horribly unforgiving at the same time. The game is a part of my life now. It's a staple for friends I've met and relationships I've had. Play this game with friends and have the time of your life laughing at random shit, killing each other in custom games or grinding planes/tanks/boats/helicopters together.  Play alone and you will send yourself into a pit of despair. The pain of constantly dying to bullshit over and over again never leaving. Only growing in my soul till I finally snap.  Having to get back on again with just the little bit of hope that this time is different. That this time I have a chance to break free of this devilish curse. Alas the never ending cycle of going into battle just to get bombed or sniped by a tank. The greed, it whispers to me, softly lulling me back with sweet lies. ""I will get that next tank, I will prevail"" I say, finally excepting that this is indeed my fate, as I press ""To Battle"", I take my final decent down, into the darkness and insanity.

It never ends. 

Its pain, its love, its laughter and its chaotic.

12676,"was fun, no longer is"
12677,Games sucks your life away. I highly recommend playing the game.
12678,"You spawn, you move, you die.

10/10 would repeat until grind ends"
12679,"War Thunder is a aircraft battle simulator game. To that goal it dose a good job. 

If you want to play tanks, ships or god forbid helicopters. Good luck. Every game mode except helo on helo has aircraft in it. Whats that? Your in a open top spg? oh here's an aircraft to kill you with its mgs. Oh your in a tiger now, feel invincible? No here's aircraft to 50 cal your tracks and leave you vulnerable in the middle of a field. That is of course if it dosn't have bombs/rockets.

In GROUND BATTLES I get killed by aircraft about 4/10 times. And I know what wt vets are going to say. Just hide. Get to cover. Pop smoke. I would do that if half the maps aren't wide f***in open with no cover. Maginot Line im looking at you. The only time I feel I can play tank on tank combat without the aircraft butting in is when its a city map. Also how would you feel if air rb had player controlled radar sam sites? Yeah, not too fun huh? 

Like I said this is a air sim game with tanks/helos/boats added on for you to shoot. Thats not the worst of it tho. I have seen few games be soo pay to PLAY. First lets start with progress. Did you see all the advertisements with modern vehicles? Want to fly the skies in a A-10? or drive around in a M1A1. Too bad. You must spend hundreds of hours in grinding from literally the beginning of ww2. For each country. For each air/helo/ground/boat separately. Unless of course you drop 80$+ per vehicle just to play modern tanks. If you don't have a premium account, both your research points and in-game currency (SL)are halved. Premium for a year is about 90$. yeah 90$ usd. The game also has multiple currencies just to confuse you as well. You can use you stored research points to research vehicles and upgrades instantly for cash. Its says GE but its just cash. Oh and there's a battle pass you can buy too. I have 200ish hours in the game and have spent them getting USA and Germany ground forces to rank 3 out of 7.

The game is running on a 10 year old engine. And it shows. Some vehicles are modeled and skinned great. Alot of the older models are showing their age, but thats not the problem. Its the bugs. This thing is infested. I think the game is just too old and they've tried to add soo much to an ageing engine that was never built to handle. Like laser guided missiles, heatseekers, radar, ships ect. Its engine is just made of patches duct tapped on to it and creates soo many bugs. Not to mention their server connection/latency is bad. Always. 

Also every game I get, the top 3 on each team get all the kills. Half the score card are players with 0k 3d. and this is at rank 5.7 not under rank 3 with bots. Also majority of the games turn into curb stomp matches where one side totally dominates and camps your spawn. Oh and spawn protection is 10 sec. 10 sec to get to cover and hopefully he able to spot and engage the spawn killers. Hope you have your engine upgrades!

Long story short. Very Grindy game. Very pay to play. Feels like im flailing myself if I play it. Don't waste your time. This game is for the people who have been playing the game for years and are too invested at this point to stop playing. Just don't start, their are plenty of games that are 60$ and developers that give a shit. WT doesn't care about fixing the game or making it fair. They only care about the cash cows. Remember if your not paying for a game, you are the content for the players who do."

12738,I love this game
12739,"War Thunder? No, more like best military arcade style flight simulator considering some of you probably don't have a HOTAS and it still feels really nice to control. I played this game for a few hours straight just trying to get a feel for it and I got 5 air kills without a HOTAS. So yeah, great game, but DCS is still much more popular of a sim for people looking to get into realistic military aviation. Even if one plane will cost you $79.99 (€74.17). Still, I feel like this overtakes Ace Combat by a ton."

12773,"It's definetely not the most realistic flying game but I feel that is what allows new and existing players make it fun, the more players there are the better the game will be. In terms of graphics they can be really good yet it will run in pretty much anything that has electricity. THe planes are great so I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on the DLC."

This is because you will see great progress in the early game, but at some point your economy will tank and you will be forced to play less and less until you have to call it quits. By this time 4 years of your life have gone by, you're miserable and you have achieved absolutely nothing.

12823,its a good fun game to play but its hard to get the vehicles you want without vigorously grinding for them at some point sucks that it basically costs money to get the modern stuff. otherwise gameplay is good and easy to understand.
12824,dssGdsf
12825,Game Fuck
12826,"I would not recommend this game. Bottom line, if you don't want to hate yourself and get angry at a game, do not try it. The gameplay itself is good, however, there is very much a pay to win aspect of it that you hit in a nation's tech tree around the middle or so. There are premium vehicles people can buy with money that are often much better than the normal tanks. That in itself is not that bad, but to progress in the tech tree you need to earn both money and research points, which increase in requirement the father you get, and once you get into the middle of a tech tree, if you do not buy a premium account, it takes a VERY long time to keep going, especially if you are just an average player (like me). 

The rage part comes in when the game itself does not work like it is supposed to on occasion. Every once and a while, your tank round will hit a glitchy spot in some armor and bounces off, or something called a ghost shell, where you round seems to hit the target and disappear. There are other reasons why this game induces rage, including when your teammates purposely get you killed (not super common, but has happened to me a few times). And getting your tank immediately spawned killed also sucks (the map designs ENCOURAGE this), because tanks cost money to repair, and that takes away from you being able to purchase your newly researched tanks.

All in all, this is still probably the best tank game out there right now. It does not start to suck until around the middle of a tech tree, when it becomes pay to win and you really need a premium account. At that point, you could get away with just starting another tree and having a decent time until hitting the middle again. Unfortunately though, that ruins a lot of the experience for me."

*Welcome to death simulator. Progression is slow, tanks are fast, shooting is slow, enemies are fast, prepare to die cause they're right in front of you with unpenetrable armour and an AP gun that goes stright into your front end, explodes inside the hull and kills everyone in a single shot.

**Welcome to the time waster simulator, the game where you struggle to fly a plane around for 15 straight minutes before either winning or losing on a 50% chance bias. Progression slow, rewards low.

***Welcome to impossible-to-drive simulator: Water edition! Slow, unreliable, weak, weak guns, prepare to be slaughtered by kissing the rocks on the beach or getting aimbotted by the game's bots.

****Welcome to Impossible-to-drive simulator 2: Water edition! Slowest boats yet, we also added players with OP warships that can oneshot you, launch unavoidable oneshot torpedoes, cause metal damage, and maybe, just maybe, die from kissing those damn rocks.



Don't waste your time with this game. Just don't. There's enough games around that you pay 20 bucks for and get the full fun package from, rather than games like this that involve.. let's see... pouring buckets of cash into the dev's mouths to get any fun out of it. Please, for your own safety, if you don't have thousands to waste on videogames, don't play this.

12872,"It looks incredible on the trailers but game is very grindy and repetitive. With the amount of money and grindy time required you will just get better investing with Digital Combat Simulator (DCS World) and take more out of it.
On top of it you are giving in to commercial practices that are just unsound in the gaming world."
12873,no
12874,Very fun and good if you get bored
12875,"I'm not quite sure how War Thunder will continue attracting new players, as an already vast gulf continues to widen between what is teased in the marketing and the reality that will confront enlistees when they're given a monoplane (or biplane) from the 1930s to fly into battle. Moving up through the tiers, from there, is a slow grind, and there are a bunch to progress through to get to even some early models of jet aircraft.

The situation on the ground is similar, but less dire, as the lightly-armed and armored tanks of the early tiers are at least pretty fast moving. Something that cannot credibly be said for the rickety old crop dusters of low-tier air battles.

This can all be addressed, of course, by opening up your wallet. But I would advise having someone on hand to fan you gently in preparation for the sticker shock.

I will pay War Thunder one compliment. It covers some under-served areas of interest for gamers fascinated by historical air and ground combat. Such as using post-WWII tanks like the Walker Bulldog on a Cold War battlefield, or dogfighting between cannon-armed, subsonic early jet fighters.

But in its current incarnation,.it seems to either take far too long, with its interminable grind, or cost too much, with its aggressive monetization, to get to that point."
12876,Works as a flight simulator
12877,"If you have any interest in air-, land- or naval combat you will probably like War Thunder. A great mix between simulation and arcade, with what is probably the best flight mechanics for mouse and keyboard ever. The damage models, details and tech trees are on point. 

A lot of people are complaining about the games economics, to be honest I never had a real issue.
Firstly, the game is free, and you can play it completely free if you are in no hurry. I think a lot of players get frustrated because the jets and modern tanks are at the very end of the tech trees (which it should be), i.e. many, many hours to reach. To get around this they pay for high tier premium packs, join a battle and get wrecked in seconds, with a loss of the game's currency as a result.
In my opinion the best content gameplay wise sits at low to mid tier and no one should have a problem to keep up with the economy at that point. 

Sure it is a grind, but if you relax and enjoy the content on the way, then it's truly a great game for the fair price of zero dollars.

What the game lacks is a bigger variety in game modes, foremost the game would greatly benefit with the addition of a permanent enduring confrontation mode for realistic air.

Would also love to see the single player component fleshed out, with more modern campaigns and missions. Updated a.i. would also be amazing.


It’s about the journey, not the destination.
"
12878,"Updated more times whenever i encounter something new and playing some extra hours to get some insight of what's going on here. I'm no WW2 expert, hats off to the game devs for making this as realistic as possible but reality is cruel so bare with me as i explain my experience. From the perspective of a regular, not P2W or P2P player. You may find odd i will frequently use the word ""terrible"", so excuse my bad English. 

  Game in general is hard and frustrating, as a result you'll encounter more people cursing ingame chat at higher ranked games, just a bit bothersome.
To make things clear, i'm talking here just about the TANKS which i find fascinating and the main reason for playing this game. 
   Played a bit of aerial battles but they were just a serious waste of time for me, from take off to gun jamming-no repair in mid air, period!

-Ingame tutorials are, surprisingly... not terrible
-Game mechanics is very unbalanced, PvE battle rating fights are very expensive and unbalanced (end levels are mostly impossible to win) (you die-you pay more, so duck and cover and wait for the aliens the take care of the enemy units). 
-Game economy is unbalanced ie all over the place, multiple ingame currencies, squad currency. But fear not, real money input (golden eagles->$$) for the win. If however, you don't win the match, rewards are terrible for the ""regular"" people.
-PvE you get hit instantly whenever bot has a lock on you through buildings and terrain and the engine calculates the human eye can't figure out how the replay shows the humanly impossible hit. Hit replay lacks of camera control. Game replay doesn't have a selectable time scale?
-Even with active boosters, for missions, the amount of silver lions and RP gain is pretty low.
-Also a major flaw, vehicles with 25s+ reload rate get less activity reward because only thing you can do is wait to reload, this is terrible. At most, you can shoot 3 times per round while others 10+. 
-Most if not all PvP maps are top notch! Some PvE maps are terrible, strategically in PvE, Japan (barricades are useless) and Sinai (ai sometimes shoots through buildings, some rocks are not 100% solid wth?, on rare occasion enemy projectiles fly to their targets before AI tanks spawn) for example. 
-AI airplanes sometimes have no smooth turning or ground vehicle tracking aim is picking up some irregular airplane movement, whatever the case this makes your aim terrible. AI planes flies sideways as well! AI bombers are extremely precise.  
-Machinegun meter is bugged whenever implemented.
-PvP is more realistic but it's a camping game, bigger caliber wins, If you start losing to stronger units, better give up because the opposite team already has the advantage. Most matches end up with spawn camping, this is terrible. 3 respawns in PvP makes some sense but upgraded $$ crew and vehicle makes all the difference+backup cards.   
-More interesting battles with low br rating vehicles. So, once you go high, other weaker vehicles become obsolete and the time you put into them go to waste. No refund policy! Mastering the Ace rank for any vehicle is useless, wasting time to be precise. 
-PvE match time is terribly long for a single session, about 30 mins. Can you afford playing 2 hours per day to actually earn some ""lions"", your doctor will say go out more, make friends offline and avoid spinal deformities from prolonged sitting. Where was i... there was a bee...
-Crew replacement time is terrible, that destroys the shooting part, dynamics, of the game. 
-Newly purchased vehicles start without the repair ability in combat, so basically you're the kamikaze/naruto or crouching tiger/hidden sloth. 
-Customization of the vehicles is terrible but it's fun to play for hours and hours just to get that one upgrade. Tanks are pretty much sitting ducks from the big bang until the end of time, just the way i like it (the ww2 period). After that homosapiens continue to degrade, including it's brain mass. 
-Ammo distribution/quality/quantity is terrible, blame history for this, it's realistic alright. Rabbit of turtle is what you can be here. So what do you do, make yourself useful and run around like dog chasing frisbee. Fragmentation ammo is useless in PvE, a side note. 

I could go on and on but 400+ hours does it for me, i press a red buzzer [X]. 

   It's a fun free to play game so there's nothing to worry about, you've just wasted some of your free time, no big deal. You do what you want with your own time and money, i ain't paying a dime for this piece of a beautiful nightmare!

12898,"Very niche problem, but when running in VR mode with an ultra wide base monitor, all of my HUD is out of my literal FOV. Combo that with the fact that ""VR gameplay"" is just playing it like you would on a monitor but in a VR headset, via mouse and key to boot, then it's just as mundane as playing it normally if you were looking for an actual fun and interactive VR flight/war sim."

The gameplay is fun and the variety of aircraft/armoured/naval units you can play is cool and each does kinda feel unique and different, which is often difficult to do for most games. Its free, worth checking out."

But the balancing and monetization are predatory and toxic. The events demand your time or money. If you have a full time job, good luck. I cannot seriously recommend this game to anyone without them knowing of the cancer that it produces.

But I still love it."

12926,"While this game has its ups and downs, I've always had fun. I've had lots of laughs and lots of rages, tho in between all of that this is a fun game and an even funner one with friends. Everyone always whines about the grind and while it is a big grind for jets, battleships, 130 mm tank destroyers. It gives you a sense of power and accomplishment when you finally researched that one vehicle that took you like 30 hours to get. I've enjoyed this game so much, and I hope other people can enjoy it as much as I do. Tip(For the newer players and even the older ones, PREMIUM IS WORTH IT. SPEND IKE 20 BUCKS AND GET THE 30 DAY PREMIUM ACCOUNT, IT REALLY HELPS)"

12928,It's OK

Re: playing this game from planes, and several years from 2011, i know how research panel works, no i dont have my unlocked maus in rank V, and because of the untrustworthy behavior of the devs not played for a year, so no, not unlocked it in the last event, unlocked some years ago, when maus was dominated by t54-s, and was no rank6 etc vehicles...all in all lost in progress, thanks again Gaijin"
12934,this game is prob one of the best war game on the f**king market
12935,realistic
12936,"The user interface is not intuitive at all, but the game is quite fun. If you like trying out different countries, it will take a long time to go through unlocking different vehicles, but that is part of the fun. If you play with a more experienced person who is willing to give pointers, it might be ok to play realistic or sim modes (i.e. that plane over there is an energy fighter or turn fighter). If you want to just have higher paced fun, I recommend air arcade mode which is where I have spend most of my time."

Gaijin as a company is far more focused with fancy new features, gimmicks, and modeling tank armor than balancing any of their games (looking at you, Enlisted). Balance does not exist in their vocabulary. They can figure out how to accurately model every tank in the last 80 years of warfare with stunning detail, but can't wrap their heads around preventing you from getting spawn sniped by ten different tanks several tiers higher than yours because your team got steamrolled as is the case in a vast majority of games. There is a tremendous skill curve to add atop the mountain of unbalance issues Gaijin refuses to acknowledge likely because they do not have answers. The problem isn't with overpowered tanks or guns, the very core mechanics and foundation are incredibly ""realistic"" meaning expect to get one shot killed by a guy ten miles away after spending five minutes crawling from cover to cover, carefully surveying the surroundings. Maybe that sounds fun to you. I can understand why people enjoy this game, and I don't think it's wrong to do so. There's only so many times I can spend a match getting dunked on by vehicles far superior to mine or watching my team roll over the enemies with no resistance before I stop having fun and remember why I keep uninstalling this game. It's an addictive trap that lures you back in. The memories seem fun until you remember the pain after a single match coming back from a long break.

And good luck even getting close to the fancy modern vehicles they spend so much time adding more and more of to the game. They don't expect you to pay to win, they expect you to pay to progress. See that fun new A-10 they added to the game? Maybe if you work (or spend) real hard, you'll be able to fly it yourself one day after ten years, only to get blown up on the runway by a teammate who thinks it would be funny to kill you right out of the gate.

If you're a fan of this game, I understand. It's a cool concept. There's cool tanks. It sounds cool, it looks cool, it feels cool to drive / fly, etc. I just hope we can acknowledge the serious issues here.

If you haven't started playing this game yet though - don't start."
12999,"A once great game that's grown far too complacent. Refusing to innovate in any meaningful way in the past few years. Or address its foundational problems. A product built to prey on people with addictive personalities and exploits FOMO to the extreme. Operated by one of the most morally and creatively bankrupt developers I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I've played this game for nine years, mostly through Gaijin's client. So the true number of hours played are not available. Just don't bother with this cash grab. Unless you're a raging masochist looking to get pegged by the snail."

13032,"To be honest. This game is amazing from rank 1 until rank 3 (1.0 until 6.7 or so). Amazing, fun and memorable gameplay experiences within those ranks. Very fluent, a lot of bouncing that makes you feel powerful and unstoppable. If you like to play the role of WW2, then this is your game, both for tank, planes and ships.

Now when you get to rank 4, the thing changes a lot. A very lot. No bouncing, everything is one shot, and no, you hardly ever do that. Doesn't matter if your tank has 400+mm penetration. The moment you're playing and shoot, hitting a tank with no more than just 180mm ish of full thickness, the game doens't recognize it. It just said hit, but no penetration or damage of anything. Here now I know why in the community they say 'Low tier, fun tier'.
Oh. We cannot forget the rockets/missiles you get hit from nowhere to be seen, kill you one shot. But you shoot one and do no damage.

Do I recommend it? Yes. But my recommendation is for low tiers until br 6.7 and that's it. Anything after that makes me sick in the head, because you don't enjoy it. You just rage by being one shotted, which you cannot do to them even in the weak spots, and campers. Lots and lots of them.

So yeah. This is a review and also a rant. Enjoy the game!"

13041,This games is one of the most fun ive played in a while. Especially when you are with your friends. Its free to play an lots of fun. There might be some grinding that necessary but its all fun. Its reminds me of the times I spent in the war back in 44
13042,"I have spent too many hours on this game.

The game itself is a lot of fun. But there are some rather frustrating issues, and scummy business practices.

The first issue is that the game is very exclusive and performance based - and by ""performance"", I'm referring to player performance. Good players are rewarded, and bad players are punished.

If you go into a game, head out onto the map, and get yourself blown up in one hit by an experienced player, before you can even fire a shot, you either have to go back to the main menu, or spawn in one of your other vehicles, and you need to pay for the repair costs (or wait for 12-24+ hours for a ""free repair"". If you perform very well, you gain a lot of progress. If you perform poorly, you LOSE progress. You still gain some research points, but you'll never be able to buy a new vehicle. Better hope you don't have a streak of bad games.

The second issue amplifies the first. There is no ranking system in this game. Good players do not face off against other good players. In other words, every game you have a chance of facing at least a handful of players who are much better at the game than you are, unless you yourself are very good at the game. It is entirely possible to go 10 straight games earning negative progress.

Then there's the scummy business practices. You can buy premium vehicles, only available with real money. Most of the unique vehicles (like the Katyusha, Panzerwerfer or Calliope rocket systems) are premium vehicles. There is no way to earn most of these, no matter how long you play. You can buy camouflage with real money to place on your tank, and you can place twice as many pieces on your tank as a paying monthly subscriber, turning your tank into a mobile bush, giving you a significant advantage. They have repeatedly disabled the ability to chat in the game, because they don't want to deal with moderating their own game. They have a daily login reward that spins like a casino wheel, showing you what great rewards you could get, and then usually landing on some 10% booster that will expire unless you keep playing. The whole game is designed to get you to grab that credit card to be able to get anywhere. I have unlocked rank 4 tanks with one faction after 400 hours of gameplay. There are 7 ranks. Yes, there's quite a bit of content, but it's locked behind hundreds, or thousands of hours, unless you grab that credit card.

The last issue is the Battle Rating (BR) system. In virtually every single game that I play, there are people with vehicles 1.0 BR higher than my highest vehicle. I frequently play with 5.3 vehicles like the Panther or Tiger tank, and always go up against several 6.3 tanks like the IS-6. These tanks simply obliterate mine in one hit, while I can scarcely scratch their paint. This further amplifies the other issues already mentioned.

This last bit is entirely my opinion and should not be regarded as fact:
It is quite clear to me that Gaijin is either pro Russian, or have no sense of gameplay balancing over their desire to keep the game as true to realism as possible. Mid-to-late WW2 Russian tanks are simply better than German tanks. This was true in reality, and this is true in this game. The difference is, in reality, the Germans still performed quite well against the USSR, because their tank crews had a few years of experience already. Meanwhile, the Soviets had just done the Great Purge, which meant they had to rely on poor, inexperienced leadership and tank crews - the T34 was superior to the versions of the Panzer III and IV available to the Germans at the time, but they were still a match due to the difference in experience. This is not accounted for in this game. The T34 is simply better. The IS-2 to IS-6 are better than the Panther G, Tiger I and Tiger II.

I don't expect anyone to read all of this novel, nor agree with all of it, nor be swayed not to play this game because of it. I wrote it mostly to get my frustrations with this game out. Peace."
13043,no
13044,"I used to love this game. I spent almost 1,000 hours on the steam launcher version alone, pretty sure I played longer before I got it on steam? Either way, I took a break for a year or two. Decided to come back after that time to redownload and play the game again some more to play all the new tanks and planes. When I logged in, I found out I was permanently banned. Support just told me the same thing, that I was banned due to cheating and they couldn't do anything? So I guess after years of not playing they'll just randomly ban you or something. 

I did get an e-mail months back about someone in another country attempting to log in, but the key went to my e-mail and my e-mail hasn't been compromised at all. I'm not sure how bad the security is on Gaijin's side that apparently allowed someone to still get on my account and use cheats on it? 

Why waste your time? It's an awful grind and if you want of the later tanks or planes you'll have to pay a lot or grind for hundreds/thousands of hours. I have 1,000 hours played and I still dont even have the final planes or even mid game tanks, it just takes forever. And now I guess I'll never get to see what they're like anyway, it's not like I'm going to waste any time on a new account,"

Warthunder is a grind-simulator, but for those who enjoy the grind, and those who enjoy the general combat of Warthunder (and those bold people who go to max tier and bomb MBTs with biplanes), Warthunder is fun. Personally, my experience has been a roller coaster and i'd recommend this game to anyone up for the challenge, and believe me, it is a challenge."

13052,SUPER GREAT GAME SUPER RELATIVISTIC
13053,"It is a good game. It is frustrating because it takes so long to grind to the last vehicles in a tree. But, if you want a pretty good tree throughout every tier, play Russia. They are easily the best tree, with a lot of pretty much the same vehicle. Also, this game is pretty much unplayable unless you buy premium time. While it is possible to play without it, I wouldn't recommend it in the higher tiers. Vehicles take longer and longer to unlock and upgrade so the premium time helps a lot. Overall pretty good game."

The perpetual growth of vehicle content is amazing, even all these years later. I started in 2013 and have been on and off this game on an 18 month cycle of love/hate, but I always come back.

Now i have 37 hours, and ive only just reached level 2 tanks, there are 6 tiers, and to the tanks you want to play with, you have to use terrible tanks, for me, I want to use the M4 Sherman, but for that I have to use american tanks in tier 1 and 2, which FUCKING SUCK. The Germans get automatic tank cannons in tier 1 and they shred american tanks. And there is no balancing what so ever, I shot a tank, in its back armour, with an anti tank gun in the m3 lee, and it didnt penetrate, a massive anti tank gun, the thing that its sole purpose is to destroy tanks, couldnt penetrate rear armour. Most of the overpowered tanks are locked behind $15aud paywalls, which most of us cant afford. The A10 warthog, which right now is on the banner of the game in library and in store, you need to pay $90aud to get it, I wouldnt mind at this point, if the devs made it so the game cost $15, and made all the tanks free, but instead they make the game free, and give people with access to their mummys wallets all the fun tanks. For a ""realistic"" game, they sure made it unrealistic as possible, tell me how a massive tank destroyer, shoots a HE round at a jeep, it gets set on fire, the people on the autocannon on the back are wiped out of existence the cannon still somehow turns around, shoots one bullet at me, disabling my cannon, shoots 30 more at me and I die, with a fucking jeep A FUCKING JEEP fine enough to be repaired and driven again, when the whole thing was up in flames. I am trying my absolute hardest to love this game, but it is so stupid, horrible balancing, paywall tanks, $90 for a plane that is used for advertising the game.

13123,been playing since 2015 across several PCs and steam accounts. Surprised it's still going strong! Always a blast
13124,It's war thunder... I figure that's all there is to say at this point.
13125,stupid ass game
13126,ye
13127,Are you ready to become a wallet warrior?
13128,amazing
13129,"I hate War Thunder.
It's my favourite game."
13130,"It's alright, kinda mid, wouldn't spend more than 10 hours on it"
13131,"Absolute ass. Been online for 10 years and spawn camping is a serious problem. You could put dozens of armor piercing shells onto a single target and not kill them, but very often get one shot yourself. Too inconsistent to be enjoyable.

Target Undamaged."
13132,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
13133,"Although I have enjoyed many hours of this game, it has come to the point where Gaijin cares no more about the player base. Only showing vehicles you want that you'll never get, either from the horrible grind you'd have to do or the removal of the vehicle. If you want to enjoy playing this just do custom games with friends or keep the game open and test drive vehicles you'll never get."
13134,pain
13135,nice game.
13136,"This is the most frustrating game i have ever played. The game doesn't even make sense. My Jumbo 150mm penetration shell can't penetrate a tigers 100mm armor at perfect angle. CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THE F DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? This game is a total waste of your life. I FUCKING HATE TIGERS. IF YOU ARE USING A TIGER I HOPE YOU KYS

The gameplay goes something like that:

You spawn and drive for 5 mins.
Then you finally spot a tiger and shoot.
The shot does absolutely nothing despite hitting it's weakspot at perfect angle.
The tank starts turning it's cannon slowly in your direction.
You start rethinking your life choices.
You alt+f4 before that broken piece of shit shoots.

And you repeat


I can't think of one person who would want to go through this torture
Please save your time and mood."
13137,"2000+ hours into this game on various consoles, probably over a grand as well all throughout 4 years. Some of my best memories are in this game, some amazing times alone and with friends. If you like airplanes I simply cannot recommend this game enough, a childhood dream come true."
13138,"Nyooom is very fun
But the spectating still sucks please fix it"
13139,Pay to win like never before

13162,its aight but its a grind like always
13163,"You will get upranked like crazy, team mates that seemingly have no spacial awareness and enemies that play like a hivemind, but on the off chance you don't get upranked or get the coveted downrank, this game is fun.
oh, also you will have to pour blood, sweat, tears and hours upon hours of grinding to get good tanks. Have fun and be prepared to sacrifice your time, family and wallet to the Snail TM."
13164,guns go shoot boom!
13165,gud

13177,Great game! and great team who is behind this game bringing out improvements almost everyday + new features
13178,Well game
13179,They want your money and they not taking NO as answer D:
13180,Only use german tanks coz im not special
13181,i like tanks and it's sum what realistic
13182,"Great, just a shame that its still inaccurate because they didnt use the leaked British files to make it better xD"
13183,pp
13184,"This game absolutely needs a ""ground vehicles only"" mode, so that tank players are no longer forced to act as defenseless target practice.
Until then, no positive review from me."
13185,"gaijin know's what they're doing, it's a frustrating game due to the the money mechanics but it's so much fun to play!"
13186,"Everyone says the grind gets really slow as you move up the tiers which I can already tell is absolutely true even though im only in tier 3. Although this is true, if you are more into the vehicles of the WW2 era, you can find plenty of enjoyment unlocking the tier 1-3 for each country instead of going to the later tiers as I have."
13187,"If you got an extra head, then go ahead and play it! Because with only one you wouldn't be able to stand after the first 10 hours of gameplay.

what the grind does to a dude"
13199,if you like pain and suffering this is for you
13200,"I don't know, it can be the most fun game in the world then 10 seconds later you're throwing your PC off of a building because of some BS, but I digress. It can be fun but it also isn't and it will make you a worse person. I used to not rage at video games, but THIS GAME has changed that I think I'm genuinely a more frustrated person now. Play at your own risk, some of my favorite gaming moments have been from this game, and some of my absolute worst can be from this game. I just wouldn't recommend this game, but if you're into gouging your eyes out and ripping out your air then go for it."
13201,UNBALANCE TANK !!
13202,no
13203,very fun
13204,The battle rating compression and odd buffs to Russian vehicles makes the game unplayable these days.
13205,Good game... if you ignore the packet loss problem
13206,"in the little time i tried this game, its a complete cycle of pain and suffering, the snail will take over your life and make it miserable until the day you day.

overall its cool tho"
13207,"tank go boom, rocket aids
"
13208,best game ever
13209,I understand it's F2P game but... MICROTRANSACTIONS!
13210,"War Thunder is a game I love, but also hate with a passion.

It has solid game play, the vehicles and planes are modelled brilliantly and look fantastic. They use damage models rather than a HP meter like in World of Tanks. Which means that when you shoot a tank, if you penetrate the armour you damage the components inside as well as injure the crew.

This means as an example that if you hit the ammunition you can explode a tank outright. If you kill the crew members until their number is less than 2 then the tank is also considered destroyed. However this is where you'll likely face your first issues with the game. The damage system works well enough, but sometimes your shell just doesn't do what it's meant to do. Sometimes you'll experience a 'Ghost shell' which is where it basically disappears without doing anything. Other times you'll hit a tank and penetrate it but everything will get absorbed by the optics. It doesn't take a genius to work out that a piece of bullet proof glass being hit by a tank shell would not absorb the shrapnel.

The game itself has several modes to play, with the focus being the multiplayer options. The single player portion of the game is woefully outdated. Some of it even being unplayable or impossible to complete due to game updates. Gaijin wont fix this however as single player doesn't make them money.

The game also has several nations to choose from; USA, Germany, USSR, Britain, Italy, France, Sweden, Japan, China and the recently added Israel.

Although as far as I understand it, Israel is a premium only nation right now as it requires you to buy a premium tank before you can even start working on the normal tech tree. It's also worth noting that the nations considered 'Minor' like France, Sweden, Italy and China tend to borrow tanks and planes from other nation tech trees, to help fill gaps and to represent lend lease agreements countries had between one another during times of war. Despite this, Minor nations can have large gaps in their tech trees making the grind to the next BR level even more of a pain.

The matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired as does Gaijin's form of balance. They compress the BRs too much which means that WW2 tanks face things from future era's. You'll find yourself regularly uptiered in a match which can make things even more of a pain, and a struggle to be enjoyable.

The game is freemium, which means free to play but with premium options. However Gaijin has balanced the game and it's rewards in such a way that it essentially pushes players to buy premium or premium vehicles. You'll not notice this in the lower tiers, but as you start climbing through the tech trees you'll start to find the costs for repairs and just vehicles themselves increase exponentially on the previous tier.

This also means that as you climb the tiers, having a bad game or even having a mildly successful game will still land you negative Silver Lions due to repair costs, restocking ammunition and so on. Sometimes even having a really good game can still net you negative silver lions if the vehicles you took out had extreme repair costs. Oddly this seems to affect the minor nations the most, as a lot of the better players seem to play them which means overall the vehicles get better statistics so Gaijin 'balances' the vehicles out with higher br's and higher costs.

This makes the game an extreme grind. As an average free player you either slowly hemorrhage Silver lions at higher tiers or buy premium to try to compensate the loses. Although sometimes even having premium wont do this.

I understand that developers need to eat and need cash. But War Thunder was one of if not the most profitable online game within recent memory. And Gaijins game design and money grabbing tactics are predatory, and deliberately make the game a grindy, unfun, buggy mess.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone to pick up and start playing. Unfortunately it already has it's hooks into me, but I shall not give the snail a single penny. 

You can still be a profitable game developer and make money with a good game. Unfortunately the Snail has taken the greedy route and it's drastically affected the quality of their product and what it's user base experiences."
13211,"Been playing since 2013 but at this point I can't recommend anyone play this much less buy anything. It was once a solid and fun game, but constant pushes for more monetization, the lack of Battle rating decompression, the economy being nerfed to push towards an even more frustrating experience if you don't pay money for a talisman and premium time, it's become a shell of it's former self. It's designed to be frustrating and the top tier things most people want is behind such a long grind that you almost have to buy one of the high tier premiums to progress at a reasonable rate."
13212,"Frankly, not worth it."
13213,"Make me want to take a bath with a live toaster sometimes, but other times is fun
"
13214,plane crash :(
13215,"This game sucks you will hate it
"
13216,"it is cool
"
13217,great game full of piss taking babies jk lol
13218,This game makes me hate my fucking life
13219,grate game
13220,gut
13221,"i have a totale of around 10k hours in this game so i believ i have a far abilty to make a decit comment 
and no most my play time i did not have the game insulled on steam thats why it below 3k


that being said there are historical inacurecys in the game that are known by many the game is very heavy RUSS byise condisdering its a russian game company if you are looking for a game that has a chanlenging learning curv and a lot to learn not just 3 to 10 things warthunder is a great start.

if your a milsim DCS player this is not for you unless you are wanting a little more arcade esk game that being the case i wouls say try the sim mode or RB you will feal right at home already knowing the basic idea of flying a aircraft"
13222,There is so many cool stuff you can do.
13223,very good geam cna shoot gun
13224,Though the game can be really fun the constant up-tier issue has been completely unresolved and company has repeatedly ignored HUNDREDS of reports about the issue they refuse to listen and have continued to display lack of care for the community base.
13225,game!
13226,"pretty good game, sorta p2w though"
13227,"Very realistic game, really big choice of vehicles and a lot of fun, maybe the most modern generation of vehicles is missing"
13228,its good
13229,great game  if you have no life.
13230,very fun but very long
13231,"Great WW1 - Present war game, got really good physics and controls. 9/10"
13232,"So amazing, rubber wheels are cannon proof and you are unstoppable since the dev's did not patch it."
13233,"Get ready for a rough grind. World of Tanks isnt even this rough of a grind and somehow in this game there is all kinds of weird goings on (cheating) that make it infuriating to play, enemies somehow spot you and one shot you from clear across the map, shooting through the terrain, constantly being one shot killed while it takes you 5-10 shot to do damage, enemies disappearing and reappearing in time to one shot you. Oh and dont worry about where to go with everyone constantly spamming the ""attention to the map"" button, spawn camping. 
Pass on this unless you want to be tortured, or you got deep pockets to pay to win."
13234,"been playing since 2013 on the PS4 and transferred to PC only recently, I think that as long as you don't focus on grinding, you will have fun"
13235,idk why i spend my time on it
13236,it is it worth
13237,good
13238,VWERY GOD
13239,I've been waiting to play this game for seven years and it was worth the wait. I love anything to do with military history.
13240,I age 1 year whenever I play a match
13241,"The Russian Bias is real in this game 100%, shooting any of the T34's with 76mm+ and getting a ""it didnt go through"" constantly.
The grind is absolutely horrible in this game, everything requires an exuberant amount of research and silver lions(one of a few currencies.)  
It gets worse as you get higher tier, you almost 100% need a paid account just to go over the repair bills and cost of ammunition in this game.  Lets say you get 1000 research points a game, its more than likely around 500 for average, it will still take you 50+ games in one tank to research the next one.  
Example:  Tiger II requires 82k research, have fun grinding 82 games.
This game desperately needs a Ground Battle ONLY mode.  Aircraft get their own mode, tanks needs their own as well.  Especially for the reasons listed above!
What made me uninstall this game is the players that drive face first in, right off the back, so they can die and jump in their aircraft and drop bombs on spawn, then when they die...they just spawn the same plane to drop more bombs on spawn."
13242,pain
13243,i
13244,"Really fun. 
The only thing I would say that's it takes up a lot of disk space"
13245,i just like tanks and fighter jets and war thunder's community is pretty good
13246,"The damage modeling is superb, but the grind is real. The models are very detailed however, overall there's no game like it and I enjoy it! Be careful you will end up spending money on this if you get at all serious.

Don't play for the grind play because you enjoy the combat or you will have a bad time."
13247,"Free games = pay to win + personal data mining.

The game is unplayable, grinding for better war machines is senseless against full paid arsenal that older players have."
13248,"One of the few games I can think of that aren't fun, but let you delude yourself into having fun by making others miserable."
13249,cool game if you want to sell your soul. 10/10
13250,plane
13251,ye
13252,its more fun than u think and if u get bored just switch to sea air or ground
13253,if you hate life and fat campers and long range no life snipers play the game
13254,good game bit unfair at times with the battle rating and an endless grind
13255,Great game if there would be less Stugs
13256,hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate
13257,i mean yeah
13258,"This game has serious balancing issues, so unless you are up for a very slow, tedious, and painful grind, then don't expect to have much fun. In the 400 hours I have played this game, I still have not unlocked a top-tier vehicle, for context."
13259,it is no fun jackhax (frankgrimes69) sucks
13260,I'm not sure why game developers think that making the new player experience as painful and close to actual hazing as possible is a good idea..... does Gaijin not understand that more players usually = more profits in gaming?  Because the game is not at all encouraging for a new player... very much the opposite.  The game seems like it has some potential for a decent experience but as it sits it is a massive turn off after 20-30 games.  I'll play a while longer to see if there is any improvements to my skill level that can help the very unwelcoming and unforgiving experience so far....  but I cannot honestly tell anyone that they would enjoy this game as a new player.  Really slow and frustrating experience so far.  Been playing video games for 30+ years.  I started on a NES.
13261,"yes, but now I have depression"
13262,PAIN... just PAIN
13263,Fun actoin pacted game with lot of things to do. one thing i have to say that it is vary griddy
13264,progression is slow and playing without a friend can often be frustrating but i do really enjoy this game and recommend you at least download it.
13265,Absolutely love the game
13266,"i like it, shit serves tho"
13267,good game
13268,
13269,Try your best to have fun at this game and you'll have a good time grinding. (impossible btw)
13270,playing war thunder is like having a chronic crack addiction
13271,I enjoy playing this game quite addicting hahaha
13272,ITS VERY GOOD
13273,:(
13274,Realy cool game and some one help me get 90
13275,"Best strategy + war game
"
13276,game good
13277,Shit gaem
13278,"where do i even start, players that are very experienced playing tier 1.3, i have completely stock tanks and dont know the maps, its impossible to get to know the maps when i get killed 30 feet from spawn by some sweaty player that has been playing since the game started. i can spend 5 minutes driving into position just to get one shotted by some guy across the map, no communication from teammates, planes killing you from out of nowhere, since i dont have the shells researched and i got uptiered i guess i cant pen anything, no possibility to even learn weak points because i get killed from halfway across the map before i even try to shoot them or even see them. Overall just makes for a really shitty gaming experience where it feels like im grinding with very little reward with everything stacked against me, and why would i continue to play a game like that when there are just frankly better games out there. This one is obviously not geared towards new players in the slightest and its like banging your head against a wall."
13279,"Fulfills my childhood dream of a multi-player combat flight sim. Also, there's tanks and ships too, I guess."
13280,"The grind is far too long for it to be enjoyable. Playing for fun will eventually run you out of SL, and balancing is practically nonexistent. While fun at times, it's definitely a P2W game. At times it seems like Gaijin designed things specifically to piss you off."
13281,I wanna kill myself
13282,so good
13283,"This is a really good game as a flight/tank/ship simulator. It surpasses all other sims on the market (like Wargaming). Attention to detail is great. You see pilots/crew/etc in your vehicles. BUT

THE GRIND IS INSANE. I have played War Thunder for years. I have the Old Guard title. I play a few games a week. I am NOWHERE NEAR unlocking high tier vehicles. Also, the more you progress up the tiers, the more frequently you will die and have to quit. You cannot effectively casually play each technology tree as a casual/F2P player. If you are F2P you HAVE to focus on ONE: planes/tanks/ships. You cannot focus on more, and the higher you go the quicker you get killed instantly and cannot respawn. To reiterate: THE GRIND IS INSANE. The game advertises jets and modern tanks etc but you can only get these if you play the game 24/7 and run meta builds.
HOWEVER it is a nice game to jump in for WW2 enthusiasts to fly a plane about in Realistic battles for a bit, take off and land etc. Not worth keeping installed if you don't want to do any more than this"
13284,I like the general idea of this game and the graphics are well done
13285,"war thunder? more like DEPRESSION, haha.."
13286,"Kinda fun at best, unplayable at worst"
13287,Terrible.
13288,"Overall, its an excellent game. 

What I love most:
No ""hit points""! Vehicles are comprised of their mechanical components, plus their  human crew. The game teaches you to think critically about vehicles and machines. I've found some IRL benefit from this. 

This game has a lot going for it. Lots of wonderful little details. It's polished, and fine-tuned, and an amazing experience."
13289,WW2 Panzer commander simulator. 10/10 transmissions not good enough to climb gradients
13290,great game and its freee!!! so much content when you start it is hard start because people are more advanced but you can catch up!
13291,good game except the grind is real
13292,daddy augh
13293,i have been playing every now and then since 2013 and find this game stressful becuase if you dont have a ton of money your suddently in the movie castaway
13294,"I play world of tanks for a long time. Ever since the game got broken I think its time for a change and oh boy it was a change.
I was recommended to this game and my friend yelled at me ""because you must suffer, as I has suffered"". Sounds like a Nicaraguan drug lord in a certain fps game. But anyway it was easy at the first 1-2 ranks and then the suffering starts to get into my funding's of silver lions and a useless shit amount of extra research points with a leftover of 2 golden eagle. I can see why war thunder is full of meme worthy moments than world of tanks. Highly recommended but with a cost of your sanity and self control."
13295,BEANS
13296,best online game! you should instsall it right now
13297,"This is a game if you have a love for tanks and planes. If not don't waste your'e prescious time on this game. Ps .... Dont play Battleships, It sucks"
13298,"Very grindy but also has fun gameplay, worth if you enjoy a grind and also ""realistic"" battles"
13299,It is just not fun.
13300,"War Thunder jumped me in an alley and took my wallet


10/10"
13301,"this game made me want to eat a bowl of glass, strongly recommended"
13302,"It is a ok game, it would be great if not for all the Bugs. I have a fast system with plenty of memory, but the game just keeps on freezing up then goes then freezes up again and on and on and on. C'mon Devs fix it and maybe people will start buying as for now it is not worth anything, but gives a lot of aggravation."
13303,i love the game
13304,Yes
13305,WARRR

13311,best game ever
13312,i hate this game do not play it it will ruin your life it has consumed me every single second im not playing war thunder im thinking about playing war thunder and when im playing war thunder all i can think about is how much i hate this game get out of my head
13313,Pain
13314,"A very fun game overall as long as you enjoy it as it is and not dedicate your soul to it, recommended

9/10"
13315,"Good game i would recomed fun
"
13316,Considering the game is free to play (paying for premium unlocks higher scores and abilities compared to the free version) its well worth your time downloading it and giving it a go. The gameplay is well paced and doesn't feel slow or plodding and the multiplayer aspect adds a great dimension to the experience as well. The fact that it keeps getting updates in the form of bug fixes and new vehicles and skins is very promising too. Well worth your time.
13317,it good
13318,"frustrating game if you ply for 2 years streight
still a noice game"
13319,for those who have no soul i would highly recommend
13320,"Total:
2206 vehicle, 
0.9B SL(0.6B for purchase, 0.3B for modification, crew training fee not included), 
0.4B RP(0.2B for purchase, 0.2B for modification)
Average income per game: -15k to 50k silver lions, 0 to 10k RP, 5 to 30 MIN
HOW MANY MATCHES U NEED TO UNLOCK ALL VEHICLES AND THEIR MODIFICATIONS? CALCULATE IT! 
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. FIND YOUR LIFE AND DON'T WASTE TIME ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
13321,monke approve
13322,"Fun game, has its lumps but is better than World of Tanks by a long shot"
13323,"Alot of fun. Low tier is so much fun, but when you start to go up in tier (9.0-11.0) gets too untactical. For example in air battles, you usually only get kills from aam instead of 'dogfighting'.

fucking love this game. HIGHLY recommend it!"
13324,AWESOME GAME 5 STARS
13325,"verey godd game
"
13326,very good and a grate addition to the world
13327,This game is so good not really much else to say. I may be bias as I love world war era vehicles and being able to play them is just amazing especially as you progress to more current vehicles but if you love flight sims you will like it and try simulator battles as that gives you the closest experience to real life battles without having to get a huge set up.
13328,Play this game only if you want to pour over 200 hours into it and waste all your life savings. Overall 8/10!
13329,if you want tier 6 you either got to be a milioner or spend 1000h on this game
13330,This is a very good game!
13331,"gun go boom
"
13332,"Played for a long time on the Gaijin client instead of Steam. Just a warning to everyone, this game has the worst economy system in a video game I have ever seen, some of the most atrocious balancing, the absolute worst servers with the worst desync I have ever seen, one of the most toxic playerbases, and the most rampant bugs I think I have ever seen. Yet, like stockholm syndrome, I can't stop playing"
13333,I LOVE WAR THUNDER
13334,You can actually tell how suicidal a person is based on their play time of this game.
13335,Neat
13336,Yeah good but I don't have a life
13337,Grindy but definetly worth it.
13338,It hurts so good
13339,this game is fucking garbage do not play it
13340,Monkey :P
13341,"I only have 235 hours in War Thunder currently. The highest tech tree I have climbed is China ground forces to Battle Rating 6.0. Ground forces are easier to climb through, but getting past this point is a long grind. I've bought premium and golden eagles only for the boost to RP. The tanks and planes are not really that great that come in the packs. All the good packs are AT LEAST $50. That being said, the one tank that I actually would by is $350 on Gaijins auction website. Air forces are hard to grind through and Naval is very slow. If you don't have a good plane to bring into ground RB you might as well not even take a plane.

I would not recommend this to someone who has never played before. There are better games out there that have a lot better tactical elements and you can actually work together with other players. There is no ranked play, so if PhlyDaily comes into a 2.0 match with a premium tanks to give viewers a review of that tank that day, you're screwed. Don't think that because you are in a rank I tank with reserves that you are learning with everyone else. There are always rank 100 players in every match ending new players games before they even see the round coming.

It's frustrating because I want to enjoy this game but the devs make it almost impossible. And I've dumped too much money in the game to set it aside. Dear reader, I hope you don't make the same mistake so many other have made. Do not play this game and sacrifice your hard earned money and sanity."
13342,"Like most people, I hate this game. Partly  for allowing some of the most remarkable cheating shots that: fly through walls, corners of houses and cliffs to perform a one-shot kill of my 5.3 Tiger tank by a 2.0 Stanley Steamer aiming 41 degrees off to my left. I hate it because then I can't respawn fast enough to drive to Stanley's last known position, line up a kill shot but get surrounded by bombs from a plane I never heard and blown to hell right after I fire but before I can enjoy seeing the hit. Then enduring the agony of waiting to respawn to have an even slower tank but I quickly one-shot 2 very distant tanks causing such love for this magnificent game and hateful experience. And repeat"
13343,spare your sanity
13344,"Don't play this game if you value your sanity, time and wallet. The F2P approach is basically unplayable (you'll be grinding a tech tree for months, if not years), repair cost is absurd and unfair.
You have the money to try a Premium approach? You must be a billionaire, because that's incredibly expensive to mantain even for a few months.

War Thunder is a F2P until it isn't."
13345,"If you're in a good mood, it's great!
If you're in a bad mood, just give up. Just stop it, don't touch it.

The game has a LOT of grinding for new vehicles so if thats not your thing then again, don't touch it.

But killing enemys is just too satisfying to stop playing it..  •￢•"
13346,good game grind too long tho
13347,заебист

13349,Solid game. Lots of fun being able to operate multiple generations of airplanes and tanks from different sides of history. All while the game is free.

13355,I think i have cancer... Send help Please!
13356,Fun
13357,"There are bugs, but it is high quality 9/10."
13358,"please help. im am stuck in the grind and it doesn't let me go, why do i still want to play? 
I dont know what i am doing anymore, i am not me"
13359,cry
13360,"In short, do not play this game. It is unrewarding, unfun, unfair and, most of all not worth anyone's time. Just relax, don't download it and keep watching other players play it on Youtube/Twitch instead.

Unless you have a Premium Account, you will not progress through the game at a good place. (Also, trust me, you WILL NOT get any Premium Account time for free, no matter if you have been for A LOT of time or you just logged in and are ready to get your welcoming bonus of a POS vehicle, hat you will play on once and then forget it exists)

At the lowest ranks, you will feel like it take a bit of work to get a new vehicle. Yet, once you will start getting clsoer to first MBTs and IFVs, the game gets ungodly bad. It can't even be called grindy anymore, because you will literally be spending more SL than you can make with a good KD, even if you win. Speaking of that, even if you will be doing great, helping your  teammates and keep winning, sometimes you will be loosing money. Yeah, even if you win. To be completely honest, I do not care how much anyone will say ""Repair Cost"", punishing people even for winning, just because they died to some ATGM-enduced cancer too many times is too much.

Your teammates will be braindead 70% of time. They will not help you, they will not do the objectives properly. Only sometimes will you get teammates, that are actually healthy-minded and know a word ""Teamwork"".

Your enemies will always have some kind of wonderwaffle, that you will not be able to fight properly or fight at all. Tiger 2 (H), T34, Ikv-91, E.B.R and etc. And although it is satisfying to kill them, most of the time you will not be able to do anything about them, because they are too far/hiding in the bushes on your flank/teammates will just straight up let them pass and get close to you.

The gameplay: Drive forward for ~3-5 minutes, get shot from a hill, covered in bushes ~2KM away, die. That's it. The same for Air Battles. Fly for 5 minutes. Realise, that there is an enemy above you and that their climbing rate and energy is much higher than yours, get a half of your wing snapped off/Pilot knocked out or some other rubbish, return to the hangar.

Although I have almost none of the hours here, on Steam, I ahve played for about a 1000 hours in total. All I got to were T-44-100 and T-54."
13361,"10/10 experience, would spend half my life and money getting to the jets again"
13362,this game is amazing sure there are some sweats here and there but the grind to get to the top is fun look i'm still rank one and i'm having a blast the mixture of ww1 and ww2 and cold war(sorry for all the and's) and now a'day fighter's is fun play it
13363,how to stop playing
13364,"eh, its decent"
13365,A pay to play game. If you don't plan on buying in-game stuff with real money. Don't buy this game. It is a shame they ruined such a good game with pay to play crap
13366,I believe I can fly
13367,Fajna gierka!
13368,"I dont really play this game too often, but its a really well made game. The graphics are really good and the things you can do in the game are really cool. The controls are very simple too. The tutorial is very straightforward and quick."
13369,Pretty reasonable as a free player. At least for the first few dozen hours
13370,"PAY2WIN... AND ZERO BALANCE, I WAS LEVEL 5 PLAYING AGAINST LEVEL 50 WITH TANKS THAT THEY BOUGHT FOR 60-80 EUROS .... SO THE GAME IS FREE TOO PLAY BUT PLAYING WITHOUT SPENDING REAL MONEY IS LIKE BEING A BOT IN THE GAME FOR THOSE WHO SPEND REAL MONEY OR 8+ HOURS A DAY IN THE GAME."
13371,Grind so hard it's like a drug addiction. I love it.
13372,"fun
"
13373,A very nice game
13374,muy bien
13375,"Very, very steep learning curve, do not attempt to buy your way to the higher tiers if you lack experience, you will die a LOT (You will have way more deaths than kills) and be a hindrance to your team, especially if you only bring one vehicle to a match. Wait until you've researched a vehicle of roughly the BR of the vehicle you want to purchase first, you want to bring multiple vehicles of a similar BR to battle and you will be more experienced by then. The grind is very long, you will have plenty of time to get experienced enough to play these vehicles. Once you have figured out how to play, it can be pretty fun unless you get unlucky and die or miss kills to things outside of your control. Would overall recommend if you enjoy military vehicles and are willing to get through the learning period. Would not recommend if you have a history of raging in games, this game is easily one of the most rage inducing games I've played when things aren't going well in your match."
13376,I love the historical accuracy.
13377,The grind will make you wanna kys
13378,russian bias is big pls nerf big sad
13379,fuck you
13380,funny
13381,"It is a great game, just be careful to not spend all of your money on golden eagles."
13382,dont play unless you want to simulate being tazed in the balls while being slapped. 10/10 would not recommend to people who dont want to throw away their lives
13383,siiiiiiiiickkkk.....
13384,"Really the only game to get quality semi-realistic vehicular combat in on a large scale, I've honestly dumped at least $1500 maybe even $2000 into premiums and premium time and can't say that I regret it. This game fills a huge part of what I want in games and you can have loads of fun playing it by yourself or goofing around with some friends"

13409,its nice
13410,"Low tiers are fun, higher tiers become more competitive and there is a good amount of grinding in between. However, the grinding can go quicker by using research boost items. You can earn those items by completing daily battle tasks and challenges. Fun game to relax. More than enough content with no need to pay to win. There are pretty cool paid content too though, like vehicle camouflage (which really works), etc."

13454,the game itself is pretty fun. The business model surrounding it is incredibly toxic. Personally I enjoy the game in small doses but I cannot recommend it to anyone else in good conscience.
13455,"it's utter bollocks, definitely would play another 1000 hours"
13456,has france
13457,not worth the grind
13458,"cannot be recommended as long as the economy is made to be predatory and force you to make purchases.

13467,:D
13468,I have played this game for a while now and all it has made me reaize is that all the pain and suffering that grinding demands hardly rewards you. HIGHLY SUGGEST!
13469,good
13470,pretty cool
13471,"If ur looking for a nice, fun, non-agrivating game to play, then go look somewhere else, this game will make you go insane. 1007 hours in, and I've just barely started to get top tier USA vehicles, in the ground tree only. but if you are addicted to pain and suffering, then play this game, but don't say I didn't warn you."

Will keep playing it though"
13475,ok
13476,e
13477,pretty good game
13478,If you want to know what its like having depression without actually getting depression then I totally recommend this game to you. 100% of the time I play this game after each match I turn into a complete rage machine and can ruin any ones day without regret and will sleep like a baby later.
13479,well its crap but playable
13480,plane
13481,Just don't do it.

That the developers add the Doolittle raid planes dus thanking and taking historys bravest further into the roots of this game

13484,"Not gonna lie to you, this is the MOST pay to win game I have EVER seen Gaijin shit out their arse yet. every game is killing maybe 1-2 guys and immediately getting obliterated due to some PtW dickwad with the strongest Plane/tank in the lobby, only because they spent an extra $60. With that said, the game In itself is great. most fun I had on those rare games where nobody wanted to pay money. 4/10, do NOT recommend."
13485,soosi
13486,"Hits front hull. Round shatters and destroys my aux machine gun on top of tank, doesn't damage one crew member or important module. Tank explodes magically. I shoot someone fifteen times and they still don't explode. Feels just as rng biased as every other game alike. I do not understand how people praise this game so much.

Don't buy prem time either, you just get trolled ten times worse. Had a really successful day yesterday, things felt relatively normal until I was doing too good and then started getting one shot constantly or couldn't kill anything. Same thing is happening today, put multiple shells that were kills yesterday on the same tanks and nothing. Not even damaging crew members or important modules. However, when I get hit the shell shatters in such a way that all the fragments go straight at my entire crew and ammo rack. Seriously, steam needs to drop this game and any ""freemium"" games alike. These European scammers need the boot.

To give context, I'm already at the T34-KV-1-SU-152 area and just started playing Russian yesterday.

They tweak hidden parameters within the match, which doing so without any context should be considered illegal because it's false advertisement. Also they have hacked my gpu driver multiple times just like WG does because they're salty little cry babies and oppressors when you might be too good at their game.

Don't spend money either, tested it twice with a week of prem time. Everything is normal without, teams balanced, games actually fun. As soon as I bought prem time I was getting trolled. Matches make no sense, your team is clueless, make you play +1 constantly in stock tanks on maps you've never played on. Won't let me kill even if I hit every single part of the ammo rack or kill their entire crew, teammate sneezes on them after I've literally put five or more shells in them. They auto die. Getting killed and penned in places that always bounce for me. Moral of the story, don't spend money on this game. 

I will never understand why companies like this are so bent on pissing their paying customers off. I enjoy supporting games I enjoy. Not anymore, I'll be a free mooch like most other people.

Alright, now that I finally think I've played enough to get a better scope. I stand by everything I said as it occurred and did so more and more frequently. I finished with over a 10k SL, and 1200 kills, and what I still consider to be over a 60% WR because today I have played at rank 5.7-6 and had teammates with double digit SL's constantly (literally 36 SL) while playing against at least somewhat competent players. Been playing over a week and a half and just now today playing on certain maps with an almost constant single base match. They'll ruin your experience at any moment they want. Still had my GPU hacked every day I've played at some point. Don't speak the truth in chat lmao. They can tweak your hidden parameters at any moment. I imagine that correlates with the GPU. This is a spiritually damaging game, as is any game that can tweak your performance. ""Entirely skill based"" lmao. I don't understand who they are lying to, but anyone who actually plays the game semi-decent should know better. If it were skill based, there would be consistencies where there are none."
13487,Would try playing this great game
13488,good game
13489,This game made me lose my sanity and i fell into a deep deppresion. If you dont want to have suicidal thoughts and deep deppresion dont play this game. Lmao

Getting from tier 1-4 is fast, past that you'll need a second life for grinding.
It's nice to play initially as a free game, but it's not worth it in the long run.

Edit: After 222 hours of playtime. I cement my claims further

This game is like heroine.  It's addictive but will ruin your body, mind and soul."
13500,"Game is cool, you have some nice battles in tanks, aviation or naval if anyone plays that.

I was going to get back into this game, bar this issues I have with its long run with shoddy micro transactions and overpowered pay to win vehicles and its new turn to seasonal content. Why in the hell is everything in seasons now? But now that even with well above minimum specs, updated or rolled back graphics and display drivers and combinations thereof the game crashes randomly. Don't waste your time if this starts to happen to you."

13530,high quality but kinda pay to win and you have to grind to get jet powered fighter..
13531,"da e bun , da sa mor cat grinde trebuie sa faci"
13532,"Bad game because it is made by a Russian company, you're led to believe you can get any tank, you can't. It takes months, years, to go through one tree unless you no life the game and can somehow fight against tanks far superior. Like racing a bus against a lambo, fun to watch, why would you bet on it though

To many bugs, not balanced, bad maps but really good models I guess
I drive for 5 minutes just to get shot from a modern tank when I am rocking WW2/cold era tanks who don't even know the meaning of thermals or rangefinders

Early game, it's alright but either you steam roll the enemy or you can't even leave your own spawn. Not to mention a light tank can just rush all the way to your spawn before you get a tenth of the way to an objective within the first minute of the game (It takes at least 10 in a heavy tank to go anywhere)

You will get uptiered (fighting tanks above your rank), when people ask why you play this you will say you don't know why. You will get the urge to spend lots of money, don't, it won't help"

13557,"My regiment which called A3OB was banned. They said that this regiment was recognized by western countries with the United States as a Nazi organization. I paid 1500 golden eagles for the regiment and they didnt return it. Also, my nickname Ukraine_will_win was deleted, apparently because the country of Ukraine, according to the data of the Russian Federation, is also a country of Nazism. Let me summarize. The money was paid, but the moderators removed everything I paid for, ignoring all the rules of the game. And this is despite the fact that there are a lot of players in the game with inscriptions V, X and O. Such inscriptions are used by killers and invaders who came from Russia to Ukraine. We will definitely contact the gaijin office in Budapest to discuss further monetization of the game in European countries"
13558,"everythig in this game is amazing but wtf is wrong with the aircraft controls???? like who tf made the control setups good god., its literally handicapped. ive crashed every goddamn plane using every youtube tuturiol how to set it up and it stillll feels handicapped compared to dcs controls.

13571,love the feeling  of dodging between aircraft and ground enemy ....
13572,GOOD GAME
13573,love the game wish it was easier to get the top planes and tanks ext.
13574,"Its a grind fest once you leave the lower levels. The naval combat is all kinds of broken. The air combat is among the worst I ever saw.

But the game is as addictive as snorting cocaine off a cheerleaders butt-crack. Once you start playing all the broken elements and pay to win reddit losers and nearly impossible controls won't matter one bit.

The sheer thrill of blowing someone up, knowing they are burning alive in their vehicle gets me harder than Ron Jeremy at a Catholic School prom. getting rage hate texts from people as I camp them fills my heart with joy.

This is the best worst experience you will ever have in your life. Go for it!"
13575,its good and well made
13576,gud game :)
13577,This is a fun and very strategic game
13578,good
13579,"would recommend

13580,very nice game
13581,suffer thunder very nice i lick
13582,"The income is too low, and the play is very tired，The progress is very slow, and you must buy a premium account to play"
13583,cool
13584,its very nice :)))
13585,"well its free and thats the only thing going for it. PAY TO WIN, imagine that. of course theres cheaters and hacks n crap. don't waste your time.
"
13586,GG
13587,"i want to die
edit 225 hours: at this point im spending my life savings on this game
"
13588,You wont have fun time grinding if you want to fly more modern jets.
13589,Decided to try the game a lil. Its pretty good I guess
13590,"yeas

13597,HELP
13598,"Heck no, doing progress is tedious, specially in the upper ranks and without premium time. Map design is horrible, it is possible to ""spawn camp"" on most of the maps ( i know there is a spawnprotection but its not really good/helpful).
And don't get me started with the BMD-4..."
13599,memory leak
13600,"happy game with stupid teammate
"
13601,"this game is epic, take your time on going in to kill do not rush it cause they will take you out. awesome game to play solo even better playing with friends. must have game for hours of fun and grr."
13602,"russians tanks are op, stalin is proud 
"
13603,"started playing, got a stuka b-1 (or Ju-87) made the beaches of normandy make like a little kids birthday party.10/10"
13604,This is one of the most greedy and predatory publishers there is.  Do not get sucked in.
13605,YOU WILL GET ADDICT THESE HOURS ARE IN ONE DAY PLEASE HELP
13606,"I admire the realism, but they forgot about making it fun.

I kept on trying, but after 60hrs of play time, its still not fun. The grind only gets worse and worse unless you pay $$ to convert XP and buy Lions. Shame, because it looks great but plays like garbage."
13607,don't
13608,hehe plane go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
13609,gute
13610,DONT DO IT
13611,if anyone even sees this please install this fire game
13612,idk i havent played in 2 years
13613,"I like being killed over and over again and feeling like there must be something wrong with me. I especially love helicopters - never seeing them before they destroy you from miles away and then when you are flying in one, dying immediately after taking off from the helipad from a surface to air missile fired from miles away."
13614,As someone who has spent a good 3years on the game I would say its a great game overall a few bugs here and there but its a great game for the low price of free
13615,"idk, good
"
13616,it is a game just like world of tanks or other world of something games but better its almost like im operating a actual machine of war.
13617,legal
13618,op
13619,"Would recommend this to people who like to smash stuff irl. After playing this for 1 hr you will have the urge to blow up you pc, buy a new one and start the grind again. But overall this is a game that everyone should at least try."
13620,"This game will steal your time or your money--but more than likely: both. I does not matter who you are because one will be taken. I, personally, enjoy this game and would highly recommend that anyone who enjoys the idea of controlling a vehicle from the perspective of God play this game. So that they can watch and see as they utterly annihilated in 4K."
13621,Pain. Agony. Suffering. Unless you play as the Soviets.
13622,IT GOOD
13623,The snail consumes my soul
13624,yes
13625,i like hot baby girl hot dogs
13626,its very good
13627,Cannot recommend incredibly buggy for a game as far along as it is. Multiple times damage indicator from the wrong direction and UI tells you the wrong person is KIA most of the time or wrong part is damaged. Also tanks just dissapear off the screen for no reason.
13628,get killed at spawn from behind you somehow 9/10

13632,this is the best Game
13633,yes
13634,Stay in low BR and you will have a blast.
13635,Its shit. No elaboration needed.
13636,Great game get it its free
13637,"Its a good concept with a terrible company behind it. Not worth the time or money, try Gunner Heat PC and DCS instead"
13638,"Игра дерьма
"
13639,"Pretty good game, but requires very good skill and much time"
13640,Such a great game! I commend it.
13641,i gud
13642,If you are a masochist this is the game for you because it simulates having your dick getting abslutely demolished as if it were in a hydraulic press or being scraped on a cheese grater
13643,fun
13644,"unless the grind changes for the better, i do not recommend getting into the game. also the gameplay is becoming quite boring, the gamemodes have been the exact same for over 6 years and dont seem to change any time soon."
13645,good
13646,"l
"
13647,good...
13648,"I would recommend this game to anyone that likes simulation, arcade, or just likes planes. This game encourages you to how to fly in realistic air-air combat situations. one more reason is just get it"

13653,I love suffering
13654,"This game is both the worst and the best out there. It is the only game that really gives a good feeling of mixed combat with airplanes and tanks. It provides alot of really good airplanes and tanks that are models amazingly, But.. And unfortunatly this game has a butt that is about five C's thick. The grind is terrible, utter and horridly terrible. The first handful of ranks are not bad, but there are two games here really. The original, semi well balanced world war two game in the center, and the cold war era war game that has mutated out of the top tiers. Jets, guided missiles, helicopters, reactive armor, and so much more. I'd love to play with the Mirage, or the Jaguar, heck so many cool top tier tanks and aircraft that require lifetimes of grinding or a bank account of thousands to assist the grind. not to mention that upper tier vehicles require premium accounts or else you will end up in the negatives and unable to repair any of your tanks. not to mention how awful and horrible the naval battles are. 

Honestly between the grind, the obvious attempts to make it pay to play at all, and a corporation that was using youtube trademark strikes to go after anyone showcasing issues or bugs with the game that needed to be fixed, to the ham handed way they handle player issues and problems... just don't the game isn't worth it anymore."
13655,"This is my secondary acc on this game and i hadnt played on this one yet
However i can say that after 1000 hours u will feel more pain than having ur testicles tazed.
I hate this game however it's my favourite.
would recommend it to people who lost their wills to live."
13656,"cool game, steep learning curve and a big grind... can be hard at first but you do get used to it :)
"
13657,This game  is fun but the tryhard make you want to quit
13658,Really good and a fun faawking game!
13659,i like the game but but grind
13660,"The game is good, but the planes in tank battles make this game unbearable
"
13661,"I think it's a fun game & a great concept, however you have to have good rounds or it will be a game of spawncamping."
13662,"Cool
"
13663,"def has different tiers of learning curves but probably the best war game ive ever played, and its free"
13664,
13665,I love this game
13666,"I too, am a raging masochist"
13667,fun
13668,Yeeeees
13669,"WHATEVER YOU DO AND WHEREVER YOU ARE. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. 

THE VOICES IN MY HEAD KEEP GETTING LOUDER, THE SCHIZOPHRENIA MEDICATION DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE I KEEP HEARING DISTORTED SPEAKING SUCH AS. 

-Germany suffers 
-Russian bias 
-overpressure 
-K52 is not OP

my wife left me, my 2nd hoe tossed me aside. I have not touched grass since last christmas and iv'e lost all social interactions to the real world. 

my days consist of spamming skill issue and rip bozo in chat on every T34 that i kill. And spreading confidential tank schematics on the dev blog

THE VOICES ARE GETTING LOUDER."
13670,oh
13671,"If you are a fan of war games I guess this will be a fine free option, but I wouldn't recommend otherwise! 3/10"
13672,"i hate this game
i wanna commit suicide after every fucking game i hate it so much it makes me cry tho i cant stop playing since its addicting its like drugs its not good for you but you still do them 
suggested to everyone!!!!"
13673,"Horrible game just like pearl harbor it really went up in flames
"
13674,10/10 I hate it
13675,A10 warthog go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr but to get this thing you would have to play maybe 3k hours unless you got premium than its like 1k
13676,good
13677,"I too, hate touching grass"
13678,","
13679,send help im in a crippiling addictiom
13680,"If you REALLY want  play this, go SOVIET
none of other country count


& many of other points makes this game don`t worth it"
13681,"I've been a World of Tanks player since Beta, but over the years that game has become stale and there was a lack of new historical tanks to play. I decided to try out War Thunder one day just to experience some of the different historical vehicles that were lacking on WoT. It took a little to get used to the minor differences in gameplay, but once I did I don't think I can ever go back to WoT. War Thunder is IMO overall now a more polished, interesting, historical, fun, and satisfying experience. Graphics and attention to detail is amazing; I mean you can get stuck in mud, your tank gets dirty, and the wind even moves your tanks antenna! As far as vehicles go there is SO many that it is going to take me years to grind through them all. And as far as gameplay goes it is intense, varied, and fun. Granted there can be moments of frustration, but what online multiplayer game doesn't have that?"
13682,very good
13683,Planes go *NYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM* *BYOUGH BYOUGH BYOUGH*
13684,planes and tanbks
13685,takes time and a lot of grinding to get past tier 1 but once you pass that its fun
13686,tank
13687,if you like having an awful time this is the game for you
13688,i freeeeeeecking love this game 1 star out of 1

13690,good.
13691,big grind be ready and buy premium
13692,"TBH I have around 200 hours of this game on PlayStation. It is the only game that I play anymore and I am now downloading it on my computer because y not. Also, I know the grind is bad, but it is 100% worth it once you do it!"
13693,Damn good fun... nough said!
13694,for most fun uninstall the game
13695,"Just, no, it's not worth it. you'll get hooked on the great mechanics of the game and will think it is worth it to grind to the top; it is not. Stop."
13696,"One of those games that is really good on paper. Great graphics, enough detail to be pretty damn realistic, and a great variety of vehicles. Unfortunately Gaijin clearly cares about making money more than anything else. I'm not gonna continually pay money and play with the same tank for 100 hours just to get to the next level. Not to mention you need SL for literally everything in the game, and if you don't pay real money you get next to none. I would play this game a lot more if this developer decided to stop robbing their playerbase blind but for now it is not a system that I wish to use. Also the maps are god awful lol, never played a game with worse maps. All in all Gaijin should sell this game to someone who cares about making a fun video game and not only about filling their pockets."
13697,good
13698,Its just sooooo detailed
13699,packet loss is fire
13700,"Very fun, sometimes being a light tank sucks but it's pretty good game in all"
13701,Want to sign your life away? Want to spend your life wasting time grinding? Come on down to War Thunder! And you can do just that!
13702,epic gaming
13703,The best way to play this game is to have the Suicide Prevention Hotline saved in your contacts while playing this dumpster fire of a game called War Thunder.
13704,Dieses spiel ist.... I mean this game is great.
13705,"This is the worst game I've ever owned. I've tried stress exercises, walking away after every game, doing push ups and sit ups at each death, and even uninstalling. But for some reason I still keep coming back despite the fact that I hate this game. It's an addiction. I'm terrible at playing it, and i'll even play with all my buddies and it's still awful at least 80% of the time.

8/10 I recommend."
13706,"hehe funni plane go shoot
"
13707,very good
13708,"you will hate yourself, but overall very good game"
13709,veri gud geim
13710,Wish i could play ground battles without jets everywhere
13711,"Fun game want to Punch a hole through my monitor most of the time playing, but the satisfaction of getting a kill keeps bringing me back in,"
13712,"great but hard game
"
13713,Friends are good to have.
13714,Suffering
13715,"its a bad game
"
13716,"Most realistic game including ground, air and  sea battles."
13717,"[h1] The game is much more painful than it used to be [/h1]

The game used to be fun. Grinding tanks in fair BRs was fun and what tech tree they offered. Before I even downloaded this game on steam, I already have at least 2-3 years of game time in and I had half fun and half pain. Now that I have 1000hrs+ plus on steam and have been playing the game for an additional 1 1/2 years, everything started to lose sense. There are so many things to name that went wrong. True, some of the players are to be blamed for their rash decisions, but most of them are the game's fault.

Starting with the latest changes. The PUMA and BMP-2M are at 9.3, and the Begleitpanzer and Radkampfwagen are at 9.7 which is understandable and fair enough, however a concern that the TAM is still at 8.7 and not swapped out with the PUMA is infuriating. What would be the purpose of the tank, as by then it wouldn't be useable due to the enemy team already having thermal optics.

Another concern is how long it takes for you to grind up in higher ranks (rank 6 to 7 tanks). I am not the best player, so grinding has been a pain for progression. One thing that I've noticed is with the Israel tank tech tree that the grind for the Tiran 4S and Magach 6 is so painful without the help of a premium vehicle. It was very slow compared to the grind with other nations which I had hoped that the developers would have done something about it.

To not make my comment too long, I will give a dislike to the game. It made me feel like the time, effort, and money has been wasted especially within this month's amount of updates. Not only has the battlepass repeat itself by putting up already existing tanks but with add-ons/different nations, but the recent changes just makes everything much more pointless and painful for an average player like me. However, my review would be changed if and only if some nice changes were to be added into the game. [b]SOMETHING[/b] at least an average player like me would enjoy."
13718,heil hi-
13719,great game but the start is slow and boring and its pay to win but whatever
13720,"plane go brrrrrrrrrrr
tanks go brrrrrrrrrrr
boats go brrrrrrrrrrr
"
13721,Sometimes P2W but its alright
13722,Worst game I ever played
13723,in all honesty its good its just filled with crybabys with no skill.
13724,shit game
13725,Suffering is always FUN...
13726,the best arcade/sim game of the time on my enfd!
13727,"this game is a great fun simulator for flying, and tank battles can and are very competitive but their is a slight problem and that is this game can really give team advantage to Premium tanks (paid with real money) and it can really set an imbalance in what is fair and not. having higher battle rating on lower Tier tanks vs higher Tier due to Premium tanks really sets for an imbalance but alot of the game comes down to doing the research ""that the game yes provieds"" on what tanks are best for what."
13728,"very good game , havent played it that much but its already consuming my life"
13729,pay to win but fun
13730,"its good
"
13731,nice

13742,das gud
13743,Nice game for spending time
13744,They need to fix uptiers
13745,no
13746,"if you still think your life has some meaning then don't ever try this game it's just a torture that you asked for it you become Gaijin's slave Gaijin will sucked all your soul and money out of your body and torture you again also community is on the level that Chernobyl can't be compared it's the worse thing you could do for your own 
                                                                                                                                my best regard"
13747,good
13748,"This is a completely Pay2Win game they don't help you at all in the progress of the game and when you get to the top tier of the game if you are not constantly putting money in the game you just don't play. There could be a balance in the money you receive in-game. I like the game and I even play it from time to time but it's a shame a game with so much potential is so boring. And for now I don't recommend this game because it's a waste of time for those who don't have money to spend. Until they change it, I stand by my opinion."
13749,"this game is absolutely horrible and is like a crack addiction you love it at first but you hate it later but need it to stay alive, this game will make you lose your sanity, the game also makes you want to jump off a cliff."
13750,"buff american trees, theyre extremely underpowered"
13751,yes
13752,"A more toxic relationship than Hollywood marriages. Warthunder is a love - hate game, featuring neat gameplay concepts and mechanics that makes it special. However, with all those nice features and interesting content it suffers from generic business practices that range from slightly annoying... to ridiculously unfair. 

Pros:
-Instead of relying on HP damage systems, Warthunder focuses more into realistic depictions of vehicle warfare via module based damaging where every vehicle part dynamically react to each other. 

If you're interested on a F2P combined arms warfare that focuses into realism- then yes, you would like WT's general gameplay.

-It's not all about realism- what do I mean by that? Warthunder features a simplified control scheme for players, as it mixes realism and arcade-y mechanics quite well. There are also several gamemodes to choose from, the primary ones are Arcade, Realistic and Simulator battles.

-Surprisingly enough, Warthunder has its fair share of fun April Fools events and community content. When you just want to chill and try something new, try out user made skins, mods and even missions. Although personally, I haven't tried out any of the April Fools event.

Cons:
-The very grind-y status of the game. This is pretty much where it starts to go downhill for most players. Warthunder indirectly forces players to use real money to be able to progress smoothly as possible. From the extreme repair costs, vehicle prices and research EXP. This pressures players to spend their money into the game, making up for its F2P business model.

-The removal of certain vehicles for 'realism' on the tech tree, hear me out on this one. Warthunder has been known for their wacky updates throughout time. These include but are not limited to; absurd balance changes, new mechanics, and even the removal/hiding of vehicles. This one is admittedly a bit more nit-picky, however, if you're expecting to see (or play) vehicles that were never produced (or only had prototypes)- well too bad.

Conclusion: Warthunder is something unique, that suffers from your usual business strategies. Overall rating it a TetraFin Flakes Goldfish score of 7/10."
13753,Garbage
13754,yes
13755,HEHE BOI
13756,"its only good if you play it to have fun,only grind when you have to

if your grinding, its a 4/10
if your playing to have fun, its a 8.5/10"
13757,Get to blow up Nazis in tanks. 10/10
13758,Play it
13759,I like planes :)
13760,"I like this game, but I find their disabling of chat and the ""reason"" for doing so disgusting.  They simply will not allow any anti-Russian sentiments to be displayed.  I can't in good faith support devs who encourage censorship."
13761,"Pain, pure pain. 

its my favorite game"
13762,only morons play war thunder. Lamestra of a game
13763,Point shoot miss then die to m22 at rank 3.
13764,its a love and (mostly) hate relationship.
13765,good
13766,bullshit
13767,"game fun, game good, buy game"
13768,Better then WOT
13769,"Personally i wouldnt reccomend i cant close it, help"
13770,"I've been playing for years, and some of my time isn't even listed on Steam. So with all that behind me, what do I have to say?

War Thunder is a hard game to learn if you want to be good from the start. It's not quite a simulator with 60 different keybinds being thrown at you, but over time it has certainly gotten more complex. Inconsistent mechanics and frequent ""balance"" updates can make the ground highly unstable even for more experienced players, depending on what they want out of the game.

What can you get out of the game? Considering how bland the main gamemodes become after a while, it's impressive how well War Thunder remains interesting, with a huge variety of vehicles to use, through different classes of tanks, planes and I guess, if you really wanted, ships, there will always be something to learn, and new ways to challenge yourself.

The grind is heavily reliant on players buying premium vehicles, making some more modern equipment immensely tedious to unlock for free, but the majority of the game is available for free.

In short: If you like war machines of any type, or are looking for an alternative to the standard FPS formula, War Thunder fits the bill, but it won't be without frustration at times. 
Fun, hard to pick up, hard to put down, easy to love, easy to hate."
13771,the game is way too complicated its alright i guess for people that get turned on by planes and that stuff
13772,money
13773,"fun game

13781,at the cost of sanity this game is pretty good
13782,;
13783,balance bad i go to bed
13784,naked women
13785,"Game sucks, I've played it a while. It has it's moments where it can be enjoyable. But over all the game is pretty much a higher quality mobile game with how it tries to take your money. 

I wish the game was better but they make too much money with their current business model.
"
13786,The single worst game I've ever played.
13787,bad
13788,Don't make the mistake I did
13789,It a very good game and is some how free.
13790,gun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
13791,The amount of grinding is insane its kinda gay
13792,epic and ye play it
13793,its fun its and enjoyable
13794,Interesting military arcade
13795,the fact that a light tank can kill a heavy tank in one shot from the front is not realistic. being all the time place against higher br is horrible. finally when u think you are playing a world war 2 tank such as a is4 and u play against bradley tank with guided missile it makes the game so much better. Go fix your game gayjin!
13796,Its a good game. Don't have enough hours to rate fully.
13797,PAIN*
13798,"Very gud game. Snail giveth, snail taketh. Attack the D point. Grammarcy."
13799,nice
13800,good game
13801,good game
13802,they need to do a better job balancing things but all in all its pretty fun at lower tiers
13803,"If your friend suggest you this game,find better frinds
this game is trash"
13804,"You eventually hit a barrier in free to play where you can't progress without losing more, free currency than gaining because of vehicle repairs. 

This is worse than Apple's overpriced products."
13805,"Generaly it's a good game but its a very grindy process to the top, Fortunately grinding can be made fun and shooting some enemies and unlocking new vehicles seems to be vorking out very well for this game. I'd give it something like 8/10."
13806,it is fun
13807,e
13808,cbt in real life and also a big pain in the A!# for anyone who loves that install it
13809,When do I get good?
13810,"It does not launch after installation with the most recent kernel of Fedora Rawhide, but if launched by Proton or previous kernels, it operates well.

The game is fun although its Arcade Ground Battles are intense, and its maps are large enough to adequately fly planes above despite containing impressive detail. However, dissimilarly to World of Tanks, tanks are unrealistically and noticeably slippery when operated."
13811,Peeeeeenus
13812,OK
13813,i love france and i hate japan : )
13814,good game
13815,pretty fun

The grind is so long I could, alternatively, just take up crack and it would probably be better for me than War Thunder.

13833,Chad
13834,Slebeww
13835,"Nice game but riddled with microtransactions , very tough to progress as a free to play player"
13836,this game is cool...it gives the feeling of ww2..though i still confused about the research system...even i play the games hour after hour..and gain research points..bt i didnt see any progress of next tire aircraft's research.
13837,"i have played this game for over three years (on Xbox and now steam) and i can say that the game is not for those who want to play in passing as you'll never really get anywhere and also with the some-what new economy system your constantly broke for silver lions (the main currency in game)  and i feel like the game has gotten progressively worse the past three years but there is also no other game that i feel is like this one. i wouldn't recommend the game to new players but i can see a lot of people still having fun with the game espiccaly if you give giajen (ik thats not how its spelled) your money but i wouldn't

after playing another 300 hr i can still say its still shit"
13838,The pay to win here is worst than fifa
13839,Broken as fuck...
13840,my autism loves the feeling of enemy eliminated!
13841,"Game is fun and all, you could say it's a lot more ""realistic"" than WoT is and the grind is the only cons I can see about this game, it is soul crushing levels of grind. High skill cap and much fun, but also makes your blood pressure go up pass the level of humanly possible. 11/10 for funny stuka sounds."
13842,Fun game
13843,"Fun, long and grindy"
13844,good game pay to win tho
13845,"This game is like your abusive Step-father who no matter how hard you try to avoid him, you always end up going back because he gives you shiny new toys and you're too young to understand what's actually going on. Only replace the abusive step-father with the game telling you a 155mm HE round bounces off the ass end of a KV-1S and you're all set. 

10/10 will suffer and play again."
13846,"dude for the love of the god dont play this game.
this game is not what you thinking"
13847,"its pretty good
"
13848,i just moved from war thunder launcher to here and i just wanna say i love and hate this game
13849,"great game, awful company, no idea how to balance anything

don't play it"
13850,"Play for fun, not for grind. trust me its so much better.  Also the tonk is love the tonk is life"
13851,"Fun, grindy tho, so premium recommend along with some research. Also Ground Rb is the best game mode
"
13852,fun... pay to play kinda sucks for premium vehicles but you can grind for a while to earn better ones
13853,"big fly planes. big boom tank. big swim boat.

13859,if you want to spend your whole lifetime trying to get to top tier and sell your soul to some indian scammer this is the game for you.
13860,"great game
"
13861,"It's fun... but also makes you suffer at up tiers. However, I would not recommend it for players who likely won't be committed to the game. The grind takes forever. Literally."
13862,there is so much pain in it tho
13863,epic
13864,Grindy but fun
13865,yea its alright ig
13866,"This game can be a coin flip, sometimes you'll destroy everyone and praise your country for having the best tanks, and then other times you'll be wishing Germany never existed.

I hate people who use German tanks, if you couldn't tell."
13867,gud game
13868,planes >
13869,fun
13870,Things go boom and explode this in turn stimulates my monke brain by activating the endorphins
13871,"The game is very fun since you can play around with different tanks, planes, and boats"
13872,"GOOD
"
13873,Fun game but you have to grind for awhile to get the tank you want
13874, gooded game
13875,it fun
13876,"Well the game is in its core a pretty good game with great graphics and nice handling. But the game forces you to either play like an asshole (spawncamping, using bushes etc.) or pay a fuckton of money for premium or vehicles (up to 60$ a piece) or just grind painfully and get angry because of other people who play like the  mentioned assholes. So in summary if you´re ready to pay, grind or just ruin the fun for everyone that doesen´t want to play like an asshole, than this game is nice if not it´s ´pretty bad."
13877,"Game play is excellent and graphics are phenomenal- there are many game modes from arcade, realistic, and full sim in planes, helicopters, tanks, and ships. There is absolutely no need to worry about purchasing premium content to compete - there are enough vehicles in every countries trees to be competitive. Having said that, I do have premium vehicles in my lineup because I am a supporter of Gaijin, the games creator. The game is free to play. Games can be up to 16 players vs 16 players and in arcade game lengths vary from approx. 7 - 10 minutes."
13878,the grind is real
13879,"Really fun, my main complaint though is how long the grind takes once you get further into the game."
13880,"So after alot of hours in this game here is my opninion.

The game has a large variation of gameplay. Ground vehicles, Naval and Air battles. So far i've mostly been enjoying the ground realistic battles. War Thunder uses a battle rating system wich quite often gives you an uptier. Very rarely i do get downtiers in this game. 

This is a game you should play with friends through voice chats to improve the experience of the game. 

Some will enjoy the game and others will hate it. I still log in every day to claim the daily chest, but somedays i don't play the game mainly because the game can have really frustrating moments. 

The game seems to be most popular during the evening in weekends, wich means the more skilled players will appear more often in game to hunt you down. 

Sadly most will suffer the pain of the silver lion system, without VIP it almost seems undoable to gain profit, but it is possible when not running(driving) around like other shooters with a rapid gameplay. Patience is key in this game. Sometimes you'll get to a spot to park in place and wait for the enemy to appear. During progress you'll learn all the nice spots in the maps they currently have for you to play and enjoy. 

Hopefully the game developers will balance the silverlion system and make it a little easier to gain. 

Overall my experiences been mixed, yet i still recommend the game when playing with friends. Some days it goes great and you'll be having alot of fun, other days you'll get your ass kicked in game by the more skilled players. My worst nightmare in the game so far are the more skilled jets flying around in higher battle ratings. I mostly enjoy the 4,7 ~ 7,3 battle ratings as they seem quite often to be more fun. 

But if you want to progress in game you'll have to grow slowly. Don't worry you'll get better in time when investing the time correctly. In my case i jumped straight into realistic mode, some say you should start with arcade modes. But thats all up to you. 

Goodluck in the game!"
13881,it is a game
13882,what
13883,"i think this game caused me to be depressed and have suicidal thoughts, and yes i do recommend playing this game :)"
13884,fun
13885,good game so far kinda wished you in the same game could play as a plane and a boat

"
13887,"This is essentially a brainless arcade game, even in realistic don't expect anything other than flying around for 15 minutes then getting forced into head-ons, you will find yourself either swarmed by enemies or have nothing to shoot at. Teamwork doesn't exist. Balance is questionable. Bombers get to start in the sky, often flying so high as a fighter pilot you wont ever reach them before they get their first bombing run in, they get AI turrets to watch their back. You cant punish them when landing, AI AA guns are lasers. In ground battles get used to fighting tanks you have no hope of killing. Micro-transactions are encouraged to skip the brutal early tiers and tech upgrades. As for Sim mode, there are better games out there. Don't waste your time on this game, it is not fun."
13888,plane go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
13889,Tank
13890,only game that makes me turn on my pc
13891,good game
13892,"Fun gameplay, well modeled planes, tanks, and ships.
only downside is it is pay to win. If you want the good vehicles expect to pay a lot of money."
13893,good simulator of militry
13894,This game really good
13895,.
13896,nah
13897,"For starters, the graphics are great, and the game mechanism is great too, if it can be played fairly according to the game mechanism at all

After a while, no matter whatever server you join, you can find the servers got infested with people with ""special abilities"" including shooting rounds with extreme curvy ballistic, or shooting through places that shouldn't shoot through including the mother earth, got sudden change with their positions like Peter Parker, and bombed by B-25 with laser guided bombs. Sometimes you don't meet the superpowers, but for a number of time, you do.

Some people advocate you that the game is good and no one is able to cheat due to the nature of the game, but you will know it when you play, especially with those special users.  If you can tolerate with those superpowers, please enjoy the game, otherwise, please try others.

And don't forget this game is infested with racist players too"
13898,very addictive game
13899,Want to feel like getting kicked in the plums? Want to punch yourself in the plums? Play WT .. its FREE! So .. you have nothing to lose .. just your life .. girlfriend .. wife .. kids .. I need help .. please ..
13900,"if they add a soldier one , it will be legendary . like actual armed forces in the game"
13901,PPPPaaaaaaaiiinnnnn
13902,"bad game pay 2 win, also nick smells"
13903,"This is a game of such potential wasted by pure greed. War Thunder is really addictive, the game mechanics are very well done. Unfortunately Gajin continously decides to spit in the face of players. 

What you've got: pay to win - premium tanks being way better.
Frustrating game loop for grinding - pushing you to buy premium and take ""shortcuts"". I didn't take those, put around 600 hours into a single tech tree - and got to about 40% of it. That's how grindy this game is.

The devs don't care about their players, only their money. Community has raised issues that were ignored for past couple of years now.

Unbalanced spawns - you will find plenty of games with lifetime clocking at about 20 seconds because you will be killed as soon as your spawn protection wears out.

No tank-only gamemode - Pretty simple, right? Well that's not happening ever. Dying from a bomb is the biggest disappointment in such a nice game mode. 

Severe issues on performance for some players - just google around for stuttering issues. You will find that the game doesn't utilize your resources fully - CPU, GPU, memory and still experience plenty of crippling stutter.

The saddest thing is that I love this game for what it can be and hate it for what it currently is."
13904,"**Warning**  This game is highly addictive.  Do not play if you have responsibilities.

""Just one more match...""  

#facts"
13905,its fine. the game would be a lot better with soldiers but overall its a good game
13906,As fun as ever. best with a few friends for sure
13907,good
13908,"Bear in mind that this review is given from the perspective of a purist. I tend to like things as realistic as possible. So imagine my bewilderment when I beheld tanks with better performance than a sports cars. And that pretty much sums up my entire experience. 
I get the impression that realism was defiantly not the goal of the developers. Which is fine. For a great many people this would be a great game. But if you are a purist like myself you will most likely find it a bit uninspiring.

13910,"Postives: Good Graphics, Models are accurate to their real life counterparts, Sounds are cool.

Negatives: Horrible Economic System, Has a terrible grinding system where it forces players to pay up to make the grind less harder, Repair costs are stupidly high, etc.

There's a lot of problems with this game that have not been dealt with yet.

Either Gaijin is too busy trying to make money via Battle Pass, Golden Eagle store or they just don't give a crap about the players anyway.

I don't recommend playing this game.

This game is literal hell."
13911,"I first played this game well over 7 years ago by now (it's been so long, I can't pin point when I first played this). It was an absolutely wonderful game to play with. Myself and my friends loved it and played it hours on hours without end, being so excited to play it during weekends as we felt this is the one game that unites us on having to work together and have fun together and with the community. 

As time goes on with this game, they have made many improvement for the players and it's great to see a game evolving in graphics visually, adding new vehicles and new game modes such as ships, it's what we all want. There was however a slight error possibly unintended by the developers that if you played tank battles, having a lower graphics gives you an advantage to see enemy tanks before they see you (assuming they are running on a higher setting) Whether that has been resolve I don't know. I gave up using tank battles as it's incredibly challenging, and that's great that players are engaged with this game and their skills are developing, no doubt they're passionate and learned every little details to increase their survival and help their team win. It's just too tedious to keep playing and find myself losing interest in tank battles. 

I am not sure how match making works, if you play it long enough then you'll find yourself having a very one sided battle, occasionally you will see it being balanced with grounds contested back and forth and that is when it's a fun tactical game. I would like to see more transparency on how players are matched, while I offer my opinion that I think it should have some sort of skill rating to make it more 'balanced' for most players, I know other will disagree and that's ok. 
With the community chat, it can be very toxic unfortunately. No doubt they're getting riled up by the state of the battles and that's not going away ever. You'll find players like that across the entire gaming world so you just learn to ignore them and if not, you can change the settings so that you can limit what channels you'll receive the chat, even to friends only in a squadron and that's great. It can be a shame as there are genuinely nice players in War Thunder and still make friends with them time to time. Now yes I know there's a chat ban at the moment due to the War. Can hardly be a surprise as you do get matched up with Russian and Chinese players and the following nations within that region that shares a same ideology. What a time to be alive.. and yes it can get very political in the game. Better take it out on each other in a video game than real military action tbh. 

The problem with this game now is that in my opinion the developers got too greedy. Myself and my friends have purchased premium vehicles, premium account times and one occasion battle pass. It got to the point where you're asking yourself 'What the point?'. It is increasingly expensive now more than ever to find yourself in a comfortable position in terms of Silver lions. This is largely due to the repair cost feature that is increasingly expensive. Some vehicles you would need to score well, have premium just to barely make profits on it, without the booster of course. My friends eventually quit playing this game one by one and I found myself playing this game on my own and it's literally depressing knowing how good it was in the past. So even players like myself and my friends that got sucked into their marketing strategy are getting fed up and eventually stopped playing the game, mainly for mental health reasons.

This tedious and stressful level you will expect when going at the top tier battles, this is where a lot of things are expensive and crazy. I have noticed and no doubt many people are fed up of this. It's the modules of your vehicle. You won't seem to notice that much and not a hassle when you're starting out on a lower BR tech tree. It can be maxed out quickly and you're good to go to enjoy the game. It's when you go up and up and up... it's gets more expensive, time consuming to max out your vehicles. It got so bad that players that made it or paid their way to upgrade it is having a huge advantage to those that doesn't. For example Night vision, heat vision, tank shell round types for Tanks, planes it's missiles and engine along with other wide array of upgrades to choose from. These are the reasons why many players are divided on this game. For that reason alone I stuck with low BR games as it's more enjoyable to play with that high BR games. 

I personally just don't get it. Even with battle pass and premium account, you're still given an impression from the company that it's not enough and it's only limited time to reap those benefits. You play this game long enough, you can eventually just walk away and not give in. I admittedly spent a lot of money on this game. The premium vehicles are still there, that along with some items from BP is all you're ever getting to keep when it comes to spending money on something, the rest is just a temporary boost which is very discouraging. 

I wish there are more game modes available where for example in air battle would have bombing focus, ground units focus, and air battle focus instead of all in one, perhaps even with pve where players can chill and just enjoy the game with friends or teammate without being incredibly rage inducing in a competitive environment with pvp. I am aware they did some testing a while back which i took part in tank battles. It's great and it would attract players like myself but they seem to be incredibly slow on that matter.. I haven't kept up to date since I stopped playing but one friend I do know that played it recently said it's still the same as it was when I last played. 

I am overall sad how it turned out for myself and my friends I've made along the way with this game. I have many great memories with this game and I will always cherish those memories and epic battle moments with my friends. Maybe I will come back one day but it will be cautious on what to expect when playing the game, certainly no more penny on them as I spent more on it than you would buying a single game at a fraction of what I've spent on this game and I know how Gaijin thanked me in return. 

Overall, great game when you're starting out, fun with friends. Going up comes with a cost not just to your wallet but also to your mental health. I will give it a thumbs up for what it's worth overall, Personally i'd pick between the thumbs up and down. My advice to new players is to just stick to a low BR range and experiment on all variety of vehicles.

If anyone literally stuck around reading this, kudos. I'd love to hear your opinion and experiences with the game, the good, the bad, the ugly."
13912,This is both my favorite and least favorite game

13928,"90% of the ""players"" are basically just bots. Literally saw 6 of them get stuck on a train car on stalingrad. Server Lag and Ping even though I only play US is garbage and results in the enemy squeezing off that deciding round a split second before me. (Ground Arcade)

Spotting system is utterly garbage on Ground Arcade, I can literally stare at a tank for a solid 5 seconds before it pops up as red. I often find myself being shot by tanks that just materialize out of thin air. The game randomly lags for no reason causing multiple shots to hit the wrong part of the enemy due to their tank glitching out and flinging around.


Update after another 90 hours of gameplay. Game has gotten worse. I end up playing the same 5 maps all day because of the horrible matchmaking. I also get uptiers almost every game regardless of what tanks or planes I use. Just today I had 25 games in a row where we lost every game by a landslide.

13951,"I really wanted to recommend this game, but Gaijin makes it so very hard to do so.

I waited several months for the V Day sale in order to purchase premium time at the discount price.  I wanted to place this purchase on the Gaijin store (for better pricing), which for some reason failed to complete payment, with generic errors without information.  Support did not get back to me until several days after the sale ended, with the only suggestion to check if the issue still persists.  When I replied that I was NOT going to do this, because the price was twice as high as I was attempting to buy, they merely closed my ticket as ""issue resolved"".

How can I recommend that?  I literally wanted to give them money and they said the support equivalent of ""pay more""."

You think Japan had the bes- NOPE RUSSIA
Sweden, China, Israel, Italy... doesn't matter, the game has Russia.

So take sweet enjoyment when you shoot their flying tank planes down, and manage to sink a tank shell deep enough into a ""weak""  spot in their indestructable tanks to kill the crew, or when you manage to land enough torpedos and broadside hits to sink their perfectly engineered unsinkable ships...

Everyone else is a 50/50 and actually good fun, depending on player skill.

gajing and the others are a prime example of big companies telling the gaming community fuck you except our shitty work and dont complain. give a bad review calling out their flaws, devs tell ya to submit a ticket about the bug just to have it ignored. support website is just a Q&A with no real support. another way for the devs to give us gamers a middle finger. this game is not worth your time nor money unless you like torturing yourself. thats all this game is good for now adays. gajing also wont give you REAL contact info when your bugs/issues need a more human touch. once again. another way for big game developers to take ur money and give you the middle finger."

13977,"Complete and utter waste of time. First off the company is very greedy and it does what ever it can to make you spend real money. This becomes very clear, you can choose to either grind the game for a year and get to top tier or just buy a fucking premium. Alright so you buy a premium everything is cool until you realize that some premium planes are simply way better than others. So u dont even have much of a choice of nations to buy a good premium from. After u buy it on release they also nerf it into the ground :) so your hard earned money goes to waste. If thats not enough you can even sometimes get punished for playing and trying to learn because there is the repair cost of planes, might not seem like that big of a deal but paying 10k silver lions adds up really fast. Without premium acc u earn almost nothing lol. Dont ever give the company money"

14094,"Worst issue with the game is their greed and the grind needed to get into Cold War+ vehicles. It's absolutely atrocious and screams low ethics and 0 care for their player base.

Second issue is that there is a severe bias towards Russian vehicles in the game due to the company being founded in Russia and ran by Russians. I believe you have all the proof you need in Ukraine that Russian vehicles don't work as magically well as you think they do Gaijin.

Otherwise the game is fun enough I guess, again the grind just kind of kills any love you can foster for the game.

Spawn camping is also a major issue, half of the games will end with one team being soft locked from winning due to the opposing team spawn camping, because your spawn protection essentially wears off about 5 seconds after spawning in, you immediately get your tank or ship destroyed without having a chance to react."
14095,"ok
"
14096,Very fun game that allows you to MMO with WWI and on equipment. Leveling up takes time and a lot of grinding unless your willing to pay for upgrades IRL.
14097,"About as fun as crushing your shins in a pnuematic press

Playing more I'll articulate more of my thoughts. I understand there is an amount of randomness in the fights and damage, but consistently it seems like the game doesn't give enough information or its broken. For example doing damage doesn't always grant an assist and shooting down a plane doesn't always grant a kill. I can be the sole reason a plan goes down, and not get a kill or assist, I can get a dozen hits on a plane then someone will get the last hit, and won't get the kill or assist.

Damage is also incredibly weird, very consistently I will hit a plane 5-10 times, sometimes scoring multiple crits, and it doesn't seem to effect the plane at all, meanwhile I'll almost always be one shot, regardless of my plane, my targets, or attackers. I can shoot directly into a cockpit, seeing my bullets land and hit markers showing up, and seemingly doesn't effect them somehow.

Additionally the micro transactions are shameless, I get its a free game, but you can't even just buy premium, you just buy a time period of it. Repairs for your planes aren't free, you have to pay for them with Silver Lions, which EVEN WITH premium, battles won't cover the cost of doing repairs unless you do really well, so you have to wait or pay money. Planes cost 60 dollars, individual planes cost up to 60 dollars. Ranking up to the next plane takes huge amounts of time, unless you pay of course

Also the historical and AI battles are a laughable waste of time, they're unexciting and reward barely any points"

14100,"So, after years of playing this game and over 6k hours played. (1,500 on this account 4,500 on another) I've finally decided to review it.

I've played this game since November of 2014, and it's grown to be one of my favorite games that I've played my entire life. However, that said it has major flaws. The game is extremely pay to win if you don't want to spend years grinding a single nation. Gaijin pretty much encourages you to buy premium time and on top of that premium planes/tanks/helis/naval ETC. And being the sucker that I am, I unfortunately have done that. I not only have a disgusting amount of time in this, but also a disgusting amount of money spent. 

I know this game will never be the way that it should and I'm okay with that. It's a free to play game, and I still enjoy playing it to this day. 

PLEASE FUCKING ADD CHAT BACK."
14101,"just please spare your self some trouble don't get this game on steam it crashes often please get the stand alone version.
recently i have tried the steam version again it does not load the matches and also crashes every time i have tried to get into a game."
14102,"rly fun in vr

especially flying planes in first person vr"
14103,very nice game
14104,Amazing game it's biggest strength is also it's greatest weakness so that's saying a lot and that strength is it's realism you get hit once in the right spot your dead the speed the animations the vehicles and even the crew are so realistic the only reason you shouldn't play is if you can't take a shot or postition yourself cause then your playing the wrong game buckaroo
14105,cool
14106,Maybe if you could not be hard progression locked by silver lions because you don't play russia and don't constantly have premium running the game would be worth playing. Oh wait no it wouldn't because the devs refuse to decompress the battle ratings.

14109,"Fun gameplay with a good early grind, but is designed to make you spend money later on. Don't fall for it."
14110,This a fun game! A bit grindy thou.
14111,"i play this game u waste life. this game is like cookie clicker you spend hour upon hours just to get a gandma.

grinding this game is pointless because it takes forever as new vehicles are added evry month."
14112,yes
14113,"The gameplay is alright but the menu system and interface is unusable.

Update - An extra 19 hours in.
Pros -
Planes are pretty fun

Cons -
The menu and interface system still feels like it was designed an intern over a 30 minute coffee break.
If you want any hope of having both a social life and/or a job and also playing this game, you will need to pay for the premium feature - giving you 2x+ exp.
If you want any hope of not instantly dying in a plane, make sure to spend real money on exp for its crew.

Logic would dictate that if you get a new variant of a plane (The one i did was literally the same plane with 2 extra guns) your pilot training would carry over to a degree, this is not the case. So just be aware all that time and/or real money you put into training a crew is going to waste the second you decide to get a new plane.

Some reviews do not tag this game with ""Pay-to-win"" But when you have a bomber for example, you only have 1 trained gunner and 4+ extra gunner seats, now you technically do still have gunners but they couldnt hit a plane even if they were stationary right next to you. You'll have to bust open the wallet or take a week off work in order to get those other gunners trained. Feels pretty pay to win to me."

14116,Game is an abusive relationship
14117,"Although it does have a very painful grind, it’s got great graphics and each match feels at least a bit different. And the damage view when you die/shoot an enemy is really neat. Overall I’d recommend, since it’s free you can see if you like the gameplay enough to want to buy premium account."
14118,"if you enjoy getting sniped across the map, shot down before you can see who it is this is the game for you"

14123,"This game is impossible to play if you somewhat suck at games. For me this game is almost impossible to play cause i'm either getting spawn camped or getting killed as soon I get to the place I want to go. The teammates in this game are absolute crap. There never there when you need them like say your in a battle and you cannon gets disabled and your fixing it but it takes 40 seconds to repair. A teammate can shorten the time by like 20 seconds if they help. Whenever I get into a situation like this my teammates aren't there to help me never. So I don't recommend this game cause the teams are crap, games is unfair and is very hard and annoying to play."

I can only recommend this game if you have time, money and a will to live to spare or you like having a handy by a girl with swords for hands."
14128,want to be a fat virgin living in your mothers basement? well this is the game for you!
14129,I would always  tell my friends about war thunder this game has me hooked I can never get enough of it i will play this game until i die . I love the realistic battles and playing them with my friends . One thing that i would like is if you guys could buy golden eagles with silver lions .of course this isn't a demand and I know this will not happen but continue the great work this is the beast game ever!!

14139,Shit game
14140,"This game is a joke. There is only one true nation - russia.
They won the war so they must be the best. That's what the russians think and it shows in this game. 
Most of the battle on the German side will look like this: German one other nation vs USA, UK, ru and others. Many battles will be over after 5 minutes as the Russians are surrounding the German spawn and it's over,

If, after all, your results are too good, you will hit the opponents +1br (9/10 battles)
And that wouldn't be the worst. The worst part is that when you play 3.3, your team doesn't have anything higher than 3.3
The opponent has a whole mass of 3.7+ vehicles

I understand adding new vehicles and may even add UFO to this game. But what the fucking reason is adding more and more post-war vehicles to low br?If something is not good in its range, it is only because it is shit.
New tank/AAA BTR-ZD wtf 
Transporter build long after the war br 4.3 fight against 3.3 and just smash that tanks.

14155,"Please don't play this game. Its nothing but a waste of time and it ruins your mood to a point where every time u get into this game, it punishes you for playing. The greed of these developers are so astounding to a point where at every turn you are required to pay silver lions. The balancing of matches are just pathetic. And anytime u activate a booster namely RP booster you are matched up with people way above you in terms of skill deliberately to make you fail the game. I am a decent player and i know this for a fact because i have tested it several times. And it is almost impossibly time consuming and tough to progress through the game after second rank, the amount of time one should invest just to unlock a higher level tank is absurd to a point where i just burn out completely. They force you to avail the premium and spend so much money because that's the only way you'll progress through. Or else you'll either have extremely bad matches and not get much RP or you'll run out of silver lions from buying absurdly expensive tanks. And oh wait even after you buy a tank, lets  say a rank 3 tank, you still have to pay 50k more to get the crew. I've seen people defend these practices in-game, to them  i say nothing but stop using your parents credit card and act like this game is all amazing and it deserves all this money through malpractices like this and get a job and know the value of each dollar. Also lets not forget  about the rewards from matches. Every time your tank gets damaged it requires silver lions to repair it or else you'll have to wait days to play that tank which you already own. Rank 1 is a breeze, the time and number of matches required to unlock a tank and the cost etc are all fine but as soon as you get midway through rank 2 the pathetic grind starts and the greed of the developers and company as a whole shows. If you just experiment all these and calculate it like i did. You'll witness the evil and greed that this company holds dear to its heart. You can see an in depth explanation about the pathetic economy in this game in a review below or above written by TARKUS. I urge you to read that. You'll understand how we basically lose silver lions just for playing a match in which you fail. We basically get penalized and it means that these people are ding whatever they can to get us to buy premium and spend TONS AND TONS OF MONEY. And they pair us up in a way that we  guarantee do fail or at least lose silver lions most of the time."
14156,"Great game, yes there is alot of grind in the later tiers, but its free, you don't get to whine"
14157,"There is not a game I hate more. That I loathe to play more than WarThunder. Yet I keep coming back. I have hundreds of hours playing on playstation, but decided to give it a try on pc. Its addictive. Like crack. This game sucks. But you cant stop playing it."
14158,"I'm done with this game I run away from it and don't look back.

Gaijin and the whole community of this game is making this game worse and worse. A game with ruined economy and balance. 

If for you it's fun to get bigger tiers with wasting your time in life then play, this game is based on constant grind, progression is so bad afterwards that without paying for premium you SERIOUSLY HAVE TO PUT A LOT OF YOUR TIME IN."
14159,Don't play if you value braincells. Also soviet bias. Terrible matchmaking. Getting upranked by 1-2 BR.

14162,yes but no
14163,good game overall but spending 70 hours of your life to unlock 1 tank thats not even halfway down the tank list is shitty

That feeling is way better than playing this game grinding for days on end just for it to ask you for a crew training cost so now you have to grind more. It's not like you have wasted 50 hours of your life grinding because the repair cost is more than your income per match. Your life is pointless enough as it is so having a one night stand with your ex is a preferable option rather than mental torture that is war thunder by which its vehicle you can't touch and only be admired.

14186,"air battles are cool but can be a pain in the ass in higher ranks because you are flying against people without a social life. ground battles are awsome in higher ranks (so ive heard) but lower tiers are infested with older players either trying to club out newer players or just starting a new nation tree. so far ive been killed by people with over 4000 ground kills and 3000 aviation kills and i am only in 1.0 lobbies in ground battle. For the sake of yourself, go shoot down some zeroes and dont touch ground battle until they fix the issues."

its a love hate relationship at this point. It's late for me to ever leave since the time and investment  i've put into this god forsaken game.

14189,"One of the best games I've ever played. It has good and realistic game mechanics while still being able to make the game fun (for the most part). Although there are frustrating moments, this game is really great otherwise. It can be a bit of a grind, but it's still fun to play casually."

Don't waste your money or time on scummy developers and dumpster fire game design.
14197,filled with cheating russians since they are a pro russia company with the tanks in game haveing way more armor than they should and have ammo that can pen other tanks 10x over
14198,"Game has a good foundation but is lacking in a lot of areas.

-Russian tanks at top tier refuse to spall and have their fuel tanks eat any shell that comes its direction
-Map design is the worst thing I have ever seen in any game.
-Lots of Chinese and Russian tanks have Gen 2+ thermals on their stuff at lower BR's than any western nation
-Helicopters as a whole are unbalanced
-The grind is horrible, will never change because its what makes them money.
-If you wan't to truly have fun with the game, stay at the lower tiers. Don't give in to their greed for you to buy into top tier.
- ^ thats just for the ground units too
-Air RB is more fun in my opinion because its a lot less aggravating but not by much.
-You will continuously find small details that are just infuriating at times. Like the lack of internal spalling as said above."

14225,"This is by far the best vehicle battle game I've played. However, keep in mind, it will take a lot of time and dedication to unlock the more modern vehicles like the Abrams or F4 Phantom. And it can be easy to get frustrated if you get too caught up in the grind. But, in my opinion, some of the older vehicles like the Jumbo Sherman or the P47 are more fun anyways. Also I'd recommend buying a premium vehicle (be sure to do your research and find the best one for you). It isn't very expensive and just having a single one and using it can drastically speed up you grinding."

- P2W for new nations and premiums in game for several month

- Dev team definitely not playing their own game, you can tell this by trying out 90% of vehicles in game, as well as most maps
- Repair kits, fire extingusers and bombs for bombers(ATGMs for choppers) needs to be grinded on top levels even if you have paid subscription. 
I dare devs to try grinding through those on top ranks. They wont. 

Believe me, if you havent played this game from its better days long years ago (I probably have 5000+ hrs before Steam version) - you should never ever spend time or money on this game.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

14260,"GG, a lot of grinding but gg. also, i'm pretty sure that about 10% are using aimbots in tank arcade mode which is a shame didn't used to be like that. Air combat is very nice still though.
What makes me say this about tanks is when you have someone one-shot you from across the map in a BR 1.0 tank when there is no possible way to target someone that far away at that level and then it shows the replay and the bullet passes within inches of cover on the left and right on its way to you oh, then they immediately pull it off again within seconds on your teammate.

@Devs: please make a way of reporting this behavior in game. its one thing to pull a shot like this off once in a while by luck but every time? seriously? not possible with in game mechanics.

Graphics are excellent too btw"
14261,This game has bias in everything play the Russian tanks you win play the German tanks too bad you die from a track shot which has nothing to do with the tank whatsoever but since the snail knows all that's why you can only play the Russian tanks and when you do prepare to get 100 kills in 10 seconds because you basically have god mode and don't need to worry about getting shot because the bias/godmode will protect you also it takes way too long to get to any decent tanks you get to start out with a horse in the civil war and then after 70 hours maybe just maybe you'll be able to get a ww1 tank going against vehicles that aren't even from the same time period as your own because a cold war tank belongs in the category as ww2 because logic that's why the Russians know all which is why everyone should bow down and listen to their wisdom because they clearly are the best game developers about as good as EA even on par with Activision which is the best game developer since the beginning of time and no one gets to argue because the War Thunder snail will make your tank die to a Machine gun bullet doesn't matter that a Tiger tank can withstand that bullet what matters is that the snail knows best.

14269,"I'd recommend this game only if you are ok with spending the first year or so with primarily WWII and korean war era vehicles. If you are only getting the game because you want to play Vietnam era and beyond, don't bother getting this game. I myself very much enjoy most ranks of vehicles in this game and thus I enjoy the game as a whole. I do wish the grinding process wasn't so long but it is also the only game like it that I enjoy."
14270,it's fun. Just be ready for the grind.
14271,"the games matchmaking is absolute garbage. i could be the only one in my BR and everyone else at 1 BR higher. the BR is 3.7 but players are rank 100??? i can play for hours and never get anything because of spawn campers or people hiding halfway across the map just shooting into spawns. also..... the tank ranks seem too be just all over the place, especially 3.0 too 5.0 in my opinion, great game, for 1 out of 15 hours logged"

If you search for a strategy game between WoT and WT, choose WT.
If I knew WT was like that, I would not loose 8 years of my life playing WoT."

14312,"Recently, servers have been absolute trash. I keep losing my connection to servers at the most crucial timings, locking my vehicle crew out/causing me to lose my vehicle in-game. The game also suffers from FPS drops like never before (I run a Ryzen 5600 with a RTX2060 Super with 16GB RAM). Doesn't help that all the servers are at minimum 100ms ping, and I keep getting lag and packet loss. 

War Thunder has always had problems with the low player count, the long ass grind, and freemium system, but server issues are the last straws that break the camel's back. Over a thousand hours in the game over the course of 5 years and only 2 half-completed ground tech trees should tell you all you need to know about the grind. The game is frustrating and seldom rewarding, and it's time I put it away."

14318,I am not recommending this game. Russian tanks dont explode as I´am used to see them in Ukraine war videos. I´ll probably wont join back to this game until they fix that Russian tank turrets fly 2 stories high after getting hit . Also they should probably add Ukraine with their tractors as playable country considering their tractors have taken hostage more tanks than vice versa
14319,you see it a good game for the first 100 hours then gets rather boring kill fucked by the same bullshit every game 10/10 should play

Sadly the killer for me was very high ping in Australia (200 plus mostly 300) causing the aircraft to not respond or going into a head on and being dead before seeing the tracer spray. 
There is a very long grind however just play to enjoy the game and not to just unlock.
The cost of vehicles in real money is massive so expensive for the cost of 1 aircraft you could buy another game or two.
Recommend the game if you have good connection to Gaijin and have lots of time to spend on one game."

You will get hard stuck at tier 4-5 because repairs will bankrupt you, and before someone mentions skill required to not pay repairs, the game is 75% luck from either getting fully uptiered (meaning you are playing against much better tanks) or if your teammates are bad and you end up getting swarmed. This is the only game I know that punishes you for playing it. Issue is, you get sucked into this game, so do yourself a favor and dont pick it up at all"

14332,it was fun

14334,too many suffers
14335,Bad
14336,"Played the game since closed Beta. Well over 32,000 hours (Majority of hours in Standalone.) and I have watched the game rise and now fall.

It absorbed so much of my young life. I was in middle school when I first started playing. Now I have a career as a mechanic and as a trucker. This game is nothing but a cash grab. The constant un ending grinding, and you only make money when you pay IRL money for the in game currency, Premium Account, or Premium Vehicles. 

TL;DR:
I do not recommend this game anymore, and it hurts to see it fall so hard. 10 years, at least $5,000 on Premium Account alone, and most of my time was the price. Do not play it, stop paying for their sham."
14337,Good game
14338,While I do like this game the amount of bugs and balance issues make it nearly unplayable at times. Going into a replay to watch your ATGM go straight through a tank like it was a ghost. The BR system that's completely irrelevant as you'll be uptiered most of the time. Sound cutting out randomly. Getting stuck on random objects. The fact you can't play only high tiers cause they're too expensive to repair so you have to go back to low tier to earn some silver lions. But they come out with new vehicles constantly so clearly their staff does exist it's just that fixing issues doesn't make them as much money. Once they fix these issues it'll be an awesome game. For now it's fun until you rage quit cause you died and it wasn't your fault.
14339,im coming for you
14340,Nice Cock

14342,"Would I recommend the game? Overall, I'd say yes. There really is nothing out there even close to War Thunder (which could be a good or bad thing). The game play itself is pretty good and polished all things considered. Sure, there's some questionable choices and such, but just the sheer amount of vehicles in the game is insane. The game is also BEAUTIFUL if you have a rig that can run it on max. 

but

Unless you are only interested in up to WWII era and only 1 or 2 nations, it's absolutely not a free to play game. The amount of time you'd need to dedicate to get anywhere substantial is pretty insane, especially if you aren't willing to fork out for premium time + vehicles. Sure, it's possible to get to top tier without spending a penny, but it's going to be a hell of a grind and a lot of suffering. I'm talking months if not years here. 

It can be an incredibly fun game, but also incredibly infuriating too, and will quite easily bounce between the two regularly. 

My suggestion? Play it for free, don't spend any money on the game, and go from there. If you are enjoying it, grab a week of premium and see if it was worth it. If you have your eyes on a specific premium vehicle, wait until you have something of a similar BR to play along side it before buying it. 

It can be an amazing game, but it has plenty of flaws. 

"
14343,"I am playing since before it was on Steam. I have over 1000 hours in this game. My PC specs are outstanding. I have unlocked USA tanks & planes until 4.0 (I don't like grinding + I believe that it is more fun at around 2-3, particularly regarding planes). I will focus on the negative points, since I am too lazy atm. to make a full review, but safe to say that everything bar the negative points is good or even outstanding, like the soundtrack, visual details.

At this point I can not recommend this game for most players. The game is a grind fest, it takes forever to get to the good & modern stuff. Arcade battles in tanks & ships suffer from built in aids that are really bs, you can basically aim at tanks with predicted hit markers through any foliage and have the enemy spotted pinpoint as a 3D model for extremely long distances and extremely long time, it is a joke.

The second main reason not to get this game is: Cheater problem, and a significant one. And just to take the stupid comments away from the get go, I know what a cheater looks like, I have worked for anticheat in the past.
Most players can only recognize the obvious ragehacker, but very very few can spot advanced cheats that are tweaked to not be too obvious. It is also nearly always that anticheat solutions catch only the simple cheats; professional cheats are rarely detected, also due to them being regularly tested, updated and tweaked so that from replay they look the least suspicious.
Still unconvinced that this game has a cheater problem: Well you can Google around and what you WILL FIND is: Competitive War Thunder is pretty much cheaters only; it is so bad, that even if you could keep up with the cheaters, teams still want you to cheat, because otherwise you are a liability. It is a huge joke. But unfortunately this seems to be a trend in competitive games, as i.e. CS:Go suffers from something similar (see Flusha). I even would go so far as to claim that longterm PVP will die and be replaced by PVE (AI is slowly getting to the point of being a suitable replacement experience).

Tank battles I encountered it a lot more, than in planes. If you still want to do tank battles, I also recommend to go do ""realistic"" battles (not simulation) for tanks as then the worst in game aids are not available anymore, which is imo a much better experience. For planes Arcade is fun, particularly between 2.0 - 3.0; great dogfighting."
14344,"Reasons not to play this:
Russian bias, easy to exploit glitches/hack, pay to win, forces you to buy premium, requires extreme amounts of grinding (100+ hours, still not above BR 7, and ive seen people go upwards of 300 without getting very far past 8.5), and very broken at times, for example your shot might go through a enemy without registering (especially at close/medium range), or a enemies shot may completely miss you, but still kill you. 

Reasons to play this: Looks good,the games popular rn, although its not completely realistic as some people and Gaijin advertise its the most realistic game out there (Not completely realistic because of tank balancing, and some things just arent accounted for when balancing tanks, and a lot of small thing that arent really important enough to list but are still pretty bad when combined.)

If you like raging, get this game
If you like sanity, this game is not for you
if you love russia to the point its not socially acceptable, you'll love this game
If you like being able to exist as a American, German, British, or french tank/plane, this game is not for you
If you have a lot of time on your hands and you like a long game where you progress over time and slowly build up, even if it causes frustration, this game will be great for you
If you wanna play a game where you can use your favorite tanks without having to spend hundreds of hours, or if your a person that just doesnt have a lot of time on their hands, I wouldnt recommend this."
14345,painful 99% of the time. Fun 1% of the time
14346, thank you Gaijin it's been less than 30 hours and I am already being spawn sniped. I really love your game I do but there's several issues that need to be fixed ASAP.

14356,this game is fun
14357,This game is awfully hard but it sure is fun when u get the hang of it!!!
14358,I hate this fucking game
14359,"Okay boys and girls, buckle-up for this one... 

For me, it all started back in 2013. I was in middle school, and was starting to really get interested in history. So when one of my friends told me about a simulation-style, plane game that was making headway, needless to say, I was pretty excited to check it out! Seeing as to how the progression system works, I was SO excited to climb the fighter ranks! 

Over the years, I watched as the game added aircraft, after aircraft, as well as upgrades to the graphics engine. It's like I just couldn't quit playing! Switching around to different nations, trying different aircraft, it was definitely the one thing I thought about at school all-day long. 

One day, I launched the game to find that Ground Vehicles were being tested... That was it for me... My favorite game just got even better! I could now experience something that is unheard of in any other game, accurate shell tracking and physics, combined with detailed, accurate vehicles. 

I also recall the day ships were added, a day I had been waiting for, for a very, long time. Honestly though, Ship battles just aren't for me. I would rather experience my favorite game mode ""Ground Realistic Battles"", where I can use my unlocked planes and tanks to unleash havoc against my enemies. 

The amount of vehicles and nations increases every update, making sure to keep us long-term players buried with content to enjoy. Personally, I have HUNDREDS of vehicles.... but that's nothing, considering there are OVER 2,000 VEHICLES IN THE GAME!!! 

I know you're probably thinking ""It's a Free To Play game, it's probably full of Pay To Win garbage"". Well, you're wrong. While War Thunder DOES have paid vehicles, you DO NOT have any advantage over players who choose to not spend a penny, at least in terms of game play. That is because War Thunder balances vehicles by giving them a ""Battle Rating"", or ""BR"". To sum it up, the vehicle stats are calculated based on survivability, as well as capability. For example, if you have the old, WWII, German Tiger H1, you don't want to face the modern, American M1A2 Abrams, in battle... That all being said, the advantages to spending $, are more ""Pay To Progress"". If you use a ""Premium Vehicle"" (vehicle obtained through the store), you earn an additional amount of research points towards whatever vehicle you are researching next in your tech-tree. You can also purchase a ""Premium Account"", which effectively does the same thing. Of course, you can probably see that combining both a ""Premium Vehicle"" and a ""Premium Account"", gives you a significant boost towards unlocking new vehicles, but like I said, that creates NO ""Pay To Win"" functionality. 

To wrap things up, War Thunder is BY FAR my favorite game, being that it takes all of the things that I love, and applies them all into one, single, package. It STAYS updated, not only in terms of new vehicles and graphics, but also in terms of the re-balancing of vehicles. I honestly can't think of ant other game studio that keeps their game so up to date, as Gaijin does with War Thunder. They have an EXCELLENT YouTube channel, where you can learn real history, AND new features/gameplay mechanics that come along with every update. 

I've put off this review for so long, simply because I don't feel like I could ever explain everything I love about this game in one sitting. Guys, Gals, try it. Watch the YouTube videos, learn the game, and I promise you, you WILL fall in love. Thank you Gaijin Entertainment, and may this game last for many, many, more years to come... <3"

14361,"Dámy a pánové, představuji vám absolutní odpad v poli vojenské bitvy, vše  co si chcete užít je za paywallem není tu ani dobrá optimalizace a ani moc barev tato hra nepobrala, každá mapa má na sobe svůj ohavný filtr takže neuvidíte vůbec nic, hráči nejsou vůbec vidět a v bitvě si vůbec nezahrajete protože dostanete jedničku od nějakého upocence přes celou mapu který má této hře 1000 h né-li více, takže je tohle spíše simulátor 2 plouživých minut ze spawnu na nejbližší kopeček. Celkový požitek ze hry je vůbec zrujnovaný když zjistíte že si ve vašem oblíbeném tanku můžete zahrát pouze jednou za bitvu.

14367,is a very good game
14368,There are no Vietnamese subtitles.A lot of Vietnamese gamers only know the native language.

14381,"10/10, hate this game."
14382,"Game is fun in tier 1 after that the game is rigged. All rolls on crates, all shots made in game. Dishonest Devs and their shady ""deals"". Don't play this game if you have any self respect or believe in humanity. 

TLDR : Rigged rolls, Dev man bad, Pay to win."

14390,True meaning of Suffering
14391,this game will make you what it feels like to chew 5 gum
14392,"Pros:
 - Cool Graphics
Cons:
 - Broken rendering of enemy tanks at long distances that pop in and out of existence
 - Ghost Shells (Shooting a tank and the shell disappearing)
 - Bombers being 1 shot and having high cost to repair
 - 1-sided up-tier in matches
 - Unreasonably large maps that take at least 5 minutes to get to the actual battle for each match
 - Pay to Win aspect with premium vehicles and gold eagles
 - Ranking Propeller bombers and fighters with Jet fighters doesn't make sense"
14393,You can't just stop.
14394,Way too complicated for beginning players. You need a toned down version of this. I'm still confused on how things work. Too much for a person to understand all at once.
14395,"pain and suffering, but you can fly cool planes and drive tanks that go pew pew.

this game is only free to play if you can suffer the grind. having a premium account is practically necessary unless you want to spend hundreds and hundreds of hours grinding each nation's tech trees. the nice thing though is that even with 200 hours of premium, there's still plenty more to attain and work towards. each nation offers something different, not to mention the several game modes from arcade (very basic flight models, more UI elements enabled, generally easier and faster paced) to simulator. 

this brings me to the next point: one of the best ways to succeed is to know yourself and your enemy. for a player that doesn't have a lot of time or interest in doing out-of-game research, this is certainly a negative, but for serious players, it adds a level of mastery to the game. war thunder is a game that you need to give time and focus into researching and mastering, otherwise you'll find it difficult to truly succeed.


all in all i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys piloting planes (and tanks and ships) in a ww2 to cold war timeframe,"
14396,owen ruined it
14397,neeooooowww!
14398,very awesome game
14399,"I would say play this game, because its absolutely fun the community is slightly irritating but helpful, and some of them are even somewhat nice people. Except now you cant even use the chat feature due to the fact that it might spark ""political talk"" like that wasnt already happening. If im completely honest this game is awesome but the fact they literally turned chats off only because someone might say something bad is stupid. they have a chat ban feature anyway, so why turn it off?

edit: they turned chat back on, YAY! 

tldr: play if you dont mind not talking to someone and being completely alone expect for the occasional ""Need Cover!!!"""

14405,"have you ever wondered how brain dead your teammates could possibly be? Have you every wondered if there are people who evolved past the prehistoric era? well search no more this game is for you! No mare chances of having fun while playing this game! You'll be stuck wondering what E-Sports team the game put you up against! You have to ask yourself if the Devs or player base even know what they're doing with this game. Every though you shot right at somebody and missed? Well fear no more! Because that actually happens in this game! With all the bugs you thing they would call an exterminator by now, but no! Cause why would anyone wanna fix there game? Welcome to Warthunder! you'll be sure to hate yourself within 20 minutes of playing!"

14407,warthunder could be a great game if most of the content wasnt locked behind a pay wall or an insane amount of grinding just to get single tank or aircraft

14409,yes
14410,Garbage.
14411,Top igrica
14412,Plane go woooooosh
14413,"Very fun game. The only main issues I have are the fact that there are a lot of micro transactions. Though not truly important, there are multiple problematic micro transactions. For example, if you want really good camouflage, such as bushes on your tank, you have to spend money. Over all, I would recommend this game if you're a military vehicle/history buff. I would especially recommend it if you're interested in WW2 vehicles. If your looking at the game just because of modern vehicles, I would not recommend it all that much, as you start with pre-WW2 vehicles and have to do A LOT of grinding to get to modern. I've been playing the game for a little over 3 years and I only just now got a post-WW2 vehicle. Even with all of the problems, like I said before, the game is really fun. You do have to grind a lot, but the game is still fun. There are multiple features that don't exclusively involve online multiplayer, but connection to the internet is required. The UI is not the greatest in the world, but you'll get used to it over time. The vehicles (for the most part) are very accurate to the real vehicles. I only recently started playing on PC instead of console, and I have to admit, the PC version is superior in almost every way. Over all, I would definitely recommend this game, but do expect a very long grind."

14449,I fucking hate this game
14450,Every enemy is overpowered. You have no chance to win unless you are ready to spend some real money. This game is a pay-to-win game.
14451,This game is the definition of suffering
14452,"The realistic battles are fun, especially ground battles.  The air and naval battles can be fun also, but the naval battles take a really long time and the air battles are a bit repetitive, just dog fight after dog fight after dog fight.  That's not the fault of the game developer, it's just the nature of the beast.  The arcade battles can be fun, but they mostly just turn into people trying to snipe each other from as far away as possible.  I get issues because I'm running off of a macbook pro and the graphics card barely meets the requirements.  So, if I have too much else running, it will often crash or have issues on screen.  The files are also quite large (~100GB), so that's a lot to have on the system as well (only 256 GB of ssd).  Luckily you can select a smaller file size and give up some quality.  Again, I don't think that's necessarily the fault of the game developer, just something to keep in mind if you are thinking about powering this game with a macbook pro or similar (p.s. it doesn't really run at all on my surface book, mac graphics ftw).  There are in game purchases available, and I can see how they can give you an advantage, but I haven't spent any money on the game and continue to feel competitive and enjoy the game after a little over 100 hrs of playing."

14469,its good
14470,YYYEEEAAAHHHH!!!!! GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!
14471,The comminuity is toxic af the game is pay to win there are more prototypes than actual tanks any more and to put the cherry on top the grind is so long that by the time its over you will be 700 years old
14472,Its a good game but only if your willing to spend half your life grinding for a single vehicle or are willing to spend 60 dollars for it.
14473,love it
14474,"very grindy and a lot of storage space, but its alright"
14475,"Great game, not much to say."
14476,Good game but sometimes too grindy for progressing on new vehicles on the research tree and expensive to buy new vehicles and even premium but still worth it to play the game for fun.
14477,"This game is extremely realistic and fun with its many aircraft and ground vehicles, but the currency and the way
you earn it is very difficult and takes an unreasonable amount of time."
14478,get out while you still can
14479,It's alright I guess.
14480,"Really shitty game.
Doesn't run well on ANY computer I've tried so far. Frame drops, insane frame times, and it completely overloads the system.
Also, controllers don't fuckin' work. It might work in the menu screen, but when you try to go to battle with it, the game doesn't respond to ANY controller input.
Until these issues are fixed, I would NOT recommend wasting space to download this poor excuse for a good game."
14481,"its overall a great game. The only problem i have with it is the games flying mechanics. I find it a bit hard to control the cross hair whiles flying, to actually hit the plane. 8.5/10 you should download it."
14482,"Dot it, and suffer like the rest of us"
14483,This game is awesome. The attention to detail and the overall experience is great. I would not recommend buying anything within this game because as you work through the ranks of vehicles your player skill also advances. If you buy you will be put into lobbies that are too skilled for you.
14484,Alright... 1. Only get this if you have patience  and a low temper 2. Its an arcade game not a super simulator go for DCS if that's your thing. Other than that it's epic.
14485,planes are fun
14486,"So…. I am disappointed in Gaijin clearly may 9th is not a celebration to cheerish allot of countries got occupied by SSRS on of those are lithuania we were on strict laws we didn’t have freedom.

14529,good game if you have hundreds of hours to grind
14530,Way too grindy.
14531,grind never ends
14532,Help
14533,"Meh. 

Fun for a F2P until you hit a certain rank, then it's all downhill once you're stuck playing the same tank for weeks and you start to notice things not adding up, the stupid meta gameplay that's driven by a complete lack of coordination and teamwork, the endless kill-die-repeat cycle with very few actually hard fought kills to spice things up.There's a few moments where the fights are actually drawn out and exciting, but most of the time you're either dunking on someone, or being dunked on. Naval battles are probably the most enjoyable part of the game now, the fights last a while, but the map and game design still push players towards slugging it out without any nuance or strategy. Guess that's to be expected from an F2P. 

There's a very obvious Russian bias from the Russian devs, pretty much all history tells us that stated Russian equipment specs were part of the information war, not actual reflections of the performance of the vehicles, but the devs take these numbers at face value and trust the Soviets to accurately report on their own shortcomings. If a person's only knowledge of WW2 and Cold War matchups was from this game, they would think that Russians are the world's greatest engineers, then wonder why nobody outside of Russia and India has every driven or ridden in something made by Russians. 

Some of the worse F2P elements include tedious grinding, uselss teammates who wear horse blinders, and every new premium ($$$) tank comes out overpowered to encourage people to buy it, then gets nerfed once the devs have made their money. 

The last straw was the removal of the chat. Apparently they didn't like people talking about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so they just turned off chat. Any claims of this being over user toxicity can be disproven by the fact that chat was already toxic, because why wouldn't it be in a game that all of the longtime players hate but feel too invested in to leave? The toxicity just finally happened to strike a nerve with the politics of the devs (who didn't mind all the racist and pro-nazi chat before), and now chat is gone, the only part of the game I could still just laugh at and have fun with. 

I'm glad I got a favorable return for my money spent in terms of hours burnt, but this game leaves a bad taste."

14537,Don't bother
14538,"I have over 700 hours in this game and its the worst game I've ever played.  Its very user unfriendly and has one of the worst player bases I've ever seen, however, I wouldn't have it any other way 10/10 would sink another 700 hours into this garbage"
14539,tanks
14540,Fun Game and you can play with friends from any platform
14541,bad game
14542,This is basially a mix of whatever you  choose. wanna fly planes? fly planes. wanna kill people but sadly it is illegal to commit mass murder IRL? you have tanks. do you want to be in the navy and just look at water while getting obliterated? you have naval battles.
14543,"Let me just start out with the fact that its a great game, but it requires way too much time (admittedly, I play it way to much) and there are some glaring issues like battle rating compression, monopoly over how fast you unlock things later in the game, etc, and I cannot elaborate enough on how slow it is to grind for new vehicles in this game, so I can't recommend it to other casual gamer who just want some fun, because this is the type of game where you spend hours grinding and getting better vehicles just to have a chance of having a little fun. The only ways you could probably get to top tier in WT is 1. You have no life, and too much time (Like me) 2. You are a YouTuber that does this for a living. 3. You are way to determined, or you actually find the game fun (Impossible)

TL;DR: Long game with some issues that might be fixed in the future, but probably not unless another game like this comes out. NOT for your average casual gamer. Very slow game, but its well made and works well in theory."
14544,"Its better than World of Tanks, at least. Plus it also has planes, boats, and helicopter. 

It is very grindy to progress tho"

14546,TANKS GO BOOM!! SHIPS GO BOOM!! PLANES GO I'M A FIRE BALL!! 7/10 its a fun game but sometimes things get a little janky on penetration for tanks every now and then. Highly recommend taking the M22 Locust into 10.0 BR games its satisfying to destroy top tier tanks with side pens. I'm really bad at this game but all in all even when it has problems its fun to play. I love seeing the play through of rounds ripping through the tank and ships.

14565,"""Free to Play"" is stretching it. Most games that claim to be ""free to play"" get their money from people buying decals or cool-looking weapons or special features that are neat but don't actually impact play. This is not one of those games. They have at least 4 separate currencies in-game that effectively have to be purchased with real money. Yes you can earn some of these types of currencies by playing, but only up to a point, eventually you will need to spend real money to advance. You will not be able to play anything but WWII era vehicles without spending money. It's also not just a little bit of money either. You'll need to be shelling out a lot of money because you need premium to ""research"" vehicles at any reasonable rate, then you need money to purchase the vehicles to use and then you need money to repair the vehicles that get destroyed when you play. I tried this game. I really wanted to have fun without dumping loads of money into it. But it's not possible. Even if you're really good at this game you'll still going to be slugging it along at a snails pace crawling up to the modern era while people with every tank modification in your current level devastate the heck out of you. I thought about not writing this review but then I realized that this game really is addictive enough that I can imagine a lot of people getting sucked into it and dumping their money into it. If this were a game where I just paid a one-time fee for the core content I'd be okay with it. But it's actually a down-right deceitful game. Uninstall this leech."
14566,I love this game! So much fun to play with people who know what they are doing.
14567,Clearly your anti cheat program isn't working.  Playing games lately and no one is shooting at me... (you can see the bullets when they come your direction - so yes: I know for a fact no one is shooting at me in that moment) - then 2 bullets and my planes are toast.  PC gamers every single time that happens.  It's not fun when you don't crack down on hackers and cheaters in any PVP environment.  Deleted game - not worth it.

You sit behind a house and camp A and suddenly you are pulverized out of nowhere in your Tiger 2p by an M22. But that's not even the worst, because there are bushes you can paste on yourself. You try with a WW2 tank drive to the point in a desert map and is then killed by a post-war Italian 105 mm recoilless (HEAT) projectile, which is also decorated with bushes (the tank). Conclusion: if you want to sell your life to the magic snail, have enough money and want to avoid any conceivable social contact, get this game. :)"

14576,"anashim she mishtamshim be sihim yeladim hara. bemeyuhad Foto_Graphica201

14577,its a fun game
14578,Terribly designed maps where you'll constantly be spawn camped. Overpowered purchasable tanks. Aircraft that are waaayyy too strong for the BR they're in and cant be stopped by AA. All with a ridiculous grind. Def don't get addicted to this game.
14579,"This game is addicting, but in a good way I think. Once you get it, you get it. (in air rb anyway lol)"
14580,"I absolutely love playing War Thunder!!! It is a grind to get to the modern era planes and vehicles, but my god is it so incredibly fun flying around as WW1 and WW2 pilots!!!! 
Highly recommend War Thunder to anyone to at least try!!"

chad game but unfortunatly im 40 fps rip pc W game W graphics L gpu prices"
14583,"At first glance it seems a nice looking battle royal type game but with war machines, (jet fighters, prop planes, tanks, battleships, and all variations of motorized weaponry). However on closer inspection this game is highly detailed in terms of the physical abilities and limitations of these weapons of war. From the speed advantage with loss of momentum energy due to the mass of the P38 Lightning to how the placement of the turrets on the USS Porter made anti-aircraft defense terrible within 2 kms of the vessel, this game is highly detailed. Whether you approve or disprove of how the developer is managing the actual game client and the game's economy, the actual game itself is very impressive."
14584,"Very nice game to play, enjoyable and fun to play with friends but, there is a lot of grinding and pay to win but it's still pretty good. The game also has very realistic vehicle models and a enthusiastic experience is given to the player."
14585,"I feel existential pain after each round, I recommend it to everyone ;3

14586,"Hate this ""game""
Idk why im still playing this"

14588,tank go kaboom
14589,Really fun game
14590,its fun
14591,it sucks out your soul.
14592,"funny
"
14593,Fetzt
14594,the core gameplay is fun and graphics are good. but the free to play aspect completely kills an otherwise good title with extremely high amounts of grinding unless you pay out the ass for good tier vehicles which makes the game basically pay to win essentially. after 10 plus hours in the game i barely have any good tanks and almost always lose in a one on one fight against players with tanks only 1 tier above mine which is sad. i cant imagine how frustrating it must be for people playing against players with tier 5 modern day tanks when all they have are tin buckets from WWII. so for those reasons im gonna have to give this game a thumbs down. people should not have to be forced into grinding hundreds of hours to get anywhere in a game just so they will get frustrated into paying money to have an enjoyable experiance.
14595,i lost a life that i didnt know that i had
14596,"I initially liked the game, but the game is inconsistent in what hit kill and and what hit's do nothing. I did have fun here or there, but more often than not I was just frustrated when stuff like me in a Sherman shooting a Panzer 3 in the side does nothing, but them shooting me in the front plate ,nowhere near my machine gun or anything sensitive, is a insta-kill."
14597,nice game pew pew
14598,"if you like to suffer this game is for you,
i usually eat shit for 5 games in a row then ABSOLUTELY DOMINATE for 1 maybe two,
progression is painful at best.
but god this game is fun."
14599,"I only have one jet and i am at the moment exploring sim battle now

update
The game is good as long as you hav mony, which is hard to get.
i got lucky with lut boxes befor, but now my luck is over."

14601,WERY GOOD

14606,great game
14607, i like it
14608,e
14609,Awesome Game
14610,"It is a fun game, but as time goes on, you need to invest more IRL money to move ahead in the game, and that is a shame. Progress without microtransactions is impossible after a certain point	"
14611,The longest I ever waited for a game to 'git gud'.
14612,"This game is fun but the grind  can be painful. Everybody who says its pay-to-win is lying. You wont get any advantage if you have 3 hours on it and buy a A-10, you might skip the grind but you are also skipping the skills needed to play top tier. The game is more Pay-To-Skip-Grind rather than P2W. You will be free kills."
14613,it is the best war game i have ever played
14614,"Don't get me wrong this game is really good, but sometimes it's quite painful to play and especially when it comes to grind."
14615,good
14616,"The art team of Gaijin did an amazing job renditioning the vehicles, the models and the effects all look amazing, the sounds sound punchy and you can really feel the weight of the vehicle. On that aspect, it's amazing. 

HOWEVER, what completely destroys this game is the poor network stability. You're going to face frequent ping spikes and connection drops, for a purely online game that kills the game. Not to mention the extremely long grind for higher tier vehicles and the matchmaking compression that sometimes pit WW2 vehicles with cold war vehicles. 

They could have a real banger on their hands but due to poor management of what they have, I don't recommend playing this."
14617,.
14618,Tank go brrr
14619,It tackes your sole but totaly worth it
14620,"All i feel is pain and violance from this game. The suffering is becoming to much to truly put up with. Everything i do seems to not be enoguh, and idk if i can put up with it anymore. So i highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to know true sadness in videogames."
14621,Highly fun game and highly recommend.
14622,"Best game ever  
"
14623,sr
14624,nice wow
14625,"very nice

german bias yet low win rate

lowkey pay to win, but not really"
14626,it is fun and you can shoot people with tanks
14627,"I started Warthunder with the closed beta in 2013, it was all about experiencing a new wargame with planes. At the beginning the devs really cared about the game and the community, sure you could invest money to progress faster but it did not change the spec of the game. But after they added tanks and more and more premium packs it obvious that this is a pay to win game, where you just spend X amounts of money to win. Immo the game is not worth playing anymore."
14628,"Fun, but the pay to win is annoying."
14629,"Feels like I'm fucking working, except I don't enjoy any part of it. Enjoy grinding for an entire week of 1/10th the way of a bar to research a new interesting tank (oh and as a bonus nothing is unlocked on it and it is literal cock and ball torture to unlock anything on a brand new tank). Enjoy getting one shot out of spawn by someone with every tank unlocked and 9 million hours on each tank with a bajillion premium paid shitter bushes on his shit so he blends in with any environment, oh but you killed him? He'll just hop in one of his million different super unkillable planes with bombs that replenish every 30s and huge cannons since you don't have AA then proceed to revenge kill you and your entire team the remainder of the game. Very fun! Very engaging gameplay! Super enjoyable getting sent to hanger with 0 to 1 kills after 5 minutes. God forbid you play a TANK MODE with ONLY TANKS. Nah bro! It's COMBINED ARMS you gotta get SHIT ON CONSTANTLY by planes that you can't do a single thing about, and nor can you do anything in your planes because you hate playing planes and can't unlock shit for them. Have fun playing Air Realistic by the way, enjoy holding W to the point for 5-10 minutes only to get one shot by some shitter that does nothing but play his unstoppable killing plane 24/7.

Oh, but you happen to have a great game, and manage to kill a handful of tanks or planes, or what-the-fuck-ever? Here's barely enough in-game currency to repair your lineup of tanks. We got a ton of different premium paid tanks that cost as much as literally brand new triple AAA videogames though for you to buy and shit on people that don't want to spend all of their money on virtual fucking tanks.

Fuck this game, I don't recall wanting to track the devs down and wanting to flay them alive this badly when I played casually ~5 years ago."
14630,"очень хорошая игра. ты не можешь пробить грузовик с 50 мм калибром, а пулемет врага нокает твой экипаж за 60мм бронёй. советую"
14631,"No, I can't recommend this as of now, the devs have handled this game horrendously with a plague of imbalance as a result.

Note: I have very little experience playing as anything not a tank or ground vehicle so I won't talk of air or navel battles, I have also never spent money on this game or any others like it.

SL= silver lions, the non-premium in-game currency

RP= research points

CAS= close air support

BR= battle rating, determines what fights what

Problem 1: The grind was long when I started 5 years ago but now it looks extraordinarily easy compared to now. 5 years ago if one were to get a nice 10 kill game and a victory (without a premium account or premium vehicle) they would get around 5000 research points and 30-40,000 silver lions (correct me if im wrong as my memory is not perfect), which was still not adequate as the grind was still so long one would need a will of obsidian to get to top tier. Now if one were to achieve the same results as mentioned they would get the same silver lions but maybe half the research making the grind nothing more than a colossal waste of time, especially with the devs constantly adding vehicles with ludicrously high RP and SL costs. Unless willing to spend literally thousands of dollars one will never realistically make it to top tier. (top tier is Battle Rating 11.7 as of now and I am only at 8.0 with only 2 re-searchable vehicles owned at that BR)


Problem 2: This game is heavily pay to win and it really doesn't have to be; seriously it should be 60-70$ at most with no pay to win. Premium accounts double RP and SL gains while (with bonuses stacking) premium vehicles double RP gains, some can be obtained for free but its either very hard or the vehicle in question is not very capable. There is a premium German version of the Tiger 1 that has double the front armor at the exact same BR at the Tiger 1, the Soviet IS-6 is at 7.0 and can easily deflect most things shot at it and easily kill most things it fights, the British Centurion mk5 AVRE can kill anything it will fight with no careful aiming at close range, the Soviet Object 120 can easily kill anything at any range and be wounded but survive most counter fire, the US T28 is literally a T95, a 7.0 BR re-searchable tank at 6.3, the German Tiger 2 H sla.16 has the same BR as the normal Tiger 2 but is faster. Those were just a few examples of pay to win tanks,  but there are many more overpowered pay to win vehicles and that isn't even mentioning the ultra rare event vehicles, which are a whole other type of evil.


Problem 3: This problem is exclusive to ground battles and it is that aircraft are allowed to be used in them, although only after doing mildly well in a tank, this means that close air support aircraft are able to quickly be spawned and are able to bomb/strafe/rocket anything of the ground with very little risk to said aircraft as while there is anti air tanks they are very hard to use and quite often garbage at low to mid tiers and early high tiers. of course fighters are spawn-able and are good counters to CAS, the CAS will often spawn before any fighters and get a couple free kills and is also likely to have fighters defending it when an opposing fighter does spawn. The weird thing is that very few people in this game seem to care about this problem and do not recognize it as one.


Problem(s) 4: The devs very rarely listen to the player base and act like nothing is wrong, it is positively infuriating. There are also too many cases of imbalance with the re-searchable vehicles to count and there is this weird glitch called ""ghost shells"", as per the name sometimes (as in quite rarely so its not like it effects game play that much) in ground battles when a shot is fired the game will fail to recognize the shell as real making the shell do nothing, it is supposedly fixed by the devs every single update but it's always there anyway.


Positives: The game is, as far a mechanics, damage models and graphics, clearly made with a lot of care and has no bugs that make the game unplayable, making it very worthy of the previously mentioned 60-70$ price and while the community can be toxic they certainly aren't the worst. Also this game can be plenty comedic with its many hilarious little bugs that I hope are never fixed as they add such an unserious, happy atmosphere to the game.

Please remember this is my opinion and it obviously is not perfect.

TL DR: Just read it you lazy bum!"
14632,"No dont

14634,Its free overall and if you want a boost in research its pretty cheap.
14635,It can be fun sometimes
14636,.

14638,My wallet is empty now thanks to this game.
14639,One of the most fun and frustrating tank/airplane/ship games I've played. Love being able to mix up what kind of vehicle I'm using.

Great variation between tank types and tank models, none of them made to bore you! I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a great tank battle simulator (NOT a tank simulator)."

14654,I hear voices
14655,"I loved this game, 1500+ hrs into it, and my account was hacked back some china d-bag. Because of such, the money I put into the game is now lost permanently even after presenting the evidence, which gaijin sent me. Yet somehow, it's my fault and they refuse to unban the account. Very much insulting, especially for someone who dumped so much time into the account as well as someone who literally never downloads mods for any game let alone one like this.

(please excuse the pissed off response your guy got - Don't know how else to send this btw)

Ticket ID - #1294532

As of 05/21/2022 I've heard nothing back from this developer."

14664,"There's too much meta sweating involved.
Cold War era equipment fighting WW2 equipment, LOL.
no no , just , just stay far away."
14665,game is fun and all until you realize that with every match you play a little part of you dies until you've grinded the game for hours and all that remains of you is an empty shell of a human being that once was
14666,"Not actually fun. You just drive a little bit, then die. In 50 hours I have ground USA and Germany to both the upper part of Tier 3. 

Team work is non existent. It is just randoms who happen to be on the same map. I quit this game in 2014 because of all the cheating mods. I returned because that was fixed now. Just, I can't say I am actually enjoying playing this grind and getting killed from the sides or rear by an enemy tank that is in front of a friendly tank. 

0 stars, do not recommend."

Getting to modern tanks and jets is a real commitment with 180+ hours; im not even half way through the tech tree and I only play one nation. Last, its frustrating. I cant tell you how many times I freaked out, blantently steriotyped someone by there vehicle or nation and just straight up closed the game. It's a hard game that takes talent and I don't have much talent and don't think I ever will, witch makes me want to quit because having fun just wont happen when your k/d is .57, so if you want to play I suggest getting used to dying over and over and grinding hours just to get a vehicle thats fun for an hour.

There are sum mar negs but I spent one hr in game and decided dat I didn't like how U had to grind a lot to unlock new tanks and as you progressed up the grinding gets mar horrible to the point dat its a lot worse dan World Of Warships. XwX"

14773,"Not free to play!! After playing this game for over 200 hours I have made some discoveries into how this game works. In order to enter a battle you must have a repaired vehicle, which cost large amounts of in game currency (which is insanely grindy to get). You will end up playing the same vehicles over and over again. If you do not purchase premium you will end up fighting more vehicles from the future/ better vehicles. One might think that if you play a game for 200 hours youd be close to finishing, nope. I am not more than a quarter through the American tech tree. So in short, this game is not free to play, if you dont empty your wallet into it you will not go far. Save your time, go play world of tanks which is actually free to play, unlike this pay to play, pay to win garbage"

But if you're on PC and like to fly or battle it out with tanks or ships this game is it. I played for 6 hours straight cant remember the last game i did that with, plus isn't this game free??"

The creators dont give a damn about your opinions, the game will filter you into lo scoring players so all damn day long youll be doubling the grind, and loosing money, this game is a shark pit of pay to win. it would be best to stick it to them, by not playing this."

I recommend this game for ages anywhere form 11 up."
14825,"Don't play this game. This game is so close to being good. But the balance, 90% of the maps in rotation are shit. The grind is shit. Every player in the game is shit. Avoid this game at all fucking cost."

14827,"Ok, I know I haven't even put a full hour into the game. But within that hour I have already completed all tutorials, placed 1st and 2nd in about 7 different matches between land/air/sea and I'm already super bored.  The game is beautiful, mechanics are great. So overall I'd say the game is great when it comes to function and visual fx.....However the battles just feel so underwhelming compared to what I'm used to seeing in other military games. 

Chat is extremely toxic and completely useless, so there goes the teamwork aspect unless you get friends who will play. Regardless though, in under an hour I find myself already bored with the free content and there's absolutely no way I'm spending real money on this AA game when I could  just go back and play AAA titles like Battlefield 1 and 4 where I can drive just as beautiful tanks who make much more realistic sounds lol"
14828,"I have put lots of hours into this game. and i still play from time to time. But after all the updates, all the nonsense, the allowing of high level people to go into weaker matches, paper mache tanks and plans where i get shot from 1km away and i have heavy armor and i instantly die, it is just to stupid now. I wouldnt recommend this game anymore. It has now turned into a cash grab for their VIP vehicles that are just god tiers and they are not cheap."

14843,"I want to love this game, but every time i get back into it i'm always reminded that the same problems still exist even after long breaks between playing. I like the way tank and air combat works, but besides new vehicles there really hasn't been much new in terms of game modes (except April fools events, but they obviously don't last) and the games balance gets hammered the further you get into tech trees. What really kills it though is the slow progression and the fact that your new vehicles are gimped making it a very painful experience to progress especially into the later tiers. I know why they do this (to get you to buy in), but would it really kill them to give you some repair/equipment to start. In the end there's nothing really like this game, it's too bad that it becomes such an investment to make any reasonable progress."

14850,"I would like to say this game is 100% pay to progress, the lower tiers are fine but once you hit that 6.3 and upwards mark you are simply unable to progress without premium. I would usually be getting around 7k research points on average with premium with a win and around 3/4 kills and a couple of spots/caps. Now my premium has ran out and im averaging at 2k if im lucky and doing super well so im getting 1/3 of what i used to get and honestly thats a joke. I shouldnt have to constantly pay premium for me to play the game. the incentive is just gone now as it would take me triple the time to get a tank....."

14860,"Purchasing a vehicle like the special purchases that will make you spend at a  cost of almost $50 to $100 is not interesting at all especially for just ONE  vehicle not to mention spending more cash just to speed up the grinding process. The grinding takes up a lot of time starting with one vehicle then the rest of vehicles you want to work on in a group.  And this is just from the first tier for a chosen country.  I do understand that I don't necessarily have to finish all tasks involved but play the game like it would never end nevertheless unless I spend 24 hours playing this game which is not realistic to most working guys like me,  it became tedious and time consuming at this point even after playing for 8004 hours.  The good thing about this game is I actually like the game itself and how it plays out and that is why I spent this much time on this game well that's before. But because of time restraints I still kept on finding  myself even just always looking forward to play this game again one of these days .  Overall I do enjoy this well made game for the most part and absolutely recommend it to my friends!"

14868,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

14898,"As we all know, War Thunder is a great game with great (and a lot of missed-) potential. 
As for the grind, we all know you're in for hell once you commit to a grind in War Thunder because if you can't put in 20 hours a day it'll take about 1 year to spade a whole country (air and ground).

However.. after 2300 hours I think that my game life will never be the same after we one day lose it. 
I mean.. it'd be a huge relief but also a part of your life that gets ripped away.

What I'm trying to say is.. if you're a person who enjoys grinding games such as Warframe, GTA (doesn't have to be relevant to the militairy theme of War Thunder), I'd recommend WT to you.

I'd say, give it a shot, cuz if you do and you get invested in it.. It'll be part of you forever.


And a part of your pain and wallet ofc... rip 1k..."

14923,yes
14924,"I want to recommend this game - Really really do, but it pains me to thumb it down.

Over the better part of about 30+ days I've decided to try War Thunder after seeing videos on Youtube about it, looks fun right? And it is for about the first 2-3 tiers, and that's when you start to see the nature of Gaijin suck their paws into your wallet.

The FTP format works okay up until about tiers 3 onwards. If you do not have a premium account, expect to spend countless hours farming for silver for repairs and basic upgrades / new tank designs. Premium account time will give you a bonus on these, quite honestly if you want to go further then tier 3 you NEED to have a premium account. 

There is also the battlepass tier system, have a life but want to get that sweet Elephant tank - well good fucking luck because although you get a daily bonus for logging in, if you do NOT do those dailys or spend sweet premium / silver tokens until you get the easier dailys you will NOT unlock that sweet sweet Elephant tank.

But hang on you say, there's premium vehicles - very over priced premium vehicles that give you bonuses to earning MORE silver lions but at a cost of your fucking soul. Not only that, your precious mKPz M47 German tank that cost nearly about 6 months of premium time will get destroyed because the match making / BR system is so broken that the moment you purchase one of these bad boys you will be put with others with much more impressive premium hardware making your Tier V supposed sex machine a literal fucking smoking tin can.

My advice - stay away from this terrible yet wonderful game, you will get addicted, you will spend premium currency and you will regret it the end.. now im off to play War Thunder because fuck me I want that sweet Elephant Tank."

14927,ver nice
14928,"Has all the groundwork of being an amazing game and I have played it since before it was available on steam and before ground forces were available.
Sadly the game seems to be in a downward spiral and definitely lost the enjoyment it once gave me.

That being said, the direction of the game, the economy, the lack of vehicles in some tech-trees, the massive amount of vehicles either for real money or through FOMO-events are just sucking all the fun out of the game for me.

Not even talking about there being literal bushes you can buy for real money and stick all over the front of your tank to get a TANGIBLE advantage over non-paying players by basically being invisible and covering up weakspots, chat now being disabled because of the war in Ukraine, new players not being allowed to use decals on their tanks anymore, decals being restricted in size, every event being a painful grind if youre not spending money to progress etc etc...

If you are looking for a casual tank game this might be fun but don't even attempt to get past tier 3/4 without a premium account and massive amounts of grind, in the current state the higher rankings are simply not meant to be reachable in an adequate amount of time for a normal player."

Unless you regularly fork over money to ease the suffering in this game, this is not going to be fun for the average person. If you do decide to play, I would HIGHLY suggest not spending any money at all. If you do, you might feel that you have to continue to play the game to get your money's worth. Gaijin, the company behind the game, also has a poor track record when it comes to customer service, responsible game development, and overall human decency.

14988,if u like war
14989,good game
14990,Without this game my bank account would've been in a better place
14991,still pretty new to the game it seems fun
14992,it's fun sometimes
14993,it aint to bad
14994,"70-80% yes

When it comes to amazing and capable engines and massive online gaming communities it gets discouraging when the developers start to charge you for features. Fortunately this game feel pretty solid without paying a dime as long as you don't get sick of the pre-ww2 combat trying to get to the later tiers.

The price Range for the extra stuff ranges significantly with planes being sold for a upfront 80$ or and extra squad slot for just a dollar. Each unlock you grind for is worth around 15$ bucks to Gaijin and probably about 3 dollars for the overall value for your account. 

This Company is like Games Workshop(old) in their quality and price and I enjoy the massive free to play battle simulator with unexpectedly optimized graphics and detail. I play this because it feels like I have influence over my own vehicles and get to use them in Simulated War scenarios in the Cold War."
14995,May the RNG be with you
14996,"This game sucks, Gaijin doesn't care about it's current player base and they never will. All they care about is making money. I can't recommend anyone start playing this trash!"
14997,o_o
14998,After having played this game for a little bit I can officialy say; Don't play france for your own mental stability and sanity.

15000,the game has realistic features on its playground i recommend it but i don't like the fact that we sometimes encounter a hacker please update it
15001,"THE MOST DISGUSTING CHEAT INFESTED PIECE OF MANURE GAME EVERY DEVISED. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME EVER!!!!!!! BEWARE THAT YOU WILL HAVE SO MUCH FRUSTRATION AND ANGER BECAUSE OF THIS DEVIL INSPIRED GAME. SO MANY CHEATERS AND UNLESS YOU ALSO CHEAT, YOU WILL CONTINUALLY DIE AND GET NOWHERE. I CANNOT UNDERSTATE THE SEVERITY OF THE CHEATING AND UNEVEN GAMING EXPERIENCE OF THIS GAME. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION AND NOT OFFERED AS FACT IN CASE THESE PEOPLE TRY TO SUE."
15002,Fun game with friends and free so why not
15003,high pings trash flight model and generally poor i and boring game. way too complex in menus and what you need to know and terrible lack of good game design really make this game a hot pile of trash. chat has been disabled probably because they had too many people hating the game.

15019,"The game is fun but extremely grindy, especially at higher tiers. There's a lot wrong with this game, but most importantly is how utterly screwed you are if you don't play the meta and/or don't have a premium account. German and Russian vehicles are definitely the way to go."

15033,"So done with this game. Just got killed by a 6.7 Tiger II, and the highest rated tank in my lineup is the 5.3 Cobra King I was piloting. This game has so much potential, but is horribly managed. HOOOOOOOOORRRRRIBLY managed. I can't stress that enough. The grind, the paywall, the matchmaking, HORRIBLE."
15034,"If you want a game more agonizing than putting your balls thru a grinder, while having to grind for vehicles that take longer than to go through than relapsing for heroin. This is the game for you, no really don't play this game I was forced to say this."

15036,tank and plane = me like
15037,if you like to blow shit up you will like war thunder

15041,very fun yes yes
15042,Get game
15043,"good game
"
15044,To be honest. You have to spend an inate amount of time to progress if you do not have prmium. In other words it takes a ton of time. There is a lot of balance issues in the game. I primarly played tanks and its not fun to be airbombed by a airplane and not be able to do anything about it. They should justr remove that option from the game entielry and keep plaines in the dedicated airplane warfare mode???. Also a lot of maps are unbalenced. Many maps portray historical accuracy but are unblaneced as adirect result. Personally as a sweeaty grinder i dont cara at all about historical accuracy i  just want the masp to be balenced. Also some tanks are just garbage and are only fillerts in the o so grindy tech tree. They are outpreformed by other tanks in the same teir on every aspect and thus playing them feels like shit. To be honest i dont recomend this game att all to the swatyest of players as youd only end up mad. At the same tim i dont recomedn this game to the casual players as progression is extremly slow after a few hours 20+
15045,This game is fun but the grind is better with friends.
15046,"its great but there is a grind to get to the top also you might rage, but... over all its a really good especially the graphics and the over all detail of the vehicles"
15047,"you want to play a game thats relaxing, fun, the devs care about it, and makes you froget your suicidal thots....

well then this is not the game for you"

15052,"It's realistic and fun to play, with cool ww1, ww2 and modern planes, Tanks, ships and Helicopters. I LOVE IT... just dont over grind and espect to be the best, even though first rank is easy :D"
15053,"there's a few thing about the in-game currency and game progression that could make the game much more fun, but if you ignore the 30,000,000 year grind it can be really enjoyable to play."
15054,"Possibly the most frustrating game I've ever played, and despite it taking a toll on my mental health this is truly the pinnacle of modern gaming, and I cannot deny, that grinding 90 hours to receive a tank worth less than 2$ on the Gaijin market is not only the best way of spending your time, it's the only way.

Strongly reccomend, it's free of charge, and it runs on most semi-modern systems, give it a shot, and you might as well like it."
15055,Its a good and enjoyable experience.

15061,Very good first military shooting game.
15062,"Overall the game has pretty nice gameplay. The only problems is that you have to spend a couple hundred dollars on the game in order to fly the planes you want, or, you can spend 1,500 hours grinding for a plane you think is going to be nice but realize it's barely average. I can only recommend or not recommend this game on steam, but if I had an option to put ""thumbs sideways"" as an option, that would be my option."

Or when i hit the panther side amour by the elge of the 40mm plate, my shell just get yeet to the ether or something and of course i got kill by that panther. That happen alot. Volumetric shells and overpressure so broken. If you can deal with the bug then this is a good game, but for me it time to stop."
15136,"ive come to the point that id rather die then play this game.

15137,"This game saved my life.

I am 50.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as."

15180,"I'd only suggest this game to those who can afford to occasionally spend money on premium, and don't mind a little grind. I've technically been playing since 2015 on my account and I've seen it all. Top tier is impossible to get to with a decent time without premium/premium tanks. 

Pretty good game, but definitely not for everyone."
15181,"It Good. Me like, because it good."
15182,"Just don't, its really not worth it"
15183,"I only continue to play because Ive already fallen for it and given money, but this game is NOT free to play. you can TECHNICALLY play for free, but you sure wont be actually getting to use anything cool without paying or putting thousands of hrs into it. Play a different game. There are many better."
15184,"I am on a apple monitor type thing and every time i  try and load the game is loads. and when its really close it just stops 
and i was waiting for 20 minutes and it still hasn't loaded
please help this issue"
15185,"I can't in good faith recommend this game. The foundation is solid. The historical accuracy, the plane/tank models, the damage model, are all there, great and very realistic. But all of it is ruined by the economy and questionable developer/balance/gameplay choices.

The progress in unlocking and researching new vehicles is very quick and satisfying in rank 1. But by the middle/end of rank 2 of any nation progress will become increasingly slower, and the cost to buy the already researched vehicles grows more and more, so much so that you can barely afford anything at some point. Almost everything costs silver lions, one of the MANY currencies in game, even the ammunition for each vehicle, and if you don't have a premium account, and at a certain point even if you have one, the mission rewards won't be enough to let you play at higher ranks continuously. It's bad, and it ruins the whole experience. 

The worst thing is that, when your vehicle gets damaged in a mission, you'll have to pay silver lions to repair it, OR wait several hours or days for it to repair for free. While in the first few ranks the cost is acceptable as you get rewarded way more than that for each mission, as you unlock more expensive vehicles the repair cost will be too much to be sustainable. Which means you'll probably have to wait up to days to play with that same vehicle again.

This creates a vicious psychological cycle. You don't want to be destroyed in a mission or get your vehicle damaged as when that happens you'll most likely become very frustrated.

The more you advance through the vehicle ranks, the more skill and knowledge is also required. Which is kind of fine, if the game was sustained by a fair economic system and didn't have questionable balance and gameplay designs.

I have mostly played with air forces throughout my many hours in game. While the arcade game mode feels pretty balanced, the realistic mode is not. I'll make an example about gameplay and balance design choices that I dislike.

In the last few days I was going through rank 2 of the american air force. There's this airplane, the P-51: when you spawn as a fighter in a realistic battle you will have to take off from an airfield, both factions do. The P-51 has one of the worst climb rate in the game in its rank as a fighter. And it's a boom and zoom plane, which means the plane is required to be at a high altitude and have enough energy/speed to be effective. Since both factions airfields are very close to each other, with that plane you won't be able to climb high enough to have the effectiveness that the plane requires. Even if you side climb, the plane will lose effectiveness once you reach 4000 metres of altitude and beyond due to its engine limitation. And by that time the game is probably already decided, meaning you've spent 10-15 minutes climbing without engaging in any fight whatsoever.

I have tried to play the plane differently, using it as a low altitude boom and zoomer, or as a turn fighter. If you play as the former, any other plane which has the altitude advantage over you will gun you down, and there will be. If you play as the latter, every fighter will outperform you and kill you, as the plane turn rate is very bad compared to other fighters. Once an enemy fighter has you in its sight, it's game over. This happened over and over again, as frustration mounted I felt helpless, the plane was basically unplayable. Its only usefulness, then, was to use it as a bomber killer, as at least its guns are formidable: but since most bombers at rank 2-3 will stay at a altitude higher than 4000 metres, getting to them will be hard and still take quite some time

This is just one of a few examples I could make. Bombers effectiveness is also questionable at best, as most fighters will gun you down at some point during a match. That is more a question of when, not if.

The game also has several single player modes that you could play. Some are free, dynamic campaigns is one them, some are not, the Pacific campaigns, which, from what I've read, they were last updated so long ago that some missions have become unplayable over time, as patches have changed the game and the specifics of each plane.
I like dynamic campaigns though: but again, Gaijin doesn't care about them. Some missions are almost impossible to win. They also have a daily limit, which means the rewards get scaled so much after you've completed a couple that you won't be able to get any research points nor silver lions by completing them. Developers want you to play online, not some unfinished single player mode they don't care about.

Do yourself a favour and don't play this game. You may get sucked into it, because as I said the foundations are all good and there, but over time you will realize you're mostly getting frustration out of it and you're wasting your time as the economics is completely rigged and want you to spend money on every turn.

I almost forgot to mention, after the war in Ukraine the developers decided to remove the chat, making coordination with teammates that much harder. It's been disabled for more than a month now and who knows when it will be back.
Go figure"

Unlocking my final tier 4 fighter the abomination that is the J7W1, I saw the test flight button, I was so tempted to click it. But alas I wanted to save it. Ever since I saw the Me 262 in war thunder I was hyped to use it, but for me the Kikka would have to suffice. When I grinded for hours finally to unlock it. I was met with a micro Me 262 and being easily chased by prop planes. I was still getting my cheeks clapped. Now I have a jet I dont fly and I am on to the UK tree."

It's very addictive and more interesting than most shooters and war games when it is at its best. I will grant that this game is FTP, but it has a painful grind made to squeeze money from you that outstrips almost nay other freemium game I've played.

However the game has a few core problems that make it frustrating more often than fun. 
-It's a loooonngggg grind, hundreds of hours atleast
-You must pay to repair and this means you can easily lose money if you are unlucky (causes way more problems bellow)
-players don't play to win. Winning pays fairly little, so it's safer and more profitable to drive past objectives and camp.
-only one game mode, while their are some slight alterations and decent number of maps, it's all point capture.
-in game purchases, should you chose to do them, are VERY costly and might help a bit, but do NOT fix the games core issues.
-in game chat is disabled, which while maybe understandable, makes coordination impossible 
-some P2W elements

It's fun at time but I would only advise playing f2p, and expect to only be playing up to early-mid ww2 tanks if you want to avoid making yourself miserable."

They just keep adding more and more things without bothering to fix what’s already in the game. Most players won’t even reach Rank 6 and they’re already adding more Rank 7 vehicles. 

The American tank tech tree is overtiered, sub-par in hard factors (armor, speed, firepower), and are downright inferior to their competitors, Germany and Russia. The Sherman was an amazing tank. Featuring 24 degrees per second of turret rotation, a ferocious 450 horsepower engine, and 100% of original penetration values. But now they are shells of their former snails. Their turret rotation is almost halved, now having 16.8 degrees of turret rotation, a sluggish 400 horsepower engine, and 75% of original pen value. Germany is babied by Gaijin and the Russians get their biased RNG armor and APHE shells, while America only sees nerfs. There has only been one major buff of American equipment, and that is the stabilizer buff. Even then it was brought along with a wave of nerfs. The only redeeming aspect of the American tank tech tree is the stabilizer and generally better players. Even then the stabilizer is used a reason for the many nerfs America sees from Germany and Russia. With the  Germans and Russians believing the stabilizer is some mythical war winning weapon! I have played all three nations and the stabilizer is not an ‘I win tool’. It is a handy tool to take advantage of when your sub-par armor, speed, and firepower doesn’t allow you to play on an even field with your competitors. “America Suffers” is a by product of “Germany Suffers”, and the best American players can hope for is to only get better as their equipment only gets inferior.

Now, onto the mode that is Air RB.

Air RB has been screwed over badly, and it’s never going to get fixed. Fighter mains are catered towards and any opposition/suggestions against them have never been fully successfully executed by Gaijin. Air RB has been turned into some sunset showdown where Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler shake hands, agreeing to send an equal amount of planes towards a designated location for a 'fair' good old show down! Que the wild west music, Yeeehaaaa! Aircraft were originally intended for ground support with reconnaissance, bombs, whatever. But Fighter mains have complained that an objective based game where they must support ground forces does not interest them and would rather have some game mode of KILL EVERYONE! Gaijin has and always will cater to them! The problem is in the air 'realistic' game mode.  It needs to be fixed how the battles play out.  The main problem is everyone treats air 'realistic' as a giant death match.  Nobody cares about the objective of the map.  So when bombers actually started playing the map it took away the fighters way of life.  Death-match.  Forced the fighters to actually play the game instead of just turn-fighting each other.  Forced to climb to 5,000 meters often in a straight line for 10 minutes to catch a bomber and shoot them down.  They found it boring and ended the matched too quickly.  Called us bomber pilots names and now we are shunned again. All Air RB has evolved to after years of development, rather devolved to, is Call of Duty featuring fighters! 

Another example of Gaijin protecting Fighter mains would be the request of Ground Forces players asking Gaijin for years on end to host a tank/ground vehicles only game mode separate from Ground Realistic Battles with close air support, or rather target practice for planes. This game mode has existed when ground forces was still in its early infancy and it was actually well received. But Fighter mains have once again complained! Because APPARENTLY target practice with player controlled targets is just so much more 'fun' than shooting AI controlled ground targets in Air RB. Fighter Mains also tend to disregard ground units waging a LITERAL BATTLE just below as decor, with the only reminder of its existence as mid-map anti-air installments. Not only that but these Fighter Mains also tend to sport a sense of 'honor' and an ego to boot. They view such tactics as Air Field Camping and Spite crashes as un-sporty! Despite these tactics clearly holding an advantage to those that use them. Air field camping provides an environmental advantage over your opponents, forcing your opponents to fight you on your terms. Yet this is again seen as un-sporty. Spite crashes done by bombers attract fighters. These fighters lose their initial altitude advantage sacrificing one of their advantages when fighting other fighters. They tail sit and proceed to dump ammo (usually missing all shots from my experience). Then the bomber proceeds to nose dive crash, wasting the fighter's altitude, time, and possibly ammo. Fighters then proceed to scream ""how un-sporty that the bomber didn't fly directly into my line of fire!""! Then proceed to brag about themselves carrying their team via their 'skill'. Even then, I'm sure if these Fighter Mains decide to play Ground Forces RB, otherwise known as Air RB featuring player controlled ground targets they would scream ""HOW UN-SPORTY"" when someone decides to take cover, camp in positions that can defend an objective well, and other various under-handed tactics. It's as if the British military officers from 17th hundreds gained a time travel portal and are now playing War Thunder, screaming ""how un-sporty"", ""what cowards"", ""what barbarious tactics""! Air RB has turned into the Death match game mode it is now and has been for YEARS because of these fighter Mains'' 'integrity', 'honor', ego, and 'skill'.

~This Fighter influence needs to be exterminated!

All in all, no matter how infuriatingly bad this game is, I love this game and wish for it to stop piling on new 'content' to take the time to fix the current problems that it has, old and new.

Here is an extension to my argument. I did not write this; this work belongs to MH4UAstragon, whom can be found on the War Thunder forums. I believe their words need to be read concerning the state of development of Air RB. - 

""Basically, any and all changes that have attempted to flip the table in Air RB, or even just ""stir the pot,"" always run into a wall I refer to as ""toxic pure fighter mains,"" even before running into further walls based on what the dev team's choices are or aren't. Of which in your proposed changes, the feature of having respawns would stir things the most. 

The mode remains stale because certain obnoxiously loud portions of its playerbase like it in its current deplorable state, simply because it caters to just what those portions of the playerbase want and nothing else. One person on this very forum literally said:

""If for any reason I need to abort a fun dogfight I am having to go save or kill some xxxxing bot farmer or spacebar warrior, or lose the match, that is the day I uninstall War Thunder.""

You cannot argue with ""pure fighter extremism"" like that. You cannot compromise with it either. Any time you try to compromise with it, such people then resume screaming while claiming ""but muh fighters take more 'skill' to use!"" and keep screaming until all the bombers and attackers are worthless trash, which is most of the current problem outside a couple oddball maps that favor attacker zergrushing (Spain, Poland, and Normandy are examples).

All these folk care about seemingly is one-life dogfighting til hell freezes over, and using the results of that dogfighting as a xxxx-measuring stick. 

How do I know just how much of a problem these people are? The last time we had a significant game mechanical change to the mode was in 1.63-1.65 when the extra vehicle spawns were added at the 20 minute mark. Those things were added as something to kill to force an end to a round where the last bomber is climbing to space or the last guy is AFK on his runway shielded by AAA. But then due to their ever-increasing uselessness, bombers and attackers with significant bomb payloads got creative and started saving a few bombs til late gam"

15287,"War Thunder is stunning and has amazing graphics but that's about it. the game claims to be free to play but in tern has an incredibly long grind just to be able to play the jets that you love, and how do you shorten the grind? money. lots and lots of money. in fact spending money on premium planes and and premium account can shorten your grind by an EXPONENTIAL amount. And with repair costs of vehicles (literally costs you money just to use a vehicle) the game punishes you for loosing/being bad and 90% of the vehicles in the game require you to get 4 to 5 kills just to break even. want to know how to boost the money you earn by getting kills/winning. more money. the economy with this game is so bad that spending no less then 100 dollars can shorten your grind for rp and silver lions (ingame currency) by 75% (the get to top tier USA would take upwards of a year but with premium it would take a few months). and all of this money you are spending to shorten the grind is supporting a dev team that does not care about their community at all. there is an incredible amount of bugs that have been around for so long and many many people have complained directly to the devs about and they have done NOTHING. speaking of the community, pretty much everyone is nice and willing to help, until you mention that you play arcade battles (aka the only somewhat enjoyable mode aka easy mode with respawns, unlimited ammo, etc) and then they instantly turn on you and shame you for simply ENJOYING THE GAME. i have personally played this game off and on for about 3 years and i just two days ago finally got the jet that i started playing the game for. so if you see the game and are expecting to play with a certain jet chances are you will have to spend a ton of money and or time just to be able to use it for 2 minutes a match and instantly get shot down by someone way better then you. horrible game"

I recomend this game for players who like intense warfair that takes teamwork, a good attack or defense plan, persistance, and skills. It takes a lot of practise to get all of these things perfect. best game so far!"

"
15346,"This game is ""amazing"""
15347,"This game is a money grab (I'll get back to that) filled with veteran+ bots. You don't have a choice you're either put in lobbies where everyone is garbage or against ""The"" Best Players, no in between. If you want to play a some war game, go play World of Tanks/Warplanes/Warships. Or try DCS because you will get to tier 3 and notice you can't make any damn progress without spending money. It's like EA games except you CAN grind out for days on end just to get above tier 3. I've been on tier 3 since last year AND I've spent some money on this game. Either I'm just dogshit or this game is an absolute cash grab. However, I will give it the aspect of having SOME fun aspects. Basically anything under T3 however even that isn't fun at times because you're put up against the players who are level 100 when you're level 5. (I'm serious this happens almost every game)."

15374,"pay to win and suck game ever.
dont be fool and dont waste your time

1.repairing system >> every battle you need repair your tank to be ready for next round, its okay till you get tier V or VI tanks  in these tiers and after that game force you buy premium pack or VIP monthly, cauase every battle you do after that you need more cash or coins to repair your tank  at these tiers V and VI  you need huge silver or cash to repair . even in every battle you be top number 1 player still  you dont get profit for cash/coins  even it goes negative per battle you doing , mean repair cost is huge more and you cant handle your game without VIP montly pack .

2.stupid pay to win system >> in batlle you see same tank as you hit more than damge you  ,thats why??  cauase they buying  heavy bullets for thier tanks then heavy bullets = more damge , and its free to play game !! yes you can buy those bullets as free to play player style  but  if you have not premium or VIP montly ,so soon youre coins will over  and its not matter if you in all round in battle be top number player  with highest score  ,still negative repairing system will win lmao 


dont fool cauase my game time  i played this shit ton hours on clinet luncher website"

If you install it make sure to change the default voice to German because there nothing more awesome 
than a German screaming at you while you are being destroyed and also there nothing more sexier than a German saying something with an erotic voice after you kill an enemy!!!!!

Anyway thank for reading!!!!!

P.S. this game is also annoying but hey that German boy-bussy is worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

:D"
15406,ı like this game yes its realy hard to grind sometimes (mostly) but its fun at the same time
15407,Play this game very fun
15408,"do you like to make yourself cry, so you hate yourself? download war thunder today"
15409,"I firmly believe this is one of my favorite games out there. I have always loved planes and tanks (and war in general), so this game has met every single one of my expectations for a war game and I absolutely love it. The only issue is the grinds and repair costs for silver lions, as I feel even in lower tiers I am losing 2-3 thousand more silver lions than I am gaining (even with premium)"
15410,"When you get down to it this is the best ""realistic"" combat vehicle game out there. Thats not really upto any debate at this point. You can say you like the other plane/tank games more thats fine. But this is the best your going to get if you want simi realistic tank/plane combat. Now the Navel modes are more or less a waste of time as of this review. The game play just is not good on that front. 

If you decide you want to play this game a couple things ill say is dont stay in arcade for to long. You loose alot of research by playing arcade. Im not hating on arcade but it is awful if you want to unlock things past Teir 3. Something else you want to do is play with some experienced people so they can teach you about all the mechanics the game dosent help you with, if you dont want to do that then you need to watch some Vids. Dont get me wrong the games not super hard or anything, but you will have a better time if you have help in the beginning.

My last major point to cover is money. This game is free but it can get very expensive very fast. Ive probably got 1000 dollars in the game easy. Now i have about 4000 hours in this game and have been playing on and off since the beginning, so 1000 dollars over 6-7 years is not bad IMO. What my advice on buying things in this game would be to wait for sales. You can always google when the next sale will be it wont be exzact but it will give you an pretty good idea of when it will be. The one thing ill say not to wait on is a premium account, BUT with that only buy enough to get you to the next sale then buy a whole year at half price during sale. 

Please dont buy things untill they are on sale.

Remember this game wants your money really bad and its not shy about it. DONT BUY ANYTHING NOT ON SALE. Except premium and only enough to get you to a sale.

This game is a very long grind.  Ground has always been terrible for grinding but air used to be ok. Now all the modes are awful at the high tiers. Its going to take you over a year to get the top vehicles for one Nation and thats if you spend some money. You can definitely get them faster but not if you new unless your just good right away. 

In the end i recommend this game if you like Military vehicles just know what your getting into, go watch some videos/streams ask around in your friend group if they know about the game, and join a squadron thats welcoming to new players if you can."

15414,"Pretty fun, don't get too obsessed though, as Gaijin is manned by some pretty nasty pricks."
15415,"PICTURE THIS. You wake up every morning to find your genitals wrapped in rusty barbed wire. Realizing the sensational amount of pain that is currently crushing your soul, you proceed to pour a half gallon of HEAVILY salted bleach on your junk. All this while you use your free hand to repeatedly punch yourself in what was formerly your dong and/or vag but is now just a mashed up pile of sadness. Afterwards you proceed to send/post a video of this fiasco to every single contact in your phone, as well as every social media platform known to the human race.

If this level of pain, torture and humiliation sounds good to you than WAR THUNDER is your game. NO MATTER THE SUFFERING......ONCE IT GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN YOU WILL BE BACK EVERY DAY! You may be asking, ""How does he know?"" Well, after logging close to 4,000 in game hours over approximately 6 years, my account was hacked. Due to the hackers actions the account ended up being banned. DID I WALK AWAY GRACEFULLY WITH MY SANITY IN TACT? F@%K NOOOOOO! I proceeded to start all over because I am a complete muppet and this game owns my a$$.

And through all that....somehow....it appears I am getting worse.

See you on the battlefield!"

15417,Love this game can be hard grinding but hang in and get the Premium Account when its 50% off . It works for me . Dont rush in running up the levels main thing is to have fun and build up your crew level. Keep an eye on your silver lions as when new it can run out easy if you keep buying new planes and tanks .

15426,"If you have some money to spend the game is very fun, the less time you are willing to put in the more money you will need to throw at the game.  Its possible to get everything you want without spending anything but it will take lots and lots of time to do it, even if you are good at the game.  

It has some issues that have been constantly complained about for years but Gaijin values money more than keeping its players happy so they continue to intentionally balance some things wrong to promote premium sales, and refuse to talk about it during community Q/A."

15435,Beware of Hackers! I have seen players shoot through buildings and from a extreme distance. The admins need to monitor the game more closely. You can't even have half a chance if someone is hacking. Look on YouTube as well. You've got braggarts on YouTube that even show hacking. Other than that it's a good game.
