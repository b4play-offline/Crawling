39,"All the challenge in this game is anti-fun. A great example is how they don't tell you the name or effects of an item before you pick it up, meaning you are forced to play at a massive disadvantage until you spam-play this game enough to know what everything does. Add in the ""challenge"" is 99.99% item stat checks, and this game struggles to find an identity since it requires the knowledge and time investment of a serious competitive game while offering the control and mechanics of a casual mobile game. Overall, not worth the time."

43,Huntress and Captain Main gaming. Extremely fun and violent.
44,"Great game! fun to play both alone and with friends. it is very fun, there are many characters, each one has its own cool abilities, which affect the way you play your game and learn to build yourself a strategy which suits your playing. although the items are random by default, you can later scrap them and choose others for your liking and use. has cool maps, great graphic, awesome characters, and more. also a good way to pass time and take breaks in between... you should have a buffy pc for it to be played since many npcs appear and can cause lags"
45,I liked this game when it first released but now there's too much shit in there. No clue what the fuck is going on anymore.

51,good
52,"It's very easy to pick up, but provides a decent challenge to master. There are a lot of items, and you can memorize most of their effects if you want (which I did) but if that's not your thing, the game provides a short description whenever you pick one up (that doesn't interrupt gameplay). The quantity of items does provide a fair amount of freshness to each run, but it can get pretty stale after a while.

I didn't think I'd like it because I'm not super into shooter games, but the stylized graphics make it a little less violent. I've heard from others that the soundtrack is repetitive and headache-inducing, but I really like it.

Overall, I give it a 9/10, definately would recommend."

I didn't even reach the 10 hour mark, but already died multiple times from enemies that somehow surrounded me and simultaneously used their own version of a ""death laser"" on my character, making my health go from full to negative in literally the blink of an eye. Highly recommended."

88,"just like the first ror2 has a ton of replayability. Every character brings something different to the table and for every playstyle, do you want to get in close use merc do you wanna do bombing runs play artificer or do you wanna stand still and just win engineer at least till monsoon otherwise he is your guy. I don't have an insane hour count but I will for sure play way more and probably buy all the dlc because even if the game sometimes has horrible rng with the items that modifiy you through your run being hot garbage and your run is doomed from the start it has those insane great runs that just pull you back. 8.5/10 really good some issues but i'd say worth the money."
89,"The game is kinda good BUT 
Paying for that much for a game that bugged AND a pretty ""empty"" DLC..

I mean the game is like easy 3D, no physics. There are no really depth in build, strong build are OFTEN the same and you'll try to mixup the same items on all characters to get damage.

But the biggest mistake for me is the bugs and gamedesign. Opening a chest that drop an item in the void, respawning after falling on the ground out of the safe area (so respawning 1 HP and dying), having the pink medusa pathing throught almost impossible obstacles. And the RNG of the chests is absurd, I did a run where litteraly 15 chests spawn in a pack but the medusa went at 2km from that position. It's weird and not fun, almost look like spaghetti code. 

I think the devs should pull out the fingers out of their ass, they get the money, now it's time to polish your EA game. Because yeah, for me, it's still an early acess."

93,Brutal game that is a blast with friend or alone. The diversity of builds and potential for godlike runs or brutally hard challenges keep this game always fresh even when revisiting. Also the game has an absolutely kick ass soundtrack and beautiful aesthetic.

156,"It has red mist mod from Library of Ruina, 10/10"
157,"I've never (I think?) written a game review, but playing this game makes me feel like I have to say something. 

BAD: The game isn't hard. It's not hard at all. It's actually really easy. It just scales absurdly at every boss fight. You'll die dozens of times because you don't know what killed you - every single time. You'll be doing just fine, but then suddenly something will just be absurdly powerful, and you won't know how to deal with it, and you'll die. You'll probably never know how to deal with it, unless you go read the wiki - and, sorry but, any game that REQUIRES you to go read a wiki on the game is a failure of delivery. 

Yes: ultimately, it's a roguelike, so it always depends on having A) a lucky run, and B) enough unlocks to win the game. But don't call the game hard, if it's just going to kill you unfairly. Hard games are hard because they require a honing of some skill set. This game doesn't have that. It has hundreds of random things happening at once, and your character is just sort of jumping around shooting at stuff, hoping that you don't have all your health drained suddenly by you'll-never-know-what (it tells you at the end of the round what enemy killed you, but even after watching recordings of my runs, I can almost never make sense of what causes my health to deplete suddenly). 

GOOD: The character variety is really great. Each character plays very differently, and the technical skill behind is character is unique. Those technical skills are learned quickly, so the learning curve isn't steep at all (again, it's NOT a hard game). It's just too bad that it's overshadowed by all the chaotic nonsense and literal randomness of this game.

The music is really excellent. 

6/10 game. Lots of potential, if the game actually were about skill, and if it actually were a difficult game, in the genuine sense of the word."
158,i wanted to write a positive review but im busy playing Risk of rain 2.
159,Fun game.
160,"i can't even begin to describe the amount of fun this game is. if you like looter shooters but hate min-maxing a build, this is the one for you"
161,"Rarely do I play sequels that change the format but recapture the joy of the original. They nailed it in this sequel, I hope they continue on trend in the future."
162,I wish i played this game sooner 9/10
163,Great game to play with friends or by yourself!
164,Fantastic. One of the most fun games ive ever played and definitely worth an overwhelmingly positive review.
165,fun
166,"great roguelike, good mechanics of gameplay
"
167,good
168,"One of the staples of the roguelike genre and for good reason. The first few hours of the game are brutal as there is no tutorial and there's an overwhelming amount of items and enemy abilities to learn. However, as you start to pick up on what each item does and how they interact with each other, you will start to know which items to look for and prioritize. As you get better at understanding how to counter each enemy and the optimal builds for each survivor, you get an unparalleled sense of satisfaction as you get better and better runs. The difficulty of the game is one of its charms as the unforgiving RNG nature of drops makes each run a unique challenge. The most rewarding feeling is when all the variables line up in your favor and you cruise through the end of a run melting everything on your screen that killed you in previous runs."
169,you might get wet
170,"The feathered enemies aren't quite as fun to attack as they are in Serious Sam games, but it's still pretty ok and above average for a decent amount of time.  Solo only perspective as of this review.  Worth it."

177,is good `\('-')/`
178,"this is a fun game, but u also have to invest some of your time if you want to get the most out of it"
179,"This game in very dumb terms is like a 3D Binding of Isaac for its loot choices, without restricting movement. I would even compare its maneuverability with something like DOOM, a game that punishes you for sitting still or not continuously moving correctly. The array of loot leaves the player with a different experience every time you play, and this is something that makes the game truly replay-able to the death.

PS: Mods are so damn good at making an imported character from another franchise look and feel as themselves. It sets up an example for many titles to appreciate and admire- how a game can be loved for itself and the ability to be modified for a more personal experience. 

I hope to see more titles be as challenging yet still alluring as Risk of Rain 2 made itself to be."

183,"I dont like the repetiveness of the game and no idc what people say that it changes with every item and combo but the enemies stay the same and the maps as well. the maps are fine and its not a problem but the enmies just make it boring. dont get me wrong its a good game but for me sadly not enjoyable. If u like playing against an overwhelmingly amount of enemies which dont change on the same maps over and over again but with cool variety of items with ridiculous things u can make with them, can be funny like this :D, then this game is for u. But at best u just buy it and give it back after two hours if u dont like it. Dont believe the reviews of anyone and just try it urself."

223,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

265,The soundtrack makes my cock and balls erect.
266,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Narkara and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

271,"One of the best Roguelite games ever, for such a good price. Tons of unlockable content and survivors, and a game that always manages to be fun after you learn all its secrets. The DLC just adds more of the game in a Void themed pack, and is well worth the price."

285,I can't recommend this game in good faith unless Hopoo implements Thiccify into vanilla; unplayable without mods in it's current state

324,"An amazing game, you can tell so much love and time was put into the game. Not a single bug that I've run into so far. I normally don't enjoy replay factors in video games when it comes to trying out the game with multiple different characters. But this game is different for some reason. The varying game play from character to character in this game, makes the whole game feel completely different with each play-through. Not to mention the fact that because it is a rouge-like, every play-through is already a different enough experience to begin with. The procedurally generated worlds are beautiful, and work great with the art style that the developers chose. Stellar game, 10/10, would recommend to anyone."
325,"This will be the only game ever that I will willingly throw money at anytime they release dlc.
Honestly the game is amazing but what truly hooks me is the goddamn life changing soundtrack.

Drop whatever your doing and hear me out, I have NEVER TRULY APPRECIATED music until I listened to Chris Christodoulou's magnificently epic soundtracks, look up ""con lentitud poderosa"" on youtube and tell me that isn't one of the most epic songs in gaming you have ever heard. Once you learn the rich history behind that song in relation to the first game and the developmental journey of this games early access It just gets better and better.

10/10 Stupid fun game with a soundtrack that transcendentally brings me to my knees and has brought literal tears out of my eyes. F*cking buy it now."

364,"Didn't expect this game to be so stupid and boring. Fortunately, I can return it yet."
365,"Absolutely loved the first Risk of Rain (had all achievements) but really dislike the 2. The switch to 3D imho makes it an absolute chore to find the teleporter (there's no landmarks to know where you are or have any sense of orientation, so you essentially run around for 30minutes walking extremely slowly) and fights become extremely chaotic. The first game being in 2D made exploration more enjoyable/easy and fights were more strategic."
366,r
367,Amazing game 10/10
368,Has a fun game loop.  It's a game that you will die frequently when you first start playing.  It's supper quick to restart the game and have another go.  The loading time is really short which just makes you want to give it another try.

440,"In this game you can become an invincible god that vaporizes everything on the screen in an instant, right before you die to a stray lizard-man that does enough damage to make a star collapse.
10/10"
441,"Risk of Rain 2 is a no-holds-barred Roguelike (note: NOT a Rougelite); it does not pull its punches, it forces you to make choices within tight constraints, and it often will put you up against odds and obstacles that seem insurmountable.

You're plopped unceremoniously onto an alien planet in an escape pod, environment so wide open or vertical that your running speed and basic single-jump seem comical in how insignificant they are to deal with the game world. You're expected to try and find a teleporter, a stone structure with a pair of horn-like prongs, to reach the next level - but doing so summons a boss monster that has a suitably massive scale as well. Said boss can manifest in the first level as: a beetle queen that summons forth more bugs and coats the ground in acid (in my opinion the easiest possibility), a massive stone golem that can punch you from the ground and fires a perfect-accuracy eye-beam at you intermittently, and a floating jellyfish that lobs electric balls at you rapidly, and - most dangerously - charges a massive shockwave that you have to either find cover from or escape, once it reaches low health (that or outdamage it). It's a rougelike, of course, so there's no guarantee that where the boss appears will have the cover structures any other game probably would provide you to escape such attacks.

So you might think the way to deal with all this unequivocally is to gather power for your character - find more items, get money to buy or repair them, and only challenge the boss once you have the tools necessary to beat them. Well, there's a problem with devoting yourself to that: every few minutes, enemies will passively get stronger as well, And based on what difficulty level you're playing on, that can scale up either faster or slower over time. Now while early-on you'll usually be able to passively level yourself up to boost your own health and damage to match your enemies, this quickly also becomes infeasible, because whereas your ability to gain EXP effectively falls off at around level 20 or so, the enemies' levels exponentially increase as you progress, towering into the 60-70 range around an hour into a game. You will need some way to either offset that power disparity, or go fast enough to avoid it altogether - [b]Or Else You Will Die.[/b]

It also isn't helped by the fact that while the map geometry is usually static (memorizing the layouts of places like Titan Plains or Distant Roost helps a bit), the placement of items and devices are not, and of course the offerings are randomized as well. Your character might need something that grants them a bit more movement speed, for example, but all you end up rolling is box after box of cautious slug or war banner, and you just have to, you know, deal with it. There are also some devices that can convert your items into different items for a bit more control, but of course there's no guarantee that those will show up in a level, and using most of them has a waiting period, meaning even considering to use a 3d printer or disposal will eat into your time limit more.

So it's altogether a puzzle with pieces that don't fit together: huge environments with limited mobility, power-increasing items that conflict with a tight time limit, and oftentimes enemy formations that don't have obvious answers or tactics for how you're supposed to deal with them. That's what I mean by Roguelike; those elements will clash and be rolled up from scratch, and you'll just have to deal with them.

If that sounds like a good time to you, then this game is perfect, all the more power to you. 

However, if it's not, Hopoo has been quite gracious to give us options to counteract some of this. Aside from the basic difficulty setting, there's layers of secrets that can be found and explored in this game, most notably series of tile codes that can be input to a strange portal base on Sky Meadow to complete Artifact Challenges. Now while most of them are detrimental or will make your game harder, there is a few that can be leveraged to reduce randomization - the Artifact of Command (with a code that is, comparatively, hiding in plain sight even), makes the game's build progression feel less like [i]Binding of Isaac[/i] (which, even then, that game didn't have a strict time limit!) and more like [i]Vampire Survivors[/i], where now each time you gain items, you are granted choices of what you can add onto yourself. Some will say this ""trivializes"" the game, but I don't care, I'm glad it exists, it has its own drawbacks (the game cannot pause while you try to decide and there's no way to discard items that might now be detrimental), and very few things that aren't cosmetic are locked strictly behind actual difficulty settings.

Most of my all-out misgivings have to do with the environment's size and scale, which I feel the [i]worst[/i] in the Commencement level; cool each time I want to attempt to unequivocally ""beat"" the game with a character, I have to do a 1-2 minute run-up a ramp, do some pillar stuff and platforming, then become a pancake. Aside from that, it's ok; the visuals are gorgeous, and the music is banging."
442,cool game
443,it's ok
444,"The game mechanics are fantastic. The movement and flow is amazing. The modding community makes the game so much fun. Extended multiplayer, New Characters, and so much more. I recommend this game to rogue-like and FPS players."

The geographically declined among us have no map, no way to location the damn thing half the time, and then it's stuck half in the ground or shoved somewhere so non-obvious it takes 20 minutes to find the damn thing.  Yeah, I know all y'all can find it just fine and it's np cause you're just that friggin' cool.  Guess what, not all of us can.  At least include a damn in-game map option somewhere so we can see what we're not getting to, or a pointer after so much time, or something.  Literally wrecks what was otherwise a lot of fun, and is now a waste of money sitting in my library.

Yes I know about the sparkles, yes I know about all the other stupid pet tricks y'all post to try to pretend the teleporter situation isn't @*&!ing stupid.  Does.  Not.  Help."

516,"HOLY MFing guacamole... I cant believe im this late to the party!

For veteran and fans: what the hell are you waiting for? Dont be like me!
""Does Risk of rain gameplay Even translate properly to 3d"" i hear you ask. You bet it does.... after having played RoR2 im actually just amazed it worked in 2d, as it seems like it was born for 3d! RoR2 is in IMO superior to its predecessor in any way.

For the newbies: Risk of rain and its sequel Risk of rain 2 are essentially your ""run of the mill"" roguelike. 
There are some unlockable character and loadouts, but there are no real powerups between gameplays, so you cant powercreep yourself to a win, you have to keep playing till you get it done propper! The ""unique"" thing for Risk of rain, is its time mechanics. The game gets harder, not based on the level, but on the time spent in the current playthrough. For the first 10 minutes or so its on easy difficulty, 20 minutes i  and it goes to hard, 40 minutes in and you get the ominous dificulty ""i see you"". You have to balance completing a level as fast as possible, with completing as many powerups as possible. There are 4 playable characters from the get go, and you can unlock some 8 Additional characters or so. So far the difference in playstyle between characters has been very satisfying. 
If you want a chaotic ""bullethell"" 3rd person shooter, or just need a New Roguelike to master, RoR2 might be one of the best games the genrer has to offer right now."
517,"It's a lot of fun, especially in multiplayer. Only slight issue is that the enemy spawn feels quite odd. Sometimes you get a dry spell, more heavily felt in multiplayer mode than singleplayer. A lot of things to unlock and the characters are amazingly well done - pretty much all of them have quite their own unique set of skills and playstyle."
518,"Got this game gifted to me a while back, didn't really like it at first and stopped playing, several months later i gave it a try again and its been to most fun i've ever had in years"
519,Addictive! Ethereal experience!

527,"THIS GAME IS FUCKING FIRE!!! IF YOU DON""T PLAY IT ILL EAT YOUR ASS"
528,"This game is amazing. Bought it on sale because I kept hearing about it here and there and boy, I should have listened the first time and bought it on release. Really fun roguelike with a small learning curve, lots of fun items and beautiful terrain. I'm playing on a 2k ultrawide and man this game is a beauty. Can swiftly turn into a neon bullet hell.
I did also just end up buying the DLC for full price, and I have no doubt it will be worth it. It will be very nice to have some more items to mess around with as what items are there, while fun, can get a liitttlle stale, but that's nitpicky at best. Just do yourself a favor and buy the bundle from the get go I think.
And I personally love that there's a modding community based around the game adding even more content to suit all tastes."

540,risk of rain is a game i would HEAVILY suggest more so with friends. but even alone it has lots of repeatability one downside its not a game if your short on time sense even short runs can go on for nearly 45 minutes but even so the many challenges and deep lore of the game are also a plus there always multiple ways to play one character. a good example is the huntress she can attack while sprinting you can go for damage with her first single shot primary or equip her other one two split it into 3 arrows which are better with status effects almost every character has alternatives and that's before really going into items and builds with each character. like with huntress secondary can shoot 6 arrows with a crit meaning a crit build is amazing with it. loader is amazing with speed meaning a speed build is viable sense a good number of her attacks deal more damge when she moving faster. i will say isn't anything no one else its said and there is a good amount of learning in it too and when grabbing more of something is pointless. like some items get less benefit from each grab like the teddy-bear you still get a increase but less and less each time or others that are pointless to grab after a point such as the crit glasses are pointless to grab after 10 sense at 10 crit glasses you have a 100% to crit and grabbing more is pointless. if your reading this trying to find a point to buy its a game with a lot of things to figure out such as how items work and in my opinion playing with friends makes it 10x more fun sense playing alone i find tend to need like a video or something in the background. i know my voice is just one of TONS but again if you need a reason to buy i personally would give it a try it and see for yourself your not gonna really understand the game reading reviews.
541,"Take this as you will

I played minecraft as a child, found league of legends, and have played nothing since for the past 9-10 years. This game is a BREATH OF FRESH AIR. I can't play it every day the same way I can with league, but I can play it often enough, and when I do it's like a 3-4 hour thing minimum. 

It's immersive, fun, re-playable, polished, AND multiplayer! If you are on the fence and it isn't the money, DO IT."
542,"This game Rains onto my brain and brings about a storm of Dopamine and I can't ever get enough.

559,lit
560,"very fun, many playstyles are available via different characters and builds"
561,cool
562,;'[
563,i love the intensity and chaos of the game and how you sometimes need teamwork each level you reach gives more things to explore and concur. i dont like that its kinda hard to find teammates when you really need them.
564,i literally just risked the rain twice
565,Excelent. I like the part where you risk.
566,looks like shit but gameplay is very good
567,honestly add a harder difficulty and mor among us
568,"unlike many rougelikes/rougelikes i have played, this one is one of them that i've actually enjoyed. good multiplayer, numero uno music, a very well designed final boss, and an amazing art style. it has plenty of content, and you will never get bored with this game. although it is *25$, so i recommend saving it for a sale."
569,Bought this game under the assumption I was to be a weatherman.
570,I dont even like rogue likes yet i love this game. along with binding of isaac this is the only rogue like i love. me personally i think its my favorite rogue like over isaac rebirth because its no die in two seconds hard but you gotta have a little skill with movement items time management etc. very good game recommend highly. this is a steal for 25 buckaroos.
571,Mithrix do kinda be hot tho...
572,NAJS 10/10
573,NICE
574,"This game has sucked me in just like the first Risk of Rain. Literally better in every way, graphic style is incredible, multiplayer is easy and fun, characters are truly distinct and different from one another. Cryptic and ""aesthetic"", soundtrack is full of bangers."
575,its a game
576,"Xi Construct, nerf its laser attack, its absolutely ridiculous!

1hr spent on a stage boss, difficult AF, eventually won only to teleport to the next stage to die WITHIN SECONDS BECAUSE THIS FXCKIN THING HAS DPS HIGHER THAN THE SUN!

Happening once is fine, but this is now the THIRD TIME THIS ONE ENEMY, ON ITS OWN, HAS ENDED A RUN!!

What's the point in trying if one enemy can just end it all?

tl;Dr - Xi Construct has single handedly made me not want to play this game."
577,"One of my all time favorite games, even without mods. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for an escape from the normal rougalike experience, into a fever dream like reality of suffering, victory, and reward."
578,if you dont play this game I will hunt you down

584,"perfects the formula of the rogue-like. good movement, good items, challenging but not truly impossible, has tweaks to the game through unlockables, lots of lore, characters that feel great to play, and natural to use, and bosses, lots of bosses, and REALLY, REALLY GOOD MUSIC. annd even rng doesnt have to be a problem when it comes to the ""artifacts,"" specifically the Artifact of Command, which makes it so the only rng is the quality of an item. truly a wondrous experience"

600,This is a truly a unique experience. My personal favorite rouge like game.
601,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this game yet, so first of yes get this if you have a group of friends to play with or even just one mate to join you. Game is highly addictive and can become intense pretty fast. Each time you pick up an item it'll attach to your character and every item is unique for what it does. It runs smooth so I doubt many players will struggle to run this game even at max settings. If you're considering getting it than don't think to much into it if you like these types of games that have crazy amount of things going on at once."
602,"don't play this game if you intend to just ""i'll just do a quick run and do my work"""

604,This game is perfect

627,"This is peak sci-fi, peak art design, peak perfomance, peak shooter, and peak roguelike right here."
628,"Dang. There's so much I want to express, but will try and be brief. With other roguelikes, my main issue is that I feel like I don't make any progress in the long term after failing a run. It can feel almost entirely dependent on RNG - where enemies spawn, what items are dropped, and when you can find the thing that progresses you in that one run. I can 40 minutes on feel like I have nothing to show for it. I haven't felt any of that with Risk Of Rain 2. Did I die? Maybe I earned an achievement that unlocked another item to pickup. Or maybe I learned that I shouldn't touch this shrine if I'm particularly weak. Or learned more about how two or three items work together. There's the occasional cheap ""what the hell just killed me"" deaths. But the vast majority of deaths felt epic and educational. So, over long term, I feel like I'm growing and unlocking more stuff, instead of just hoping for a good run. Character abilities and the way they can synergize with items can make or break some runs. I'm slowly growing an intuition towards which items to get.

That's just talking about the long term with this game. Actually playing is such a treat. I've had tons of fun with most of the characters, finding two favorites. There's an emphasis on always running and always shooting if an enemy is in sight. The gameplay can be frenetic, which is great for how easy it is to pick up. 

As a roguelike, I appreciate that there's a little more control over the items that you can amass on a run. If I wanted more of another item, I could shred another, or could choose specific items to purchase towards a build I was working on. I feel like Risk of Rain 2 nails this - allowing a knowledgeable player to create awesome builds. And that's gotta be my favorite thing about this game - that you have to put in the work to create a god build, but once you're there, it feels amazing.

I just finished beating my first final boss on Monsoon difficulty, and now want to try the other modes and modifiers I hear about - like Eclipse runs and Artifacts. It feels awesome to know a game will reward your time if you want to invest it."

You gather so many items/powerups to the point you become an self-propelled force of destruction, until one misstep ends your entire hour and a half long run.

665,"To be honest, I thought the game was just plain boring. Every run felt exactly the same, the classes played almost the same aswell. You have to search the entire map for items, what takes alot of time. I had in three runs, almost the same items and non of it felt special in any way. I ended up in the last boss fight, wich felt like it took forever ( 60 minutes + for a run), I was almost to quite because, most of the time it felt like nothing really happend. Just not for me the game.

690,"It's a good game.  Lots of things to collect, unlock, and get good at.  It really scratches that urge to hoard items and get loot while rewarding you for doing it each time you play.  It's even more fun if you go in with a couple of friends or look into some of the mods people have made.  It might be kinda hard at first, but there's no harm in playing on the lower difficulties while you unlock characters and get a feel for the combat and different types of enemies."
691,"when you play it with your friends, this game is sick!"
692,Depression simulator
693,gup baby yeahhhh gup
694,"If you're a fan of Roguelike games then this is the game for you, even though I've only played for 30 minutes. I refunded the game because I thought the game was an Open-world game like Zelda Breath of the Wild but turns out it was a Roguelike game (not my type of game)"
695,Pure chaos
696,nice gameeee
697,"[h1] You won't regret buying it [/h1]
Got this game when it was not yet officially out and played it for many-many-many hours (as you can see). 
It's a great game with fun mechanics and breath-taking challenges. I enjoy playing it with my friends AND by myself as well. Sometimes it even helps me vent my frustration in the endless run where you just shoot and jump until some random 5 inch enemy, that wasn't even looking in your direction, kills you xD 
I do recommend it for those who enjoy shooters and/or coop games. [spoiler] There are even some additional items that you can unlock which could really put your friendship to the test. [/spoiler]
So, go ahead, knock yourself out with this one!"
698,My favorite roguelike games
699,GOATED
700,"This game fucking sucks, play it now."
701,"Pros:
- Good combat movement flow
- Replayablity 
 
Cons:
- Monsters get generic at some points
- Very little amount of maps

Overall:
A good game to play with friends, feels a little repititive at some points."
702,Just a well done game that always keeps you on your toes
703,it fun
704,simply complicated fun
705,ok
706,I love games that give you companions and this can give you companions. A lot of random artifacts as well make that game a lot of fun.
707,buy i.tt.... or else you become SLUDGE
708,I played it once and now I can't stop playing it.
709,Buy it and you will love it.
710,"posted this same thing about roboquest. game is alot of fun, played several hours in it. However recently there is a bug that doesnt allow friends to join multiplayer games just 10 mins of black screen and kicked back to main menu. i would rate this game good but if I cant play it with friends as intended because this multiple month long bug then game sucks dick dont waste ur time. FIX. UR. SHIT."

716,really fun
717,I lobe game
718,kill them all
719,"I first started playing Risk of Rain 2 after a friend gifted me a copy so that we could try out the multiplayer, and I think it's safe to say that I didn't expect that I would get as obsessed with the game as I did. Honestly, even after everything has been unlocked and all of the environments have been seen multiple times, it's still so ridiculously fun to revisit Petrichor V, whether I do it by myself or with a friend. Although my favorite survivor is Artificer, every survivor is enjoyable to play as in their own way. The environments are beautiful, the music is amazing, and the lore is incredibly fascinating. The combat is also really satisfying, though the enemy scaling can be frustrating at times; I've lost some really good runs to simple mistakes and enemies dealing unexpected amounts of damage out of the blue, but it honestly makes the victories all the more satisfying.

As far as my multiplayer experience goes, harder gamemodes like eclipse will absolutely test the patience of you and your teammates. It can be incredibly frustrating to die on the final stage and leave your teammates to complete the entire escape sequence by themselves, but strategizing with my friends about item distribution and seeing our collective efforts pay off has been really satisfying for me.

Altogether, whether you have someone to play the game with or just want something to try on your own time, I couldn't recommend Risk of Rain 2 more strongly."

734,no rain 1/0.5
735,"Games dead. I have both the original and this one. Played them both. The original seemed more alive while his one seems to be missing something. It's not the same feel. It's the same game in many ways, but, they just fail to execute things in three dimensions. Nobody is playing ever in multiplayer."

783,"At first I didn't really like the game (I didn't play the first one that much), as I didn't get the gameplay flow. Only after having seen the DLC trailer and consequently buying the DLC, I started to realize just how much fucking fun this game is. At first I only played the DLC characters, but after unlocking the other peeps, I started playing the other characters more and more.
The game turns into a fun and unforgiving experience after putting the focus on simply overpowering your character until you suddenly die due to the enemies also getting ever increasingly more powerful."

10/10 modded experience would cum again"
801,"After about 40 hours I can confidently say this is my favourite rouge lite, everything in this game has had love and care into it including the soundtrack, lore, character designs and bosses not to mention the DLC which adds easiler over 80 hours of content this game works for both sweats and casual gamers (monsoon makes me wanna cry) the modding community is really cool with Mods such as vr, expanded items, different game modes I recommend this game to pretty much anyone 10/10"

808,"One of the most inaccessible game I have ever played: thrown into a level with barely information on what buttons to press (not even all of them), no idea what to do and no idea how to progress. Had to read a bunch of guides to figure it out.

After doing that, the game is pretty entertaining: make a build that suits your character, try to defeat the final boss, explore secret levels, find even more powerful items.

A roguelike game that's really nice in coop too (one copy per person needed)"

896,I played 100+ hours and i still suck.
897,"Absolutely insane. I've personally never played a game like this and I never played RoR1 so I'm pretty new to the genre. BUT holy shit is this game fun. A friend of mine introduced me to this game and insisted a group of friends play it. I was kind of all over the place at first and it does take a while to learn all of the different items and such. It gets easier as you go and it is not by any means hard enough to deter people from playing. The map designs are decent as well. None of them are linear and they are all special in their own way. The endless phases and waves become more stressful than you would like to think but in the most fun way possible. As someone who is absolutely in love with instrumental prog rock and similar music the soundtrack in this game is beyond words. The music that flows through your ears while you're spraying your way through hundreds of badass looking, well designed enemies is spine chilling. It hypes you up, it gets you ready to visit your next underground heavy rock or metal venue and bang your mf head. As a person passionate about music, the music in this game ALONE is worth the purchase. The game is designed to be replayed so the replay value is high. I myself found that it gets very slightly repetitive if I'm sitting here playing the game for hours and only this game but the differing buffs (items) per run and random levels make it much easier to get around the repetition. There are so many different builds with enough variation of characters (Each one has their own abilities and weapon type! There are also unlockable ones you get by doing different things while playing) that it stays relatively fresh. Some people may enjoy playing alone but I personally have a harder time playing alone. It's so much better with friends. All in all it's an absolutely wonderful game with decent level design, beautiful and unique art, amazing music, and a good time. At the very least buy the soundtrack, especially if you're into music like Intervals, Polyphia, Nick Johnston, etc."

907,"One of the best games ever made, and certainly underrated (Yes, I know it's overwhelmingly positive, what's your point?) The literal only reason to not play the game is if the rogueli(t/k)e genre isn't for you, and even then you'll certainly still like it enough to be worth the money (more than most other games can achieve). It's perfect in just about every way you could ask from a game, from the mind-boggling soundtrack by Chris Christodolou to the lore documents you unlock between runs(they're all worth reading) to the incredible runs you can achieve hours in. Some advice for those starting out: Difficulty is only there for if the game is too easy for you, don't be afraid to dial it back if you aren't having fun getting one shot by brass contraptions and alloy vultures with unstable tesla coils in void fields aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
Don't play it if getting addicted will pose a serious risk to your health, because we both know you will be."

911,"Boa música, compra."
912,"Jade Elephant = Morphine
Spinel Tonic = Cocaine

Prove me wrong"
913,"The game is mostly fun.  But is has some absolutely glaring balance issues.  The strongest status damage in the game is something normally only found on enemies, and it can virtually one-shot the player out of nowhere.  There's no big telegraph, you get hit with stray fire, you take the status on, and if it was an enemy with a lot of base damage, you die.  This basically means you cannot take damage at all and must play perfectly or you will have your whole run ended in an instant.

The last boss also has a design that I absolutely despise.  I hate the last boss enough that the rest of the game could be flawless and I'd still uninstall it.  There is a boss phase where it just takes all of your hard earned items and leaves you practically defenseless, and there is no counter play.  There is nothing to stop it.  And the icing on the cake?  It gets to use all those items against you now.  Get lucky with a really strong set of gear?  Maybe playing with command and have an absolutely OP build?  Now the boss has it, and gets to pummel you with your own good fortune and grinding.  It's like being punished for playing instead of speed running.

I'm not sure I could imagine a worse boss for a game than this.  I loved the first ROR, but I'm not sure I can trust these devs anymore."
914,so addicted to this game. now patiently waiting for new updates/dlc.
915,90% of the time I can't understand whats going on in the slightest
916,fantastic game
917,Very fun and extremely replayable. Highly recommend.
918,"a must have for any rogue-like enjoyer, can be very simple and very complex at the same time"
919,very good
920,"To say i'm not usually a fan of rogue likes is an understatement, games like enter the gungeon, hades, rogue legacy and various mobile and flash games that use the rogue like and rogue lite titles have never enthralled me very much.

This game however, has; in fact it is one of the few games that I have attempted to 100% and enjoyed the entire process to. The game feels fantastic and can captivate for hours a session, the only experience I can compare it to is some certain specific starcraft 2 arcade games that me and my friends have sunk multiple 2-3 hour runs into, reaching levels of enemy spawns and damage numbers that cause our pc's to slow and lag (which is something that ROR2 thankfully avoids outside of some exceptionally long runs and intended fuckery. Music, character's, graphics, and aesthetics are all 10/10's. Most items feel useful or viable outside of a handful of notable examples and the game is both rewarding and engaging. To give it the highest honor possible I actually purchased the dlc for this game which is something I almost never do (plus owning the dlc allows your friends to access it's contents barring the unlockable characters). I've honestly tried to find a flaw for this game to include in this review and I can't think of any. Though I praise it endlessly it may not be for everyone and a decent pc is needed to enjoy it. otherwise if your ever interested or even curious about the game it tends to remain quite cheap and goes on sale quite often with the dlc bundled for only a handful of dollars more.

in short 10/10 would buy again."

946,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Risk of Rain 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

951,"93/100 (With Bias, one of my favorite games of all time)

In this review I hope to analyze where most roguelikes fail, and how Risk of Rain 2 overcomes (even partially) these blunders. With over 130 hours in the game I find myself somewhat qualified, but I've seen the game played in depth more than enough to make a qualified statement on RoR2. 

To start off, many roguelikes allow the difficulty scaling to overwhelm even the most experienced of players.
-RoR2 also has a steep learning curve when it comes to difficulty scaling, but with the option of multiple different difficulties to choose from, it leaves the power in the hands of the player. This is something that I find particularly good for new players, because as much as experienced players will talk down on playing anything other than monsoon, we all know that a good drizzle run for a few hours can be just as fun, and if nothing else, great for new players to gain experience without being totally destroyed.
-Once one gets past the learning curve, they may find themself still ""stuck"" to an extent when they reach a certain point. 
RoR2 deals with this in an excellent way, because since scaling comes from item collection, the player is once again given the power to decide. One can decide (if their run isn't going the best or they just want a power spike) to pick up lunar items that cost a different currency than main chests. Lunar items can progress runs or end them just by the nature of their abilities, which makes them super fun, kinda like a glass cannon. Obviously the lunar coins you buy lunar items with are hard to come by, but any experienced RoR2 player knows a little way to get lunar coins *wink*. 

The next problem one finds in roguelikes is that you find yourself with a false sense of security at a point.
RoR2 is no different in this nature, because as someone who's been one shot 100s of times on double digit stages, I get it. 
-The items that RoR2 gives to combat this are pretty effective though. Anything from shields that can nullify damage as a whole to revives that give the player a second chance can be found as an item, which while not completely nullifying one shots, makes the game seem much more fair at a point.

Another problem you can find in close to any roguelike game is that there is usually one primary strategy that dominates runs. 
-The great thing about RoR2 is that 
1) Some strategies are better than other but all builds can scale to rival each other in power, and
2) Each survivor has their own kit, and some items suit one character better than another.
In this way, RoR2 has some of the best diversity in runs, and overall amazing replayability. Even if one masters a character, theres still infinite ways to play that character again, and the same can be said about the other characters in the game. At the time of writing there is 14 playable characters, and while some kits blend with others, the playstyle of each character varies significantly.
Therefore, RoR2's items, characters, and the overall nature of the game make it replayable for as long as one wants. 
The possibilities are truly endless, no run is the same.

Finally, the last major problem that plagues the roguelike community is that many times, there isn't much of a way to avoiding/escaping combat. 
Think about it, many games have the players as sluggish characters with nearly impossible to dodge enemies. While RoR2 does keep the player handicapped at the beginning of any run with no mobility for most characters, any good run ends with flying across the map, a typical feature of any run. Along with this, RoR2 gives the player many i-frames in a lot of survivor abilities, which makes dodging attacks quite an easy task.

While most of the things I analyzed above were positive, I should share some constructive criticism, because no game is perfect.
In my opinion, the time it takes to get to Mythrix by doing the pillars takes way too long, which is a shame because an obliteration is by no means as fun as a great boss fight, but most runs it seems like obliteration is much easier. If the pillar steps took less time up, Mythrix would be the most satisfying boss fight in the roguelike scene.
Other than that, there are up to 11 unique areas with 8 mains maps to be cycled through, (13 and 9 with the DLC) which can make runs significantly more boring as play count goes up. Along with total bosses in the game (13) combat can get a little stale, but a simple increase of maps and/or bosses would be a great improvement to replayability!

tl;dr: Get the game, most replayable roguelike and ultimately prevails where others fail."
952,Good game to feel overpowered after awhile and fun to play if you need a time passer or have the time to do a run

955,Fantastic game.  The DLC addons are definitely worth the money.  A fantastic rogue like to play with friends.  The graphics are amazing and the game just makes you want to keep playing.
956,"As of writing this I have about 90% of the achievements in the game and can say it is one of my favourite games ever. The game can however be challenging, and is not a game of leisure. The timed difficulty increases can make it quite challenging at first, but I found that after getting better at the game it is quite a nice edition. The characters are quite diverse and found it enjoyable getting all of them, however the same cannot always be said about unlocking the alternate versions of some abilities. Particularly, the alternate abilities for one of the starting characters the commando requires you to complete 20 stages in a single run of the game, and another one of his requires you to kill a very challenging boss. If you are a completionist, some of these achievements may be a bit of a burden, but I think that the pros out weigh the cons heavily with this game."

960,"After playing this game with friends, Solo, and for a decent amount of time, I find this game to be fun, addictive, and exciting. It gets the blood pumping, especially when you look around and see yourself surrounded by a lot of enemies. Now dont get me wrong, the game is not perfect per se, but it does not have many or really any major flaws. I would also highly suggest checking out the official discord server for the game, as it can help you with the many character guides, find yourself some teammates, and because its a friendly server!"

The game looks, plays, and even sounds nice. This is the same thing everyone else said but the background music is some of the best I've ever heard in a game.

988,"The game is great, no complaints there. However the developers broke the game for most Linux systems and are seemingly doing nothing about it. After the release of the Survivor of the Void Expansion, regardless of whether you bought the dlc, it takes about 5+ mins to load into the game. Depending on your pc it might be a bit faster or massively slower. People are reporting load times up to 30 mins or so, and so far there is no fix. This really sucks, since the game ran just fine before the release of the dlc. So if you are planning to play on a Linux system or the Steam Deck, don't buy until a fix is found or the developers patch this problem out."

edit: It's windows insiders bug. Will change my review when I get back again to it (soon).
===

Just installed the game to give it another try after a long break (bought the game on release day). 

Mouse didn't work in menus (you can move and see the cursor but LMB doesn't work, keyboard doesn't work), but figured out it was controller's fault. Disconnected my controller and restarted the game, then started a new run. Everything was nice and smooth. Started to enjoy the game. It was 30 mins into the run when my friend messaged me on steam. I used the steam overlay to respond... And then the mouse stopped working in game. I could only run around (keyboard was working fine) but was not able to aim or shoot. I was hoping the game had some kind of save feature, but I was wrong... Really?

Might change the review later in the future when I feel like giving another try."

Not even Captain with his long + close range gun could hope to rival the perfection that is know as Commando. I don't think I'd be able to play this game if Commando wasn't in the game, if Commando was ever removed I'd spend 2 months crying and I'd wait for Commando to return for longer than I've been waiting for Silksong. Commando truly is perfection; Commando is love, Commando is life"
1077,dont stand still for 3 seconds in a 100 minute run and you will have a good time
1078,"Risk of Rain 2 offers a great experience to be had with friends, serving as a perfect fit for those quick sessions you and your party can jump right into.  First off, the visuals are beautiful, going for that simplistic, aesthetically pleasing design.  The soundtrack is pretty rad too.  The difficulty of this game is handled mostly well, offering easy-to-understand controls for players to get accustomed to, but can become painstakingly difficult as you progress, which is fine!  In my experiences, Monsoon (Hard Mode) required me to completely change up the pattern of my play style.  The process of trial and error was fun for me to develop, however what it boiled down to was [spoiler]play solo, starting on stage 5 onward, immediately run to the teleporter, start it asap, and evade all enemies while chipping at the boss hoping no elites happen to spawn nearby.[/spoiler]  That's what worked for me, I'm sure more seasoned players have better strategies, however it transitioned from being a fun time to more of a chore.  For Monsoon, it felt like less of a skill issue and more of a luck thing + required less engaging tactics.  Aside from difficulty [i]which is chosen at the player's will[/i], each run will have the players acquiring a variety of unique items, allowing them to go nuts with stacking attributes like speed, homing missiles, and chaining attacks.  Each character plays pretty different from one another, so try and find your favorites.  Finally, the major unlockables you can work towards besides new characters are their alternate abilities and mastery skin.  These rewards range from fairly straightforward to more advanced.  These are great little challenges that increase a player's skill and give them a new reward to try out.  To me, this game manages to have good replayability while not hosting an overwhelming amount of content to unlock.

Risk of Rain 2 delivers entertaining game sessions for solo or group play, looks stunning with its use of colors & effects, provides plenty of variety while also maintaining a beginner friendly introduction, and has a minute amount of challenges that will surely keep players hooked for quite a while."

I come back to this point 5 months later and the bug is still consistent. I dont understand how there can possibly still be an issue with this 5 months later. And honestly i can only think of one thing and regardless of whether its right or wrong i dont fucking care cause im gonna rant at this shit. The game is now on epic games launch, and dont get me fucking started on how dog shit epic games it. Absolute degenerate company and we can prove that with rocket league after they took that over too. They need to get their shit straight or just go bankrupt or get bought out. please for the love of games fuck those shitters.

This game is pretty fun to play, personally I think it is better and also easier to get Achievements if you have more than 1 player. I would recommend starting on Drizzle and working your way up. If you are even somewhat of an achievement hunter like me, I would focus on getting one Achievement at a time, preferably ones that are simple. As you get these Achievements you will unlock Gear that you will receive when you open a chest, and if you accomplish a feat for a character you will also unlock an alternate ability for that character. There are also other characters to unlock. 

I recently unlocked all the Achievements for this game, it was a fun ride. Sometimes it could be frustrating, but that is like any game. Sometimes you will have no idea about how you died. But stick to it, keep going and it will get easier, as you unlock new characters, abilities, and Gear. I would recommend getting the Survivors of the Void, as you will need it for unlocking all Achievements, plus some of the Gear from the DLC also helps.

Lastly, I found this to be a very enjoyable game. Go get it!

1190,"Before ror2, i was a nobody. I was lonely, helpless, broke, and at the worst point of my life. My wife left me, took the kids, and made me pay child support or i'd get sent behind bars. I had no money and was constantly looking for outlets of my despair such as alcohol and drugs. But on this one fateful day; i had booted up my PC for the last time to say goodbye to my anime waifu desktop wallpaper, who had been by my side the whole time, but instead i decided to open up steam, looking for a game to play before my wifi and electricity cut out. That decision was single-handedly the most important decision i have ever made, changing the course of my life as i knew it. I looked around for a game to spend my final $20 on, and i found it. Risk of Rain 2. it seemed like a good game to play before i succumbed to the darkness around me. I played it, beat the final boss on Drizzle and my mind suddenly burst. It was like a thousand pounds were being lifted off my shoulders, as i realized my true purpose in life. To play ror2. At that moment i had the knowledge, strength, and willpower of a thousand men and women by my side. My life did a 180 as soon as i had seen that game over screen. I picked myself up and got my feet together. I found meaning in myself and had the courage to get my life back together. I started an e-business centered on helping young people who were in the same situation as me get their lives back together through the power of Risk of Rain 2, which has gained a massive following and has caused my money to skyrocket. Now I am living the good life, in a nice mansion off the coast of California, with a beautiful wife and a pair of kids who I will love forever. To this day I still make my students and I take daily recitals and prayers to Hopoo games in eternal gratitude for what it has done to me and my friends.

Thank you hoopo. But please nerf the atg"

1205,"This game is just a very well polished roguelike, a game that requires skill, but has a good spritz of RNG, you can get insane god runs so quickly, but also quite easily get bodied and all items are very simple to remember and memorize the effects of, not to mention replayability. Let's say you're done with the most stuff and 100% game, well guess what, mods exist to add custom characters, difficulties and so and so forth.

Not to mention you can get the entire game and DLCs for 10 bucks on key sites, and it the game does go on sale quite oftne"

1215,"Honestly one of the most addictive games I've played. Not only are the characters all completely different and require different items but even if you don't get the items you want in a run, you don't feel completely useless or weak. Every run of this game makes you feel like a boss at the end because of how much stuff is going on."

1221,"No two characters feel or play the same; different loadouts are available for all survivors; lots of items with unique effects and interactions; the gameplay doesn't feel repetitive at all for a roguelike. There are many unlockables, most of which you can get naturally just by playing the game. Overall, very balanced; you can win no matter what your luck is. Mod support with a very active community."

1226,"I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”"

1261,One of the greatest games in this new generation.  No roguelike game can compare to the sheer genius that was put into this game.  But no.   I hated it.  This game sucks
1262,you play as space hobos covered in knick knacks while shooting endangered wildlife
1263,"I've been reflecting lately on why some roguelites click with me and some don't.  It's not enough to say whether the game is good or not.  I've bounced off of many massively popular games like Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, Spelunky, etc.  Those are undeniably good games, but I couldn't get into them properly.  I tried many times.  They just never clicked.  So what's different between them and games like Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire; games that have taken over my life at different times?

I think more than anything else the answer for me is excitement over the possibilities of the run.  EtG and Dead Cells are fantastic action games, but runs feel more or less the same.  Maybe you get a new item and it changes your playstyle a bit.  Maybe you get a strong build and you complete the run.  But for the most part, you know what to expect.  You have a couple of items/weapons equipped, they may have some synergy, they may be strong, but that's it.

Then look at BoI.  Because there is no limit on the number of items equipped, and because all items affect all other items and effects stack, you can get absolute god runs, and you can get antisynergistic nightmares.  Anything and everything is possible.  And because of the sheer amount of different items in the game, it's tough to force certain builds.  You never know what you're going to come across.  And that's where the excitement comes from.  What complete nonsense is going to happen on that next run?

I've only put a few hours into Risk of Rain 2, and already I know I'm going to put hundreds of hours into this game, at least.  The game is good, of course.  I could list all the reasons why the game is good, but much more importantly for me, the game is exciting.  It clicks with me.  It gives me the same sense of wonder about the next run that BoI does.  The god runs that nearly break the game, and the duds.  What's the next run going to be?

If anything I'm saying is resonating with you, buy RoR2.  Don't wait for a sale.  It's easily worth the asking price."
1264,this game could beat me up and throw me in a river even though i cant swim but id still buy it
1265,fun
1266,i love this game

1268,it's a fun game the DLC makes it so much better. It's hard at first then it gets easy and fun.

Because of the salad it only works when I'm in Cook Islands, so I can only use it when I visit my friend, Archer. He says it looks crooked but he likes it. This game is the best videogame ever, I use it all the time when i'm in my port-a-potty. 10/10"

1318,it gud mane
1319,Why are you reading this review? Go buy the game.
1320,"It's fantastic. It feels like a game from a bygone era, but with the quality of life improvements of something modern. Singleplayer without having to be online, private multiplayer, tons of secrets, including areas and unlocks, and unlocking new characters and skills are rewarding without being too difficult. It's a game that you can pick up and play for 15-20 minutes, or for 6 hours straight, and it's not as difficult as one would expect from a rogue-like. I slept on this game for too long, don't do the same."
1321,I hate rain >:(
1322,fun game better with friends
1323,Finger licking good fun!
1324,Good game. Goobo our lord and savior approves
1325,could play over and over and over and over and over now im out of cocaine. 10/10
1326,"Might be okay single player... but playing with friends is far too frustrating... If I or my friend make one mistake in the later levels we die... can't respawn until my friend has finished that level, by which point and im super under leveled and under geared thus getting me killed immediately on the next, harder level"
1327,????????? why can i still write a review??????????????????
1328,"Best game to play if you want eargasm, eyegasm, and a whole bunch of other gasms you didn't know existed."
1329,very fun and lot's replayability especially with friends
1330,"It's a somewhat entertaining game for singleplayer, but really lacks in the multiplayer content. There's no incentives to play as a team and loot is constantly fought over. It feels like a singleplayer game that the devs slapped a multiplayer mode on top of. 

I never felt like I was progressing or unlocking things which lead to a lot of runs that I felt like I just wasted time and accomplished nothing. Death can come very quick and with very little understanding of what you died to. Items don't show their stats till you pick them up leading to a lot of confusion on what something actually does.

It's a very interesting concept, but it's not a game for me. Wouldn't recommend to friends."
1331,i have no friends and have been playing this all solo and its still fun
1332,lost to mithrix fuck you

1342,Absolutely incredible experience. So much fun especially with friends. Beautiful chaos. 10/10
1343,most addicting game ever
1344,fun
1345,Pretty good
1346,"I played this game with such intensity that I broke my mouse.
"
1347,This game is pretty addicting and can bring hours of fun and I like how each run is different since its a rouge-like. The only con is it might be hard to unlock all characters.
1348,"Risk of Rain 2 is by far my favorite Roguelike game. In my first run alone, I knew I would love this game to death. I would die many, many, many times before I cleared the game at all but that didn't sour the experience for me. With the vast variety of characters and items to collect (including the DLC), the many different stages you can go to, and the many secrets and collectibles you can get, this game can provide hundreds of hours of fun. Mods make the game even better and vast, but I will be excluding them for review purposes. Overall, this game is amazing and will only get better with coming DLC packs. Do yourself a favor and buy this game."
1349,it didnt rain
1350,me like :)
1351,"One of the best Third Person looter shooter rouge-like out there. Really fun alone, but when you get a group together with different artifacts one its one of the best games to be played ever. 11/10 game"

1374,good game.
1375,Its just plain and simple fun and endlessly replayable
1376,Really fun with adjustable difficulty and mods being addable
1377,"I wish I could give this game an almost thumbs up, but not quite a thumbs down. The biggest issue for me is replayability.

Great game, interesting characters, weapons, items, locations, and enemies. Battling waves of enemies is fun and even more satisfying with a group of friends. That being said, I find little to no desire to jump back into this game for a while. Shooting waves of enemies gets old after a while."
1378,"This game is is like an 8.5/10, One of the best games i've played and its the best Rogue like i've every played, My only issue with it is getting to Mithrix (One of the final bosses)but other than that its an amazing game, I would totally recommend playing it, And if you do get bored get r2modman, It allows you to mod the game and makes it feel almost completely new with the right mods, I recommend everything from kinggrinyov, I hope you enjoy i as much as i do."
1379,really good!
1380,very good :)
1381,I absolutely love trying to break this game. Mods make this game crazier. Definitely recommend! +1

1383,Mul-t with enough attack speed to make its damage per second into damage per tick is so good

1398,like Binding of Isaac but with lizards
1399,"This game is a fucking masterpiece. I have hundreds of hours on console, and moved to PC to play the expansion. It's an amazing experience relearning the game with the new synergies and crazy combos you can pull off with the new items and characters."
1400,cool game also damage can be dumb sometimes
1401,Risk of rain but 3D. Although its kinda annoying they took out some of the broken items and by extension scrapping some of the more fun builds. Overall still an amazing game with unlimited replay-ability. Trying to beat your best run with different builds is the best part of this game. Commando is still the best Character. Always will be.
1402,fav game and its goated
1403,YESSS!!! IT SO GOOD! BUY IT AND ENJOY THE SEROTONINS!
1404,"Goated game, insane modding community. Will suck your day away if you are not careful"

1449,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Risk of rain 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

1462,"fun game,sometimes annoying 
"
1463,poggers
1464,"personally i have reason to believe this is the most overrated game on steam so here's why:

- little to no content in terms of stage variety, literally every stage is just a different colour pallet with one minor unique thing being either pools, drops into the void or tall trees, none of them stand out or feel any different from the last if you play the game the only thing you might pick out from a certain stage is that you can do a certain thing to unlock a certain character, item or ending and if you've already done that once then the stage loses any and all significance, just another enemy kill and chest cycling run
- boring gameplay loop, spawn on different coloured stage, kill same enemies on every single stage, fight enemies to get money because it resets every stage so you're basically just running around fighting solely because your money resets so you can open chests and then when you open chests you just scrap all the items you dont want and then find a printer that dispenses an item that gives you damage or crit, depending on what you want to stack & then just use all the scrap to stack that singular item for a ""build"", then you activate teleporter kill boss, collect anything you didnt then go to the next stage, nothing changes, there's no gameplay modifiers aside from artifacts or anything that feels like it changes as you go through a stage
- bosses are just big enemies rather than bosses, they even spawn in with normal enemies whilst you fight them - to add to how unimpactful they actually are you can make it so multiple of them can spawn and it barely changes anything, for comparison in Isaac & Gungeon if you added more bosses you would feel the difficulty because the fight is more personal and bosses are more of a threat
- your weapons and abilities do not change when you pick up items so you're essentially stuck with a singular set of 4 abilities than you spam non-stop when they come off of CD for an hour if not more... the game is so character dependent its painful and if there isn't a character that feels fun and matches your playstyle you simply won't enjoy playing the game, all other roguelikes have items etc that alter your attacks & how they function allowing you to create crazy attacks and do nutty almost gamebreaking things, the only gamebreaking cool combos that you can pull off in this game is either infinite healing or insane burst both of which are extremely bland and dont make for a particularly good experience
- the DLC gives you one character that you actually have unlocked for buying the DLC and the other one is locked and you have to play to earn it aside from that it actually adds a single bonus stage for stage 1, 2 and 3, all of which don't feel any different from the base game stages!
- the only drive the game gives you to unlock anything is the fact that the base characters you get are extremely boring and basic and dont have any burst in their kits meaning that if you want to kind of build other than high attack speed with either crit chance, item proc or debuff you literally can't so you kinda are like forced to go damn i want to unlock these other characters... personally i couldn't be asked to do that because i played mostly with friends so there's no point in joining their runs just to cripple them by forcing them to give me stuff or just being crippled and useless so i just modded my save file and even after playing and having a go with most of the characters it all just feels the same
- the games story isn't really explained aside from in lore tidbits that you'd have to read in your own time, so its not very interesting imo
- it looks colourful and nice and its optimised really well which is a saving grace i guess
- other than that enemy design is all fairly uninspired and boring in my opinion, lizards, mushrooms & constructs made of metal, stone or clay and they either smash the ground or fire a projectile at you, they all die the same and feel the same, the most unique enemy in the game is the slime because it splits on death and considering every single roguelike has a slime that splits on death i think it highlights how boring the enemies are
- difficulty doesn't scale with the stage but rather time which makes absolutely 0 sense considering your money resets every stage so spending more time to get more money and collect things works against you in a way which is absurd, its like getting punished for exploring the stage and making sure you've used all the resources the game gives you and yes you can say ""play faster idiot"" but having your money reset every stage so you can keep getting into these fights over and over again just so you can start the snowball of chest opening is boring and it wastes time only for the game to bump the difficulty regardless, SO if you open all these chests and get nothing of value you can essentially softlock yourself into a loss because you ""wasted time"" when in reality the game just wasted it for you

there's a whole bunch more i could list on why this game is overrated and extremely bland in comparison to other roguelikes & roguelites on the market but if you've played a lot of games in those genres you'd probably understand why i feel the way i do about this game"
1465,goodest game jaja
1466,You can play as Goku. Need I say anymore.
1467,"What can I say about this game.... Its a complete mess of mass destruction, epic boss fights, hidden secrets, challenges and lore. At the time of writing this I have owned the game on both PC and console and I love it! Its great way to kill time letting hours fade away as you grow stronger and stronger, unlock new character and loot and meet better bosses. Its a great solo game but oh god does the fun only get better with a mate or two, and with the unique modifiers you can add at the start each run will amaze you and offer a new experience.

So all in all one of the best games like this out there, I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good challenge or casual gamer alike."

1508,"It's hard for me to find anything necessarily wrong with this game, it offers so much for such a simple game, plenty of exploration, level to level progression and an emphasis on getting stronger and finding better gear, an absolutely banger soundtrack (Sky meadow is the best I will fight) Plenty of character choices and variety for the characters too, though unlocking some of them can be a pain, I even thought some impossible at first, the longer I played, the more I realized it was too hard at all, I went from starting off barely able to even get to stage 5 on the default difficulty to now doing monsoon and modded runs to up the difficulty, there's a huge emphasis on improving how you play, your awareness and everything, and I've enjoyed every second of this silly game I've played, there's also a TONNNN of logs and information and even lore you can read up on, I continually come back for a run or 2 each day and even you can play with friends, 100% worth all it's merits, just a banger game overall, plus you can use mods and add like dbz or TF2 characters or something lmao."

1522,"Addictive, challenging and fun. This offers an experience both unique enough and similar to it's predecessor that both can be played and enjoyed in their own ways. The potential for insane builds, hidden unlocks, uniqueness of characters and simple to learn gameplay loop leads to a pretty addicting experience. The coop only increases the fun further. One issue I have are the length of runs can feel pretty slow at times, especially if you just want to get a quick game in. This can sometimes be worsened by the ""One more run"" effect but you can determine if that sounds bad. Another is the initial style of drops, i.e. random drops doesn't feel like the best way to play the game. There are relics that let you tweak this, including choosing your drops to really customize your build. This feels more like the way the game is intended to be played, which is odd to not start with. There are also missing QoL features like a description of items when viewing them in menus. Like a tooltip or something

1589,"It's a great game about collecting npcs and fighting all sorts of mobs until you have to defeat Moon Lord.
God, Terraria is so wonderful"
1590,"This game looks really boring and dumb, and I didn't think I'd ever try it until I was convinced to give it a shot. To sum things up, it is an amazing, immersive, and satisfying game that I don't think anyone explaining it could give justice to just how good it is, which is why I so strongly recommend just to play it and see for yourself.

Like I said, I can't give it true justice, but I'll try. Relatively big learning curve, but learning the mechanics is fun in itself. Every survivor/character offers a completely different playstyle and there is 100% chance there's at least one you will like. The items you receive, usually due to RNG, make every run even more different. One run you might get insane items that let you two shot every boss, another run you might get thrown tons of single stat boosts like speed and let you traverse an entire map in less than three seconds. If you still can't find a survivor you like, the game offers even MORE versatility and lets you switch around their core abilities to somewhat similar ones after unlocking them. The game is insanely hard. Obviously, there are easier modes, but the harder ones literally make me want to pound my keyboard, but somehow in a good way. Even after dying in a really good run, I don't lose motivation to play like I would after dying in Minecraft with good loot. I just get more determined to play again, because the game is just fun at its core. And oh, the MUSIC. Music is impeccable. The final stage music gives me chills and actually gets me in a massive weight on my shoulders, final boss type of mood, which is amazing (Like I said, IMMERSIVENESS!). Finally, the lore. The lore isn't shoved in your face, you don't need to know any of it to understand the game, which I really liked. As I played, some really bizarre things were going on that I asked questions about, which is cool that there is a bit of unknown in the game that I don't have to explore if I don't want to. 

I've been sad because video games seem to be less fun for me now. Risk of Rain 2 blew my socks off and lets me have great videogame experiences, ones that I haven't had in a very long time."

1634,"Risk of Rain 2 is one of those games that I think I could have loved if I found it before I started having to worry about paying bills. The combat is exciting and fluid, the soundtrack is quite good, and the sound design is incredible. There are a bunch of different characters to choose from and the game seems to have a lot of depth, which can be especially rewarding for reflective players who adapt on the fly to subpar conditions. On paper, this game is right up my alley.

I bought this game expecting a punishing but fun experience: something I could look forward to improving at after a long day at work. Get in a couple runs before bed, make mental notes of what to change in my game plan after every loss. All good, right? In reality, I boot up the game and my mind starts churning.

[i]What am I doing with my life?
Why am I trying to get good at this game?
What's the point?
Grandpa's dead. Grandma's dying. My dog is covered in graying fur and lipomas.
I miss my sisters. My friendships aren't what they used to be.
You know, when you think about it, our time on this planet is so short. Wait, am I still playing this game?[/i]

And I stare at the little khaki-colored character on the screen, whose smooth light-toned helmet is just a little too similar in shade and shape to a sad, bald head. I watch as this strangely melancholic little man sprints and scoots around, alone, watch as he desperately searches for a way out. Time's ticking.

I won't leave a bad review for this game. It has all the makings of a great indie title. But for me, this game consistently leaves me full of existential dread. Maybe it's the time factor, maybe it's the muted (but tasteful) color palette, maybe it's the large and mostly empty landscapes. Or maybe it's just the Commando's helmet. That darned thing reminds me of elderly men who've lost their hair, lost their families, etc etc. Whatever it is, it makes playing this game a real bummer.

I'll keep playing this game in the near future; maybe something will click and I'll start loving it like I know a younger me would have. But in the meantime, I'm gonna go pet my dog and tell my sisters I love them."

1683,do drugs go fast
1684,"Honestly, just a great game, probably my favorite roguelike of all time."
1685,"Awesome game. Progression is fun and the variety of runs is pretty good. the maps arent randomly generated so you could make an argument it gets boring but ive played this game a lot (played on switch and xbox before buying on pc) and ive not been bored yet. All the characters are unlocked differently and its fun and engaging. None of the characters are similar, every character has its own playstyle that you can customize with artifacts so build variety is pretty big. This is a game that isnt afraid of letting you become godlike and thats really fun. Want to loop around a few times while one-shotting everything and being pretty much unkillable? Go ahead, its possible. 9/10 game for me, recommend this game to anyone.  And i havent even played the dlc."
1686,"addictive combat style, has kept me coming back for more"
1687,"Stage 1 : Oh this is nice, haha, pew pew ! haha die stupid lizard !


Stage  20 : WHAT IS HAPPENING MY COMPUTER IS TAKING OFF AND I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ON SCREEN HELP !


10/10 Fun game."
1688,i like the part where they survive the void even though theres a risk of rain
1689,good game
1690,It's soooo risky to rain in this game
1691,when you get to a 2.5+ hr run it is   healthy brain rott . this game is so fun with friends & in single-player
1692,Great game. Endless ways to play
1693,Today's forecast; there is a major Risk of Rain today and it will most likely also continue for the next 2 days.
1694,"if you ever have money to buy this game buy it, probably the best purchase I've made this year and i simply cannot stop playing the game the difficulty is set perfectly and I love how it just gets harder and harder the longer your run goes and I especially love the modding community behind this game with custom characters and character skins making playing the game even better"
1695,Es good
1696,"This game is insane. You don't need me to tell you it's good, just look at all the reviews. It speaks for itself. I have never played a video game that keeps me coming back long after I think I'm done with it. I have probably a combined total of 200+ hours between Switch, PS4 and PC, and feel it's time to write my thoughts.

Risk of Rain 2 is perfectly fine-tuned sheer chaos. The game is designed for you to get so powerful you destroy the game itself, to the point you're standing there motionless eliminating every enemy on the map, until you get one-shotted by a fucking Elder Lemurian. Maybe next time you'll beat the final boss. Even then, the game is far from over.

On your way to that point though, every run has a purpose. New items dropped into the pool of available ones become available by completing missions in the game, and each level has secrets, and there are entire freaking secret LEVELS that are only hinted at through item descriptions. They took the sense of wonder from a metroidvania or open world game, and crammed it into a high-intensity action roguelike. I still find myself in awe of what this team of 2 people hid around a corner, and how they could create an artistic product that is never not fun or interesting. I really just don't get it. 

The characters each feel like a completely different game. You got a blink sister with homing arrows, Spider woman with a big punch, a Cowboy with backstab crits, a turret builder (go bungus), Wall-E if he were made for warfare, Mr. bomb-drop guy, floating fire and ice caster, and some absolutely sick new characters with the DLC. They each breathe new life into the game and feel like you're picking up something that's brand new.

It's high in my list of top 5 games ever made and it has become my palate cleanser, my comfort game when no others are quite doing something special. The new DLC is totally sick too, and completely changes aspects of the game I thought of as ""static."" This game just doesn't stop surprising. 

Get it already"
1697,"6$ per hour of fun well spent so far, play with friends."
1698,infinite stacking is surprisingly awesome. this game encourages trying every playstyle imaginable and manages to keep things fresh throughout

1727,"Absolute fun game, that gets a lot of new content, if you find yourself fighting over items with your friends there are artifacts that can help with that.
It is a bit dependant on research to unlock everything, and often descriptions are vague, so if you don't mind that then it's a great game.

1785,Buttery smooth gameplay and combat makes this a must for a pair or group of friends.
1786,To this day the way my friend described this masterpiece of a game when they introduced it to me a few months ago is my favourite 'It's like Hopoo Games found a way to sell a highly addictive digital equivalent of cocaine'. Best played with friends who stack you with their items for the dopamine hit on your first run to really cement the addiction but still an enjoyable experience solo. Even after doing a 3 hour god run and dying to a blind pest you still want to go back for more. 10/10

1813,"months ago a friend recommended me this game to play and I decided to check it out, It's rare now n days that I get hooked on a game but this game is one of em I'm hooked on it and I love it
I don't play this game often but when I do I sit down for hours and just enjoy every moment especially 
when its stage 3+ the game is fun as shit. What I love most about this game is its characters there is plenty 
to choose from once you unlock them I mainly play Commando (Best for new players) and the mercenary. Items in this game are cool aswell example: boosting damage, health, speed, and fire rate you can get a temp shield that does up every time you kill someone and to also mention you can do these codes to unlock ""Cheats"" or Perks like more enemies but half health, Pick your loot from chests and many more. The levels are beautifully made and have tons of enemies in each level that are vastly different from one another and the same goes for bosses.

Risk of rain 2 is a fantastic game and I highly recommend you pick it up and play with a friend.

10/10"
1814,"Very Rain much Risk.

Thus, YES"
1815,fun characters and challenging
1816,cool game
1817,Very easy to pick up and play even if I take 40 hours to get to the objective solo. Nice work!
1818,fun chaos
1819,This game is poggers 9000 frfr I literally picked up a rock and all of a sudden became immortal. Probably the best scavenger hunt simulator of all time
1820,"Outside of the pleasant visuals, risk of rain combines a looter shooter with a survival aspect + insane replay value in that there are multiple characters and multiple buffs/debuffs. In addition, the aspect that the game's difficulty ramps up with time brings a sense of urgency and each play though is it's own unique experience. It's fun as a solo project, but even better with friends."
1821,very good game if you enable mods it is even better
1822,"This game is so chaotic. Every run you'll learn a new strat, every run you'll see an insane new discovery. This game is so incredibly fun if you dont play it, your missing out."
1823,pew pew pew pew pew
1824,so far so good

"
1831,"satisfying smooth gameplay with unique and sometimes challenging mechanics. beautiful looking designs for stages and characters. this game deserves more attention that it has now. my one complaint though is that some sort of tutorial would help, though youtube has some videos"
1832,"[h1]Risk of Rain 2 is rogue like game with rarely seen feature like difficulty scalling with time.[/h1]
[b]About the gameplay:[/b] You landed on unfamillar planet and you are trying to escape by using items found on chests simultaneously fighting (or avoid) various enemies and bosses. The game ends when you successful escape from planet or you died (I don't tell about secrets ending)
In first runs you will propably early die, but you will get achievements, aka new drop items from chests, multishops; new characters and skills for them to use in future runs.
Graphics is minimalist, but is eye-friendly
Best feature is possibility to play with your friends (or strangers if you don't have).
And if you are fan of maxings you'll spend a lot of time to complete various achievememts
Don't forget about eclipse mode. If you think monsoon is easy, here you can check youself.
My favourite part of this game is when you are overpower on late stages. These a lot of objectails shooted from monsters and from you causing small lags. (If game lags, you are OP)
Of course you can add various mods, E.g. new characters, somes gameplay changes and more.
                                       [b][u]Pros: [/u][list]
 [*]challenging difficulty scalling with time
 [*]11 uniques survivors (playable characters) (+1 is secret and +2 is from DLC)
 [*]over 50 types of monsters (enemies)
 [*]over 15 bosses (including secrets ones)
 [*]148 items differing in rarity and 38 equipment (with DLC)
 [*]Multiplayer support
 [*]a lot to do if you are trying get 100%
 [*]a lot of environments with randomly generated chests and teleporters and small,but with significant changes E.g some doors is closed, but next time is actally opened
[*]Doesn't weigh much on the disk
[*]Mods support[/list][/b]
[b]   [u]                                 Cons:[/u][list]
[*] I don't found it   [/list] [/b]
In ending:
If you are rogue like fan, this is [b]MUST-HAVE[/b] for you
If you aren't still you won't be dissapointed"

10/10"
1876,Play it if you want to test the limit of your computer capacity!!!
1877,good game
1878,"The game is good, but,  when it comes to multiplayer, it has some significant flaws that can make it a real drag to play with other people over. This was a real deal-breaker for me since I bought it to play with friends and acquaintances.

Specifically, the looting in the game is often a race between you and your teammates to see who gets busted and who becomes irrelevant as the game moves forward. All loot is available to all players, and if you're playing with people you know this might not seem like a huge issue, but as anyone who's familiar with RPGs will know, having to do the accounting on loot to keep everyone balanced is a drag but neglecting it simply ends up having one person farther ahead than everyone else too.

And, upon dying, you snowball into total irrelevancy and quite quickly lose the ability to catch back up - one death you can come back from, though not easy, but two is run-ending for you - even if your team eventually wins, it won't be fun as you'll basically just be along for the ride. This is especially brutal since runs can last hours while you're unable to meaningfully impact the game any longer.

In my personal opinion, the game desperately needs something akin to loot instancing like what most ARPGs have long since grown accustomed to. If you are only looking to play this with friends and not on your own time solo, then I suggest perhaps rethinking it. I know I should have, it wasn't correct to make this purchase for me, and I hope this can help others avoid making the same mistake as I did.

If you think that this isn't much of an issue for you to worry about, and you like everything else on the box, then the game is probably a great pickup. It just sadly isn't something I can *personally* recommend."
1879,why does the rain have a health risk please tell me im begging you
1880,"Very pog much good
"
1881,good game
1882,i got very addicted to this game in a short amount of time i cant stop playing with my friends and trying new builds i cant wait to get the dlc once ive done more base game
1883,Unlimited hours of unadulterated action and adventure with zero BS. Definitely one of my favorite games and a great stress reliever. Highly recommend Survivors of the Void Expansion too it adds some awesome elements to the game
1884,Thumbs up

and the dlc is good too

bad:
-updates are decently spaced out (1st dlc came out 2 years after launch, but some larger free updates were in between)
-two artifacts (modifiers for your runs) completely trivialise getting all achievements (which includes completing the game on the highest difficulty on each character)
-multiplayer relies heavily on each player not taking all the items for themselves
-after getting all achievements, the only thing left to do is the eclipse runs, which are absurdly hard and require you to beat the final boss on each of the 13 characters 8 times (>100 runs)

overall an easy 10/10"
1907,yes
1908,i like the one that makes me go fast
1909,"Very good challenges to keep yourself occupied, with enjoyable gameplay. Anyone who likes a challenge, likes playing with friends and enjoys roguelikes, this is a good game for you."
1910,"eh its good ig 
could use more booba"
1911,"acid dog is great, everything else is okay i guess"
1912,this game crushes my soul everytime i play alone and i die to some random bullshit 1h into a run
1913,YES!
1914,meh
1915,I have no life
1916,"One of the best roguelikes in gaming, hours upon hours of fun to spend mixing and matching a huge swath of items with different characters, as well as challenging yourself in a variety of ways with Artifacts. There are also mods which are really easy to install to extend the gameplay and add lots of QoL features.
It's also an amazing multiplayer game, i've never had a single issue with the game outside of mods, save for the update when they added crossplay with Epic users, in which you an only play with other Epic users, not Steam users. Otherwise, multiplayer is perfect.
Next, the music is phenomenally great, absolute bangers from Chris Christodolou. Although a heads up, if you're looking for the tracks on YouTube, they're not named by where they play in game, it'll be annoying to figure out which ones are which. And if you want to listen to Void Fields without that speech which doesnt occur in game, Chris has linked it in the description. It's unlisted, so you cant search it, and no one else I heard of has uploaded the speechless version.
For the achievement hunters, be wary of this one particularly difficult one: Ethereal. For what you get out of it, I think it's a downgrade of one of your best skills, but the condition to require it is exceedingly difficult: taking absolutely no damage during a prismatic trial. it will take you extremely long to get, because you essentially need the perfect conditions for a run"
1917,"This game is terrible. It has destroyed my life.
10/10"
1918,Yes
1919,"BUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUSBUNGUS

jokes aside this game is a huge addiction of my and the only rougelite that I enjoy"
1920,Great game!
1921,">Steam: You should review this game.

K. It's aight"
1922,brainless fun. lots and lots of fun.
1923,"It's fun.
It's infuriating.
It's random.
It's good."
1924,"Risk of Rain 2 can be fun, but the experience it offers is as inconsistent as its framerate. You, or someone you play with, [i]will[/i] die in less than two seconds and have no idea why. The recently deceased will be saddled with a heinously punishing gear disadvantage, dooming them for the rest of the run. They'll die again at the start of the next stage, then sit in spectator mode doing absolutely nothing until the run ends, or the next stage starts the cycle over. 

If you mention this online, the prevailing wisdom you get from the community is to install a bunch of mods and avoid using half of the characters. I guess those are options, but the game has had the same problems for three years. You'd think the studio would have implemented optional revives, catch-up mechanics or item sharing by now. 

I'm still not sure if I like this game or not. Best I can say, I've spent an improbable amount of runs staring at my phone."
1925,I like the way the game builds in frenzy.  Be ready to spend some 10's of minutes on it or longer in one session.
1926,dying after spending hours on a run still doesn't feel like a waste. so much fun. the aiming in this game feels so smooth too. 10/10
1927,its fun. mods are funner.
1928,"All the chaos I needed in a single game.
Plus the music is awesome."
1929,bbvvvvvv
1930,fum
1931,Fun followup from the original. Has much of the same feel and made the transition to 3d really well
1932,"really good for a while
will get repetitive without mods after some time
then after an even longer time will eventually get boring"
1933,Yeah it's good
1934,Yes this game is absolutely amazing with the fact that every single run is different and the amount of variety there is in the game. I'm dead serious but this game gives me a god complex from time to time because of how insane the runs are. I really recommend
1935,"Amazing Game !!!!!! 
Please play it at least once
10/10 game"
1936,Achievement hunting has never felt so good
1937,"Game is good, and make sure when playing co-op you split loot evenly or else someone will get utterly demolished . Twisty if you're reading this I hate you, you damn loot goblin.

10/10 game"
1938,trinkets
1939,"Kinda sad me and my friends played this for about a month tops before there was nothing left to do, even with mods which are also a pain in the ass to setup"
1940,Is good game. updates are always good. would recommend

1942,10/10 Would Risk Again
1943,Game good
1944,i want to commit suicide
1945,might be raining
1946,its cool i guess
1947,"This is one of the best games I've played. The idea of starting out normally but get items to become godlike and destroy anybody in your path is amazing. The characters have there abilities and weapons which you can unlock more abilities by getting certain achievements for that character, it's such a cool idea. This game is very addictive and fun but the best thing is that it's so re playable. No character is ""bad"", you just have to play them right. Artifacts are a great way to play your game differently whether you make it easier or harder. It's not to hard to unlock them either. The multiplayer function is great to. whether it be with friends or with randoms, you can always play with somebody. And not only that, if you think your too good for the game there is the eclipse game mode which really test your skill by giving de-buffs every time you beat the game. I can't really say anything bad about this game exept for the occasional 6 BURNING which shreds your health. Dam you Grandparent. This is a repetitive  rogue like which is my opinion a perfect match. I hope somebody reads this so they can play it too. 10/10"
1948,Great game that is never the same
1949,i am fat and this game is enjoyable. thank you for reading my review.
1950,This is pain.. but ye i'm into that sh*t i guess ?
1951,good fun game
1952,Bungus
1953,overloading worm
1954,very fun
1955,ok
1956,Actually questioned whether I'd enjoy this game but Huntress booty definitely worth it. Game is also fun. But that booty *chef kiss*
1957,"I'm a bit nitpicky when it comes to what constitutes a roguelike, but despite being full 3D and realtime I've got no hesitation in calling RoR2 a proper Roguelike - and a good one.

Shoot, chop and kite through literal hordes of angry aliens, trying to keep up with the ever growing difficulty curve. Randomised items that do things like make enemies explode on death, arc lightning off your targets, summon a giant beetle monster to guard you, or more regular bonuses like boosts to attack speed and critical rate.

Graphically it's a glorious saturated, stylised extravaganza of colours and explosions and effects. Each map has it's own distinct theme and are often as high as they are wide, with you climbing cliffs and giant spiraling tree branches while defending yourself.

The sound effects are distinctive without being annoying, clearly allowing you to identify them, and the mastering is done well. Most of the player's tools and weapons also sound good, and the thoonk of the Engineer's grenade is engraved into my brain by now.

Gameplay wise it's simple - the longer a run goes on the tougher enemies get, and the more likely it becomes to see elites and even some bosses start cropping up regularly. You need to balance finding and buying items, killing enemies to get XP and coins, and getting to the next stage before too many difficulty levels have gone by. 
There are some environmental puzzles and exploration is encouraged - you need to find the exit portal the hard way unless you happen to have an item that can ping interactables on the map.

The game keeps you on your toes every run. Despite being overwhelming by nature the combat feels fair - even when the difficulty level hits truly ludicrous levels of one-shot bullet hell, you've powered up to fire missiles every third shot and set everything on fire while every enemy killed spawns daggers that home in on nearby enemies, while triple jumping through the air and moving three times base speed.

Soundtrack's good as well, a good accompaniment to both the quiet moments of wandering towards the next chest and the more frenetic periods of combat.

Overall, highly recommend, play with a friend but good for solo."
1958,its fun
1959,"Loved the 1st, double love the 2nd!"
1960,"- Gets the good shit
- Kills everything that moves
- Feels like God
- Dies from some random enemy who decided to camp in a corner

10/10"
1961,"10/10 alone, 19/10 with friends."
1962,"As a lover of Roguelikes I have to say Risk of Rain 2 is perfect. It's tough yet rewarding. Simple yet complex. Each character feels smooth and is perfect depending on how you play. 

The game is hard as nails at times. Sometimes it feels bullshit especially if your going blind into the game. But once you figure out how to play and you find a character that fits you. You'll be able to play for hours

The game times can stretch to an hour (Timer when I beat the final boss) or more (Runs can loop infinitely) So it isn't great if you just wanna pick up and play for a bit. But even then if you have the time it's perfect.

The multiplayer is fun and even better if you have friends. Just try not to piss each other off or no one will have fun

Grab the game. And be careful. ""There is a risk of rain"""
1963,":3
:)
:|
:o
:<
:OOOOOOOOOOOOO"
1964,"Extremely Immersive

Once you start a round you can't stop - but when you die you can put it down till another day

Perfect for one needing a dose of gamage without locking in hours/days of life time.

Can't fault it - really great game."
1965,"aweso,e fgame"
1966,absolutely amazing game nuff said
1967,brrrrrrrrr im commando and have a lot of autism
1968,"if the house was on fire, my bf would save a copy of risk of rain 2 first before me."
1969,BEST ROUGE LIKE EVER
1970,"Amazing game! the best rogue-like imo! tons of fun and the unlockable characters and achievements give you a goal to work towards. Love the single-player experience, haven't tried multiplayer yet!"
1971,K
1972,"stopped my hentai addiction, tahnks"
1973,Its fun to play with friends ;DD too bad their gone HAHAHAH
1974,"Artificer's thighs make me feel things that a game like this shouldn't be able to make me feel.

Oh yeah, and the game is really f*cking good too"
1975,I AM FULL OF HATE
1976,suppressed fire
1977,One of my favorite roguelikes
1978,"good game

cool visuals
smooth satisfying gameplay
collaboration"
1979,"I fired so many rockets i made a friends PC a slide show on the moon. 
so i would rate this game.

Infinite rockets / 10 or 10 fps on my friends PC out of 10
"
1980,"other games look good on the Deck. RoR2 does not and its even verified! idk gameplay i could not get past the graphics issue
"
1981,what the hell is going on
1982,"solid game. love it, a challenge and a rush."
1983,I liek game :)
1984,the rain risked it all for the second time
1985,"Risk of Rain becomes Risk of Pain, but it's all worth it in the end!"
1986,"GAME GOOD
"
1987,Good
1988,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1989,"I want to pet Acrid, let us pet Acrid"
1990,"Amazing game. Great single player or with friends. Simple enough to pick up and go, but intricate enough with the different survivors and items to offer infinite replay-ability. Fun visuals and super dope OST. 

My hopes for the future are a further expanding survivor roster and maybe an option to turn on advanced tooltips for items and skills?
"
1991,"If I ever see another one of those dollar-store liberty bell looking things floating around, mocking me from afar, I am going to scream"
1992,"Amazing game. DLC is definitely worth it too. The game may seem like it would get repetitive, but there's actually so much depth and intricacy to it that it never really gets old. No two runs are the same, and there's a plethora of items and characters to unlock that will keep you playing for hours at a time."
1993,The dark souls of all rains
1994,"OMG IM OP THIS IS INSANE DIO BEAR SAVE MY LIFE LETS GO SO MANY ITEMS I JUST KILLED MYTHRIX AND ESCAPED LETS GO!!!!! (have beaten the game yet)
"
1995,Somehow this PvE game is just calm
1996,Absolutely amazing game. Always a fun experience and the music is a stellar compliment to the gameplay.
1997,"The game runs smoothly once loaded even on low end PC. FPS count gets very high compared to other games. If you die (or when) it boots up quickly, and voila, you are instantly back in the game. Whole user experience is very well thought out. Only the initial loading takes some time, even from a SSD. In singleplayer there is also pause option that comes handy with children in the house.. You can get your ROR2 fix easily during the day, which can not be said of many other games. 

The game itself is more addictive than most abusable substances. 

Agility of most characters is so fluent and so much is happening on the screen at once with vivid colors it is like you are getting overload of information that is totally enjoable. It is power fantasy driven action but you can and will die a lot. Once dead, you have to start from the beginning like good old days. 

The game is short and you can play it through in one sitting, which I have done, with friends or alone. Of course the game is more nice to play with friends, but it's totally cool to play this title alone also. It gets repetitive but IMHO it is not boring but every second good time, except when game over hits...

Get it. You will not regret. I recommend for old school gamers because the difficulty can be ramped up very high. I recommend for people with kids, this is quick gaming fix you need. For others see gameplay videos from youtube etc, and decide for yourself. This is my 3rd favourite timesink, first being Fortnite and second Valheim."

2005,pretty cool :steamthumbsup:
2006,gopf and fun
2007,"haha 69 hour review, anyways games good, amazing music, amazing explosions, if you like going from ant to god in 30 mins you'll enjoy"
2008,You're gonna need a bigger ukulele
2009,good game.
2010,Amazing game. I am terrified of crabs now
2011,"6/10 for Multiplayer,
7.5/10 for Singleplayer.

The BAD
1. Same problem as Binding of Isaac: no tooltips for items under many conditions. I don't get the design philosophy behind it. It forces you to alt-tab 1000 times until you have the items memorized. It's annoying in Singleplayer, and f-ing annoying in Multiplayer. Speaking of which...
2. Multiplayer doesn't really work. The ideal and boring way would be to boost one person to infinity and perhaps have some others get support utility. yaaaawn. Further complicated by the fact the you cannot trade items. ""hey I found this, u need it?"" ""sure, let me run 3 minutes over the whole map"". speaking of which...
3. Scale and Downtime. The maps are ""too large"", or more specifically, traversing them takes waaaay too long. That brings me to downtime. This game is too fast when it shouldn't be (item choices and so on in Simulacrum or multiplayer in general without a pause function. Also, collecting boxes and charging the portal when you burst the boss down. Stand there for 3 more minutes doing little to nothing. How fun.), and too slow when it shouldn't be (why is the final boss not the final boss, but being tired of running forward for 5 minutes straight? It may motivate you to go for movement items in singleplayer, which is already annoying, but in multiplayer most people will end up holding W while the rest of the party is already done completing all tasks and waiting at the boss area). It dampens the fun in subsequent runs. Speaking of which...
4. Replayability is so-so. Although I am certainly wrong on this, it feels like there is little new to discover after reaching the first final boss. It's not really inciting to go for specific character builds if you have little to no influence on which items you are offered. The cryptic character unlock conditions don't help. I wish they were more clear. Speaking of which...
5. There is more, like bugged magma worms or enemies in general, especially in multiplayer, that end up going to heaven and out of your reach, but points 1-4 cover the gist of it imo. So far, so good. Speaking of which...

The GOOD:
Smooth gameplay, items can be clearly distinguished, stages are different, characters feel different enough

Overall, I think this game is worth picking up on sale for Singleplayer. I reckon it's more for people who heavily enjoy Warframe, but also like games like Hades or, of course, the original Risk of Rain. I found it too same-y and empty, with some unnecessary design decisions. While the core gameplay can be more fun than Binding of Isaac, picking up items is too much of a hassle. The decision whether you should go for the next level or search a couple more boxes while the difficulty increases with time is not one that I found particularly interesting."
2012,"Just good, get it! Why read reviews when you can be playing the game!"
2013,"bought it 5 days ago, i have 40 hours in it now, its ight i guess"
2014,I was expecting a lot more rain.
2015,"i killed a wave of thousands of enemies with one single plasma ball
10/10 game would recommend twice"
2016,"Great way to pass the time, the difficulty settings makes the game as easy of difficult as you want. There is more to the game than I initially though."
2017,Chaotic and Fun at the same time
2018,this game is just impossible
2019,"This game is, as you all could imagine, really solid, its a game definitely worth checking out if you already haven't. It's a game with a very solid amount of replayability and that not even including the mods for this game and most, if not, all of the characters are extremely fun to play and all present their own unique overpowered item builds and play styles. Hands down one of the best games in the genre. 9/10"

2047,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2091,Possibly Precipitation...
2092,It's an addicting game especially when you're trying to unlock new survivors. I didn't have as much fun in multiplayer than I did in singleplayer tho cuz your friends just start getting loot which you also need and the enemies sometimes attack them instead leaving you with less gold. Nice game overall with tons of playable characters and many stages with amazing soundtracks.

2138,"This game is great. Enough of a skill cap to keep you interested, a ton of unlocks and stuff to do, and multiplayer keep this game fun for a very long time (if that wasn't obvious). Below I'm gonna go into some areas of note, so expect a lot of text.

BASIC GAMEPLAY: The transition to 3 dimensions from 2 was done very well from the first game. Traversing the map, kiting enemies, even returning items feel similar but with more depth, which is great. Most of the survivors and their abilities all work well together and mix up playstyles well enough. The items are fun to play into the strengths of, but that kind of falters towards late game (I'll talk about that later). The basic dynamic of finding the teleporter and getting to the next level is comfortably simple, and the scaling difficulty puts enough nuance onto it that you can play fast or take your time depending on your preferences. Overall, it's very easy to understand and has enough depth to keep it interesting for a while.

GAME BALANCE: I have issues with how ROR2 is balanced vs ROR1. In the first game, your items meant a whole lot more. Since you couldn't manipulate them and simply got what you got (on top of less items generally), you really had to work with what you got, and the high enemy TTK's reflected that to make a difficult but very fun experience. ROR2 feels too transfixed on the ""god run"". It's not as concerned about player/enemy dynamics, and more concerned with getting you enough items to kill enemies faster than they can attack. Likewise, enemies are balanced around this to kill you faster than you can kill them if you don't dodge properly. This makes gameplay a lot less interesting later on because enemy differences become a product of the size of their healthbars, where enemies simply become something that will one-shot you if you dont one-shot it first. This also means you never end up taking less useful and more interesting items because they don't simply make you do more damage. When was the last time you ever used squid polyp or warbanner to lock down an area and play more defensively? It's probably never, because its better 100% of the time to simply turn them into crit and ATG. Because you find so many items, you end up mostly getting every item in the game if you go late, except for the bad ones which you've scrapped and printed into better ones because why wouldn't you? This results in most runs feeling the same, which is a shame because I really enjoyed runs in the first game where you would find items like desk plant or barbed wire and be forced to play around them because they're just the tools you have. This is my main problem with the game though, so don't let it sway your opinion too much, as it only really comes into play past a couple hundred hours.

STUFF TO DO: This game does a great job of using unlocks to keep you interested. Achievements are out of the way enough to mix up your gameplay early on, with some being really good ways to teach the player (I loved unlocking soulbound catalyst by finding different newt altars for example). On top of that logs are a fun way to add to the 100% of the game, even if some (voidling) seem to never drop. Hidden realms are another awesome extra in the game that are cool to discover at first, and fun to revisit in later runs. Artifacts and eclipse also provide (mostly) fun modifiers to your runs to shake it up a bit once you've gotten better at the game.

ARTIFACT OF COMMAND: They should have never brought this back. Artifact of command allows you to pick your items, effectively breaking the gameplay loop and turning monsoon difficulty into super-drizzle. In a game that already gives you a ton of options for manipulating your items, all of that is thrown out the window in favor of leaning further into that ""taking the best items so every run is the same"" type gameplay that gets you those boring, unbalanced, and time consuming god runs. I've heard too many people ruin the game for themselves by setting their expectations too high for their runs by using command, and I simply think the option should have been relegated to modders and not made easily available for no penalty (because yes, you can abuse it to bypass otherwise fun achievements too). If you play with command already, just trust me that getting better at the game will be much more fun with the proper gameplay loop, and if you're for some reason reading this before buying, never turn it on. Don't even use it for funny gimmick runs because it'll tempt you to use it for evil. I'd rather they remove this than frailty.

LORE/SETTING: Petrichor V is an awesome setting. An alien planet that actually has vastly different biomes, creatures, and secrets that are all well developed really give this game a ton of nuance. All of the survivors and aliens you find are sick, with every single detail of the game given an extensive lore entry in the logbook (seriously I fucking love the logbook). There's even stuff to find in game that let you participate in the lore (I don't feel writing about spoilers so you'll just have to use your imagination). All of the lore is detailed and just cryptic enough to be interesting even after reading everything, and every other detail of the game is very nuanced and colorful.

TL;DR AND RATING OUT OF 10: I said a lot of bad stuff in this review but this game really is a masterpiece. So much stuff to do and such clean gameplay that you won't even notice any of the negative thoughts I have about this game. It's very easy to sink a lot of hours into this game and I'd say it's worth the time, but that won't stop me from seeing more potential in it.

2156,"One of the best games I've picked up in all my life.

The sheer replayability of this game is unlike anything I've ever played before. No matter how obliterated you get, you will always come back for more. The builds you can set up with this game are amazing, and I cannot stress this enough of how much I appreciate this, there is absolutely no useless item in the game. No matter what you pick up, it will give you a benefit, most for better, some with a crazy benefit, but with a drawback (looking at you blue items)

Overall, you will love this game, and the DLC just steps everything up with even more items and unique enemies and levels.

2169,"I absolutely love this game. This game is the best action roguelike out there right now, hands down, and I've played a lot of roguelikes. Like, a lot a lot.

Once you get the hang of it, the game puts you into a kind of flow state with all of its weird features and items blending together into a tightly balanced and thoughtfully designed experience while still being chaotic, messy, fast-paced and silly.

If I was to place a criticism upon any aspect of the game, I would say I am not a huge fan of the ""sudden death"" that tends to end most failed runs. It's fun to fight against a massive horde and eventually get overwhelmed, it's less fun to get blasted from full health to none by some big metal balls you weren't looking at."

2172,"Excellent Rogue-lite. If you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy. There's so much variety from game to game"

Even if you are not so much into roguelikes you will enjoy your time with this one.
Fast paced, high fps game with no limit to powerups so you can start from barely moving to feeling like a god when you finish a run.

2186,is fun
2187,Great fun with a great modding scene
2188,"This game is fascinating. If you recieved this game from a friend, do not play this game only when they say they want to play it, absolutely play it by yourself and experience the fun, the rush, and the frustration that risk of rain 2 offers you. It offers drizzle, a fun and lighthearted experience while still posing a real threat, rainstorm, the normal difficulty, and monsoon, a whirlpool of blood sweat and tears ready to throw you into the pits of hell. This game might not be potato friendly, but even the worst of potatoes can experience the thrill of a God Run. 9.5/10, absolutely recommend."

2206,"This game is extremely fun. At first glance there doesn't seem to be much to it, but there's a lot of extra thing you can do that you don't see until you play the game. By far, my favorite thing is the challenges to unlock the different characters, as well as each character his their own challenges for abilities.

It's a great game to just turn your brain off and have fun. Or play with friends! For sure  worth picking up even at full price!!"

2220,"I loved this game at first, but it all went downhill after trying to unlock new characters and abilities. Some are absolutely trivial, while others will take days and days of grinding to unlock what are essential game pieces for the game. What a shame that such a brilliant game is completely overshadowed by these restrictions. Might as well have double the character cast with all the movesets, but might as well not since most people won't unlock these. Huntress I feel is a case to the extreme especially for the casual player or people who value their time. To me, this character is unplayable without her alternate moves, but good luck doing that for a week of ""Man I hope I don't take ONE POINT of damage"" else that's 20-30 minutes of lost time. I've never been so disappointed with a game more than this, because It's so fun, but doesn't deserve these restrictions. Again, these alternate unlockable moves might as well be a new character entirely, and it's a shame they are basically permanently locked for most people."

2232,"You probably shouldn't Risk your time playing this game you may Risk your sleep schedule.

See what I did there? I was trying to be funny by making a pun that involves the word ""Risk"" because the game itself is called Risk of rain 2 and the word Risk means a situation involving exposure to danger. What I was trying to say is that the joke here is playing this game might Risk your sleep schedule because the game is very fun to play and you might spend a couple hours daily playing it but I threw in a little pun the get a chuckle out of you or maybe make you cringe a little haha. But anyway I sure do love my jokes sometimes, my grandma once told me a joke she was all like ""knock knock"" and I replied with oh yo granny's trying to tell a knock knock. Uh who's there? she was like ""lettuce"" oh uh lettuce who? ""lettuce in"" then she does a back flip. You see I thought that joke was pretty funny because when she said ""lettuce in"" it kind of sounded like she was saying let us in, you know because a knock knock joke makes you picture the person telling the joke is at a door and you're on the other side responding to what they're saying while you're inside and they're outside and when she said ""lettuce in"" and it sounded like she said let us in it made me think oh I get it because it's like she's standing outside the door asking me to let her in. God Granny you're so funny sometimes, almost as funny as me though, you see unlike granny I actually threw in not one but two funny puns in my review for double the funny because what's better than one joke? two jokes of course expect I was doing it with puns. I don't know I guess I was trying to go for like a shoot your shot kind of thing like they do on the dating apps but I did it in the form of a pun in a review on steam."
2233,IT IS PRETTY FUN
2234,"It is a fun game to mess around in and if you like bullet hells it is certainly one to embrace.

I think the repetitive nature if something I am not crazy about and the always the same ending kind of thing grinds on my replay-ability but its a good 30-40hrs till it gets to the grindy point.

Was fun to unlock new characters, items, alternative weapons etc. but ultimately a little weak when certain builds or characters felt way more fun or easy to play."
2235,"This game has an amazing soundtrack to go with its fun gameplay. Whenever I listen to volkor X, I always wish there would be a soundpack that you can swap the songs out for to play while you're risking rain ingame."

2240,this game is like if the risk for rain was actually risky
2241,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2242,"Let me just start off by saying that this game is fantastic and that the only reason I am leaving this review as negative is because of what the devs did with the difficulty of the game after the release of the survivors of the void dlc, and the devs probably look at negative feedback more than positive feedback. So basically what the devs did is that they significantly reduced the difficulty of the game.

 Now first off let me explain how the difficulty of the game works. So how it works is that there is this timer mechanic where about every so often the enemies would become stronger and would appear in larger numbers. There are also 3 difficulties to choose from that affect this timer. If you played on rainstorm (aka normal) before survivors of the void the difficulty would increase about every 2 minutes and 10 seconds. However if you played on drizzle (aka easy) before survivors of the void the difficulty would increase about every 3 minutes, and if you played on monsoon (aka hard) the difficulty would increase about every 1 minute and 20 seconds (even though it says it increases the scaling by 50% for monsoon and reduces it by 50% for drizzle).

 However now monsoon is old rainstorm and rainstorm is old drizzle and drizzle is now stupidly easy. Now idk if this was a bug that not a lot of people have noticed (because i have never seen people who make content on this game comment about it or notice it). Or if it is just that the devs wanted to make the game easier. Now if it is a bug pls fix it although if this is intentional i have one question, why?

 To me, making the game easier is worse because now it is a lot less important to actually get good at the game which was one of the most fun parts of this game. To learn how to get loot quickly, To learn how to play the characters, to learn how to use an item the most efficiently, and to learn how to dodge attacks. Now before the dlc you had to know how to do all of these things to be able to win a run on normal which for me was really difficult. But it was really rewarding to slowly get further and further in every run. It was very rewarding to unlock a new character because most of them require you to complete a challenging task to unlock them. And then there is the final boss which I have always respected for being very challenging but fair and actually feels like the hardest part of the game instead of one of the easiest parts like a lot of other rougelikes. It really puts your skills to the test and you will die over and over (at least before the difficulty was nerved).  But then you get that one attempt where you actually manage to beat the boss and it feels super satisfying . Then after the fight you get a great ending and a new character that you really feel like you earned because of all you did to get to this point.

 Now take what I said in those 9 sentences and throw it out the window because that's not the game now. The game on normal now requires very little skill to complete and if you want to challenge yourself you can’t except for eclipse i guess but if i'm gonna be honest old monsoon is harder than eclipse 8. For the reasons i have listed i wish that the devs will fix this bug (at least i think it's a bug because i know the difficulty was nerfed after the launch of the dlc and the difficulty being nerfed was not in the patch notes).. Because if they don't fix this bug, in my opinion they are taking away a great experience from a lot of people because the amount of skill required to beat the game now is much lower than it used to be. So please fix this if this is a bug,and if it's not a bug then i guess the game will stay the same because if the devs change something it is because they think it would make the game better (although if this was intended it would have been included in the patch notes). Although I would hope if this was the case the devs would change there mind."

2254,"To put it simply, this is one of the best games I've played in a long time. I'm not that interested in these kinds of shooter games, but this one definitely caught my attention. I first got it around 2 years ago, and I loved it straight away. Though I had no idea what I was doing, since I got the game with no prior knowledge. I played it for about a week before slowly forgetting about it because I was playing lots of other games at the time.

A year later I found it again, and started playing. I got addicted right away, and started playing it every day for around 2 months straight. This game has incredible replayability, and is super fun and enjoyable, even if you're not into this kind of game like I wasn't.

Everything about this game is great, the story, the characters, the monsters, the artifacts, and my personal favorite, the itemization. The itemization is one of the reasons I think this game is so replayable. There are so many items to choose from, so many combinations between the items, and so many combinations between the characters and items. The game even has multiplayer, though in that the items are usually unevenly split among the players, with 1 person normally getting a lot more than the rest. Despite that, this is one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend you give it a chance."

2262,Good game. Enjoyed
2263,"This game is very hard if you just picked it up, but after some time things will click and stealing lunch money from lizards is gonna be a breeze.

This game has 4 difficulties that people talk about the most.

Drizzle
Rainstorm
Monsoon
Eclipse

If you just wanna run around and blow lizards up, play on drizzle so their fireballs become nothing more than spitballs.

If you want to just blow stuff up, but still want a risk of dying then play on rainstorm.

If you want a challenging experience then play on monsoon.

If you want to feel like your progressing on getting better at the game and you don't mind dying a lot to master it then play on the bonus mode eclipse.

For a newer player I would recommend to start off in rainstorm or drizzle and to learn each of the items and how they interact with each other and each character. Furthermore, learn each of the maps and plot a route to travel to get all of the loot quickly and effectively. Then after winning a few runs you can choose to go to monsoon or eclipse."

Yet it's still Crashing and I can't fix it, the game runs fine on a Radeon HD 6800, and lowering the graphics sort of helped. Admin doesn't really help me.

I can't find the root causes of my Crashing; it could be caused by Unity not liking my GPU (like Subnautica Below Zero, hates it), too literally anything else to do with memory or incompatibilities with hardware.

I wish for a lot of things, but I don't get whatever I want. If this crashing is purely related to the game I do hope it is patched. If not, fuck me I guess and all my games..."
2346,Amazing roguelike game with rogue-lite elements. This game also translates well from the 2-d style of the first game into 3-d. The gameplay is fast paced and arcade-like with plenty of options to spice up each run through the game. You can have hours upon hours of experience and play time and this game will still keep you on your toes and coming back for more.

On a realistic note, if you enjoyed the first game OR if you like roguelikes that switch up the meta with each playthrough, have a diverse cast of characters, items, and bosses, and you enjoy reading cryptic lore descriptions and traveling through the same loop (or different loop) of stages while beating the tar out of everything that comes in your way, give this a shake. Easy to pick up, difficult to master for sure."

2415,"This is a a magnificent game. Super replayable, smooth gameplay, incredible soundtrack and atmosphere.
To me, it was a tremendous improvement over RoR1 in practically every single way.
Buy this and buy the expansion - it is more than worth the bucks and the studio that made it definitely deserve your money for making this. Even if you've never played a rogue-lite before, you'll probably really enjoy it. I like it more than others of the genre, but that's probably because of my personal flavor, and that those games seems to be more about having razor-sharp movements and reaction speed. There's still a challenge to this game, but there's ways around having to play at 99% capacity to enjoy a good, long run.

10/10, the only thing I'd want more is even more expansions and even more characters and items."

2419,"I would love to say that I absolutely adored this game, but I can't say that in whole heartedness when the update with the void DLC completely made this game unplayable. If I try to load into the game, it takes me half an hour to get past the initial loading screen, and even if I am stubborn enough to try and wait that long, the game is also likely to crash if I play more than one match, forcing me to wait ANOTHER half an hour- ok I think you get the point.

Point is, I can't play the fucking game, and I have no possible way to fix this issue. If the ROR2 Devs are reading this - FIX YOUR GAME SO I CAN GIVE IT THE 5 STARS IT DESERVES"

2425,insanely fun
2426,DIS GAME SICK CUUHH
2427,highly recommend this game it is so much fun not only with friends but also solo. it's graphic and sound design is on point.
2428,yes good
2429,A GREAT game to kick back with some friends and create some crazy scenarios. Plenty of wacky builds to create and ways to play.
2430,became god and died the second after.
2431,"Risk of rain starts off a little slow.. then ramps up exponentially. It’s what I call a casual game where there’s a linear learning curve of easy to play, somewhat hard to master with a massive dose of RNG. 
Eventually you really start stress testing your PC and things go so insane that the game shuts down.. that’s what I call it a win. 
Luck really does play a factor too, be prepared to be playing, thinking you’re dominating just to be one shot by an overloading worm that decided to turn left."
2432,spfgrthui
2433,so fun with friends <3
2434,"This game satisfies the voices in my head. It lights the synapses in my brain and represses my urges. There was this spectrum rider at our school that everyone disliked with a fiery passion. I introduced him to this game and he died of epileptic shock. This event is now known as ""the incident"" and I am no longer allowed within 5 feet of any autistic people let alone children effectively granting me an immunity shield to other people's autistic urges. However, I can't seem to distance myself from my own autism urge to yell at the top of my lungs and digest colouring utensils. Great Game!"
2435,"good game
"
2436,"If ya like games like isaac or gungeon or any rogue like games, think of those but 3d and multiplayer. Its a BLAST"

2449,"Very fun game and can be modded. Game is just the right amount of difficulty and trying to complete all the achievements is fun. Mastery challenges can be a little difficult but are very rewarding once you finish them. Mercenary: Ethereal is my only complaint about the entire game. I did complete it, but I did not get the achievement :(. I have no motivation to do it again but idc I still have the skill. Very replayable and very enjoyable. Definitely a must buy."

2482,"Risk of Rain 2 is definitely one of my favourite games I have played, and probably one of my top 5 played games, having played it on 3 different platforms. while each run in theory should act similar due to the way items stack, the game still manages to remain fresh and exciting with each run. I also love how the balance still feels good in multiplayer, and it feels great to play with friends."
2483,Really fun game very fun and interesting. This game is way better with mod though. 10/10 would recommend
2484,"Fun game with lots of stuff to unlock and experience
absolutely do not enable crossplay with epic, it breaks multiplayer

2518,this is the game ever
2519,no i hate this game
2520,"Risk of Rain 2? More like Risk of minutes turning to hours as you slowly slaughter your enemies to oblivion. Frames? Who needs those! Kill 10 Void Reavers and Jailers? Pray you don't die in their instakill implosion radius as your 72 items proc at the same time and your computer starts to die! Risk of Rain 2 is really just a competition to see how fast you can get your computer to glitch like hell.
Pros:
[list]
    [*]Multiple playstyles and characters - Make Mithrix playable :(
    [*]Wicked item combos
    [*]LORE
    [*]Artifact of Command, Swarms, and Sacrifice make an epic combo

2553,it's more fun when you have a crippling gambling addiction
2554,"Blast of fun that encourages exploring, testing, and cooperation."
2555,"Extremely fun and addictive. Huge variety in gameplay stemming from the sizeable pool of playable survivors and plethora of genuinely interesting items. Some really fun challenges and achievements in this one and some less fun ones... I'm looking at you ""The Demons And The Crabs"".
Overall, probably the best rogue-like in recent years, and that's without mentioning the Survivors of the void DLC which expands the replayability massively by adding new playable survivors and even more items."
2556,A very well made game. A must play!
2557,gamer
2558,Yeah I like the game
2559,"It is very good, but I am very salty about the final sequence of the game because I JUST GOT HERE, BEAT THE BOSS WITH INFINITE PHASES, AND THEN I GET DESTROYED BY THE MOON BLOWING UP BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ESCAPE

fr i was lost in that area for an entire minute, then looked on yt on how to get out, then got to the ship and REALIZED IT HAD TO CHARGE WTF MAN"
2560,Real fun game to play with friends
2561,this game whips ass
2562,"What do I feel about this game? Freaking adrenaline like WOAAAHH -without knowing the time has passed sooo long. It's very much addicting and so much more to learnt while on the play. 

Let's say every character give us more different kind of gameplay and playstyle.. depending on our item do make the characters more astounding based on things we had even the equipment itself. 

I gotta say, I should have started play this game much more earlier but I didn't and here I am suddenly playing this game and have a blast with it. Recommended game - opinion may vary since this game very much repetitive in a way. Even so it's still made me play alot as how challenging and satisfying it felt.. Yeah..literally ""feel goods"" yo.

And as far as I know the community around this game still filled with tons of other contents mod out there that I myself might give a try in future. That's all that I can say now, since there's alot more for me to discover :)"

2573,Great sountrack
2574,Not that fun
2575,"This is probably one of the hands down most fun games I've ever played in my life. I do not particularly enjoy roguelikes (I hate getting a ""really good build"" going only to ultimately lose it), and yet I find myself playing this game all the time, so I feel like this is pretty important context. Make no mistake, this is a roguelike game, and you will ultimately die in it. But you'll want to keep coming back to it because you don't want to let this game be better than you.

It's great for passing the time, and this is especially true for the Switch version, which I also ended up buying and have clocked nearly as many hours on as on my PC. This game keeps a lot of what Risk of Rain 1 did so well: INCREDIBLE soundtrack, weird level design, and the characters are all so unique. Risk of Rain 2 feels like the game they wanted Risk of Rain 1 to be, and all they had to do was just make it 3D.

The expansion is pretty cool as well, highly recommend it because the ""void corrupted"" items make for some messed up builds. 10/10 game, get this one as soon as you can."
2576,"I love losing all of my progress for not moving for 2 seconds, love this game, would totally recommend for any roguelike fan"

2596,"The Risk of Rain was never this high, very good game but no among us reference so minus 1 point

9/10"
2597,"I have to go outside the game to get a mod manager just to have basic QoL in the UI like ""on all screens, I can tell how many items I have and what they do"" in a game all about getting lots of items and what they do. The UI in this game is thumbs-down-worthy on its own.

And that's not getting into how I spent like 45 mins of my first 2 hours in the game thrice-overing maps for teleporters because it's a flat black panel with mild particle effects that's 5% as visible as it should be for something utterly vital to enjoying your way through the game.

I have some ups and some downs to comment on the gameplay itself, which definitely seems like it can be fun if you 1. Download 3rd party mods to make the worst parts not a dumpster fire and 2. Have friends who do the same, but the fact that I have to go that far not to improve an already-good game, but bring it up to minimal quality-of-life standards, is a big thumbs down. I don't generally recommend things that require hoop-jumping when there's so many good games out there with good UIs and good visual design."
2598,chaos 10/10

Update: It gets fun again but it takes a bit to get into the swing of things."
2608,Yes.
2609,"I love the game dont get me wrong, but every time i try and play multiplayer, one of us gets disconnected from the game and cannot continue. It completely kills the enjoyment of the game and makes it impossible to enjoy with friends. Multiplayer definitely needs work/fixing. It always happens around the 50+ minute mark which really sucks as we are so far into the run just for it to be cut short by this problem."
2610,just buy the game dont be like my loser cousin the characters are amazing the replaybility is awsome and the dlc is great play solo or play with freinds theres no diffrence this game is awsome also dont pick up the shield generators
2611,yes
2612,"My absolute favorite game, its so much fun, the characters, the locations, the enemies, and the amounts of playtime, this is the best Roguelike in my opinion, The best thing about this game besides it being 3D is the items, not all of them are good BUT they can be the absolute craziest shit you have ever seen, tho there are other Roguelike games that have much more crazy stuff like this but damn, this game is so much. Do your self a favor and buy the game"

2621,"I can confirm this is a good game, it may seem repetitive but there is so much to do you wont get bored. But thats it, its impossible to play multiplayer. ive tried reinstalling but the game is still crashing. Its been happening too much and id rather quit playing the game due to how frequent it is. Ive had games where we cant leave the pod, games that seem like a good run but would crash near the end. Its just annoying and i dont feel like putting in so many minutes of gameplay just for it to crash near the end. You cant even rejoin if you leave which also annoying when people crash. Right now id only recommend playing solo if you dont wanna waste so much time getting to the end just to have the game crash."

It's super replayable, my favorite rouguelike, and has so much to learn, improve on, and keeps you coming back for more, making more goals, etc. The beginning of runs is slow, but that's only like 5-8% of my time playing, it's not even that bad, just bit boring compared to the utter chaos and fun later into the game."

2638,"Hug the Crabs They Don't Hurt

2639,Where's the rain
2640,"I really enjoyed this game at first, but the more I continue to play it, the more I'm baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reception this game continues to enjoy. Once you've played for a a few hours, you've seen basically everything. The game consists of only a few maps, ranging in design from basic to generic, and the main premise of the game is you want to run around the map until you find a teleporter, beat a boss (or bosses) and escape to another map until you beat the final boss; however, the longer you spend playing the game, the more the difficulty ramps up. Ideally, you want to find a balance between finishing the stage in decent time and farming enemies for money to buy items and upgrades, because if you book it straight to the teleporter, you're likely going to get your ass handed to you by the boss(es). 

The main issue I have is that a lot of the initial challenge comes from the fact that the maps are humongous and largely empty, and (barring a a couple of exceptions) have little in the way of landmarks or other identifiable features. Because of this, it is A) absolute hell to play without some form of movement speed items because it will otherwise take you 15 minutes to get anywhere, and B) very easy to get discombobulated and waste a lot of time running around looking for a teleporter and realizing you're checking the same empty corner of rocks you checked 5 minutes ago...and now there's boss monsters spawning all around you instead of basic enemies because you took too long. However, this goes away once you realize the teleporters will always spawn in one of a set number of spots, which is where some of my boredom began to kick in.

On top of this, there is just not enough variety in terms of anything except characters. I do love the character designs and the variety of characters (although, as with most games of this genre, some are infinitely more useful than others). Everything else gets very stale, very quickly. First, unless you have the DLC, there are a limited number of map environments; Stages 1-4 will always be one of two map options, and Stages 5-6 will always be the same, so you'll very quickly start to see the same environments repeated. There are a large amount of items and upgrades, but a lot of them are locked behind achievements that can be either difficult to unlock, or have such unusual conditions to unlock I would have never discovered them on my own if I hadn't looked at the achievement list (i.e., purchase the same upgrade 7 times in a row, kill a boss in less than 15 seconds, die three times to burn damage, etc.) This goes doubly so for character skill upgrades, most of which have really out there requirements to unlock, such as killing X number of enemies in one shot while airborne, killing Y number of enemies with exactly 1 HP remaining, land a hit while moving at Z movespeed, kill boss A with character B on map C with skill D, etc. 

Also, a lot of the items just feel the same, even if they look visually unique. For example, there's an item that makes lightning bounce between enemies and one that makes fire bounce between them; an item that heals you when you kill an enemy and an item that makes enemies drop a healing orb when killed; an item that increases your sprint speed and an item that increases your movement speed, etc. A lot of them just do slightly different things and it just did not give me enough variety personally. Also, you unlock most of the items the same way, just by killing enemies, getting gold, and then paying to unlock a chest. There's a lot of different chests, which is exciting at first until you realize they all largely contain really crappy items and the only differences are what category the item falls under based on the chest color (i.e., green = healing items, red = damage, purple = utility). There are some noticeable exceptions, but I see them so infrequently that it really feels like they're not even in the game at times and most of the time I'm running around with the same handful of items.

Anyhow, I could go on, but this is already the length of a novella and I think I've made my point. I did truly have a blast with the game at first and I still play it occasionally in short spurts, but I just don't see myself playing this for dozens to hundreds of hours like I did with Vampire Survivors, Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Hades, etc. There's just not enough to keep me engaged and hold my attention. 

tl;dr - not enough variety. same handful of maps, lots of same-y items, same basic gameplay loop. characters a strong point, but some are OP and some are laughably bad. most stuff has weirdly specific unlock conditions I would have never discovered w/o looking up."

2670,yes
2671,"Fun as a single player but even more fun with friends. ""WHERE'S THE TELEPORTER!?"""

2673,good
2674,"""Sorry boss, the forecast is saying there's a high risk of rain.""

*air strikes a lesser imp*"
2675,fuck you victor this games is a master piece
2676,"Really good game. Each map is different and unique, the characters are all good (some broken and fun) and have their own special playstyles/abilities, the lore in this game is an inescapable rabbit hole, the game is not as high end as you might expect, especially if you lower your resolution on fullscreen (in case if you're experiencing FPS lag), and it's generally a good game that plays super well.

There's also no need to hesitate buying it if you can't play with other people, the singleplayer is also extremely fun and is super addicting. 

In conclusion, *buy this game*"
2677,"not much rain 

"
2678,"Game good. Shooty get looty. After putting hundreds of hours into the semi-trashy xbox port, I can say for certain that this game is fantastic. Even the port was great. Well worth the price and your time."
2679,haha neurotransmitters go brrrr
2680,bungus
2681,I can't believe how good this game is.
2682,"One of the best roguelike in the market, atmosphere, characters and items are all fun to explore/play with and as.
It has a ton of content and you can play with friends! That's the best part, ruining relationships because you took someone else's chest >>>>>
I'm not even mentioning mods but that's another ton of content if you feel like the game doesn't have enough!
For what it costs, it's just a blast, solo or with friends! Might be difficult at the beggining but you'll get through it and discover a beautiful gem!

Also the dlc is really fun and adds some new characters and mechanics that are so well crafted!"
2683,"Why the rain coat isn't the most OP item in the game?
Look at the game title.

2689,"Great game, however, the multiplayer option is kinda weird, if a user is the server host, I can't do anything or its vary delayed, now if I host, same thing happens to other users."
2690,"This game is literal bullet hell with shit ton of entities specificly designed to push my cpu to its upmost limit and even liquid cooling can't do shit about it.
Would still recommend it though you can morb with void fiend 10/10 game."
2691,"its a great game with smooth controls, fun battles, and it makes you feel like a baddass when playing it. definitely recommend playing you will have a blast especially when playing with friends.
but i have 1 problem and that after losing a run that you spend 10-30 or more minutes trying to do 1 thing it feels like you have just wasted a lot of time and don't get any kind of reward for playing.
the only thing you can get from a failed run is lunar coins which are rare anyways."
2692,"I should be mad when I die in this game. I normally hate rogue-likes. Risk of Rain 2 however, doesn't make me mad when I die, and I don't hate this game. Every time I fail a run, I always hop back in almost straight away. Then I die once more, and start a new run. Once the cycle begins, it consumes you until you finally drop the game. Whilst I have yet to complete Risk of Rain 2, I'm working towards that goal, whether it takes me 10 hours, or 500 hours. 4/5 good game."

2708,"Both this game and its predecessor are great, and if you get tired of the gameplay loop eventually there are plenty of mod options to switch it up a bit - there's even a mod to play with more than 4 players if you have a large group. Highly recommend, big entertain"
2709,"Played the first, didn't think a 3D version would work, but they knocked it out of the park. 10/10 would recommend."
2710,its cool ig
2711,One of the greatest examples of a game in this genre. Love it.
2712,"There is a risk of getting rained on, Get it?"
2713,"(I own this on Playstation also) Must have friend, or else the game is very boring. Playing solo is a lot of running around, very slowly looking for things to open. I feel with a party it would be much easier to scour the map for treasure. Otherwise, I like the game. The shooting, control (minus move speed in the beginning), and leveling up aspects are great. It gets a little confusing trying to figure out what each icon means, and they don't give you any indication in the game until after you choose an item. The story is very weird, I have no idea what is going on, why the aesthetic or character designs. But that never matters anyway. It is frustrating getting one-shotted out of where late in the game. Never feels great when that happens after over an hour in one session. I also wish there was more progression of the characters, other than the unlock via achievement. I don't even know what some of achievements mean, and there are so few. 
Anyway, the game is worth full price if you have a group of people you play with and you like rogue likes."
2714,"good

2725,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God is a movie that ends with Klaus Kinski, noted monster both in movie and in real life, strutting around on a hopelessly lost and sinking raft, surrounded by monkeys and dead bodies. Through his own deliberate actions he is both unfathomably powerful in his own mind and a completely powerless husk of humanity by any other measure. Risk of Rain 2 is also like this but without having to look at Klaus Kinski and with co-op."

2727,Phenomenal game to explore over and over again. No 2 runs are the same.

2730,"this is one of the most fun multiplayer games ive played, everything is pretty much perfect"
2731,"Very fun game. You need to invest time into learning the items and what they do, but after that you can really enjoy every survivor!"
2732,"The game is very enjoyable but the maps, bosses, monsters, and playable characters feel repetitive after a certain while. I think a larger variety of enemies, items, characters, maps, and etc would really add onto an all ready very enjoyable game"
2733,Mitchiipoo Approved
2734,"This game is worth your time, you should buy it."
2735,"Got this gift from a friend. I totally judged the cover of this book, big time. Not even four minutes into my classic run, I was already excited and quickly realized that this was going to be my new favorite game! So grateful that I have been introduced to this game, I can't stop playing it now. My favorite aspect of the game is that I can play with full controller support, I've been wanting to play more games on controller and this is one of the easiest games to play. I love the fact that the default controller binds for this game is as simple as can be. I also enjoy the general gist of the game (as I love waveshooters/lootshooters), I'm sure it is obvious that I am outright addicted. Playing with my friends involve different ways that others play through the modes and I genuinely have fun with however the game is played! So wish I found out about this game earlier <3"

2743,"Good rougelike, select from a handful of characters/classes and drop into an alien landscape where you gain 'credits' by killing mobs which are used to unlock random (and some non-random) loot boxes to equip yourself with buffs, all the while the difficulty level steadily increases as time goes by. Simple but colorful and appealing graphics, runs beautifully on the Steam Deck. If you're a fan of roguelikes there is a lot to appreciate here.

The 1 criticism I have is there seems to be no permanent progression to speak of. In other roguelikes such as Synthetik or Let It Die you'll gain some sort of character or weapon EXP each run, at least a little progression for each run. Nothing like that here, you essentially 'git gud' by learning level layouts, buff abilities, what to expect from bosses, etc. Some may like this sort of system, I'd sort of like to be able to pick out my favorite 'class' and really chalk up a bunch of EXP for them, or see my favorite buffs get EXP. Minor complaint, the game is a great experience regardless."
2744,"This game is absolutely fucking dopamine inducing. With every fibre of my being, this shit is the absolute god of a roguelike, standing next to Isaac, Spelunky, and many more. It is inconceivable to how good this is."
2745,"Infinitely replayable. I have 32 hours at the time of writing this review and I feel like I've barely begun to explore the content of this game. Highly recommend, possibly the best roguelike I've ever played."

Then there's this game, where you can kill god, harness his power, and steal the strength and immortality of every other divine entity to absolutely decimate anything that crosses your path.

10/10 would rage at dying every time to get that one perfect run again."

My mom took 15 hours to find the Physical copy of the game on Amazon. I tried playing it but the only thing that appeared on my screen was Ludacious femoids Engaging in Provocative activities, My grandma was looking at the screen when i first booted the game up and after seeing the HARAM scenes happening on the screen she threw me over the fence and beat me like a 2nd hand carpet but jokes on her there are fibers in the stick she used and fibers are good for your health so now i grew to a size incomprehensible to the human brain. Im actually just straight up inpercievable to normal humans and i can snuff your existence off of the planet with no recourse. GG WP"

2805,Playing this game is like entering a time machine you think you are playing what seems to be 5 or 10 minutes only to look at the timer and realize that you have been playing for hours really fun to play with friends
2806,"The game has been going downhill lately when I bought it, it was a glorious 96% positive now it's a pitiful 94% positive. Truly unplayable 0/10."

2810,"this game is great to get to be fair it is so relaxing to play I know I know you wouldn't think an epic rogue like intense game would be ""relaxing"" but, it is! I love this game and finding out little secrets hidden here and there throughout the game you thought you completed is an amazing feeling. Creating different builds with different characters is awesome too! I give this game an amazing rating and this is a must if your into roguelikes"
2811,This game is something else that you need to play to understand. 10/10
2812,I've had a lot of fun with this game is solo play.  The reason I wont be playing anymore is because when I play with more than one person the rate of enemy spawns are absolutely horrendous. This includes when their spawns are doubled. I find myself more often than not running through a completely empty map or maybe with a few enemies.  Very monotonous and quite time consuming. If this were fixed I would have no other major concerns.
2813,Super fun game to play alone or with friends. Combining and stacking items on each character is very satisfying and things get very crazy. There is so much replay value as well so it's definitely worth every penny.
2814,"Honestly the game is super fun and challenging, really fun when you play with friends!"
2815,This game deserves double thumbs ups
2816,"418 hours of playtime, at least more than 100 hours of hunting achievements that fried my patience and will to live and trying to improve and more than 300 hours just having a fun time with mods, and yet after all of that I'm yet to legitimately beat any survivors above Eclipse 4 and will never recover from Mercenary: Ethereal. But enough of personal experiences.

Risk of Rain 2 is a highly replayable FPS Roguelike with hundreds of achievements, hundreds of items, different ways to modify your runs that make it either challenging or a casual stroll in Satan's neighborhood, tons of characters with unique gimmicks, a well written story, and tons of Bosses and Monsters that can either be difficult, challenging, average, or straight up bullshit that you whine upon their presence. 
This game doesn't aim for a balance, though that doesn't say it makes it lack fun, in fact it's the opposite; it's imbalanced that you either have a run where RNG mocks you and makes you deal no damage for the entire run, a completely average run that never happens unless you're a streamer, and a run where you're either a god or your PC just crashes upon entering the teleporter. Deaths can feel so punishing and sometimes straight up broken, on the other side of the coin, Wins can also feel really fulfilling but sometimes borderline unfair.

Lost your mind after being humiliated dying to a Lunar Chimera instead of the final boss at the top? Fret not, with the help of Artifacts, you can modify your runs to a different gamemode, now instead of being harassed by pillars you can shamefully die inside as you run the perfect setup only to die by a Malachite Brass Contraption that you didn't pay attention to because there were too many Lemurians strafing around you, very enjoyable experience indeed.

I'd say take a break if you're stressed but due to the sheer amount of fun I had with mods I used to play 12 hours a day so I'd just be a hypocrite by saying that. 
Now I'll introduce you to what kept me from getting burnt out from this game (Note: It didn't stop me from getting burnt out by consistently waiting for 3 days to get a decent Prismatic Trials seed for that Mercenary achievement) and it is a popular concept called [b] Modding [/b]. Just install R2modman, link it to RoR2, install some mods, and you're good to go, unless you have a PC like mine which takes 20 minutes to load the game everytime I play with mods. As of this review there are currently more than 2,000 mods in Risk of Rain 2 [strike] half of it are probably deprecated but that's besides the point [/strike] and that's just wild, majority of mods include but are not limited to: More artifacts, run modifiers, new characters, new enemies, more skins, more items, a complete game rebalance, UI changes, [strike] huntress ass [/strike] and text mods that no one cares about.

This game is not only worth your time, it also actively eats your time, my verdict is that Risk of Rain 2 is truly one of the games of all time."
2817,"It's replayability, 2404 hours should speak for itself :)

Highly encourage anyone who finds them self getting sucked into this game to check out the eclipse difficulties under 'alternate game modes' in the main menu. 


"
2818,"A brilliant action Roguelike with an absolutely insane amount of content. This game manages to take the 2D gameplay of Risk of Rain 1 and almost perfectly transfer it in to 3D.

Music: chris christodoulu did an amazing job with the music you should check it out on your own time if you have not yet. 2. the diverse gameplay options- you want easy? go easy and play any playstyle you want on easy and it will be its own version of a challenge. wanna go hard? impossible even? feel free this game has numerous ways of making you regret life in this game. and 3. options. ive played a lot of rouguelites and honestly there are very few that come to mind as great at gameplay and item customization in fact there are item combo's out there that i wondered , ""will this even work??"" and 9 times out of 10 id say YES OMG YES its like a combo of WTF am i doing and omg I LOVE THIS. and hoenstly its a hell of a ride"

If you have the cash buy it."

I had gotten into this game by someone telling me about it, playing it on my low tech laptop and low graphics on it and i had fun. Later I got back into it because of the new DLC SotV. Game got 10x more fun. Either way the game is fun and people should play this game in anyway. There are mods you can get, there are things ingame that can make the game easier or harder. YOU CAN PLAY WITH FRIENDS EVEN. And there is more to come in the future for this game. 

I recommend this game."

2861,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game recently to try out since it was cheap, so he installed it on his computer and he started playing. A few days in and he already has 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. For my first time playing, I picked Commando and was mercilessly demolished by my own son. I asked my Son for help and he took me through some basic tips and tricks. Its been a struggle to learn, but I am finally getting to the point that I can play with my son. I loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories, especially."

2877,"..and so they left, more steel circuit than man, with terrible power in shaking hands;
their humanity and soul still remaining on the planet.
Their hearts still racing, ready to grow into something more, delusions of freedom
filling their head.
They were ready to recharge with a new tale to tell and a new passion: to explore.
Finally, ready to take their shot.

2887,"This game is basically like smoking (except it's not that bad for your health). It feels weird and flat at first because it doesn't tell you anything and you've begun playing because a friend told you it was cool and then at some point you've played for 30 hours and you just want to play 30 more. 
Stopping the comparison here, I love how this game teaches you many things about itself without actually saying it, it's a die and retry and understanding process that feels like dialoguing with the machine which feels very enriching."

2900,"this game is amazing, great game to play with the group. also the mod support is great"
2901,Good game.
2902,"This is not usually my kind of game, but something about it just works. It's just a lot of fun to get good at and it's not so complicated that I can't get my head around all the mechanics. Easy to pick up but with enough depth to keep things interesting. My absolute favorite game to play with friends."
2903,"I want to begin this review by saying I am not a deep enjoyer of this game, however, I do believe that many people could and would enjoy it. The 4 hours I have in this game are definitely not ones I regret, but I just lacked connection to the game. This might be due to a lack of story or maybe I just simply don't enjoy shooting npcs. Overall, I'd still recommend it to anyone, definitely worth a try!"
2904,fun
2905,i like cock
2906,That's not what ATG stands for
2907,"I feel like I'm missing something with this game. There is not one thing in this game that makes me want to play it for longer than half an hour. Sure, this is a fine game but I feel like the gameplay is just the same thing that I experienced from the last run that I played. 

But with all of these positive reviews of this game, I feel like I might be giving this game a rough time, so I'll probably keep playing the game to see if my opinion on it changes. But for now, This game is fine. There are little to no bugs, I can tell that the devs put a TON of work into this. But this game is not for everyone. Even if I'm the only person who doesn't thoroughly enjoy the game. 

Edit: I think I have finally cracked the code on why I don't 100% enjoy this game. I don't feel like this is my kind of ""Cooperative game."" I always feel that when I am playing this game with my friends, It's not usually about the team, it's about the individual players. I also don't generally like games that are based on some sort of luck. I like a uniform game where I can control it, but maybe that's the thrill of this game. Also, I feel like I am the third wheel when I am playing this game. It always seems that I never do enough damage, I can't kill bosses quick enough, but when I see my friends play the game, ON STAGE 4 OR 5 THEY KILL THE BOSS WITHIN 10 SECONDS. LIKE HOW????!?! I can see why this game is so appealing to some audiences, but the randomness and just my utter inability to understand what I am doing wrong makes it impossible for me to enjoy. 

This is a 100% biased review and this should not be used as a tipping point on whether or not you should purchase the game. I say try it out (with friends), and if you don't like it, refund it."
2908,add sex
2909,Risk of Rain 2 is a good game
2910,"Not a game I envisioned liking when it was first taking off with people, but becomes very addicting fast. It encourages going as fast as possible, picking up items, which provide most of your character's power. In singleplayer you just take what you can, in multiplayer you coordinate a bit to help build to each character's strengths and weaknesses. Picking up multiple copies of items amplifies the effect, such as picking up two medkits doubles the healing received when they activate. Almost all items are passive and apply view your normal movement and damaging abilities, letting you focus on staying alive. A little ways into a run you will usually have enough items to begin doing crazy damage to keep up with the progressive scaling, to the point of sometimes just clicking once to attack might clear the screen of enemies from dozens of effects stacking, but you can never fully let your guard down as you typically die in 2-5 hits or so even with a lot of defense. fun both solo and with friends, and glues you to the screen. Even the starter 2 characters are good fun once you figure out what their strengths are. The game also doesn't punish you for using the provided unlockable game modifiers or playing on lower difficulty, letting you unlock challenges with modifiers or lower difficulty to help you unlock things."

*Hits Spinel Tonic*

Is playing without the Command artifact the ultimate form of cuckoldry?

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than playing without Command.

Think about it rationally. You are shooting, running, jumping for like 60 minutes solely so you can get a Squid Polyp. All that hard work you put into your run - dodging Stone Golem lasers, getting annoyed by six thousand Lesser wisps spawning above your head, activating Shrines of the Mountain all for one simple result: Your inventory is filled up with warbanners and Monster Tooth necklaces which cost money.

On a god run?

Great. A bunch of garbage items which add nothing to your run end up coming out of the Chests you buy. They get the benefit of your hard earned dosh that came from killing Lemurians.

As a man who plays this game you are LITERALLY dedicating two hours of your life to opening boxes and praying it's not another Chronobauble. It's the ultimate and final cuck. Think about it logically.

2926,"Easily the best game I've ever found through being recommended to me. Insanely fun characters and deep lore that you have to earn by collecting items. I started playing for the first time about 2 months ago and I've dumped more than 100 hours into this game, and I haven't even looked at the mods yet."
2927,"This a good game, gah dam"
2928,very cool if you have friend to play with
2929,Cool game
2930,Great game. One of the best things about it is how many times you can play it without geting bored.
2931,"Risk of Rain 2 is probably one of the most fun, challenging, and rewarding games I have ever played. I have played it across several different platforms including the Switch, PS4, and PC. In fact this addiction has left to me losing control of my life, I am now homeless and can only play it in public libraries. Anyways 11/10 would recommend."

2941,yeah this is fun
2942,Absolutely Spectacular Game
2943,An amazing Rogue-like with lots of replayabilty and build variety.
2944,"I get it that this is a survival game.
The beginning is super easy and interesting, but the boss fights are ridiculous.
Im constantly dying on one-shot hits, which doesnt seems reasonable to me.
I expected to have a longer 'life experience' in the game, but seeing all my perks and items going to waste because of those ridiculous boss fights, and having to start all over again, its painful and not enjoyable to me.
It it only could have some hard stats like strength, dexterity, life, etc which you could raise and get stronger over time and dont have it hard reset after dying, it would be much more fun.
But this is not an rpg. Sadly."
2945,Bungis
2946,"poor design decisions plague this game, this game has horrible enemy and ability design. fun to play with friends but even then your patience will be tested, and a lack of build diversity to win is pathetic at best. The final boss stage is tedious and worse than it was originally shockingly."
2947,"issa good game
"
2948,Good for mindless mess around time. Can be a bit frustrating. Better with friends.
2949, omg they made rain irl !!11!1!
2950,"Game is fine when you can get it to work. 
Tried to play it with multiplayer with my son and the lobbies are not functioning and you cannot join any friends. 

This fame feels like its still in Alpha, I would not recommend if you wish to play a shared multiplayer / co-op experience."

2954,Its fun
2955,I love this game
2956,"This is one amazing FPS game.

The graphics are brilliant. The controls are good. The boss designs and behaviors are some of the best i have ever seen in a game.

I recommend this game, but just know it can get very hard early in the game and is a really fast paced game. Also you only have 1 life which makes it way harder as you get stormed by enemies. Some players like this style (I do), while some don't."
2957,"Friend sacrificed his health for a chest, I stole it, and he died within less than a minute. Pizza, if you're reading this, fuck you.
9/10

2958,it took me this long to get all the items
2959,"shooty boom boom pow pow.

more eloquently put: this game is a freakin' masterpiece."
2960,GOAT
2961,"This is a very interesting game that I'm growing to love more each time I play it. It is simultaneously a soul wrenching experience, and the most rewarding. As of today I have done my first solo monsoon run as bandit and got the B&E challenge despite having artifact of swarm on (which doubles enemies including bosses.) 
 Needless to say I do recommend you have some friends join you because even though this game is quite fun solo its even better watching all you friends take your loot :)"
2962,this shit goes hard
2963,"Good game, I give it a 80/100"
2964,"This rouge like Dragonball Z game is very good, reminds me of DBZ Kakarot. Goku's ability's are really good and the duel mode with Vegita is crazy. If you like Dragonball Z then you will love this brand new Dragonball Z game!!"
2965,made me gup my pants
2966,"One of the most fun roguelites/likes (idk) on the market. Can't recomend it enough, the characters are fun, art is cool, and music is nice."
2967,WHERE THE FUCK IS THE PORTAL
2968,"Fun to play alone or with a group of friends, would recommend"
2969,You will hate this game the moment you see elite elder lemurians.

2991,it gud
2992,yea
2993,"As a huge fan of the original 2D side-scroller, needless to say I was concerned when I learned(what I felt) were creating an almost entirely different game utilizing a notoriously buggy engine many years ago. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this game delivered and managed to surpass my enjoyment of the first game! Although the game does have its fair share of bugs;I can only assume comes from the cross-play feature as that is the only time I had technical difficulties with this game. Overall it feels very polished in fact. This is an absolutely fantastic sequel and I look forward to future content releases."
2994,10/10
2995,Fun to play coop.
2996,"Personally I don't know what to say about this game that hasn't been said before. The gameplay loop is addicting, gup is amazing, the characters are unique, the fearless scaling adds so much potential. This game is just incredible, just buy it already"

2999,after all these years there is still a problem of teleporter spawning in places that you just can't find. i don't recomend playing this game unless you want to spend 30min looking for a teleported and not finding anything. just att a game mode already for people who want to enjoy the game and place the teleporter in the middle.

3078,I LOVE RISK OF RAIN 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3079,"im knew to rogue-like games, and this really gave me a perfect impression on them. good to play with friends or alone if you dont have friends. easy to play, and easy to get the hang of. i recomend alot

huntress literally so hot like what"
3080,good
3081,I like going brrrrr.

3083,This is the best video game in 20 years
3084,"Tons of time can be spent on this game, i've had it for a while now totally recommend if you're looking to waste a couple hours for $25"
3085,"be like me

""beat mithrix without breaking a sweat""
""floating blue orbs spawn and text that says moon destruction imminent""
""panic and try to jump off the tower but realise blue walls are not letting you do that""
""after wasting 2 minutes and 20 something seconds pause the game and google what to do""
""realise blue orbs were portals and i am now fucked cause i don't have enough time for the ship to reach 100%""
""after that reach mithrix again but always die cause he is somehow harder than he was before""

seriously what is going on how am i even more garbage than last time"

3088,"Never played the first one. My friends just wanted to try it together. It's a good game. Performance is phenomenal for everything going on. Had a blast playing it with 3 friends, but it's not one of those games where you need them around to spin up a game. I think we unlocked almost everything just to have another reason to run through the game again. There are different routes you can take, tons of secrets and little gimmicks to learn. The randomized item combos make for interesting builds and force you to change your play style. Each character does this as well. I didn't necessarily care for the music at first, but it grew on me, which shows me just how well done it is. The expansion is probably also worth it. My only issue with the game are the quirky physics when you become too powerful, one step forward and you fly out of the map. So, if you want to scale up to endlessness, it becomes a very odd and uncontrollable experience. Even when you remove all your speed/jumping gear, your base stats can get so high that they do the same thing to your character. But only for speed & liftoff... DPS no longer matters, Health no longer matters, it's just who can one-shot who first. That's my only complaint and I get it, it's a hard thing to get the scaling right over that much time, without making a game gimmicky in one way or another. Other than that, what else can I say? I'm waiting for RoR3 I guess :)"
3089,Lot's of fun. Highly recommend! 10/10
3090,Love it

3098,"Even though my hands turn into the shit while playing this game, i still come back regularly just to hear The Rain Formerly Known As Purple."
3099,yes
3100,"This is a game about economics.

On the surface this seems like any other roguelite, mechanics wise, think ridiculous item combos like in Binding of Isaac. As you progress, just like in BoI, you permanently unlock more items that can spawn in the game but the starting selection is limited enough that after a few hours you have learned how most of them behave and the additional unlocked items feels like a trickle of useful tools that gets added to your arsenal the longer you play. You also pick from a range of unlockable characters that play [i]very[/i] differently, making the variety in builds always feeling fresh.

The major thing RoR (1 and 2) does different is [i]the clock[/i]. As the timer goes up, so does the difficulty, so you have to find the balance between staying in the level to get all the equipment and moving on to the next one. I generally don't like being on the clock, but in this game it works really well. It's what fuels all the strategies, how you choose to clear the level and encourages risk-y approaches. It's not as stressful as it might seem but rather it makes you aware of the painful seconds you lose with detours and gives you the choice between meeting easier enemies with less gear or more elites and more gear, this is something you need to decide based on the items you've gotten that far in the run.

I loved the original (in 2D pixel art style). and was surprised how well the formula translated to 3D, making it easily one of the top 3 roguelites of all time, in my opinion. Just like the original, this is a timeless design and I'm sure people 10 years from now will find it just as engaging and exhillerating as I do now."

3102,It's a great game where you can have a broken build and still die
3103,"Risk of Rain 2 is like a siren’s song. It lures you in with interesting characters, flashy combat, and a vague yet intriguing story about a planet covered in crashed spaceships. Then you look at the top right corner of the screen, see that you’ve been playing your current run for over 65 minutes, and realize you’ve completely torpedo’d your productivity for the day.

It is absolutely incredible just how hypnotic this game can be. Everything about it feels so “immediate,” like the developers have injected instant gratification into every aspect of its gameplay. Enemies dramatically explode or flip over when you kill them, loot chests have a punchy *THUD* sound when you open them, activating the teleporter for the next stage feels like you’ve just hit the launch button on a nuclear missile. The constant feedback of your actions make Risk of Rain 2 feel amazing to play, and the music just elevates this experience to godlike levels.

If you’re going to get this game, there are a few things you should know. First off, the game was designed around co-op, but (in my humble opinion) it doesn’t do a great job of balancing for that fact. Gold and XP from kills is shared, but items are not, and items are what truly give your character power. On every map, there are a limited number of loot chests containing random items that can potentially provide huge boosts to your character. However, once a chest is opened, nobody else can use it again. This often leads to massive power imbalances in which one or two players amass a huge inventory of items, leaving the rest of the team firing peashooters in later levels.

Another (potentially controversial) issue I have with the game is the fact that once you die in co-op, you need to wait until the end of the level to revive. I understand the thought behind this, as the whole point of Risk of Rain 2 is that you will eventually lose, but this just creates even larger power gaps between players as the game goes on. You cannot pick up items while dead (obviously), and items cannot be dropped either, making this a snowball effect that just ends up feeling bad. Especially when those more powerful players continue to steamroll everything in sight, dragging the rest of you along for the ride.

Overall though, Risk of Rain 2 is a remarkably well-crafted experience. It offers a huge amount of replayability, combined with an unorthodox progression system and lots of little secrets that make the whole world feel very unexplored. If you’re a fan of roguelikes, co-op games, or experiences that will suck away all of your free time, Risk of Rain 2 is an excellent choice."

3148,"Today I have a story to speak about. A man named Parker and his pet Trout. Walking down the creek was his favourite route. Parker loved his trout, without a doubt. But one day, an escape was committed by the trout. He was out. At least, he felt of joy, but who was still looking for him? Parker, the little boy. But there was worse out there, said the koi. You might be cooked, and eaten with soy. This frightened little Parker, but he had marked his trout with a marker. One day, Parker was at the pond, where he found his trout. Parker thought he was gone, but the trout was still around. It was a rainbow trout, a pretty one, I must say. One day, I wish to eat it with glaze. I hoped and prayed the fish would escape again, and would meet his glazey end. Turned out, that's what happened! One day they were walking along the pacific ocean with the trout in his bag, so the salt water doesn't hurt his little gills. Yes, later on they live most of their life in the ocean, but the trout was not quite yet to begin this motion. I saw the boy and his little trout, and I took it from him, and ran all about. He was put on the grill later that day, a fine tasting fish, eh? I said to Parker, as he cried for his fish. So I gave him a little plate of my dish. He agreed, the trout tastes good. They became trout hunters and used bows and arrows made out of string and wood. They would do this forever, if they could. They would bring it home, and enjoy the meal. This cooking man was the real deal. He looks older than me, over 35 ""How old are you my guy"" Parker asks, and was given an answer that give him a surprise. ""I'm 54."" The man said, just then, there was a knock on the door. The man threw acid at the chefs face! What a disgrace! The cook managed to survive, and would continue to be alive. The cook died roughly 25 years after the acid incident. Oh, how Parker had grown! He found another boy with a trout, all alone. He took it and cooked it, and carried on the legacy. As the smells filled the house, Parker played a nice melody. He told the boy the stories of the chef, until he died too. But the boy kept it going. He found a boy with a pet trout once more, I know you've heard this all before. But at the end of the day, Parker carried a legacy soon to come your way. Look out for a man suspiciously holding a bag and tape to keep their mouth shut until they can eat. If you see this man, run, and call the police."

100% would recommend to others"
3157,"Risk of rain 2 is a roguelike that takes a completely different approach from it's predecessor.
it being a roguelike, you die, a lot. that's no exception here.

Every character in this game feels like butter, they all control smoothly in their own different ways, from huntress teleporting all around the stage, pecking at monsters until they die, acrid ground pounding down a mountain to crunch the beetles at the bottom, with the amount of things tightly packed into this game, like the amount of different upgrades, the lore, the character designs, there is a lot to love about ror2.

I would recommend this game plus the [url=https://thunderstore.io/package/Wonda/Refightilization/]'Refightilization' mod by Wonda.[/url] It allows you to respawn after death as a monster, being able to help or sabotage your fellow players to respawn as the character you died as, it's a hoot having to deal with your friend who was turned into a giant glob of orange slime as he shoots shurikens at you."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 17 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to use a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3192,"The most interesting Roguelike Game ever in my opinion. (I HATE Hades and Binding of Isaac and always thought that this genre sucks tbh). 

Its basically a third person shooter (except Railgunner OP) on Steroids.

Lots of Secrets to discover, for example Artifacts (which are always optional) which alter your playing experience BIG time, you can even take out the randomness and decide which iteams to get.

Even the Lore has some great depth.

Unlimited Framerate, runs absolutely fine on a GTX 1060 6GB with no frame drops, even 1 hour into the run (when it gets... well, HECTIC to say the least).

Very hard at first, but the more you play the better you and the game get.

It's also the kind of game where you should have a friend or more to play with. Solo play is certainly possible, but I feel like replay ability in that aspect is low. Co-op will make the game a lot more fun and last longer.

3253,"One of my favorite games to play with friends.

I was wary of a 3D follow-up to a great indie original, especially after SPAZ2. Hopoo did good though. They stayed true to the overall feel: art, music, sound, movement, even some of the more homely aspects. But ROR2 goes beyond a mere 3D version of the original. There's a lot of new content in addition to the re-imagined classic content.

This game requires a lot of skill and memorization to get good. Also, you can read about how items scale, but it helps to know some math. Personally, I love it."

3262,"This is the only review I've ever left for a video game, so I'm going to keep it short: RoR2 is gaming distilled into its most perfect essence. The art, sound design, animations, music, and gameplay, are all so incredibly tuned to be a delight for every sense that I still get chills when fighting secret and final bosses. Online Co-op is the closest to classic sleepover couch co-op of any game I've played. The game modes are endless, the runs are always interesting, and nothing can ever replace the joy of my computer grinding to a halt as it tries to display and give sound effects to ten thousand purple shrimp missiles launching twenty times per second as the bullets of my dual pistols find their way lovingly into the floating giant jellyfish before me."

===[Overall]===

This game, should be among one of the top games for its release date. The combination of multiple mechanics and the looting system alone are very fleshed out. The characters are all detailed and have multiple areas in which you can grow them. I have no complaints for this game, except that I would love to see more dlc's and more characters being released a little more frequently. The replayability of this game is the highest of any game i've ever seen, on par with minecraft or terraria. This game, is worth it full price, and should have the price heightened because of how good this game is.

Overall score: 9.7/10"
3268,thumbs up

I even pulled my girlfriend into PC gaming over this game.

100% a great experience more than worth the money.

3303,Very great game and so much fun to play with friends!
3304,"Tremendous Mindless Fun.
ive never played risk of rain 1 but i can forsure say that ROR is a definite game to get if you've searching for something new to play. New stages, constantly increasing difficulty, loot drops ,etc."
3305,hehe funny lizard shoots hydrochloric acid
3306,"It's not the best single-player game for sure, but it's an INSANELY good time with friends, worthy of multiple replays."
3307,"This game is literally my favorite game of all time. I did not play much of the original game, however, I can say without a doubt that this is the game that I continue to come back to. I enjoyed learning what all the items do and what they all synergize with and the SOTV DLC just adds to that. And for those who enjoy a challenge, grinding out Eclipse is fantastic as well."
3308,"This game is way too unfair.
I beat the first one a lot of times, but this one is just some kind of joke. Spent 4 hours on a single run and got one-shoted on the final boss at the first seconds on the fight. That's not how it supposed to work."

Good lord o_0 when will it end?"
3321,Hopoo Games are some badass devs. Just a straight-up fun indie game that shits on the titles most money-obsessed triple A publishers are putting out nowadays. Buying this game shows support for people who actually care about making good videogames. The DLC is great too.
3322,This game is a master class at setting expectations and then breaking them in completely absurd ways. Even hundreds of hours in I still occasionally find combinations that blow my mind.

3354,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3363,"This game is possibly one of the best I have found in a long time. This game has incredible replayability, combat mechanics, and overall can stay interesting since you have different modifiers, items, endings, and so many more different things to be offered. Not to mention the DLC pack they have for purchase that grants you another entire ending with dozens of new items, and creatures to kill. I seriously recommend this game to anyone who may be interested and I hope the developers continue their amazing work. Thank you for this amazing game."

3373,there is no rain game clickbai
3374,Last update has been a HUGE improvement to the game. I can't stop playing it since. 10/10 masterpiece.
3375,The loot pools cause there to be a variety of builds for one to explore and enjoy a new game.
3376,very good game :)
3377,"As my first roguelike game, Risk of Rain 2 has set a very good precedent for what procedurally-generated mayhem can cause. With a super simple story buried under cryptic lore, the meat of the game lies in its easily repayable gameplay formula. Each session can be beaten in roughly an hour, but replaying with different characters and modifiers ensures that you'll come back for more.

This is my go-to desktop distraction when chilling in Discord calls. It's entertain, challenging, and endlessly repayable. Certainly one of my favorite time-wasters in my library."
3378,I had maybe 200 + hours on console and now I am back loving it again. I just hope to see some returning RoR 1 Boys. Love it and will always say jam to this game.

3380,"love this game, really fun with friends"
3381,"I've played quite a bit at this point and definitely gotten my money's worth. Absolutely fantastic game that allows you to sink hours away while trying to make it as far as you can. So many different types of survivors to play, each with their own unique styles of play, that can each be twisted by the items that are available in the game for some pretty hilarious spectacles. If you make it far enough, you're computer may cry from the mayhem."

3429,"First game I've bothered getting all achievements for and honestly one of the few I'd argue to be worth the effort. After over 250 hours in this game I still find it fun to boot up and try new builds out, and with tons of hidden lore, items, and areas it's definitely one that can keep you entertained for hours."
3430,Don't forget to bring your umbrella
3431,so addicting lol
3432,"Great game, another one I have bought twice over PC and console, really replayable as any good rogue-like should be, with lots of challenges and stuff to unlock, to keep it from getting too stale"

3434,
3435,"very chill and nonchalant

3436,"Great game, worth every single cent. Replayability is awesome, gameplay feels good, always something to learn, multiple characters combined with many items are making every single run unique and different, and not even talking about the different stages, achievements or awesome and definitely worth-buying DLC. Awesome solo, even better with friends!"
3437,"After going through 2 runs of the game, and already beating it, I have made the realization that this game is pretty boring. The replay-ability is not there, and it became boring shortly after starting the 2nd run. It's really boring and not worth it."

Even after beating the game countless times, i cant help but come back to play another run with my friends or by myself. The entire vibe of this game has me entirely immersed in the games lore. Well worth the price, best rogue like out there."
3475,I like huntress' thighs
3476,"This roguelike is extremely fun, and is one of the most unique in the whole genre. Hopoo games have done a great job making additions to the game and expanding upon it, which makes the game well worth the small price it has. I have just finished beating eclipse 8, which is a scaling difficulty mode similar to the boss cell system in dead cells, which keeps the game interesting for people looking for more challenge in their runs. Overall this game is fantastic, and one of the best roguelikes on the market, well worth $25."

""The game he's playing looks kinda fun"" I thought to myself unaware of the rabbit hole I was getting myself into. I bought that game that day. I never knew that it would become one of my favorite games. I don't know what grabbed me first! The music? The characters abilities? All the learning and discovering how to build and play? I'm not an expert, I'm not even what I would call good at the game! I love every second of it. Every death. Every win. Every facepalm moment. I will 100% this game because I adore this game.

3541,"It's a fun game in some ways... the action, graphics etc are all good... but this game has major issues that make it no fun for me, especially with multiplayer.

The game does not encourage team play, so expect even your friends to just do their own thing and not help you or play as a team. Not their fault really, it's the way the game is structured.

My biggest problem is the loot system. Loot opportunities should be instanced, full stop. This is a semi-ARPG, with shades of games like Borderlands, but roguelike. ARPGs have moved to instanced loot for a long time now, because devs of ARPG games learned that it is not fun to play multiplayer and have your team mates jump on everything like lootgoblins and gain momentum, while you get weaker and weaker and miss out on the cool stuff. This takes me back to Diablo 2, players all trying to grab the items after a boss was defeated. It's not a fond memory, and gaming has moved on in the 20 years since then. It's particularly harsh on new players trying to run with more experienced ones.

Personally I hate that the game's mechanics encourage a competitive experience of all rushing around trying to be the first to get to the shrines, loot boxes etc. I end up starting to put in less and less effort, as I watch my team mates all stack up on speed items so they can grab stuff faster. I don't want to always start with all-goat hoof build just to be able to have a chance.

In multiplayer, the game creates a feedback loop that feels bad to me: the faster and more experienced player(s) grab more and more of the share of the loot, then the weaker ones start to die as the difficulty ramps up, and when you die you sit back and watch til the next stage, so you fall progressively further and further behind. Then, of course, you are almost guaranteed to die again on the next stage... and again... until you are just little more than a spectator for most of the run. Pretty much every run with more than 2 people I have played goes this way. A few players try to help, be kind, help the weaker ones to catch up... but the pace of the game means there is little time to be deciding who should take loot anyway. The game rewards pushing and pushing, and it's more efficient to just keep getting more OP as an individual and let the weaker ones fall away and get carried.

Even if you had a generous team mate thinking about your intended build, most of the items are basically good for any build. Only a few are real specialist pieces - obviously melee characters will benefit more from focus crystal, engy from fungus... but let's be honest, when the player who should have the item is on the other side of the map, are you really gonna bother leaving it and tagging? Nope... you grab and scrap later.

I like co-op games where you stick together and your skills synergise, and the party falls or stands on their teamwork. ROR's mechanics encourage everyone to run off in different directions to try and find their own loot, only coming back together for the teleporter event. And of course, as the strong players get stronger this continues to be viable for them... whilst you, the noob, won't be able to keep up even if you try, further increasing the chances of dying alone.

Again, the basic gameplay loop is quite fun, and playing solo or with just one other person who you know isn't going to compete with you for items can be fun, but so far my experience of larger groups in this game leaves me feeling frustrated at the loot system. I should not have to base every build around getting as many speed items as I can as early as possible just so I can be in with a chance of grabbing a few items later.

And this is playing with people I know... I can't imagine how bad it is with trolling randoms.

The game also feels kind of empty, hollow... storyline is almost nonexistent, I know that's kind of the point, but I don't feel any urge to keep playing it personally."
3542,play it.
3543,funnnnn
3544,"BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME"

"
3556,Yes
3557,very nice
3558,Didn't play a lot but had fun
3559,"Heard about this game for a while, never actually looked into it directly. It was always the stray youtube recommendation with a bizarre title like ""Reaching 1 million damage in RoR2"" I had picked up on the fact that it was a roguelike, and I was (and still am) very fond of roguelikes. So there I was, about 4 years after initially hearing about it, bored and scrolling through steam. I picked this game up, and I don't regret it honestly. Lots to take in for first time players, lots of gameplay, honestly just amazing. It's a 3D roguelike shooter with all kinds of diverse characters, to secrets. When you feel you've reached the limit to your entertainment, they also have released the Survivors of the Void DLC which adds more items, more bosses, more enemies, more everything. The game has given me a wonderful time, very good, especially with friends."
3560,"Its everything i wanted and more, dont wait just buy it"
3561,cool game. fun with friends

3581,One of the best rouge likes I have ever played! Its absolute chaos and gets more fun the more you play I am going to play this game way to much.

3590,The rain one shots you
3591,"game good?
"
3592,Play It
3593,very nice game
3594,Gun GOOOOOO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
3595,It is fairly enjoyable.
3596,"The game requires an amount of skills and attention to details that it doesn't have.  The physic is buggy and the screen can easily become unreadable because of how many enemies or effects are popping up (in a game were most enemies can one-shot you, that's not great).  I'm no stranger to difficult games but losing over and over because the game feels unpolished rather than because of a mistake on your part is just not fun."
3597,"An absolute masterpiece of a game. 10/10 would obliterate again.
All achievements took 100 hours of playtime."
3598,Great game. Would play again. Avoid if you have a life.
3599,fast pased action arena clearer game love it
3600,I'm not convinced that there is a risk of rain
3601,"It's great for killing time. Go three hours deep into a run, hardly realize it. Main issues I've had are connection-based. After long enough into a multiplayer run, both I and my friend tend to lag out, no matter which is the host."
3602,"Incredibly steep learning curve. Expect to learn by dying to a lot of obscure mechanics. It is a really fun learning process regardless. 
Overall, there isn't really any other games like this one."
3603,more fun with friends.
3604,really good chance for rain
3605,very nice game then i found out there are mods for this game even better 11/10 a must have for rougelite enjoyer

3626,"Risk of Rain 2 is nearly a perfect game.

Coming from someone who never played the first 2 any meaningful extent, I can't compare it to it's predecessor, but as it is now I love it.

---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

(The game looks really good and stylized, it has its almost breathtaking moments, but it isn't focused as much on direct appearance.)

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

(God damn, so many characters have a unique playstyle and something that makes them fun. The items you pick up can drastically change how you play, like the Shaped Glass, which Doubles Damage yet Halves your health, so playing aggressive is even more risk/reward.)

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

(All the soundtracks to this game are good, and convey the environment perfectly, the only thing stopping it from being Eargasm worthy is that not every track is something *I'd* listen to.)

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

(This game isn't easy, especially on Monsoon difficulty, and it can take time to get used to, and certain things like a boss repeatedly telling you to die doesn't necessarily bode well for being child friendly.)

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

(You can pretty massively change settings, so on Max graphics with no corpse limiters it can be pretty taxing, but if you are fine with turning settings down, it runs just fine.)

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

(The Gameplay can be easy to pick up, but there is a really high skill ceiling. Personalizing your items to suit specific builds, and memorizing item functions means you can get better and better.)

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

(This is an odd category for this game, as runs are isolated, aside from item, skin, and ability unlocks, which stay permanently unlocked for future runs. During runs you grind for items and levels to up your effectiveness.)

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

(You can get logs for Enemies and maps by playing and they key you into the researchers who discovered them, and find out some lore, but it isn't essential at all.)

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond

(You can go as long as you want by looping before the final stage to get stronger, though the enemies will get stronger alongside you.)

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

(I hope everything I've said tells you why it's worth it.)

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

(Some things like trimping by getting too much speed, and getting stuck in one or 2 corners happen, but you can get out of those corners, and they won't get in the way too much.)

---{ ? / 10 }---
☐ 1
☐ 2
☐ 3
☐ 4
☐ 5

☐ 7

Overall this is a great game, and has few flaws. This has a ton of replayability, and I totally recommend getting this!

It's fun and there are many different characters with not much showing that one is worse than another, it depends on your play style. Difficult game, very fun with others but still pretty fun alone."

3649,"An awesome run and gun game.
The speed and difficulty increase every second.
With good reaction times and precision, you'll reach your limit after a while.
Also very nice as a game with friends."
3650,"Was a skeptic on this, friend and I got for each other on a whim during a sale. I had always heard good things about the first Risk of Rain but never played it. Risk of Rain 2 seemed to be well regarded too, but again, I didn't think I'd be interested.

I have to say I'm impressed despite being a bit meh on this one at first. There is a lot to like here and there is a learning curve that feels rewarding enough to keep trying while still feeling challenging. The main game having an adjustable difficulty progression is a nice touch and has made it easier for me, who is new to this series, to get into the game more deeply and ""get farther"" (helping me stay motivated to keep trying)

Not every class is my cup of tea, but that's actually a plus, in my opinion, because there are so many different  ways to play and with different loadouts per class, you can make change your playstyle even on the same character.

I feel like this game deserves the praise it gets and plan to revisit it regularly."

and i'd do it again
10/10
"
3692,"Music is so good but it is very quiet and it should be louder, Gameplay isn't AS replayable as people say it is. Once you find the most broken build you kinda just stick to it. They kinda ""Balanced"" farming items in the void. But i would argue becoming an untouchable god on the second stage IS more fun. It gave me a lot of hours but it needs more content. Everytime I finish unlocking everything I just want more and I have to wait so long. Its also a blast with friends and I have had to much fun goofing around with stupid mechanics in the game. Plus I probably have 200 hours listening to the soundtrack."

4 out of 5 stars."

3704,"The game takes some time to pick up, but after you unlock all the items and some fun characters it can become a cluster fuck that you can sign up for whenever you want. Not a lot of games get this much replay-ability. I would recommend it to anyone that has a slight interest in rogue likes, because this is one of the best ones out there.

Grab some friends and play the game you losers."

there's:
angery beetles
among us mods
like 12 classes (and like 20 more good ones if you include mods)
c     r     a     b
cool unlock system 
2+1 neat gamemodes
easy multiplayer so you can play with randos or friends 
personal respawning armies made of either robots or drones or void dudes or beetles or flying orbs with lazers or all listed at once if you're high enough
among us mods
""oh shit this has lore?""
INCREDIBLY nice QOL mods (literally search most anything into thunderstore. there's a mod for that.)
artifacts that spice up or change gameplay in (usually) a cool way
newts beyond time and space, apparently
feeding god complexes when you get a really good run
basically rotund slimes but better in every way
pretty scenery
not crashing when you get the uber-god run and literally eveything on the map instadies to 12 diffrent things all at once all the time

sooooooooo yeah, cool game"

3775,"I have over 200 hours in this game and I'm still not tired of it. There's so many achievements and characters (and character skins) to unlock that you'll honestly never get bored of it. Also, it's very hard the first time playing it, which is a good thing."

3842,"this game is really good, however i just lost 300+hours of progress because i quit the game using the ingame menus.
i have no idea how to fix it and the internet hasn't helped. I can't recommend a game that can randomly kill all of your progress"

3846,Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
3847,"Great game
"
3848,"Overall a good solid game, you might feel lost in the beginning till you get the hang of it as it does have a learning curve ie: items/abilities/champions/enemy's/bosses,  etc... Long story short repetition is key here, if you are someone who does not like repetition in games this is 100% not for you stray away. 

Really fun to play with friends, worth the purchase if you have people to play with imo. The soundtrack is also a big plus if you enjoy the retro wave style genre."
3849,"This game is by far some of the most fun I have ever had gaming with my friends. Fast and intense like a really good competitive shooter, but you get the benefits of fighting the computer and just hanging out. I love it.
"
3850,mitix big pog
3851,"Play Huntress and Engineer if you are a fan of automation, because once you are about 40 minutes into a run, you no longer have to touch your keyboard.
Play commando if you want an original and balanced experience.
MUL-T go burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Mercenary, Loader and Acrid are for up in your face but randomly getting one shot.
Bandit, Artificer, Captain if you like burst.
Rex... Idk who plays this.
(out of ten?)  Solid 8, just have to have time for a crazy run."
3852,Tons of fun.
3853,This game is awesome! I hope there would be more newbie friendly multi-player lobbies.

3894,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

3898,"One of my favorite games of all time. Frustratingly difficult at first, but as you begin to understand all the systems in the game and how items work together your brain turns into an automatic computer that's calculating every move, how long you need to take, which chests to grab etc. So many items and different paths that the game never feels stale (especially with the new DLC). This game is a perfect marker of what a rogue-like should strive for, and scratches that endless possibilities itch that I haven't had fully scratched since Binding of Isaac.

3899,"3 things:

It's incredibly fun: I didn't think I'd see a 3rd person arena shooter roguelike at any point, but boy am I glad I did. Risk of Rain 2 is accompanied with hours of hilarious, rage-inducing, and outright ridonculous gameplay. You wanna go the speed of light? Hit that order shrine. You want everything to explode when you use your basic attack? It'll take a few loops, but you'll get there. Do you want to bind an autoclicker to m1 when playing Huntress? I highly recommend it, she has auto-aim and it's just nice quality of life.

It's incredibly beautiful: people might look at risk of rain and be like ""huh this isn't hyper ultra realistic 967k graphics, this shit is ugly"" but the atmosphere of being on a desolate planet alone (or with 3 friends) becomes bigger and bigger as the game gets harder and harder. The deep and dark colors create an environment that really seems like it wants to kill you, which is exactly what the game wants to do. Trust me, you'll spend enough time looking at your health bar and enemies to mitigate the worry of the world looking the same.

It's replayable: to piggyback off of the ""looking the same statement"", RoR2 is only the same, if you make it the same, and it's really hard to get 2 similar runs back to back. Since Risk of Rain 2's release, they've added a plethora of maps and map variations that make the environment feel different each playthrough. The item randomization is solid (aside with a slowly creeping item bloat). Most of all, there's a massive cast of characters, 4 different game modes, and tons of modifiers to change your run. Everyone I know that's picked up this game has sunk at least 40-50 hours in it. I can't guarantee you will do the same, but I can certainly tell you that from my heart, (and my playtime) I think this game is worth every penny I spent on it 10-fold and more."
3900,"I dont know who I am, I dont know why I'm here, all I know is I must kill"
3901,stage 5 music slaps harder than the yellow dudes. 10/10 would loop again.
3902,I'm not a huge fan of roguelikes but this game is honestly super fun. Even more fun when playing with other.
3903,"Crash land, kill endangered species, slap random space junk onto your person, kill a god, repeat.
Good shit, bring your friends."
3904,"The first rogue-like that I've enjoyed, I would recommend this for anyone."
3905,"Extremely well-made game once you get the hang of it. I would suggest playing your first 5-10 runs on easy just to get a feel for the mechanics/items. It might be too frustrating otherwise. (at least it was for me)

I've only played solo so far but I assume the coop experience is even better. 

Pros:
- exceptionally fun game loop
- beautiful art style with unique enemies and worlds
- high replayability due to large amount of characters and item combos
- amazing soundtrack!
- not too graphically demanding 
- no AAA microtransaction BS
- viable for solo players

Cons:
- No pausing in Multiplayer. (Not that I've tried coop yet but I can imagine this could be annoying)"
3906,"one of those games that keeps you hooked from start to finish with plenty of variety in characters. The challenge in this game is great, one minute you feel like a god and next minute you're dead. 9/10."
3907,its a damn good game better than the first would LOVE to play the third one can't wait to get back on my pc and play it with mods because the mods are also DAMN GOOD

Review by Unam 

I'm a huge fan of the Roguelike genre, but Risk of Rain 2 is the best one I've played. [i] It is Magnificent [/i].

Everything about this just clicks together perfectly like puzzle pieces in a jigsaw. Let's start with a few basics. This is a Roguelike, meaning that your progress through a run is always different from other runs, and if you die you restart from 0. In the base game there are a total of 11 Survivors that all behave differently from each other I'll give you a quick rundown of all characters:

[table]
    [tr]
        [th]Name[/th]
        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Commando[/td]
        [td]Jack of all trades that works almost anywhere[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Huntress[/td]
        [td]Nimble but quick character that can dispose of most enemies in a flash[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]MUL-T[/td]
        [td]A tanky robot who can melt tanks and resist most damage[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Bandit[/td]
        [td]A Survivor who specializes on hiding and dealing massive damage behind the backs of enemies[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Artificer[/td]
        [td]A destructive Survivor that has mighty offensive abilities (and a jetpack)[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Acrid[/td]
        [td]A melee, ranged hybrid who can melt tanks quickly through the use of poison[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Captain[/td]
        [td]The Captain's strength is his ability to call down a variety of tactical drops, and can take care of most projectiles in a rush[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Engineer[/td]
        [td]A smart Survivor who uses turrets and good positioning in order to execute the enemy[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Loader[/td]
        [td]A melee Survivor with a grappling hook that can get her anywhere[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mercenary[/td]
        [td]A swordfighter who moves lightning fast through most enemies[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]REX[/td]
        [td]REX is a special one, as most of his attacks consume his health, making everything a balance between health/attack[/td]
    [/tr]
[/table]

Everyone here is unique, and you will most likely stick to 2-3 Survivors, but every one is worth experiencing at least once. You start with only Commando, but you can unlock most of the other characters through special challenges. However, you can't just rely on your survivor. This is where your items come in. These provide a boost to a specific skill, examples include Movement Speed, causing Bleed, firing Rockets, and so on so forward. You rely on your items, without them you are nothing. Items are always random, meaning that you will have to improvise what you do depending on your items and plan accordingly. Items are divided into categories, from Grey which is common to Red which is super rare but provides IMMENSE POWER. The key to victory is to deal enough damage, manage your speed and your reaction time, and have enough healing to be able to react to a hit. The longer you take, the harder it gets. This means that alongside everything else you have to be fast. This creates interesting chemistry between all these factors, where it can get quite ridiculous and fun. 

The game also offers a variety of interesting environments with little secrets that are always fun to explore. Some elements are always randomized to keep things fresh. There are some random events that can also trigger randomly that can be quite a challenge. The enemies and their designs are fun too! Some real standouts are the teleporter bosses which you fight to progress to the next stage. Unless you have a good run where you instantly kill anything in a single second these will prove to be tough. Everything will challenge the most hardcore of players. Most items have to also be unlocked through challenges, much like the Survivors. It will take you multiple hours to unlock everything there is to see. Even after you beat the final boss, the game will keep you coming back for a lot. 

Hopoo has crafted a great game that takes a fresh spin on the genre. Congratulations to the small team on crafting something very special for me. You've made it through this entire review, trust me, this is worth it. I would still pick it up if it was 60 Dollars. 

I give Risk of Rain 2 a...

3927,it good
3928,very good
3929,Risky
3930,"i also have the dlc. It is super fun and easy to learn. it can seem daunting at first, but it supports a ""grab, go, and find out later"" play style until you learn what things do and how you like to build your character. had bits of lore that are relatively easy to find. great alone or with friends!"
3931,variety is the spice of life
3932,fortnite save the world
3933,"this game is very funny to play with friends, there is a lot to do in the game with achievements of various difficulties, even if you completely finished with the achievements there is still a lot of fun things to do in the game."
3934,:)
3935,Is this game fun... Um not really. Is this game fulfilling to play... I dont think so. Is this game enjoable to play with friends.... HAHAHA dont make me laugh. However there is one thing this game can give u that nothing can compare to. Yes by playing this game u can transcend the human realm and become a divine being. RIsk of rain is not a game but a tool to reach the divine realm. Please do not read this review unless u r a higher being like me. Humans now disgust me and if u wish to be like me u better start working on risk of rain 2.
3936,this game convinced me to eat the glowing green mushrooms in my backyard

3954,gun go shoot
3955,Is good. Is even more good when multiplayer. I give it 9 / 10 Ukeleles
3956,"I don't have enough time to git gud. So I play on Easy and really enjoy it. It's the most relaxing shooter I've ever played. The only drawback is, that the final boss is just a bullet sponge (depending on your RNG-Luck) can one-hit you. All in all the battle is rather different from the rest of the game.

3964,if you wish to feel like a good then play this with the artifact of command.
3965,"The Risk of Rain games are some of the best Roguelikes out there in my opinion. Risk of Rain 2 is easily my favorite video game, and it is a perfect extension on the first game. The developers of this game have clearly poured their hearts and souls into it and it really shines with some of the most engaging gameplay, interesting lore, exciting mechanics, creative visuals, and attentiveness to the community that I have experienced. If you like roguelikes, and want a customizable, rewarding,  and rich experience, you should absolutely buy this game and its DLC. And Risk of Rain 1."

3974,gud gamm
3975,10/10 would get swallowed by the void again
3976,"The first game introduced me to roguelikes, and by it's own it was an amazing experience.

For a while, I was reluctant to buy the second game because it felt like it was the first game, but with an additional dimension, and for me, the 2D platformer feel of the original was the charm.

Oh, I was wrong. The game not just adds a dimension, but a lot of depth and possibilities. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. Hearing ...con lentitud poderosa after spending years with Coalescence in my playlist hit me in a way no other OST did. Props to Chris Christodoulou!

This could be a hard game, a VERY hard game if you want. But also could be a cakewalk, there's so much room for experimenting with builds and item combinations. There's no need to gatekeep difficulty, you play how you want to play, and that's the beauty of it.

3978,AND HIS MUSIC WAS ELECTRIC!!!!
3979,"Mild chance of downpour is the best game of 1952, sadly it came out in 2019"
3980,"Excellent soundtrack, well designed levels, interesting and dynamic character roster.  Developers set out to create a very specific experience and it's plain to see they stayed focused in pursuit of that vision.  Thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it often to friends."

3982,Risk of Pain 2
3983,really good big yes get it super fun love it wow
3984,"RoR2 is an absolute masterpiece that surprisingly surpasses the quality and replayability of its predecessor. Boasting an obscene number of gameplay combinations (character choice each with a completely distinct play style, mix-and-matchable alternative ability options for each character which can further change play style, game difficulty, solo or co-op, mix-and-matchable gameplay modifiers or ""artifacts,"" a ""new game plus"" mode in Eclipse, an ""arcade"" game mode in Prismatic Trials, many distinct win conditions, a toggleable DLC that profoundly affects the meta), odds are there is a combination of settings that nicely fits your skill level and preferred mode of play.

On top of that, the audio and visual designs of the game are impeccable, being both incredibly informative in the heat of battle and quality in their own rights. Chris Christodoulou brings an incredible soundtrack that excels in establishing and affirming tone.

I'm typically not a fan of roguelikes because I often find the gameplay to become stale far before I reach significant measurable skill thresholds (e.g., winning a run or beating new game plus), but Hopoo Games mitigates this by splitting up progress into achievements, three main difficulties, and the eight-step progression track of Eclipse. Having just beaten Eclipse 8 on my first survivor, I can attest that every threshold along the way both seems feasible at the time and is satisfying but non-trivial to actually accomplish.

Whether you're a fan of roguelikes or typically avoid them, I cannot recommend Risk of Rain 2 enough. It is easily one of my top 5 favorite games of all time."

3986,Won't let me play unless i unplug or disable my gaming wheel
3987,pretty nice

3992,"i shoot i die , sometimes i cry but i always want to try, 

Then finally you beat the final boss on the hardest setting after grinding for over an hour and of course you then cry (yes again) but with joy this time, 

With those tears of happiness still on your cheek proceed to prepare for another run until i check the time and realise its now 3am with a big sigh..

i love the music, the art work and style it really makes it a joy to play."

online with friends is awesome"
4012,"It took a while for me to warm up to this game, as initially, I thought the lore was too obscure and random, and thematically, the game felt all over the place.

However, after having played it more single-player, and having looked deeper into the lore surrounding the game, it's safe to say I was mistaken with my initial impression. The lore of this game is phenomenal, and the various locales are beautiful. Combat in this game is excellent, and the artifacts and eclipse mode not only make the game accessible, but provide a great challenge to those seeking it. 

It's one of my favorite multiplayer games to play with friends, due to the shenanigans and fun moments that can arise in any given run. Truly a great game to get, whether you intend to play it alone, or with friends."
4013,this game is fun
4014,"This game is not what I thought it would, my friends were losing hours in this game and eventually bought me a copy to play with them.

4076,"ha funny arm man go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"
4077,"One of my favorite rogue-likes. Risk of Rain 2 is best played with a couple of friends in my opinion but it has loads of arcade-y kind of content and bosses that scale with number of players, so the solo experience is one unto itself and still well worth exploration. When you are playing with friends, though, this game quickly turns into a madhouse of insane item-survivor ability combinations that turn crowds of enemies from grindy assaults to waves of explosions. It's like a joke that never really gets old, and because of this i find myself coming back to the game every few months to put a few more runs in. 
I highly recommend this game, I'd buy two copies so a friend could pick it up with me. I feel like there's more connectivity issues now than there used to be, but nothing so frequent or game breaking that it makes the game a chore to play in my experience. 

Also, just a tip, most of the survivors in the game benefit most from effects that trigger on-hit, as each bullet fired gives you an opportunity. There are a couple of characters that are a bit of an exception to this, but almost always you're gonna benefit a lot from stacking bleed, crit chance, or mini-rockets (seriously, i cant hype up the mini-rockets enough)"
4078,no sex option between engineer and turrets 9/10
4079,best roguelike i've played. and i've played quite a few. dead cells was my favorite before this but it was dethroned. do recommend 9.5/10

4081,"I see glasses, I pog"
4082,"Pros: 
Goes easy on your machine
Runs like greased lighting 
Great music
Great fun with friends 
Cons: 
There's an issue with crossplay that will crash your game if you or any of your friends have it turned on. Turn it off GG ez
Since it is a rogue like,  RNG can screw you
Little bit of a learning curve until you have abilities and items under your belt

Took me about 144 hours for a full clear, with the exception of only one or two achievements you can make the game as easy or as difficult as you'd like. Some friends can play easier characters on easier difficulties or you can amp up the difficulty with artifacts and different modes. 

Definitely worth the money whether you have friends to play with or not."

4088,good
4089,This game ruined my life (in a good way)
4090,"Fun game, just not really made for multiplayer. If you die and your team doesn't, you will enter the every stage after that in a massive deficit in terms of power because of the items you missed out on getting. Inevitably this just leads to one person getting super powerful while everyone else dies instantly every stage. 

Or just play the way God intended on Swarms + Sacrifice with an item sharing mod"

4117,good
4118,3d rougelike that should probably have an epilepsy warning. needs sex.
4119,"Risk of Rain 2 is an extremely addictive game with satisfying moment-to-moment gameplay and a progression system based in achievements. The game starts out very simple with its item pool to ease you into a larger stockpile of items that you'll be able to get. Pretty much all of the playable characters are pretty fun and satisfying to play, and have their own hidden techniques / tactics associated with them. The music is positively incredible, as well! You'll be having to listen to most of the tracks quite a few times, but they're all at the very worst bearable. The graphics aren't exactly cutting-edge, but the artstyle is pretty charming, and the lack of high-def graphics allows for more devices to run it.

This is the type of game that you'll say you'll only play for about 1 run, but end up doing 3 or 4 runs just because of how fun it is. Give it a try if you can!"

4131,"satisfying damage, movement, graphics"
4132,"tl;dr : An absolute masterpiece, both for a roguelike AND for a third-person shooter. Although lacking in a select few areas, the game's prominent modding community provides a multitude of QoL improvements.

Pros:
+ Beautiful visual style
+ Character roster covers a wide range of playstyles and strategies; if a certain character's gameplay doesn't feel fun, there's most definitely some other that will
+ Extremely fun multiplayer and singleplayer
+ Strangely enough, the one roguelike where I actually still have fun even if I lose (which to me is a very important indicator of a good game)

Cons:
- Certain features are not in the game by default, though this is remedied by modding. The game doesn't have the ability to save an in-progress run which feels like an extreme oversight considering that runs can go well over an hour.

[b]Note: I personally play the game modded. Thunderstore is the mod manager I use due to it's simplicity (and it auto-downloads dependencies), but I believe there are other mod managers as well. The following mods are what I highly recommend to make the game the best experience it can be:[/b]
+ ProperSave: Adds mid-run save support to the game. Progress is saved at the start of each stage so you can quit and resume later. Also supports separate run saves for each game mode along with multiplayer.
+ ItemStats: Changes the item pickup text to better describe what it does. Also lets you check item descriptions just by pinging them on the ground.
+ LunarCoinShareOnPickup: Lunar coins picked up in multiplayer are given to all members.
+ DropinMultiplayer: Lets players join in during an in-progress run, giving them items/levels if needed.
+ PauseInMultiplayer: A bit buggy, but helps you freeze time in multiplayer in-case somebody needs to do something."

I cant stop playing it, but actually almost just uninstalled it"
4160,"Sometimes the simple things are just amazing as a starter. To keep everyone happy, a good-flavoured soup can really hit the spot. French baguettes or a white bread plait both go really well with this.

Ingredients

1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped

4 sprigs of thyme, chopped

2 cloves of garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

2 tbsp olive oil

900g carrots, peeled and chopped

1.25 litres chicken stock

400g tin of coconut milk

Sea salt to season

To serve

200ml softly whipped cream

10g affilla cress

Crusty homemade bread

Method

1. Put a large saucepan on a high heat and sweat the onions, thyme and garlic in the olive oil until nicely softened.

2. Add in the chopped carrots and reduce the heat to medium. Sweat the carrots for around 10-15 minutes to release the maximum flavour from them. Add the chicken stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to medium and allow to simmer until the carrots soften.

3. Once soft enough, blend with a hand blender. Once blended, add the coconut milk and return to the heat for 3-4 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt.

4. When serving this soup, I like to give it a froth for presentation purposes. To do this, pour the soup into a jug and use the hand blender on a low speed with up and down motions to make the soup frothy.

5. Pour into a bowl and then top with a dollop of whipped cream. Place a piece of affilla cress on top of the cream and then serve with some crusty homemade bread.



Olive tapenade bread
This olive tapenade bread works really nicely with bacon and onion bread. Serve slices of the two together before any dinner party or special occasion to truly impress your guests.

Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves

Ingredients

500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting

7g instant yeast

2 pinches of salt

2 pinches of caster sugar

325ml tepid water

Olive tapenade

Olive oil for greasing

1 egg yolk, beaten

Method

1. Combine all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Then pour in the water and mix with a fork until the dough comes together.

2. Tip the dough on to a work surface dusted with a bit of flour and knead for 10 minutes until well combined - when you press your finger into the dough it should spring back. The dough should also be nice and smooth. Place it back into the mixing bowl and cover with cling film or a damp tea towel and allow to prove for an hour in a warm place.

3. After an hour, knock back the dough. To knock it back all you need to do is punch all the air out of the risen dough. Now you are ready to shape. You can make either two small loaves or one large one. I like them smaller, but it's entirely up to you.

4. To make one loaf, roll all the dough out into a flat rectangle on your work surface with a rolling pin. The length of the dough should be the same as the length of the tin you are using, the largest tin you can use being a 2lb loaf tin. Spread the olive tapenade evenly across the whole dough with a palette knife.

5. Now roll the dough like a Swiss roll, nice and tight, and then seal the edges with your fingertips so it doesn't open in the oven. Grease the baking tin with a little olive oil and then set the bread into it. Cover with a damp tea towel and allow to prove for 15-20 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/400ºF/gas mark 6.

7. Brush the beaten egg yolk over the whole surface and then place into the oven to bake for 40-45 minutes. To check that the loaf is properly cooked, tip it out of the tin and tap the base. It should sound hollow. If it doesn't, return to the oven for another 5 minutes.

8. Once cooked, tip the bread out and allow to cool on a wire rack before serving.



Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with Sweet Potato
This was the cut of meat I most wanted to learn how to cook when training. If you don't want to do this yourself, your butcher will French-trim the rack for you. The Dijon mustard brushed on really complements the flavour of the lamb and allows the crust to stick.

Serves 4

Ingredients

2 racks of lamb cut in half (3 bones per serving)

Salt and cracked black pepper to season

Olive oil

2 tbsp Dijon mustard

8 pearl onions

2 little gem lettuce, sliced thinly

1 tbsp butter

For the crust 4 slices of stale bread made into crumbs

Small bunch of parsley

4 sprigs of thyme

For the sweet potato fondant 1 large sweet potato, peeled

2 tbsp butter

300ml water

2 sprigs of thyme

Method

1. Place the lamb on a chopping board fat side up. Lightly score the fat layer with a sharp knife. Next, generously sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper. Mop up the excess seasoning with the meat, ensuring it is thoroughly coated.

Heat some oil in a frying pan on a high heat. Seal the lamb by placing each side in the oil long enough to develop colour. It is simple: no colour equals no taste, so make sure you brown the lamb properly.

2. Transfer the lamb to a preheated oven at 190ºC/410ºF/gas mark 6 and bake for 7-8 minutes. While the lamb is cooking, you can prepare the crust.

3. Place all of the ingredients for the crust into a blender and pulse several times until it looks nice and green. Pour the mixture into a deep dish and set aside.

4. Remove the lamb from the oven and brush generously with the mustard. Dip the lamb into the crust mixture coating it completely. Dip it several times to ensure an even coating, then allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes covered in tinfoil.

While the meat is resting, make the fondant. Cut the sweet potato with a sharp knife so you are left with 2cm-thick rounds. With a 5cm fondant cutter, cut out four perfect rounds of sweet potato. Keep whatever is left over for a purée.

5. Add the sweet potato, 1 tablespoon of butter, water and thyme to a small frying pan. Cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes on each side until softened but not overcooked. Once cooked, pour away the liquid and cook the rounds in a little olive oil and the other tablespoon of butter with the pearl onions, until coloured on the outside.

6. Sauté the sliced little gem in a little olive oil, 1 tablespoon of butter and salt to taste for 30 seconds in a separate small saucepan on a high heat.

7. When you are almost ready to serve, place the lamb back into the oven for 3-4 minutes. Slice through each chop once ready. This is best served pink.

8. To plate up, put a little carrot and star anise purée and some of the little gem lettuce on a plate, then sit a portion of lamb on top. Add one piece of sweet potato fondant, a couple of pearl onions and spoon on the warm red wine jus (see panels).



Pear tart tatin
This elegant dessert is designed to serve two, but you can easily make an extra tatin or two to serve more. I find vanilla pods dusted with icing sugar are the perfect finishing touch. Dry the empty pods after you have used them in the ice-cream to use for decoration.

Serves 2

4196,"I can't tell you what's happening, but I can say I love it













(yes this was for the steam community badge)"
4197,this game is amazing <3
4198,"I’ve played this game for so long now and honestly its one of my favorites. The progression system in this game is such a bitch and for that reason alone i love it. Every single second of the game the enemies get harder and harder to defeat. Huntress is definitely my go to character to play because of her aoe ability plus her mobility is incredibly good, and easy to master. I dont ever see this game getting boring anytime soon for me at least. Love love LOVE this game."

4212,Yes
4213,"I'll keep it simple, do you want to shoot things? Do you want to play with a different playstyle every time you play the game? Do you want a game with endless replayability? If you answered yes to these questions, get the f*cking game. By far the best roguelike game in the world."
4214,The Rain Formerly Known as Purple sticks in your head after you hear it. Other than that great game.

4244,"Fun last as long as you can type game, and there's ways to beat the game if you want to close the loop on the story. Huge selection of playable characters with vastly different play-styles, big swathe of enemies, huge collection of items to go for unique builds, and it scales pretty well 1-4 players. Biggest complaint would be that the maps don't vary much so they do kind of get plain after awhile.

Would recommend if you like horde-type games and/or want something to play with a group

8.5/10"
4245,pew pew big fun
4246,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4247,what if it was called Risk Of Rain Poo
4248,"fun with friends and the mod community is great
"
4249,"Warning: This game may be highly addictive.
Risk of Rain 2 is a game that starts out feeling difficult, but once you get the hang of things you begin to feel like a god. It is a real power trip. Eventually, easy mode is just used for unlocking things. The medium difficulty also becomes too easy eventually -[spoiler] once you begin to utilize artifacts such as the artifact of sacrifice and artifact of command [/spoiler]. Starting out, you may feel like monsoon difficulty will be impossible to ever complete, but in time you will get the hang of it and monsoon may be the only difficulty you will play.
Overall, a fun experience with a lot to reach for and unlock. It can truly be satisfying to see how much you improve over time."
4250,10/10
4251,"Really excellent update from the first version of the game. Love the play style and the story line! Great with friends. Can be tough to unlock characters, but you just keep playing."
4252,"It's a fun game, and it has a lot packed into what seems to be a small and simple concept. It's great to play with friends, probably my favorite coop game in the last few years"
4253,!0/10 would suggest playing with friends makes the game way more fun.
4254,it felt like 30-40 minutes but actually 2 hour pass
4255,Fun game.
4256,"me and some friends died on monsoon right before the teleporter was activated on the stage where we could obliterate and we don't know what killed us

4257,"It's like meth...



Nothing else"
4258,10/10 would play again
4259,No actual rain
4260,"Game good, there is enough items to know what most of them do but not make every run the same."
4261,"I love rogue likes! My favorites are Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Issac, and FTL. This game is nowhere near as fun, varied, or long as those. It has only a handful of levels and each run is basically the same except for difficulty level. Maybe worth $3."
4262,yeah this is definitely one of the games ever made
4263,"risk of rain 2 is without a doubt, one of the games of all time. it has a story, characters, and gameplay for all to enjoy."
4264,Penis Schwanz

4280,"It's insanely fun and replayable, even better with friends. If you have any doubts about getting it, then take my word for it; It's that good."
4281,"Marvelous GAME. It's an enjoyable game with a decent learning curve. It's frustrating to die at times, but really rewarding to come out on top despite circumstances. Every run is different and every survivor changes each run up ever so slightly. 10/10"
4282,good shit
4283,"Risk of Rain is one of the best roguelites out there. With easily upwards of 60 hours of content there is so much to do and unlock. Even after playing about 170 hours, there is still something I haven't been able to do. Also, playing with friends and people online is a fun experience that helps to round out the game. And the game is still receiving support and dlc years after it first came out. 9/10"
4284,"Lovely game, I will gladly 100% this title. Just needs a little more tweaking like not having the automatic pick up of items and rather exclusively pressing E to pick them up as an option in the settings. It would help new players a lot as the Lunar items come with HEAVY drawbacks sometimes. I love this game though."
4285,uh yeah its good
4286,unhappy
4287,haha character go brr and item go bzz boo mbomom and bzoom aand is good :)
4288,A lot more fun with a good friend!

4296,"an insanely fun and colourful game, the characters are all incredibly unique as is the game. The monsters change with each environment and every game is different depending on what artifacts you use if any. 10/10 would recommend, one of a the few games that I can sit down and play for many hours straight. Even better with friends like a duo or something."
4297,"very good, pls play"
4298,"could easily see myself sinking 100+ hours on this
really great purchase
10/10"
4299,"Just bought and started playing this game recently and I already had some frustrating and funny death experience.

>Started Prismatic Trial
>Spawned with only 10% Health due to Glass Artifact
>Got on to the 2nd level fast and with ease.
>Activate Teleporter.
>Enemies Spawn - Proceeds to burn them down.
>Teleporter at 80-90% - Almost done! Got too confident and let my guard down and went to tab out real quick.
>Tabbed back just to get quickscoped by a mid-air Elite Stone Golem while its jumping from platform to another.
>Ain't even mad. Proceeds to do another run."

4306,it good
4307,"its gonna rain bodies, lots of bodies"
4308,Why don't you have this game already?
4309,"With randoms this game is frustrating, but with friends it becomes extremely fun. Good game mechanics with cool bosses/enemies. Good visuals and amazing soundtrack. Overall, the game is worth the money if you have people to play it with."
4310,really fun
4311,"this game makes me angry, then 20 min later im wanting to play so badly again, Ive haven't had a game that made me this excited to play since i was a kid. what a amazing game."

4314,"Bought in EA, bought the DLC when it came out, 1000's of hours in RoR1.

I love this game. But after repeatedly losing hours of enjoyment due to unbalanced game play and getting one hit even after 1.0 landed and a DLC dropped is maddening. 
It feels like the developers lost their minds towards the end of the game.

No spoilers, but the proper ending level takes everything fun about the game and makes me hate it.
Some of the levels are less fun than others; but the last level is a lesson in the opposite of proper game endings  and design. It is pointless, huge, ugly, empty, and has enemies you only see there, along with possibly the worst boss in a game I have ever played. This coming from someone that grew up beating all sorts of awful NES games.

The game is still in need of serious balancing as evident by the comments section alone.
(Funny, half of the people bring up legitimate issues, while the other half just pull the git gud card. Sorry wimp, this isn't Dark Souls where there is a reason and rhythm to everything in which skill and attention pay off.)

All in all, I cannot recommend this even at a discount until they re-balance certain aspects to bring it more in line with the first game. Rage quitting out of a cheap shot 2+ hours in a rouge lite is some cheap BS, and causes me to come back to this game less and less.

That means I won't buy any DLC if I don't play the game! Ruh Roh."
4315,"This game does a fantastic job at pushing the player/players to work together thinking critically, and creatively. It has something to offer a wide variety of skill levels from new, to experienced players. (P.S. the music is DOPE!)"

If you play the game long enough with other people in a session there is 100% one of the guests will disconnect and not be able to return or finish, ruing hours of hard fought for progress. There's 3-4 of us who play together and you truly can't finish unless you do it very quickly to get the achievement and unlocks.    Solo however it works just fine."
4374,gg
4375,"you never know what killed you or what your mistake was. its super frustrating to have the perfect run but then your health magicly disappers without any apperant reason. the game also doesnt tell you what went wrong, it does tell you what dealt the last killing blow on you which is not useful at all..."
4376,The game offers a casual way into rogue lite/like games 10/10 in my opinion.
4377,"TLDR: Buy game, it good :)

I'll be honest, a couple of weeks ago I saw this game and thought it looked neat but it wasn't anything special.
Now having sunk 75 hours into it.... I can safely say, I was wrong. Risk of Rain 2 is a Masterpiece and I intend on sinking so many more hours into it.

I never played the original Risk of Rain, so going into RoR2 I didn't have any expectations. Matter of fact, I didn't even know the game was a roguelite. Despite being a roguelite this has not taken away from the amount of detail and secrets that are packet into every stage.

Okay I ran out of steam for writing this BUT I REAAAALLYYY LOVE THIS GAME.
If you enjoy roguelites, BUY IT.
If you have some free time, BUY IT.
If you see it on sale, BUY IT.
If it's not on sale, use isthereanydeal.com and FIND A FUCKING WEBSITE THAT DOES HAVE A SALE AND BUY IT."
4378,pretty fun unless your talking about prismatic trials as mercenary
4379,"After 136 hours and getting every achievement the game (currently) has to offer, I can safely say that this game is a must-have for any gamer out there! Also, the music absolutely slaps; I listen to the ost of this one and the first one every now and then!"
4380,Difficult & annoying. One hour dying and trying then managed kill the first boss and progress to second level. About 17 minutes just boring running away endless enemies. Kill one and two will respawn. Then die eventually and start all over again. All Reviews: Overwhelmingly Positive. I don't get it.

I don't recommend this game if you have a job, family, hobbies aside from gaming, or any friends (Unless they also play this game) because this game will consume you as it has already consumed me I think this is video game equivalent of actual crack and it has ruined my life.

4396,"Risk of Rain 2 satisfies my obsession to clap cheeks while looking like an aggressive Katamari ball along the way.

I almost always have this downloaded in my library. I played the first Risk of Rain back in the 2010s, and playing Risk of Rain 2 in 2022 reminded me how fun it was to snowball your character into an absolute mongrel of damage. I was initially nervous about the transition to it being 3D, but Hopoo Games did a triple somersault into a cup of water on this one.

The characters are great, each with their respective optional skills. There are also several challenges to unlock and play (Command is excellent for specific builds), and the online coop is stable and so much fun."

The multiplayer for this game suck ass"
4458,"[h1] Good god, I love this game [/h1]

Risk of Rain 2 is a near perfect example of roguelike game design, wrapped up with a lovely visual direction and a phenomenal soudtrack courtesy of Chris Christodoulou. There's ample choices of survivors to pick before crash-landing on an alien planet, and in true rougelike fashion they're all very varied in gameplay and get unlocked as you get a handle on the game. 

It is very easily to get overwhelmed and frustrated in your first hours, admittedly, Trying to comprehend the various enemies that never stop spawning, figuring out which powerups are worth your time and synergize with your chosen survivor, trying to find the goddamn teleporter to move onto the next stage [spoiler] Protip: Follow the sparkling red lights once you see them [/spoiler] and then getting your butt kicked by an unexpected horde or unfamiliar boss that seems to kill you in one hit. 

But stick with it, it's like riding a horse. It may try to throw you off, but once you get the handle on it everything opens up, and with the right skills and builds you will be virtually unstoppable. I can't express the absolute power trip and visual spectacle a synergized, overly powered-up run gives me. It stops being about surviving the horde, the horde has to SURVIVE you.

And in typical rougelike fashion, there's plenty of powerups, hidden realms and additional abilities and assists to unlock, which just add further to the game's incredible replay value. It's even got a DLC now that adds even more to the game, and opens up even more possibilities in every run. And the best thing is only one person in a multiplayer lobby needs to own the DLC for other players to experience it. 

Of course the game has multiplayer, so if you have 1-3 other friends who play the game, rope them into the chaos, it's always a fun time. Fool around even more with survivor synergy and beating the stuffing out of every single enemy foolish enough to spawn in your way.

In short: Buy this game, pick your survivor, stack your powerups, and CHALLENGE THE MOUNTAIN."
4459,best thing since sliced bread
4460,Good game
4461,I literally cannot even play multiplayer anymore. I tried every fix I could find online but it literally does not budge. Everytime I join a multiplayer lobby I can't play and everytime I start a lobby people can't play. I'm basically forced to play singleplayer because it doesn't fucking work.

4480,"I really enjoyed playing the game, it gets very chaotic and fun, it's also great with friends. However, there's one problem I have with the game. The game is not exactly what it says it is. In the game there is not in fact a risk of rain, nor any mention of rain. I feel as if it's unprofessional and morally wrong to title the game something it's not. Where is the rain. Where is it? Is there even any rain in the game? Someone please tell me. Where's the rain. I want the rain. PLEASE GIVE ME THE RAIN. I WANT THE RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN. RAIN.

Few games with actual replayability while keeping its gameplay fun and entertaining. After your first ever run, you just feel like you've done so good you could do a lot better the next run, unlocking and learning what each item does as you play more and more.

With items, obviously comes with Survivors. You can tell each Survivor has a unique role and utility with their playstyle, at least in a group. A composition is also very important, as much as an entire group going for the same Survivor is fun, you have to admit having a built composition is a better way of enjoying the game.

And with a variety of Survivors, comes with a wider variety of enemies to fight against, and trust me, there's a LOT of different enemies, not to mention any of them has a chance to become practically any type of Elite to spice up your run.

Your time is limitless, but the more time you take between each stage, the harder it gets, and I learned that the hard way. The game keeps you more or less on the move depending on what difficulty you're playing on. You CAN take as much time as you need, but at your own risk of quickly getting overwhelmed in numbers and could easily cost you your entire run.

You also get different choices on how you want to win/end your run other than just defeating the same final boss over and over again. However that does not mean they're easier or simpler to get through.

Overall, Risk of Rain 2 is incredibly fun and the replayability is insane thanks to a lot of RNG factors differentiating each run from another, and I also recommend playing with a couple friends, it makes the game even more fun when you got a couple buddies you can escape different planets with. There's a lot that I haven't even mentioned, otherwise this review would be close to endless, so I'm putting it up to you to explore the rest of the game yourself.

(On a side note, modding is also a thing on this game, however I haven't tried it myself so I can't really express an opinion towards it.)"
4496,I became Raiden from MGR:R
4497,gun go boom
4498,"I fall for Risk of Rain 2's trick every time. An hour into a good run my character is plastered head-to-toe in bizarre power-ups, like a katamari rolled through a novelty shop. Yes, I have three teddy bears strapped to my thigh, but those are important, because teddy bears have a percentage chance of blocking all incoming damage. Obviously I have seven needles stuck into my head. How else am I going to massively increase my attack speed? When I'm loaded down with dozens of items, Risk of Rain 2 always fools me into feeling unstoppable. ""I am a golden god"" echoes through my mind. And then something hits me so hard it knocks the godhood right out of me, and whoosh. Dead in an instant, game over. How did I ever think three teddy bears would be enough?"
4499,FUN GAME!
4500,risk of rain 2
4501,fun yes with friends yes get yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4502,"Have you ever wanted to hit an all-time high AND an all-time low in dopamine release at the same time? Well if you have a good Risk of Rain 2 run just before you watch your entire family get murdered you may just get there.

Risk of Rain 2 is a third-person shooter rogue-lite game with both singleplayer and up to 4 player multiplayer modes. I have played this game since it came out, and have experienced every iteration of the game and can honestly say that this game is one of the best solo time-killing games as well as one of the best fuck-around-with-friends games on the market. Every single run is a fun experience, and every character feels hand-crafted to have their own style. Items are (for the most part) fun to pickup and incorporate into insane builds, and tons of wacky combinations exist and can be found simply by playing. Each level is well crafted and the secrets the game holds are very well made. The game is designed well, and that's only half of why it's fun.

If a good engine and basic gameplay loop set the game up to be homerun, the balancing sent the game past the stands and into orbit. [i] Nothing [/i] in this game feels balanced at first, and its [i] wonderful [/i]. This game has balancing, and is balanced (for the most part) but the fact that Hopoo managed to make it feel like any run is broken is a development miracle. Want to run at the speed of light? Drink 40 energy drinks and watch your health evaporate as you hit a surface too hard and take the 1045720592 fall damage you were building up from spacegliding everywhere. Want to erase enemies from existence? Stack up crowbars and grab a big laser cannon and watch as you obliterate a beetle so hard everyone in the universe collectively forgets it ever existed just before seeing an enemy who is about to do the same thing to you. Want to play a supportive role and set your team up for success? One word: [b] [i] B U N G U S [/i] [/b]. EVERYTHING feels good to build and stack as you watch enemies evaporate before your eyes. The base item not spicy enough? Use the lunar ones! Insane upsides with (mostly) crippling downsides create crazy new iterations on any build. [spoiler] Use enough and you just might defy religion. [/spoiler] Go on, build a run that makes you think you'll kill god and then actually go do it. Nothing is stopping you, except god. And he'll put up a good fight.

If [i] that [/i] hasn't sold you, the modifiers might. Throughout playing you can unlock 16 different modifiers that can both make runs easier or make them so mind crushingly difficult you'll wonder how the devs even won with them on. But that's the thing, [i] they didn't. [/i] When the modifiers first came out, the devs said that they still haven't successfully won a 4 player lobby with all 16 active. I haven't been able to, and after about 5 tries it's easy to see why. The modifiers add even more new ways to experience an already vast and great game.

""But I don't like Roguelites"" I hear you cry as you inexpliciable look at the store page for a roguelite. Well don't fret,l this is also includes a Survival Arena gamemode where you and friends can defend against wave after wave of increasingly powerful enemies. It's a great experience because all those busted item builds can be done here, and it's arguably easier to do. You can also throw on modifiers to make even more chaos. Hell, you can even [i] access a mini version of this mode in a normal run [/i] if you feel so inclined.

But if [b] [i] THAT [/i] [/b] hasn't sold you, I still have one trick up my sleeve. I have about 200 hours in the game. 0 of those have been played with mods. This game has third-party modding support, with mods that add items, levels, modifers, characters, and even fucking gamemodes. I have occasionally browsed the mod database and HOLY FUCK is there a ton of random stuff that all seems fun. Old characters from Risk of Rain 1, New characters based on no IP, various anime characters, League of Legends characters, items that break the game, items that [b] break[/b] the game, an arena gamemode where you fight monsters to get items then fight your friends, and even [i] breaking the 4 player limit on multiplayer [/i]. The modding community seems incredibly dedicated to this game, and I can;t blame them at all.

If you're concerned that you won't be able to get your money's worth from this game, I got my money's worth from the base game alone and the amount of mods that exist eclipse the base game's content tenfold. I can't recommend this game enough, both as a solo experience to chill out and de-stress after a long day as well as with a full lobby of friends on a Friday night. 10/10 would 100% complete again."
4503,Theres so many things i could say about this game but id be here all day if i tried to say them all. id never heard of this game until a friend told me about it and after a bit of convincing i finally got it and at first i had no idea what was going on but the controls felt amazing. i kept dying over and over but every time i died i wanted to get back in and discover more. this game is hard but very rewarding once you git gud and figure out how to do so. fun single player and fun with friends. Risk of Rain 2 has become one of my favorite games of all time and i just cant stop playing it. if you havent gotten this game yet what are you doing get it play it now. oh and engineer sucks lol
4504,"best game. no cap.
"
4505,yeah I beat the game
4506,"What I like most about this game is the shear amount of unlocks, hidden areas, and characters that it offers.  Always seems like there is something else to do... being playing for 26 hours and I've only unlocked 39% of the achievements; which typically are tied to new items and/or new moves for characters."
4507,very fun
4508,good game
4509,IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS GET THIS GAME AND FORCE THEM TO PLAY WITH YOU THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME AND NOT THE HARDEST TO PLAY
4510,Please Add Sex In Game!!!!!! Only Downside!! The Devs Dont Lissten I WAnnts Sex For Years!
4511,"Clearly, you don't own an air fryer"
4512,"Doesn't respect your time. I am a ""filthy casual"" indeed, and the new heroes and abilities you can unlock between runs ask for  obnoxious challenges like ""get a killing blow with a sniper shot ability 15 times in a row"" but also is basically impossible to do when playing with friends because either they may steal it accidentally, or their AI non-disableable gunner drones will steal it. AND it doesn't show health bar numbers, so you have to GUESS if it will be a killing blow. So there's actually another prerequisite to the unlock for most players: 

Memorize the game like the back of ur hand. boooooooooringgggg.

Within 2 hrs of gameplay, you will have seen almost all of the game and have already been annoyed if playing coop that it was not designed well for 4 players, ESPECIALLY with randoms.
Don't get me wrong, it caters to the playerbase that OVERWHELMINGLY plays solo or just with 1 other friend with voice chat, but casually in lobbies, there are glaring oversights that aren't profitable to fix.
If you are a filthy casual, this game is not designed for you.

*and after getting your settings right, picking an initial hero, doing 2-3 runs, and probably reading a wiki page to figure out how the heck the game works (insufficient tutorials), your refund will no longer be available (2hrs of playtime)*"

4534,"Multiple game ending glitches that will end your runs. not fun at all. Poor mechanics. Also, the last level in this game is so incredibly boring its unreal, with the most boring slow boss fight. Its insane how poorly designed the last level is."
4535,"really fun , visual good , music good , lots of mad shit worth the money"
4536,"Void items
"
4537,"I played for 2 hours and rarely got past the first level. Once I switched the difficulty down to easy I got to the second level, but thats it. During my playtime I never felt like I was doing anything right, always felt like I was just barely surviving. I watched beginner's tips videos and got tips like ""Jump more"", and ""Always move"". I never had any real fun.

Game is very fast paced, somewhat stressful to play. No way to save progress, you must complete the run start to finish without stopping, only to pause. Not good for dad gamers like me.

If I am doing something wrong here, let me know."

4548,"I am a 78 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I enjoyed risk of rain 1 but I do not enjoy this game and only really play it with friends. I also only ever play huntress because I can hardly tell what is friend or foe.

4699,"I still die every time, even on the easiest mode, but it won't stop me from playing because this game is incredibly fun. People might say that you're not a ""true gamer"" if you play on easy mode, but don't let anybody stop you from having fun :)"
4700,had to wear a raincoat just to play this
4701,"Its an excellent game to kill some time. With successful runs lasting anywhere from 30 mins until you're just bored of your run. You can see yourself getting better at the game the more you play it and the skill ceiling is fairly high if you choose to jump into the Eclipse runs. All the survivors feel unique and have their own fun play styles. The game is mod friendly for a few QoL changes, so any negatives I have about the base game can be solved with those. The DLC also adds enough content to the game where its worth the purchase."

4706,its fun
4707,"I am a 56-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Risk of Rain. I am a single father to my son, who is now 15. My son recently started playing Risk of Rain. In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing Risk of Rain. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. Risk of Rain reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."
4708,mm yes good
4709,i hate rouge likes but i have put 43 hours in this game and i plan to keep going until i have all trophies and then ill go some more . its amazing
4710,This is the only 3d rougelike game ive ever played and I love it. When I am able to one shot bosses the rougelike has done its job. Nice amounts of items. good replayability. good game
4711,it is very fun
4712,its like cod zombies with waves but done way better like way way better
4713,it has cock
4714,"A breath of fresh air from many games on the market today. It's not a railroading type story that forces you down it's path in order to do anything, nor is is a frustrating multiplayer that has a steep learning curve in order to just feel decent. Overall, one of the best games I've picked up recently, and I'm hoping to boost my hours and enjoy this game for as long as possible"

4730,"wake up honey, its time to slay [b] [i] god [/i] [/b]"
4731,Overall its fun but the first few times I tried playing it was pretty confusing finding a server to join randomly. Honestly I would recommend playing solo or with friends rather than on a random multiplayer server. I will say that while playing anytime our run time went over 45 minutes we would start to have desync issues until someone would disconnect meaning that some runs would be going great then you would crash with no way to rejoin the person as far as we can tell. DLC is fun but not necessary as everyone can play the content (but not the characters) as long as 1 person in the lobby has it. Overall 8.5/10
4732,I think the game is really fun with friends!

4737,"It takes some time getting used to all the options available to you; it can definitely be overwhelming when you first start. After a bit of time and some experience built up, you'll see just how much the game has to offer in replay value. Runs will always be different, but still feel familiar. The areas are creative, the music is phenomenal, and the visual design is iconic.
Get some friends together for the most entertainment. The game is definitely worth full price, but if you're tight on money, waiting for a sale is just as good."

4750,Great Game Its So Fun To Pass The Time
4751,"Risk of Rain 2 is a beautiful game with near infinite replay ability.

Risk of Rain 2 (ROR2) is one of the only games i own that i truly believe i could play forever and still find new things to do and enjoy it every time and additionally one of the only games with a that soundtrack i could also listen to forever.

The game features a large and varied array of items, each of which feels unique , even when having similar effects. This huge amount of items allows for an absolutely mind boggling amount of combinations and subsequently a massive amount of different builds. Every item feels like it has some amount of usefulness, be it some more than others, however each item has its place. For example the great and holy bungus (Bustling Fungus) emits a healing aura upon standing still for a short time, due to how the game requires you to be constantly on the move this usually sucks. HOWEVER the bungus is absolutely insane on the engineer class due to its interaction with the engineers stationery turrets.

Not only do the items feel varied but the characters aswell. Each character feels and plays completely differently which only furthers the replayability. One run you could be machine gunning people down with Mul-T and his nailguns whilst another run you could be swinging around the entire map in a singular second only to punch the teleporter boss so hard that it dies in a singular shot with loader. Not only do the characters feel varied from eachother but every character features multiple skills to choose from which can drastically change how you play, such as mercenary who can go from a full melee to what is essentially a ranged build.

But arguably the best part of the game is the absolutely jawdroppingly good sound track that accompanies the game. The composer (Chris Christodoulou) is an absolute musical genius. I still remember being thrown into the sundered grove my first time since its new theme track and looking upon this beautiful green mushroomy forest which was slowly beginning to full up with enemies, i remember farming up some gold, opening the red chest and getting the brilliant behemoth. And then the big drop hit and i can still clearly remember the feeling i had as i had an absolute euphoric feeling as i exploded my enemies into oblivion missiles flying everywhere all while being serenaded by Chris's sweet sweet soundtrack. I genuinely cannot stress enough how good the soundtrack is.

Overall ROR2 is one of if not the best games I have ever played that constantly keeps me coming back for the wonderful gameplay, and if not the gameplay for sure the music.

10/10 Engineer supremacy

PS: the song i mentioned earlier is titled ""They Might As Well Be Dead"" go check it out on youtube if you wanna hear it and sub to Chris while you're at it."

4816,"Yea, it's really good.  A cool spin on the rogue-like genre.  It is insanely addictive.  Also super easy to pick up and learn.  Kill stuff, get money, buy crates for upgrades, find portal, repeat.  Those are the bones.  There is a ton of other stuff sprinkled throughout, but the learning curve is easy.  10/10 for what it set out to be."

The only problem is that the multiplayer is super glitchy.  It's very common to get kicked out of a lobby.  My friend and I had a 2 hour game going, finally about to get the 20 stage achievement, I got kicked from the lobby, and he got it, and I didn't.  The game is fun, but the multiplayer definitely needs to be fixed."

Very repetitive, grindy (not in a good way that feels rewarding either!), limited customization (can't even change the color palettes of characters?), builds are completely random without unlocks and end game is unlocking new characters or an additional ability for preexisting one so you can do it all over again? Not to mention game breaking bugs that have been present since release (portals spawning inside terrain).
No thanks!"

4873,it's good
4874,Fun
4875,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, the difficulty scaling makes sure it stays engaging throughout your runs, the art style is great, and it has an awesome soundtrack. Definitely a 10/10!"
4876,captain is hunky
4877,"For people unfamiliar with the genre, I would consider this to be a similar vibe to COD zombies such that its about running away from constantly spawning hordes of monsters while killing them. The difficulty increases over time, the monsters and their abilities vary, the characters and their abilities vary, and the items/upgrades obtained each run vary to an extent giving a wide variety of potential experiences."
4878,it kinda pog ngl
4879,play this game or you don't know what is good in life
4880,good game
4881,shoot pests = win :')

That is both a suggestion and a warning."
4885,Nice
4886,captain
4887,addicting.
4888,I'm in love with this.
4889,This game has really come a long way. This dev team really cares about the quality of this game and adds great content. I am a huge fan of RoR1 and RoR2 isn't quite the same but it still lives up to its roots. I would highly recommend this game because it's just so fun to go for achievements and has a ton of playability. Hopoo and Gearbox are awesome!
4890,Good fun
4891,Bungus
4892,There is no rain
4893,"This game is extremely fun, and difficult at times. You will die... A lot. 
There are tons of cool mods too. My favourite one so far is the Metal Gear Rising OST mod."
4894,RAIN ON ME
4895,The game constantly sends hordes of monsters without any possibility to pause to check the inventory. There is no in-game description of items collected so far. The whole experience is just constantly running and shooting and just hoping that collected items are good. This lack of control annoys quite a lot.
4896,"Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend
-Theophrastus"
4897,well kinda good and kinda bored a little bit cuz no friend playing this game :(
4898,funny
4899,"Very fun game, for a roguelike t's got the right balance of RNG for the difficulty curve. Runs can consistently engage you for more than an hour and you'll look like you just ran an overpowered electromagnet through New York city before being absolutely pummeled into the ground if you forget to tread lightly."
4900,Good game
4901,"Played a bit, was fun, no rain though."
4902,Time goes fast while playing this game. I want my 22 hours back.

The devs of this game have made a masterpiece of a game and you would be making a mistake if you did not give this game a try (if you enjoy Roguelikes/roguelites like: The binding of isaac, Enter the gungeon etc etc)."

4944,"I am not a roguelite/roguelike/whatever person.

This game is incredible. It goes all the way from ""I'm alone in a scary world and everything wants to kill me"" to ""I just spawned into a new level and everything dies when I look at it"" over the span of an hour-long run.

RIsk of Rain 2 is a fantastic game and even after the several hours I have played in it, it has never gotten stale."
4945,"Very fun solo or with friends and the arcade style of progression is killer. I honestly haven't had this much fun playing a game in a while. I'm still relatively new to it but my only qualm is that runs can take awhile (I've been averaging around an hour) so I only get to play 1-3 runs a day. Highly recommend though, this game is incredibly fun!"

4953,Wasn't expecting to like this game. Some friends of mine told me to get it so we could all play together so I said sure why not. Started playing it and I actually really liked it. It's super fun and it's not just a mindless shooting game cause you have more things to do. I love this game and you may think you won't like it but it surprised me so I say it's worth a try.
4954,It's pretty good I guess
4955,This game is actually super fun I’m not even gonna lie
4956,this game is not fun. do not buy

4969,"Not too big on rougelikes but damn dude, this is a great game. Just all around super fun too play. 100% worth the $20 plus the DLC. Both the multiplayer and single player are great. Please give this game a try!"

4975,so god damn pog
4976,"This should be the perfect game for me. It has the perfect mechanics that I prefer - I like the elements of chance combined with skill. It has a rich backstory and 3-dimensional characters. It's a point-and-click adventure with a large degree of autonomy. You are able to choose your own motivation, and play your character the way you'd like to. There is real humor, and you can choose how far to take the humor. You can choose to waste your time reading small minutia, or skip through it. Your character feels like a real person, with real struggles, and real decisions to make. Add to that a mystery in a science-fiction setting, and, in theory, I should be writing a rave review right now.

Here's my problem - it's very, very emotionally dark, to the point where it's affecting my mindset. At 16.3 hours, I'm about 25% through my first playthrough. I've had about 3 or 4 sessions of play - every time I stop playing for the day, I just feel empty and lonely. And, to an extent, I think much of the darkness is necessary for the subject matter - the mystery you try to solve just serves as a backdrop for the psychological landscape of struggling with addiction, amnesia, and discovering who your character is and who he wants to become. There are certainly bright spots - the humor, and crossing things off your task list. But everything - every mystery, every thought, every interaction - is anchored in the fact your character is a very broken man in a very broken world.

Now, I'm a highly empathetic person, fighting my own battles with depression to begin with. In all likelihood, and based on the raving reviews, I'm an outlier. It would probably help if I didn't keep playing for an hour longer than I intend to each time just trying to find a bit of sunshine for my character, and accept that I might just need to be patient and play through to the end. However, I think the strength of the game is the downfall here - I'm making decisions on when to tackle tasks, therefore the developer couldn't add bright spots to help with pacing. And pacing seems to be the main criticism of many of the other reviews. Maybe the emotional darkness would be easier to handle if the artwork was a little less gritty, but again, that kind of goes with the subject matter.

I really, really wish I could love this game. I really tried to love this game. I will likely try in the future to love this game. But right now, if only to warn someone else fighting their own battles that right now may not be the time to play this game, I cannot recommend it."
4977,very very fun game to play with friends never ends so much fun
4978,haha polyute go PTPTPPTPTPTPTPTPPTPTPTPPTPTPTPT
4979,"I'm a little late to the Risk of Rain 2 praise train, but nonetheless I made it on board and what else can I say. The game is amazing. The character design: fabulous, the maps: beautiful, the music: to die for. Everything about this game is just an upscale of the original. There literally is a little something for everyone here. 

My favorite part about the game is its replay value. There are so many different characters to choose from, all with their own special niche. There is a stealth hunter, long range sniper, well rounded commando, engineers, and much more. Within those characters there are even different loadouts, offering a variety of ways to play your favorite character. If you've been sitting on this game waiting to buy or play, get up right now and do yourself a favor and add it to the cart."
4980,Pew pew. 10/10
4981,NOT ENOUGH RAIN!!!! Thought i was going to fight rain but the game title is very misleading. played 12 hours hoping there might be some rain to fight but there isn't.

I think the only problem i have is that some of the characters you can play as just aren't up to par with others. But maybe that's just me and i'm just naturally better with specific characters.

On PC version people use mods to allow up to 16 players in a game and all sorts of interesting stuff. My only gripe would be that the void expansion is not on switch version. Replay ability gets a 5/10 stars but it is worth it either way in my opinion, neat fun game you are meant to play over and over from scratch essentially. But tons of unlocks\challenges\achievements as you progress."
5080,"I only played for 3 hours so far, please don't hurt me"

Single Player is good, but find friends to play multiplayer. Also, modding is cool and is easy to do + has a good community."
5082,is good

But great to play on PC and Steam Deck. The graphics are low key so should run on anything just about. Physics are great, decent audio and runs smooth. Can't ask for much more."

5091,you can have drugs
5092,"This game is fun and is highly replayable. I like how each character has specific goals you must do to unlock them, they aren't hard at all, just takes some exploration. And they all have their own feel! And the perks you can stack are so dope and adds even more flavor to the game. The enemies are all diverse and I like how new ones are gradually introduced as the difficulty increases. The environments are fun and diverse, and don't even get me started on the music, which is a masterpiece and should never be muted. Highly recommend this game, it's fun alone, even more so with friends. Buy this for yourself and as a gift to a friend."
5093,
5094,I can give mercenary big tits so overall pretty good game tbh
5095,"Everyone likes Binding of Isaac this is just that, but third person and in space with alien monsters, farm power ups, go from world to world killing aliens and monsters, gathering unique perks, unlock secrets and achievements along the way with endless replay value, honestly the game is a steal when its on sale, and totally worth full price, its not often i get too immersed in roguelites as i find them a bit boring, but this one is something special, just ask the community."

5114,"This game is a wonderful masterpiece. Easy to learn, fun to play, and any success is greatly rewarded."
5115,i love the develeper and the trailers pretty good
5116,"OVERALL: 8/10

PROS:
ROR2 is close to a masterpiece. It's a blast to play with friends or by yourself with loads of content to unlock, even if you only buy the core game without DLC. Even after burning out on this game, coming back after a few months is like a breath of fresh air. It's an easy to learn, but hard to master game that requires memorizing items and locations of certain shrines. Every character interacts differently with each item/equipment, so you need to familiarize yourself with these things to maximize each survivor's potential. The need to stay on your toes and make quick decisions is crucial to being good at this game.

CONS:
Depending on your system, you will most likely end up crashing the game at some points. It's good practice that after wave 10+ to lower your settings a little bit. The music is fantastic, but it does get repetitive after the first few hours. Hopoo Games doesn't update the game very often these days, so if you're use to games that have new content coming out every month you'll be disappointed. Lastly, if you're with other players and you end up dying later in the game, it is very difficult to catch up with other players in terms of items."

Fast-paced with lots of enemies, dakka, and upgrades, you'll find yourself constantly on the move to reach your endgoal, stopping for a brief moment can be your end in this game. Even more fun when played with friends.

 don't have any bad words to say about it."
5177,its good
5178,Amazing game with great gameplay and endless replayability
5179,"It is a rare instance that a games sequel manages to improve on its predecessor in every manner. In the days of low-effort sequels and crap reboots, a game that follows up on what came before and improves it is a welcome breath of fresh air.

What is even rarer is a game that manages to change visual mediums entirely, from 2D to 3D and yet somehow manages to maintain the art style, game play, and atmosphere of the original game.

Risk of Rain was clearly a labor of love, and Risk of Rain 2 is as well. The music is fantastic, the visuals are stylistic and beautiful to look at, the characters provide a wide range of unique play-styles to choose from. The Rogue-like formula works well with the generated items to make each run feel fresh and unique even on the same character. The secrets, minigames, and puzzles encourage repeated exploration and working with friends is a real treat. 

This game deserves to be played and appreciated for what it is, and it is absolutely worth your time."
5180,The only game I can carry suwi for some reason. I'm pretty sure soon I'll get carried by him just like tf2 and phasmophobia
5181,"When playing alone, this game is great!

when playing with friends who only play Rail-gunner this game is c u r s e d and  u n f a i r .

Enjoy!"
5182,Wungus over bungus
5183,"Risk of Rain 2 is an absolute banger of a game

Rouge like games have always been my favorite types of games to play and this one nailed it. Risk of Rain 2 is a rogue-like where you find items that make you stronger in both obvious and unpredictable ways as you run through plenty of stages until you meet the final boss. This game has lots of ways to play and every survivor has it's own wildly different playstyle. Some are instant killing machines while others use their own health to destroy enemies. 1 run will never be the same as long as you try something new or choose artifacts to spice up the run even so, this game gives you all the freedom to run wild.

This game has a incredible OST and pretty vivid and nice to look at art style. There are tons of skills and abilities to try out and a HUGE amount of items to test out. Runs that go well can branch off in wildly different directions, where items twist character abilities into novel new uses. One item might sound awful on one character but godlike on another. The vast number of enemies, items, and abilities make for an endlessly replayable experience. Risk of Rain 2 isn't worried about giving you OP abilities because it knows that eventually, the difficulty level ticks up and up the longer you play until it reaches the infinitely scaling challenge.

There are dozens of hours of content available, and achieving godlike builds is unimaginably fun in a 3D environment. The adjustable difficulty, while not perfect, makes the game nice for new players and veterans. Risk of Rain 2 doesn't evolve the roguelike genre, but it does iterate on it in a exceptional way.

My only gripe with this game is that as every character has a different playstyle, there's a chance you won't unlock your unknown favorite character for a long time. So you have to have the patience to play the characters you don't like and possibly waste a few runs trying to unlock characters and you will possibly quit before that. 

Some tips from my experiences 

Some items can brutally detrimental, but you'll learn what to avoid with experience. Stay away from lunar items if your trying to have a good run. Then afterwards you can mess around with them eventually you will know what is good to use.

Try to do more runs without the Artifact of Command. This artifact can be quite fun at times and can be useful for that ""perfect build"" but remember that this a rougelike game and taking away that rng makes the game pretty boring being able to choose the best items all the time. Remember that printers and scrapper exist. 

In multiplayer, you should not grab every item you can. Leave some for your teammates. Otherwise they die easily, which kills the fun for them and makes it harder for you. Checking on your teammates item count is as easy as pressing Tab.

Time is the biggest variable to literally everything. Almost every aspect of the game that scales at all, scales heavily with time. Sometimes it can be better to just move on instead of spending 10 minutes getting every single chest on each level. You should be spending no more than 5 minutes per stage in stages 1-3.

That's about all Risk of Rain 2 is a brilliant rougelike game and remember to keep moving."
5184,its fun
5185,Great 3rd person rogue like with a nice variety of items and very replay-able 9.5/10
5186,good game i enjoy
5187,very fun multiplayer game

5189,Haha war crimes go brrr in this game
5190,simply amazing
5191,"I'm not super big into the roguelike genre yet but it doesn't play like dead cells or other harder ones. I feel like it's more fun, easier to pick up, and just different in a few ways that makes me like it a lot. 9/10 game would recommend buying on sale or something if you are unsure."
5192,"Something I can say is that I've never really been into rougelike games, so when I bought this game, I really was expecting to play it for about a week and drop it, but this game just absolutely grabbed me by the neck and it dragged me deep down into the pits of my very own room and I ended up playing this game exclusively for around a month. I would happily do it again, and again, and again, and again. I have yet to even do most of this game yet, I feel like I've only dug to the surface, and I'm happy with trying to dig at it. This game is highly addictive and super fun, especially with friends, I say that you shouldn't automatically get the DLC, it's really good, but it's really just for people who want more of the same, which is amazing. All I can say is that this game has a godly OST, ALMOST (Cough cough Rex) all of the characters are fun and memorable, and if this game ever gets boring, you can count on artifacts and Eclipse mode to help make it EVEN more enjoyable. (Well if you're a masochist anyway.)"

5205,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

This review is coming out after Roe V Wade has been overturned by retarded fascists. The next thing they plan to do is overturn is Gerrymandering laws, and gay discrimination laws. If you gamers think you're safe, you've been enabling these Christian fascists this whole time. They will come after us, I'm right, I always am. Gaming will be made illegal because they'll always quote false data, unscientific measures, and they won't even read their own fucking bible. If you are christian and not a fascist, I'd be weary now of what other Christians will do to you, especially those who are in power and don't know simple descriptions like ""mammon."" Remember that Gnosticism is great and understanding these fucking dumb shits.

[h1] Schizoposting out of the way [/h1]
Risk of Rain 2 should be on your soon to be last list of games you play. Why last? Gaming is going to be criminal. And you will have to use the skills you learn in this game, to Joker, minecraft, gaslight, gatekeep, and girlboss your way through the horrible wasteland that will be the USA. Congrats friends of not America, you will be saved from the light as the United States, accidentally trips itself ass backwards into permanently stopping Fascism, like Lelouch Lamperouge. In a cruel dystopian reflection of the real world, RoR2 is about something similar. Stopping theocracies. And in that measure this game is based, and may one day be used as a citation by neofacists to try and rewrite history. Asserting that, the plane this game takes on was better off when Mithrix and Voidling were in power. A BOLD FACE LIE if I ever done did see one. So what is the story then of RoR2? Complicated. As it takes place with many characters, starting off with Johnmando. Who lands on the planet after the ship his crew was on is attacked and destroyed by Providence a God like entity. After many heroic fights, Johnmando, Johnforcer, Jondit, Jontress, Han-Deeze Nuts, Jongineer, Jiner, Johnper, Good Dog, Johncenary, Sigorney Weaver, Jeff, and Heretic work together to kill Providence. However, their attempts to escape fail, and only Johnmando, Good Dog, Heretic, and one other survivor (Your characters) survive. This is spoilers from the first game, and if you're reading a review for the second game, instead of first beating the first game, I want no complaints from your dumb ass, I'll spoil the section where we are at present then. Speaking of which. [spoiler] Johnmando is captured by void infesters and becomes the John Fiend, Good Doggo spends time in puppy jail but escapes, Heretic wills herself back to life as a ghost embodying relics, and the other survivor presumably heads back to earth, and gathers a new force of heroes to try and save those left behind, and stop Mithrix's influence. Upon arriving the team are tricked into dropping onto the planet, and their ship captured by Mithrix. It is up to the team, and you to fight off the barbarous natives, who are less equipped than you. At your disposal you have much more advanced technology, chemical warfare, weapons probably banned by the Geneva convention, and literal fucking magic. Rescuing the already captured John Fiend, Good Doggo, Heretic, Biolantine, and Johnificer the team is completed. A team of soldiers must find all the survivors, kill Mithrix, and spread Manifest Destiny. The rescue team in question includes Johndit, Captain John, Johnmando, Johngineer, Jontress, Sigourney Weaver, Johncenary, Mul-T DEEZ NUTZ and Johngunner. However, the longer they stay, on the planet the stronger Mithrix's influence over the planet becomes, with Providence already out of the way, the storm approaches, starting merely at a drizzle, becoming a rain storm, and before too long a monsoon. As Mithrix's power and influence increase, so too does his will, his creations, and the risk of rain. [/spoiler] Nice...

[h1] Okay the Real Review [/h1]

The music in this fucking game rocks my socks, it's a great synthwave pattern, that increases as the game moves further into its eclipse. The controls are smoove af, and the best part is how broken the game can become. Protip movement speed is amazing, especially if you're going so fast that your collision can kill enemies. It can be frustrating especially when playing by yourself, but with friends, this game is always just several hours of fun. Sometimes the goal isn't even to beat the run, just get a broken build, and laugh about it until Mithrix's Monsoon drenches everything in anti healing enemies, and then you die. One of my favorite bits, is the fact that achievements are tied to certain big unlocks. You get an achievement, and that achievement unlocks you an item or an ability, or maybe even an alternate skin. This is where the game shines, to me at least. It really feels good when you go out of your way, get an achievement, and then that point forward you may receive the boon of said achievement in game. More games should do it, and it made this game fun all the way through.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]

I highly recommend this game, it's fun, its fast paced, it can be picked up, and put down whenever (kinda like the family dog). It's got great music, a bunch of different game-play options, and some really awesome multiplayer dedication. But most importantly. It's got a beautifully dedicated team working on it, that regularly update, check on what players feedback is, get ideas to implement, and know how not just to make but how to maintain a game."
5209,it's fucking adactive when u start playing
5210,This game is so goddamn fun
5211,If you have 50 hours to spend researching the game and dying then you might enjoy it. If you want to pick up something and have fun quickly this is not the right game. And while you're trying to figure out mechanics/map/controls/etc you are actively being punished for exploring.

5220,"Risk of Rain 2 is a very fantastic game, from the characters, gameplay, music and even more. The game defiantly has a lot of love put into it. The best part of this game though is enjoying it with friends, I've had my fair share of extremely odd deaths but my friends and I shrugged em off with some laughs. The game also features some of the best ways to stack items ever, of course your opponents get stronger too if you aren't careful...

Next is the DLC which adds two really fun characters and the corrupted items which add another layer of depth to the game. And all the other goodies that come with it.

The game even has the prismatic trials to show off your skills, the simulacrum which acts like a horde mode, and even harder difficulties with the eclipse mode, which has occupied a lot of me and my friends time these days with the game.

Now what I dislike, which is such a small small list. 

Co-op deaths. I wish there was a system or a way to revive your allies while on a floor, becasue if you die early on your friends either have to feed you items next floor, or they have to rush the floor and leave immediately before the game gets too hard for the next floor. Personally this doesn't really frustrate me but it's there.

Overall very fun game, when friends ask if I'd recommend this game, I'd say yes in a heartbeat.

If you plan at all on playing this with friends then just know there is a major desync glitch that will ruin your games.

5242,"This game solo or with friends is pure brilliance! Massive variety of characters with different abilities and endless items giving you different buffs! The game is all about lasting, lasting as long as you can, that's providing you've defeated all bosses and unlocked all artifacts.

I do have a quarm with this game however.

Every. Single. Damn. Game that me and the boys play, the servers shit out at around 110 mins, no matter who is hosting the game. It's a really frustrating issue and has made us not want to play it together anymore which is the reason why most of us bought it.

Please. Game devs. Look into this server issue. It needs to be stable! We could go for 10 hours straight!"
5243,The rain sure is risky in this one.
5244,"Best rogue-like ever made, solo or coop, both are fantastic."
5245,it is very fun hard to stop playing

Also no offence but the music sucks"

5248,"There's something truly special about this game. At about 90 hours now and it's easily one of the best purchases I've ever made, so much so that I bought it a second time on the Switch. That fact that it's only £20 is a steal, I would have happily paid £50 for this game.

Quick rundown: it's an action/roguelike with the aim of murdering everything to become more powerful, in an attempt to murder stronger things. You pick up items which can do anything from increase your attack speed and health, to making ever attack explode or being able to crush everything in the area by jumping. A multitude of enemies (and variations on those enemies), bosses, items and levels all of which are beautifully handcrafted and accompanied by a gorgeous soundtrack. The developers have put a lot of work into making this game something special and polished. This is a far better experience than the vast majority of AAA games at the moment and it really shows."

The characters are all unique and all the secrets definitely motivate you to continue exploring, especially when you discover something new in a place you've been tens of times."
5259,"The game is simple in its base objectives, yet the different characters, their different loadouts and various items introduce a lot of variance in the way the objectives may be accomplished. Each character can be played in multiple different ways and have enough depth that spending time to master them feels worthwhile. Good job Hopoo. :)"

5283,"I enjoy this game but I warn newcomers that this game is grueling to learn sometimes it's only fun when you know what you're doing. This game does a garbage job at explaining what you should be doing to progress sometimes. It barely explains what certain items do before grabbing them, sometimes the game bugs out and the teleporters vanish, and don't even get me started on the final level! I had an amazing run, dominating every enemy, boss, challenge, and even the final boss was a cake walk but in the end my run died because it didn't tell me how to leave the boss area at the end which ended up killing me when the countdown stopped. I will continue to enjoy this game but again newcomers should be prepared for some layers of BS from time to time as well as some run killing glitches or confusion."

5294,"Ok, so I love this game, because it always is able to tread that line of same old same old and new, and in fact even now I'm still seeing new enemies and bosses, or finding nooks and crannies I wasn't aware of. I first found this game through youtube, and immediately fell in love. The mechanics of this game can make the beginning runs a bit tricky, but the good news is that you can make those mechanics work for you, and very often, as long as you can survive the first level, you are pretty much golden. What this roguelike does a bit differently is that itis forgiving, without being forgiving. You can make it so that you choose all items and are rained upon by them, but the moment you get cocky? That's when you get your shit pushed in and die faster than you can process. There aren't too many different characters, but each character ends up playing vastly different from each other, and if you find that you don't quite like any of them, even with DLC (which I also recommend)? Then that's fine, because the modding scene for this game is huge and frankly quite easy to understand, so you can add as many characters,bosses,enemies, and items as your heart desires. As a final thing, I think ScottFalco said it well when he said that this game goes at your pace, and you choose when it ends.

TL:DR- Its a fucking masterpiece"

I can't remember being this into a game since like Skyrim came out. As you gather more and more items you slowly become extremely overpowered. In any other game, this would become boring, but somehow, in this game, that's exactly where the fun is. You can melt enemies but there's so many it still feels extremely well balanced. It's a game that somehow feels both easy and difficult at the same time in the most fun and satisfying way. There are so many hidden secrets in the game, and all the different playable survivors feel incredibly unique. Gameplay is incredibly smooth and natural feeling for all the survivors. There's a survivor meant for everyone's play style.

This game is a goddamned masterpiece and honestly triple-A studios need to be looking here for where the future of gaming needs to go (343, EA, Blizzard, Bethesda, looking at you guys). I've gifted it + the DLC to my cousin and a friend already."
5302,Checkin into rehab rn
5303,It's good.
5304,"Absolutely Amazing!!! Every hour is sure to have so much fun packed in it. Great diversity, still getting updated, and great modding support. If you want even more fun, I recommend the survivors of the void DLC. The cost is so worth it, 2 new characters, a new tier level of items, and more! I hope this helped, download if you like rouge-lites/likes, dungeon crawlers, 
 and/or third-person shooters. With a sprinkle of a late game god complex."
5305,...and his music was electric.
5306,good
5307,ngl rain pretty risky
5308,fun game there was a high risk of rain
5309,my brother had this game and thought it was crap then he convinced me to get it and now i can't stop playing
5310,Very pogg champ
5311,horny and scared of hammer man
5312,It's pretty good dude.
5313,Great game
5314,good
5315,goku.
5316,very cool
5317,YES
5318,"35 hours in and I feel like I'm just getting started. 

I've only got half the characters unlocked; maybe only 2/3 the items and enemies recorded. 

The characters are hard to explain. Each one genuinely has their own identity and play style. The first time playing each character feels a bit laborous once you've got some time with a different one; but after giving each and every character a legitimate chance, you soon realize that each and every class is genuinely fun to play in each their own way. 

Each have pro's and cons, and each have their way's of managing the cons. This game was well worth the purchase. I bought 2 more copies, one for my wife and son to join in on the fun. We all absolutely love it.

I got it on sale; but knowing what I know now, I'd of happily bought at full price!"
5319,weirdly addicting
5320,gam
5321,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
5322,"Is it fun? Yes.
Do I recommend it? Certainly.

Unfortunately, after almost 30 hours of gameplay, I can confirm that this game doesn't have the same replayability as most other games sharing the label ""rogue-like"". Items do not offer as much synergies as I hoped they'd do and you end up always seeking the same few items in order to make your class OP.
The item pool itself is also very limited and only a very few items change the way you play throughout the game. Most are just there to make you do whatever you were doing already, but with more dps."
5323,"In depth, fun game with no limit to fun or play time."
5324,Very addicting I recommend!!
5325,"Great game, but ever since they added the storyline cutscenes, playing the game bluescreen-o-death's my PC."
5326,SO GOOD! GET IT!
5327,very good game so far and very fun with friends. it is annoying at the start but it gets very good
5328,Fun.

5340,"10 worlds, 10+ characters with different playstyles; you will find at least a couple you will vibe with. Chris' soundtrack elevates your experience to a whole new level. Great replayability. Thank you for this gem, Hopoos!"

5377,"Wasted hours in the effort of hoarding house hold items, military grade tecnology and eldrich horros that for some reason give me special abilities only to die without realizing why.

Best time of my life, get it now, my dopamine receptors are burnt now and i would burnt them again."

5390,"Probably one of the only rogue-like games I've played that I keep coming back to. The gameplay is great, every class has a unique playstyle, the learning curve didn't feel too steep, and good lord the music might be the greatest part of this game with it being perfectly timed for what's happening in a stage."
5391,"risked it.

got rain.

10/10 would play again."
5392,"Fun, thank you friend who bought this for me."
5393,game funni
5394,"A great rogue-like survival game. Much better than I thought it would be. Great when played solo, and even better with friends. There is no risk of rain in this game. Only the risk of being overpowered by the native monsters who don't like you."

5413,gam gud
5414,"It's very easy to pick up, and controls are very minimal which is sooo helpful.

Give it a spin! Easy to understand"
5415,"New update introduces some fun new items and numerous irritating mechanics. Ex: void bubbles: are unclear on what makes them go away (kill enemies? interact with baubles?) - end boss now makes you jump through bright orbs that look very similar to damaging balls.. just a lot of stuff that feels like ""oops! you didn't look at the wiki! get owned!"""
5416,"This game is phenomenal single player and with friends. The games mechanics never feel unfair and can be worked around. The time it to learn what what each item does to your character takes a while and the fact that most of the item descriptions Mid-game don't give you the percentages.
My one VERY major complaint is someone disconnecting from the game becomes common after about an hour of play and you or your friends can rejoin. Its a big problem but it doesn't ruin the game it just is rather annoying."
5417,fun challenges if you're into that but super casual time burner if you dont like to think while you game

5424,perchance droplets of water will fall from the sky 2: electric boogaloo
5425,"I really like the game.  It's awesome when it works, however most of my runs end because it doesn't.  Enemy damage scaling has been off for a while now.  Most runs feel so awesome, only to die in one hit to... well anything.  You never know if it'll be an elite enemy, boss, etc., but it rarely feels fair.  
Yea, you can argue, ""Just don't get hit,"" but when a game is like 30 minutes cmon.
I'd like to see a patch that makes normal mode feel normal again."
5426,"You are weak, then you are a GOD! And then you get weak again and died in one hit. This is the cycle of Risk of Rain 2, you shoot and kill things, then they shoot and kill you."
5427,awesome video game :)
5428,"This is an amazingly fun game.  Working through the different areas, learning a bit about each item, deciding on builds that are not only fun, but easily destroy your enemies, and of course, the challenge when you screw up your build and get obliterated five minutes into a run.  All the characters are interesting and each have their own strengths and weaknesses that different play styles can benefit from.  Just...  make sure you turn off the PvP rune before you go deep into multiplayer.  People can be jerks."
5429,"Side effects may include
1: High anxiety
2: multiple broken objects
3: Sleep deprivation
4: Possible heart attack mid run
For customers who experience the following don't play
1: No arms

5436,"Stellar experience.
Self explanatory game that you can pick up in literally 3 minutes, I know because I brought some friends to play with me and they picked it up immediately. Many of the mechanics translate well from the original.
Love it. Nothing else to say."
5437,Excellent game! Best roguelike I've ever played
5438,Very good and fun <3 Music fucking slaps
5439,I like mushroom :)
5440,plant man kills god
5441,"I didnt know how fun this game would be till i played it . At first it seemed ok but , as you play the game it gets better , harder and a lot more fun! If your playing with friends , this game will keep you up all day and night. I really recommend this game if your a difficulty kinda guy , and loves to adventure ."
5442,"and so he went back to his computer, to play risk of rain 2"
5443,Good :)

5474,Bungus? Bungus.
5475,good game
5476,"Game got LOTS of issues design wise. First there is no automap, and no natural way of look around. Staying on low ground is a continous downside, literally. There are also no indication of enemy except if you catch where the shots comming from, which quickly gets discarded as you get flooded pretty fast (10+ min in game). Pick ups are not as easy to ""pick up"" on, turning off enemy corpses basicly a must less it clutters the field hiding boxes you should pick up. The game has an overal bad visual design when it comes to differentiate betwean stuff and other stuff.

The big ones. There are a lot of attack types from enemies that are locked on to you. While they have a minimal visual qeuee when it actually lands, from other visual clutter these become untracable. Further more there are attack types that shows on the ground, but thats the last place youll looking at as most enemies taller then you and you generally look upwards as flying enemies are priority due to theire angle of attack cannot be line of sighted.

The next big one is line of sight is okay from bosses, but not continous line of sight, thats a nono. There is never enough cover that could provide a decent moving oprunity while still in cover against boss. If you stay still the random adds will overwhelm you quickly. Also some bosses attack don't have a discerning telegraph, it just spits you from nowhere.

The game very well know its own flaws, hence all the heal options in game, that pretty much dictates if you get enough crap you deal with boss before it chews trough youre deffenses, if not then you done. Game has no skill requirement other then really good 3D navigation skills, and pixel perfect searching eyes to see all the hiden bits and bots scattered on the map.

You pretty much have to learn the map to even have a chance to make a path, and it actually kills exploration at that point as there is a set way of going to places. (story mode, there are random maps, god i dont wanna try those)

It sounds exciting, but no. The whole game feels slow to be honest. The amount of walk around especially after a portal just kills the flow. Some enemies are so slugish and even the fast ones can easilly tracked by mouse.

This game would need to redesigned pretty much in all aspect. Oh the gold gain is horrible, there is almost no qeuee or feedback that you got gold, you just know that you do cuz you killed but thats about it. Even the health to gold statue i used a lot before i noticed i got a text message what happened. 3D printer is random, holy shit its so bad all around, the designers have 0 clue what a game should be.

Btw i dont know how to refund usually its on propertiers but now its not. 86 minutes :/"

    It can be overwhelming to figure out what item does what while beetles, cute jellies, and ancient stone constructs attempt to purge you from existence, yet enjoyable to explore the different possibilities and combinations- and use that to unleash hell. This game offers many different ways to experience it should you choose to change it up. Much to explore.

While I did not expect too much and was initially put off by the idea of the game and the artstyle, I now cannot stop playing it.
Hours fly by and before I know it, I look at the stage timer at 1h+ while it felt like maybe 15 minutes passed.

It's chill and relaxing, especially in the early stages and gets incredibly intense the further you go.
Prepare to die, like a lot but it's part of the game. Everytime you grasp more of the gameplay, the challenges and the mechanics behind it all and with each run you get further, get better, closer to beating the game.

There's also 3 sets of difficulties, with an ""easier"" mode that gives less enemy skaling and more HP regen as well as normal and a ""super mega hard"" (Monsoon) difficulty that basically reverses what the easy one does.
Meanwhile, the further you go and the longer you play a run, the harder the game gets too. More enemies, with more health and abilities leading to downright ludicrous amounts of earlier boss-level enemies as regular mobs.

There is really only 2 ways to end a run, either you die early on or when fighting the main boss, or you loop (essentially deciding not to fight the boss yet and go through a few more levels before) and get to boss-level status where you singlehandedly nuke enemies and bosses from existance mere seconds after spawning.

The game really does let you go crazy if you make it far enough, with each run feeling different, due to the loot and enemies being entirely random. Maps are not procedurally generated as in other rouge-like games, but handmade and feeling immediately familiar while still providing new things to find and new challenges each time.
Items you find give you various stat boosts, from abilities to passive stat boosts like attack speed etc. and you can stack them...a lot!
The game has no problem with you stacking +1000% attack speed or 100% crit chance items letting you experience god-like powers, provided you last long enough to find them.

At last, the lore and exposition is sparse, kinda like the Souls games, with almost everything being cryptic, requiring your imagination and giving you information mostly through what happens (or doesn't) ingame. Stages have secret paths, bosses, puzzles to unknown teleporters and the game has several endings for each run.

Graphically, it's got a sorta unique art-style. I wouldn't call it amazing or realistic but it doesn't want to be that. It's simplistic in nature but works damn well and has its own charme.
Performance is mostly stellar but be warned, if you go crazy and keep the run going long enough there will be so many effects and mobs on screen that it will tank. That's to be expected though with what's going on.

Sound wise, each character has their own movement, ability and weapon sounds that fit them. The music meanwhile is an absolute masterpiece, all handcrafted for the game, ranging from intense rock to downright relaxing tracks, which each stage playing a different song.

As with any rogue-like, when you die, you loose every item and the progression in the levels you had. The one thing you keep is a permanent currency you can use in a sorta hub-world that you can access by opening a portal there. While there, time stands still (aka. the game doesn't progress in difficulty), you can relax and trade items in for others as well as unlock permanent ones that you can then acquire in the runs. There's something more too it but I won't spoil it.

To sum it all up, I really didn't expect to like this but damn, it is such a charming game to play solo or in coop, unlocking new characters and abilities and finding what works for you and trying to ""build"" your character as much as you can with the random loot. If you have any interest in rogue-likes, do yourself a favour and grab this game!
I cannot wait to play more."

5547,"I really tried to enjoy this game, I really did. Unfortunately, you can only slam your head into a brick wall so many times before you realize you aren't getting through. Risk of Rain combines two genres which I love, shooters and roguelikes which makes it all the more confusing that this game fails to impress. 

   - One major problem I noticed was that the combination of these two genres somehow managed not to take only some of the highlights of each genre, but also almost ALL of the lowlights. While many modern shooters are fast-paced with great movement, Risk of Rain somehow manages to feel slow both in pacing and in movement. You often have to choose between being fast and being powerful if you even have a choice.

    - Another major problem is the simple lack of variety in gameplay. Unlike most modern roguelikes, the maps are repeated as opposed to generated meaning that every time you go to a map, it's almost the exact same map as last time. It's much akin to listen to a great music playlist over and over, it's cool the first couple of times but after a while you can't help but feel like you need more variety. 

    - In Risk of Rain, there is almost no critical thinking required. Great roguelikes such as Hades or Enter the Gungeon require players to think logically about whether or not it's worth the risk to get a new item as well as weigh different options to try to get items which synergize well with the items you already have but Risk of Rain is *mostly* absent of these mechanics. If you have the money, open a chest, if you don't, don't. There are a few places where you can decide what you get (outside of Artifact of Command) but these too leave little option in what to get meaning that you can lose (often) due alone to not getting lucky.

Overall, I'm sure a lot of people enjoy Risk of Rain for it's unique characters and gameplay style, but for me it fails to impress. Risk of Rain fails to innovate and somehow manages to capture neither the charm and excitement of roguelikes nor the fun face-paced feel of a shooter. Despite this, I'd say the game is well designed and developed so I wouldn't blame anyone for enjoying it."

5572,"Hopoo has done an amazing job of breathing new life into a game that was already engaging and beautiful. They removed some small aspects of Risk of Rain 1; the climbable ropes and Life Savings, for instance; but the aspects of ROR1 that are totally missing from ROR2 are few and far between, and every single change Hopoo made is well worth it. The environments are completely immersive, the soundtrack is (once again) freaking brilliant, and the enemies (whether they're new or re-imagined) are even more beautiful and badass than what Risk of Rain 1 offers.  I was skeptical of the remake, as I know others have been, but Hopoo absolutely outdid themselves with Risk of Rain 2 and they have only improved what was already wonderful"

5592,"Pretty solid game. Different characters,equipment,bosses,enemies, and so on. About the bad sides: If you play multiplayer you both can get high pings for some reason and thus, makes it unplayable. Secondly, it is unbalanced. I mean, for some bosses you cannot escape the attack they do and get hit by it or die. Lastly, this game depends on LUCK. Which means that depends on your character, you need specific item or equipment for it and you cannot get them every game. You need to be lucky in order to win.

Overall, I'd say it is a good game and I highly recommend it."

5601,"So yeah this game is good. Disclaimer: I do not own the DLC.

Risk of Rain 2 is a perfect sequel to the original Risk of Rain. The original has a great soundtrack, fun and replayable gameplay, an interesting story and an excellent soundtrack. Risk of Rain 2 takes everything from the original and expands on it. More maps, more story, more items, more monsters, more secrets and more survivors. There's very little that Risk of Rain 2 doesn't improve from 1, although my beloved Enforcer is gone, which is sad.

A big selling point is the shift from a 2D platformer/shooter to a 3D combat focused game, which is a real improvement. While combat in the first game is fun, after a while it becomes a game of lining up enemies and positioning. In RoR2, the combat is much more reaction based and you can't see everything, which makes mobility and speed much more important. Unlike the first game, getting better doesn't just involve knowing the best items and survivors, now dodging Golem lasers since you know how to maneuver makes you feel awesome in a way the first game can't and shows the player the improvement they have made.

RoR2 is a ""Roguelike"", but its very free form. Unlike something like Rogue Legacy where content is locked off by progression and death, very little of the game can't be unlocked in a couple of hours, if you have a guide. The only exception being 1 survivor and certain items, which is weird since artifacts that completely change the game can be unlocked in your first run while very good items cannot, but it's not that big a problem.

My advice is to completely ignore everything outside the game, the guides, the speedrun videos, and the crazy 100+ crowbar Huntress videos and focus on playing the game. The game is meant to be a slow burner where heroes come slowly and secrets are obscure and subtle. After you beat the final boss, then find out how to unlock everything else. I think you will be able to appreciate the game more that way. Two thumbs up!"

5668,"Phenomenal game with endless re-playability. It's become a go-to for the last year or so whenever I'd like to pick up a co-op game with a friend. There are so many ways to play this game, many characters to choose from/unlock, and as a result there are endless strategies to discover as you go through each stage. I'll often play with the artifact that allows me to choose items so I can pick my stack of upgrades that is best-suited for the character I selected. But it's also a pleasure to play with the items randomized, as it can yield some interesting upgrade combinations that I wouldn't have thought of!

It's great that you're able to change the game style through the various artifacts that you can unlock - finding a fun combination of them to play with has been a joy. The different game modes are such a nice refresher if you're in the mood to play something slightly different. Each stage in and of themselves have so many secrets to uncover; at times I'll forget about the timer just because I like to explore the stages!

As an aside, the art style of this game is truly a pleasure to look at. It's pretty hilarious that as you obtain new items, they're tacked onto the avatar of the character you're playing. It just feels like a lot of thought went into this game, and I adore it!

I have nothing but great things to say about this one! It is absolutely worth it. :)"

5724,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

This game does not understand replay-ability in the slightest. The rate of mobs/death once you have 3 rows of items is absolutely ridiculous. Instead, it just has these crappy little boring runs that never get any more enjoyable or rewarding. Always ending in the most boring and anti-climatic ways. ""Wow I got 1-shot by some BS out of nowhere"", or ""Wow, I killed the final boss without taking any damage at all"".

It's either way too easy, or ridiculous as hell and you lose all of your hard work instantly with no actual challenge presented. There's not some fight or puzzle that I lose, just needlessly self-exploding suicide mobs that spawned directly behind me silently while I fought the other 250 mobs in front of me, my bad I guess.. not. I honestly tried for so long thinking it was just my mindset, nope, this is just objectively terrible. Thanks, but no thanks. 

Imagine you're playing Counter-Strike and you're in a 1v1 situation. You clutch the round, get hyped, leave a spray, and knife the wall before sticking the defuse. Then you're quickly debriefing the round and planning for the next buy with your team. At the last second while defusing, you are shot in the back of the head by a ""6th man"" and lose. That's this ""game"", exactly. Trash, I know. I thought it was '5v5' too, I dunno what to tell you. *shrug*

I can get screwed and stripped of everything I work for in real life unjustly, I play games to get away from this hell of a reality. Once you are unfairly stripped of your run by bad design, you will never want to continue playing when you are forced to start over again. The beginning stages are a snail's-pace soul crushing experience of painstaking boredom. Especially in direct contrast to the run you literally just had unfairly ripped from you.

Feeling strong and starting to have a little bit of fun??... ""FUN IS DETECTED"" and soon thereafter you are suddenly forced to start over. Back to the 0 item equipped trash gameplay. They have no clue as to what makes something actually ""fun"", or how to embrace actual carry-over progression to unlock it's own natural ""replay-ability"". Wait, I thought this was a ""VIDEO GAME"".. by definition meant to be ""FUN"", oh? Hmm. Inexcusable."
5744,"SO AMAZING!!! CAN'T STOP PLAYING!!!
"
5745,"Lots to learn

5746,Good game yes
5747,This the one of the games of all time.
5748,"If you audibly say ""I'm going to do one more quick run"", you will not be doing a quick run. Highly recommend."
5749,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
5750,yes
5751,very fun
5752,sexy
5753,lots of hours of fun with replayablity if you enjoy the kind of reset run on death. Void is the only answer to this world
5754,pretty sick

5756,"Its better if you have friends to play with. Overall, i enjoy playing it."
5757,"This is easily one of my favorite games. It has great variety, amazing replayability, and good difficulty scaling. It also works well in both singleplayer and mutiplayer, and it has mod support. I highly recommend checking it out!"
5758,The multiplayer loot system is just not fun it just feels like a race against everyone else to get the loot

5789,"I suck at this game, but I'm sure having fun"
5790,"Before I played Risk of Rain 2 I had a small wee wee, no girlfriend, no friends and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
5791,Extremely interesting and addicting design and game!!
5792,There is no rain in this game. The title is a scam.
5793,"me like it, updoot"
5794,this is one of those games where you say i'll go one more run and then spend the next 2 hour completing the run. im fucking in love with this the music graphic all of the game. every character is unique and has a Completely different play style combine it with the items and perks and artifacts you can do some crazy ass build witch game encourages you to go for those crazy build one run you one shot everything using 50 crowbar (its an item) the second you're a monster with 500%+ attack speed firing (or smashing or cutting depending on your character) enemy's so fast you don't need to have high damage. you can all do this with your friends too i had a blast playing it with my friends and it was a lot of fun. i haven't unlucked every character's and item's and still have shit ton of fun only in like 7 hours. overall a solid game with solid mechanics witch i highly recommend giving this a shot you won't regret it trust me. :))))
5795,rly fun. and then butthair.
5796,is good
5797,"Fun to turn off your brain to AND fun to try really hard to think of different ways to survive. Amazing with friends, and its amazing with your own music playing in the background."

5807,Fun game
5808,goku
5809,"This game isn't perfect like many steam reviews make it out to be, the game balancing is a bit questionable as you will be completely demolishing everything and then get killed immediately out of nowhere which is pretty silly.

Finding the exit for each level can also be a bit of a pain sometimes.

However, it's still a pretty good game and 100x more fun while playing with a friend."
5810,
5811,Buy it on Steam!
5812,gud gaem. shuut bad guys. kill god.
5813,"Great graphics, engaging music. Fun to play with friends and the multiplayer is well implemented. The difficulty raising with time adds some fun suspense and keep interest thoughout the levels. Really love that any dead player respawns on the next level, so their run isn't finished after some bad luck. Highly recommend"
5814,good
5815,i like the mult-e character because they remind me of heavy weapons guy from team fortress 2 and the game team fortress 2 is a game i like.
5816,"Definitely recommend playing with others, but this game is an incredible shooter-meets-rogue-like! 10/10, do recommend!"
5817,"one of those roguelikes that ppl who don't like roguelikes (like me) can enjoy :-)
it doesn't have as much replayability for me as it does for ppl who rly love the genre, but it's still worth the price"
5818,A space based roguelike that builds on the original and exceeds expectations. Fun for a short run through or longer session. Fans of Risk of Rain should buy immediately. Same great music. Unique but familiar levels. Endless replayability. Great on PC and Steam deck (plugged in).

5828,good very good
5829,♥
5830,at first i was confused on the goal but after playing and understanding i can say with complete confidence that this is a top tier game. The lore is great and the game play is even better. Overall a good game that can bring countless hours of entertainment.

5835,"Its like the first risk of rain but in 3D. They add more stuff to the game as well, but essentially its the same thing but better."
5836,"the concept of starting over and using a diffrent build or adding something
 beneficial helps and makes the game more fun or difficult depending on how you feel on the day.


                                                                                                                                                     10/10"
5837,Great roguelike. Highly enjoyable.
5838,"I often don't find rouge-like games super enjoyable but Risk of Rain 2 was one that was able to captivate me enough to keep playing it. Unlocking character, items and skins was so fun to do and all of it enough of a different feel to it to be able to enjoy every character despite some of the things that I disliked about them. All in all Risk of Rain 2 is a very solid game and allows for quite a lot of enjoyment to come from it."
5839,this game makes me want to risk my life in the rain with Mithrix chopping of my man hood
5840,"Late game is easy early game is RNG based (If you are god awful like me)

If you are looking to have a nice game to just relax to you are in the right place. Each death feels like a pretty big defeat but its that kind of game, and you rage really easily this game isnt for you."
5841," ""..and so he left, with everything but his humanity.""

Absolute 10/10."
5842,its alright
5843,swag
5844,literally crack
5845,"Flawless, must buy if you have any interest at all."
5846,Looks like it might rain the second time today.

With the inclusion of build diversity and a better understanding of item synergy, artifacts, as well as the inclusion of lunar and void items, the game is an instant 10/10 for fans of the rogue-lite/like genre. For those who are not avid fans of the genre, the game is still well worth the price and with a friend or two, your experience will only get better. 13 hrs on PC version, 74 hrs played on console(yes, it is good enough to warrant buying it twice)."

5920,"It's a pretty average game, challenging, fun decent and a good time with friends. That is until you unlock big mommy Loader, learn how to pilot her and become the fastest, most autistic, deadly projectile known to man, it has never been the same since, all other characters will feel clunky and slow and incapable of soloing stage one no items one shrine of the mountain teleporter boss, in turn making them all weaker and inferior to the one true god. You will also forsake all other stage 4 variants when you spend more than three minutes at Sundered Grove, as you will have an eargasm, having the same effect as massive milf Loader, all other songs will pale in comparison and will be heard by your ears to be mediocre. You will come in an innocent child and will come out a man of quality, nevermore to experience joy from what they used to enjoy, yet it is the curse that we have bear to experience perfection, just know that you will be a better man, isolation is part of the price of being so high above."

5923,very gud game loved it so much i bought the game after pirating it
5924,"""This the run.""

*Get's one shot to an enemy*

Next run:
""This is the run."""
5925,"I decided to give the game another chance and I have to say I found it fun this time. In true roguelike fashion, there are loads of items that can make or break your run, and admittedly it's rough finding out what items do what when there's a timer looming over your head at all times.

HOWEVER. I still stand by my belief that this game is too much in love with making annoying as hell challenges the method to unlock characters and items. Devs, if you want people to actually play with all the items, skills and characters, DON'T PUT THEM BEHIND STRANGELY SPECIFIC CHALLENGES like using a certain character to beat a certain specific boss that's not even guaranteed to be found in a run. I just finished a run where I had to land 30 consecutive shots on enemy weak spots and it was frustrating and grindy, not fun."
5926,I'm utter garbage but I like this a lot
5927,"Very great game, the artifact system is very fun to play with and i love the visuals of the game, the survivor and monster designs are just too good and hit my artist g spot.

5932,remove horde bosses and why is getting lizard man like winning the lottery. anyways it good.
5933,"Progression of a level depends on the RNG of dropped items. Later on the stage/loop (late-game) enemies can easily one-shot you. The final boss can be easily cheesed. Your run depends on your luck rather than skill. 
On the positive side, it is very fun killing the enemies before they even spawn. The survivors are mostly balanced with different playstyle for every survivor."

5972,now im scared of tall white men with a 6 foot long hammer
5973,Makes me moist like sponge bob
5974,"I would say this is a solid 10/10 in my book.  Risk of Rain 2 is a 3rd person rogue-like loot shooter that has tons of replayability and the fun is multiplied the more friends you have to play it with.  You can also choose to do casual runs and make silly ridiculous builds or challenge yourself with speedruns or ""artifacts"" to modify the gameplay to be more intense.  While graphically simple, the art direction is beyond amazing, the soundtracks have a lo-fi feel to them that adds to the background, and it runs with little to no stability issues making it super accessible even if you're still running Windows '98.

Would gladly recommend in a heartbeat, and the DLC adds even greater levels of content."

5976,"A lovely, stylistic game with a unique take on the rogue-like genre. The music and setting of this game elevates it considerably, without compromising in the least in regard to game-play and the overall experience.

This game is amazing and will give you hours of fun. Full on 10/10

A longer description?
This is a game in which puts you right into the action... As soon as you step out of that pod you are instantly bombarded by literally everything, and I mean EVERYTHING trying to kill you. You will find chests and broken drones to repair, go exploring in this unforgiving world while you try to find the teleporter. But watch out because being careless of your surrounding will get you killed.
The games art style and visuals will leave you in shock... but gameplay and the vast world of this unknown planet will keep you coming back for more."

6026,"As a huge fan of Risk of Rain 1, this game initially didn't scratch the same itch being 3D. I had a hard time getting into it, but eventually (around the time they full released) I replayed and found it to be some of the most fun in a game I've had in a while. Once you've accomplished all there is to accomplish, look into mods, it'll only add to an already great experience.

10/10."
6027,just play 4head
6028,This is a great game to play with friends or a partner! It will have you thinking of good builds for certain characters and sometimes screaming from the monsters! I love this game quite a bit.
6029,"I could see why people may not like this game at first, it plays a certain way. It's all about speed and loot. My first time playing I didn't realize that and wanted to explore every nook and cranny. As you can imagine, the game punished me for this. Once I watched my friend play, I realized what I did wrong and the game has become an absolute blast!"

6075,"Game is extremely repetitive and boring. Equally as unfair as isaac but lacks the variety and metagame/strategy that makes TBOI entertaining.

The entire gameplay loop can be summarized as:

Run around level to find chest/terminal/shrine.
Open chest/terminal/shrine with money and get a marginal damage/defense/mobility increase. If no money, kill enemies until you have money.
Repeat steps 1-2 for 10 minutes.
Find the teleporter and press E on it.
Run circles around boss and shoot until boss is dead. There is a 5% chance the game spawns a cluster of enemies offscreen that kill you in half a second.
Go to next stage and repeat from step 1.


DONT HATE JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION IMHO :))"

6115,"Most disappointing sequel to a game in quite a while.

At first it feels like a breathe of fresh air, you get to discover your favorite game with an added dimension, and with that comes complexity but you suddenly realize that the roguelite aspect is much more reduced, builds are much less wacky than the first game and the world feels much smaller somehow, it's more tedious than the first one and multiplayer is kind of garbage 
also you rely much more on the items than on the first game, but they refuse to make items fun and the chests mechanic doesn't translate as well to the Z axis.

Really should have had ziplines to replace ropes. The maps could have been bigger if there were more ways to traverse. Hell, the most fun characters to play are the ones that have extra movement mechanics.

Several characters are still either completely OP or worthless. This game is even more RNG dependant than the last. The level design is mediocre at best and awful at worst. The levels are far too big for lower mobility characters so you'll be running huge distances. This is even more frustrating in multiplayer.

Risk of rain 1 worked primarily because of its 2d environment. The devs unfortunately tried to literally translate many of its items and features without regard for its functionality in a 3d environment. It ends up feeling like a mess.

I've spent many hours on this game at this point and it was purely because I thought it would get better. I was wrong. This game isn't fun like the first one was, nor does it have its style. It's an exercise in frustration and nothing more.

The worst part about it for me is how character abilities are completely sidelined lategame in favor of just stacking more and more items. Good items are too obvious. There is no build diversity. Character quickly only become the sum of their items. Enemy design is just poor. Overall the game just feel sluggish. HP sponge game. Relies on one shot to kill the player due to how broken some health regen itens are. Note that lots of this also applies to ror1. Ill never understand the love for this series when it just commits sin after sin when it comes to good design.

They should have made your success more weighted on proper usage of skills instead of collection of items. Every god run just evolves into the same play style of lightspeed death ball.

6220,"[h1]RISK OF RAIN 2 REVIEW[/h1]
September 13th, 2022
13 hours in at time of writing

Just finished the game today, on the second try! I will finish my review now, as well. 

Why is this game immediately better than most other games?
Hmm, let me think- oh yeah, NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. Every (except two) new survivor is a grind to get and is usually well worth it, unless you just hate it's playstyle, but most survivors are not too terribly different. The only thing you could pay for other than the game itself is it's lone DLC which is not at all required but also worth it, and it throws in the other two survivors.

Why else?
Completely randomized sessions.
Every time you play this game it will be different. The levels are on rotation, but there is a limited number of them, so I'm talking about potential treasures and encounters. Every session has the potential to be a 'god run' and give you a ton of chests right off the bat, and every session has the potential to be forbidding of help to the player. You are the one with the brain. [i]You[/i] adapt, [i]you[/i] survive... or you die.

Perhaps another?
Every item (and arguably survivor) is useful and worth finding. Every item adds a permanent buff to your character unless it is discarded/traded by the player. And all of them are very useful and will aid you greatly in your many journeys. 

How about one more?
The art style and optimization is amazing. Consistently high FPS except for in MASSIVE fights, and I have a 2gb GPU! Not to mention the world design, background lore, and character designs. Everything just looks great, and will accompany your eyes nicely every time.

Surely there must be some cons though, right?
My only complaint is that there is no cross-play between PC, Xbox, and Playstation (something every multiplayer game should have), and also there is no Mac support. The only bug I encountered was with the Bandit survivor, where it would keep playing the reload sounds for about ten seconds after I finished reloading. But it has only happened once so far.

What about the BOSS FIGHT?
Even if you do survive four phases, there is no guarantee that you'll make it to the boss level and thus the only way to properly end the game unless you're looking for it. I did a few early runs, not having known how to get to the boss, and proceeded to complete around eight phases before dying, wondering how to get to him. Eventually I found out, did the pillars, got to the boss arena, annnd died with hardly any of the boss' health remaining. At the time of posting this review, I have just recently beaten the boss after discovering that he has, in fact, FOUR intense phases before you finally defeat him for good. Each one was very difficult, most of the time spent was trying to dodge his insane abilities. Solid fight though, reveals a bit more of the lore with a twenty-second cutscene at the end followed by the credits.

In conclusion, there is no reason NOT to buy this game. It will satisfy any gamer, no matter your favorite genre.

[h1]VERDICT: 10/10[/h1]

6255,kinda like muck
6256,Don´t buy is addictive and it will steal your soul
6257,A fun game; started playing it with a few friends and just couldn't stop playing it once I picked it up. The difficulty scale and equipment/character skills are really fun to use and mess with. Have to say it's more fun if you're playing with someone but even if you play solo it is a game that I would recommend if you're bored and wanna put a couple hours on a game.
6258,"One of the best games of all time. This provides hours of game-play and the modding community is insane if you choose to go that path. From VR mods to small tweaks there is a perfect mod for everyone. Or if you enjoy vanilla, this game has so much to unpack you'll spend all day or all night doing ""Just one more run"". Incredible. This is the best thing you can do with your money if you enjoy a good game with your pals or just by yourself. Go buy the game if you can, you'll thank me later. :)"
6259,"Fun game, play it"
6260,it's a very good cute fun lol gahahahaha interesting kawaii interactive game. i hated it at the beginning but now i love it. 4lifer ^_^

hop on risk of rain 2 on urban dictionary"
6271,it rains on the final stage
6272,Yes gud
6273,funny mercenary kicks flying eyeball
6274,"There might be a risk of rain but there's hardly any other risks in game.

One of those ""Turn your brain off and 1-shot everything for 30 minutes with no risk of dying"" designs that are so popular in the roguelike genre. I suppose in a genre of game that's generally designed around learning through repetition, the most popular ones are going to be the ones that reward you for not using any critical thinking whatsoever. You just grab hundreds of buffs that multiply your damage and resistance into the hundreds and drool until you're done. The only challenge was the ridiculously overtuned boss at the end but I can only they imagine they nerfed it because the kinds of people that play this aren't the kinds of people that critically apply themselves. Sure it has co-op but ten minutes in you have the stats of an entire army so it doesn't even matter. If you want co-op, look anywhere else."
6275,Seems better for multiplayer. I didn't like it solo.
6276,I would pay double the price for Risk of Rain 2 and its DLC in a heartbeat.
6277,This gaem is sooooooo gud!1!! it let me shoot bad guy.10/10 buy gaem

6292,nice
6293,Its good
6294,"One of the most fun rogue like games for co-op. So much replay value with all the characters, loadouts, and items you can get to customize your build. And the music is truly a joy to listen to and enhances the addicting gameplay so much. Survivors of the Void DLC is a must buy."

6299,"I usually never get all achievements in a game. I did in this one just because it was a good reason to keep playing it. The core mechanics and the value of every unlocked item just compel you to try new things, it's endlessly amazing.

Very fun game, especially with friends."
6300,Good game lots of fun
6301,Shitty game
6302,Game good.
6303,this game is goated and has amazing stability even tho i do everything in my power to get the true ending the game crashing truly the hardest thing to do (idk why so many people complain about crashing even on an xbox one i never crashed) also dlc is hella worth just don't be stupid around void enemys like duh but just like don't be stupid around any enemy and stay away from drizzle and command that really ruins the game
6304,this game is
6305,its totally bonkers man
6306,"Review from the perspective of someone who's only ever played solo: it is very fun. There's a bunch of characters each with their own abilities that can interact with the game's huge variety of items in different ways. The game can be hard to get into at the start but as you unlock more items and figure out what different monsters,items, etc do, the feeling of accomplishment as each of your runs gradually improves is great."
6307,I recommend playing this. It's the best thing I've spent hundreds of hours on.

I love the music, gameplay and visual style, although it may not be for everyone.
I recommend you buy this game during the steam summer sale, or no sale, because the game is so good you should buy it no matter if its on sale or not 
oh and the dlc is amazing, like the game.

6316,"cool game

6317,"get yourself a squad and this game is very fun

6318,"I've been a big Risk of Rain fan for a long while. It was a game I could play on my, at the time, mega potato PC for hours on end. So imagine my surprise when I heard Risk of Rain had a sequel coming out? And in 2.5D??? I remember freaking out over seeing it.

One of my biggest gripes with the first game was how slow it felt, without the Glass artifact. Yeah, yeah, call me a cheat, a casual or whatever, but the bosses felt like massive bullet-sponges that you just had to flail around with, and it was obnoxious to deal with. That mixed with the 2D aspect made the whole ordeal even slower, for while it was fun, there wasn't really much wiggle room for player expression, if that makes sense. RoR2 fixes this issue immensely, through a mix of scaling items, big numbers, and a... is it a 3D or a 2.5D game? 
Regardless, having the freedom to run around also helps adds depth (quite literally) to the fighting done. 

However, these big numbers are not just for you, but also the residents of the planet! The risk of (rain) death always looms above you as long as you play, even in an amazing run, and that's always a pleasant experience.
I also really enjoyed the recent 3D printer/scrapper addition. While it wasn't always there, it's a nice way to salvage a run, and bring a fair amount of consistency to the game.
I'm also glad they kept the artifact system from the first game, sometimes it's nice to slap on Command and instantly win, or slap on Glass and coin-flip on a victory.
Did I mention this game has mods? Oh, so many mods, from QoL to new content entirely, it's amazing.

Overall, worth the price, the game has infinite replayability (tm), unique survivors with varied skill sets, and even some familiar faces (RIP Chef)! As for the DLC, I have mixed feelings about it, if we're being honest, probably wait for a sale or skip it."

6321,fun
6322,pick up 10 glasses to look swag
6323,"This game is soooo amazing you can replay it so many time's and if you ever get bored of the base game mods are super easy to install. Best thing to do for mods is download RoR mod man from thunderstore.io, but please if you think you might want to play try it DO IT. And do a cuple of runs  and see if you like it.  And playing with friends is so fun. So if you are thinking about getting this please do."
6324,Lots and lots of challenges and every game is random on drops unless you have a certain item! never gets old
6325,yes
6326,goos
6327,Was very suprised by the gameplay. It does take alittle getting used to but its such a good game to let off steam.

6337,"This game is a wonderfully crafted rogue lite. Game play is stellar and flows smoothly. The music is so good I listen to it during my day job. 
My personal favorite feature is how each item you pickup shows up somewhere on your character, and is unique to each character."

6345,Fun with friends.

6351,GOAT Action Roguelike
6352,dis game is gud
6353,"This is exactly what I wanted from Warframe and Path of Exile. There are crazy end game builds you can get like in Path of Exile, but it resets after you die and you don't have to have a PHD to create your build. It has a high skill ceiling mechanically like Warframe, but without the predatory monetization. I am not trying to bash Warframe and Path of Exile, I just noticed that Risk of Rain managed to sidestep a lot of the issues those games have by being a rougelike."
6354,"This is the best roguelike game I have played since Hades. There is extremely deep strategy, the music is excellent, and there are many different ways to approach each run. Endless secrets and new things to discover. You can spend a long time exploring the playstyle of each character. I highly recommend it, 10/10"
6355,Yes

6364,"the game is very poggers XDXDXDXDXD

6365,"Amazing soundtrack!

The game isn't bad either..."
6366,"[b]I'm only marking this as having received it for free due to the fact that I was given it by a friend, not the developers, or anybody else associated with the development of the game. [/b]

This game can very quickly turn into one of my favourite idle/incremental games. 
There are a lot of great items, and a lot of even greater synergies. 
The co-op scaling feels a little wonky at times, but it's all good fun when trying to divvy up the loot, and having petty squabbles about who gets what loot. 
At the base-price of $35.95 AUD (whatever that may be in your local currency), I don't know if I'd recommend it wholeheartedly, but whenever it goes on sale, I would very much so give it a whirl. 

[i]Lastly, don't be too disheartened if you get super far into a run, just for the game to crash; It happens to the best of us. [/i]"

6373,"Fun game to play with friends or solo.  Can be a bit slow in the beginning if you're not finding chests to upgrade during a run, otherwise it's fun to kill some time with.  Slight tweak could be to add titles to items that are available at the 3 item kiosks in case you aren't familiar with what items look like from the get-go."
6374,"good
"
6375,"Didn't realize it was so repetitive. I thought it was adventure type action shooter. You basically repeat the level over and over and over and over and over, until you beat the boss."
6376,Anti-drug campaigns would be a lot more effective if they just suggested this game as a substitute
6377,"This game is really great. I would highly recommend.

It's really challenging, sometimes you'll get frustrated. But once you understand how enemies and bosses attack and learn the items, you'll have lots of fun.

Beating this game for the first time is just a great feeling.

The DLC is good, I'd say only get it after playing the game first, to see if you like it. It adds a different ending and more items so I'd say not for new players."
6378,It's one of those games I know I can play whenever I'm bored and always have a blast playing.  Absolute banger!
6379,"""good game"" - literally everyone i know"

6389,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6401,"gameplay lacks character with dry rinse and repeat mechanics.  The replay value is low, unless you like continually fighting the same enemies over and over"
6402,"This game has so much that makes it good, honestly"
6403,Amazing game! I recommend everyone play it
6404,modding in this game was both a gift and a mistake
6405,"This game is truly amazing. It makes you feel like a god but also makes you feel little at the same time. This game is truly the highest of any rogue-likes can get, especially including the fact that it's a third-person shooter. Personally, I love to play most of the characters overall, and it is indeed stupidly fun when playing co-op with friends as well. There are many struggles when starting for the first time, but as you learn, you start to get more in depth in to certain build strategies with items. This game is truly a gift, and I am not disappointed for buying this game.

Addictive gameplay, unique item combinations, (ACTUALLY) balanced survivors, and (challenging) challenges for varrious rewards and fun!

All in all this is a 10/10 game, It's worth your money and the DLC makes it even better, fitting into the game perfectly as if it was base game! :D"

The game play also has both multiplayer and single player and endless combinations when it comes to game play and different ways it can change is the artifact you put on, the difficulty, the character and the abilities you put on, the items you get, and weather you want to beat the boss or just go for as many stages as possible."

Overall – Risk of Rain 2 is a lot of fun to mess around with. There is really no long term progression other than unlocking some characters and alt skills, so you can hop on with a friend who’s played forever and not have to worry about “catching up.” Really a blast to play.   Highly recommended.

6529,"It's a fun game where you can build anyway you want until you're about 60 minutes into a game with friends and you disconnect. Fun solo, frustrating when you can't stay connected to finish a run."
6530,"I was skeptical at first of this game as I wasn't sure I would like the fast pace of it and being timed. Turns out I love it. I feel like a lot of care was put into making this game available to gamers who aren't the best at any sort of shooter games what with the different difficulties, characters, and drones (NPCs that heal and automatically attack for you). However, I will say that with the hardest difficulty (monsoon), I think the sweet spot in the amount of players is two. I feel like with three or more there aren't enough items to go around and with just one you're the only target soaking up damage. 

I am a bit of a completionist to a certain degree and will try my best to 100% the game. It doesn't have so many achievements to where it is daunting with some really challenging ones that did take me a good bit to get. The difference in the character design really helps with the replay-ability of the game. I highly suggest checking all of them out first and trying to avoid having just one ""main"". 

Highly suggest this for a group of friends. I feel like if you'd play it by yourself you'd tie of it a bit too fast. 

"
6531,Risk of Rain 2 is a fun and challenging game. I enjoy playing it despite how much it can drive me up the wall.
6532,"Excellent game. Both solo and with friends!

A roguelite third-person shooter that plays at an extremely fast and unforgiving pace, you can use one of the thirteen characters and hundreds of items and upgrades to loop yourself into «Obliteration»!"
6533,"This game has been so much fun over the few months I have had it. I have gone from playing drizzle with sacrifice command to getting the eclipse 8 gold medal. This game is a great shooter and takes a lot of time to get good at. it can be infuriating at first, and sometimes it still is, but it will always be sometimes. It takes time to learn the maps and items, but once you get the hang of it, you can have a lot of fun. This game is only like 30 bucks or less (idk the real price) but you can get so much more value out of it. The lore is much deeper than you would expect in a game like this and the small community always helps each other out. The game can be very hard to learn by yourself. I started playing this game because my friend started playing it and he knew a little more than I did and helped me learn the basics of the game. Give the game time to learn and it will pay off. Buy it. Do it. Make sure to get the Survivors of the Void to. It's worth it.

6555,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6572,"Pretty nice roguelike, with some flaws. Recommend if you have someone to play with.

The gameplay follows a pretty standard roguelike route. You go through multiple stages, with each stage ending with a boss fight, eventually ending up in the final stage against the final boss. If you die, you start again. There are items in the stages that can be found to boost your character and a lot of hidden secrets to interact with There's a lot of random factor in the game, the items, stages, and bosses are all randomized, leading to some runs being godlike and some being just weak. A somewhat unique feature in this game is the loop mechanic, meaning that you can loop to the first stage again rather than proceeding to the final stage to fight the final boss.

The game encourages fast gameplay by making the difficulty scale with time. The various items and equipments in the game can create very chaotic gameplay, with some builds can easily win the game without doing much. This leads to some sort of balancing act of whether you farm for more items or proceed to the next stage.

There are no permanent upgrades in this game, just more unlockables, similar to games like Enter the Gungeon. You can unlock items, character skills, and more characters by completing challenges in the game (Steam Achievements). Personally, I didn't really like this mechanic. Some of the challenges are just really hard or heavily reliant on RNG. Since this challenge unlocks skills, items, or even characters, it can be frustrating as you can find yourself grinding a lot just to complete it. 

There's single player and multiplayer modes. Two years after release, I find it pretty hard to find multiplayer games to join. Granted, there's a discord server for finding groups. Still the single player and multiplayer gameplay differs significantly."

6578,The game is honestly one of the best games in played in a while if u have time to spare. Its really a great game overall but my only issue is disconnecting between players during long sessions. If this wasnt an issue with how often it happens this game would be a 10/10.

6582,"the timer just makes it to stressful to be fun. whenever i run to one corner of the map just to find nothing i get punished because while i was of doing nothing the enemies at the teleporter got stronger

i also dislike most bosses (the few that i saw) 
the jellyfish for example has a massive aoe instakill which seems pretty much unavoidable if youre fighting at mid-close range. according to the wiki you just have to stay at a distance or seek cover but i dont understand how im supposed to do that when im playing a mid range hero (the homing arrow archer) and the only ""cover"" is jumping of the platform followed by a 30 sec long climb back up (since there is a timer this just isnt a viable strategy).
 more or less the same goes for the golem boss with his undodgeable laser."

I am proud to say that Risk of Rain 2 was the first game I ever played on here, it has a stunning art style with super addicting game play. My friends and I stayed up for hours having fun, and I ended up learning a whole bunch about the game. While, I think the game is great with friends (as most games are), I can't recommend it for single player. So all in all, if you got friends or family, get them to play this game with you."

I am not normally drawn to games with 'endgame content' but this is a huge exception. You keep unlocking things and getting better at it, so it's just a really fun climb up the skill/progression ladder.

Risk of Rain 2 brings you on to different planets and makes you attack different hordes of monsters.

6717,"Before we go in, let me say that Risk of Rain 2 is a Roguelike. Not everyone enjoys playing Roguelikes. Understand? Good.

Risk of Rain 2 is a very good game! Everything feels so fluid and well made, and the game runs surprisingly smooth for the amount of particles and models on any stage. There are 3 difficulties that either help or hinder your gameplay, and at the time of this review I have yet to beat the harder of the 3 (known as Monsoon) solo. Speaking of solo runs, there is a muliplayer option for Risk of Rain 2 and with the right group of people things can get quite hilarious. Tho one thing I will criticize is the fact that if you die on a stage in multiplayer, then it is almost impossible to pick yourself back up and not die on the rest of the stages! So a revive shrine would be helpful each stage instead of reviving at the start of the next one. All that being said, Risk of Rain 2 is a very good game, with updates still being made. Definitely worth the purchase IF you enjoy Roguelikes."
6718,bungus
6719,Fun game. I enjoy playin it with all of the characters.
6720,This game is good but i keep DC playing with my friends and if you read this review please update the feature if i can join again if i got dc thx

6723,This game is very cool and I love it
6724,This game is fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
6725,"I'll admit, when a buddy of mine bought me this game, I thought I was going to play for like 2 hours and drop it. I'm not much of a roguelike enjoyer, but I was curious as to why this game had such Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. 
Now I know. The gameplay loop, characters, and enemies are all so genuinely fun to fight. Playing with friends is also fun because you'll always have at least one item wh*re who'll be the main character for the run. 
The soundtrack goes hard. Listen The Rain Formerly Known as Purple, and then listen to They Might as Well be Dead, and then listen to Nocturnal Emissions, and then listen to Con Lentitud Pedorosa. I can't pick just one track, Chris Christodolou does such an amazing job with every track in the game they all slap. 
The lore is deep too, not in your face. Item descriptions you read in the main menu and the environments tell you the deep plot behind the game. It's all so sad and wonderful. 
If you like roguelikes, you'll love this game. If you have friends looking for your next game to play, you'll all love this game."
6726,Even if I haven't played this game to much it's still a hell of alot of fun. Especially if you get some friends in on it. I'd say the favorite part of the game for me is the atmosphere that kinda reminds me of Rain World ironically. Anyways pretty fun game.

6742,"Its a fine game of power-ups, if you like a good game of ""rogue likes"" then I would say you've found the perfect game for you however if you like being able to start out guns blazing then you might want to look somewhere else."
6743,"Very addicting to play. Some characters feels better to play then others but they all pretty much have distinct playstyles. Starting the game is a bit hard though as you just kinda have to grind a little bit to be able to unlock and play the other characters.

RNG with items can be a pain sometimes but there are ways to customize your runs to feel more natural or fun in general.  Playing solo or with others is a pretty fun experience as well.

One of the best things about Risk of Rain is that it is easily modded to add in new custom characters and items that enhances the gameplay loop which can lead to a whole new experience. 

Overall Risk of Rain 2 is a very well made game for casual play and for those who like to grind out these rouge-like shooters."
6744,"Risk of Rain 2 is a great concept made by tragically prideful and unreceptive developers who will actively make fun of your performance in the game and write off any criticism on social media as you being an ignorant, sore loser of sorts. Deleting the players' health with half of the game's contents (in normal difficulty), to dissuade the player from choosing the difficulty that they like most (making fun of you for playing on low), or to make constant DPS aura bosses when your game has melee characters: all of these are clear problems for normal people, but the holier-than-thou devs are on a mission to keep everything that one could find obnoxious in and make you feel guilty for disliking it. 
You may like the game, but be aware that it has blatant design flaws that will [b] not [/b] be fixed. It's bad enough that these are there to begin with, but the devs are too all-knowing to ever admit that they could've messed up in any way."
6745,"I have not played this game as much as other people nor have tried doing multiplayer mode due to offline responsibilities, but RoR2 is that type of game that I'll come back to every now since the runs don't last that long.

There's always that ""one more try"" essence in rogue-likes which this game captures it very well. The characters I have right now (5 I think) varies vastly from one another so I'm fairly certain that anyone can find the character that they're comfortable with.

I highly recommend RoR2 to anyone getting into rogue-likes or games in general, or a chill yet fun gaming session with friends. Kudos to the team for making this game!"

6769,"Very fun game, an absolute blast to play with your friends, only thing is that me and my buddies can never get through a single run without someone disconnecting with no way to reconnect, cant join through steam or in game. Huge pain when you spend upwards of an hour plus only to get kicked. Not sure what the reason is but it seems more common in the bazaar/ newt place than elsewhere but it still is a problem regardless of where you are. I'm not gonna bother to play another 2 hours worth of this game for no reason."
6770,it's making me type something here
6771,its cool af
6772,GREAT GAME
6773,Stop looking at reviews and just buy it already.
6774,"I'm not sure how I feel about this game.

To begin with, the gameplay is very good. It's fast, it's dynamic and every character feel very very different. Also, it's a multiplayer rogue-like with good gameplay. There is like... 2 of those so the game gets a lot of points for that too.

But, in my opinion, the rogue-like formula of looting a bunch of stuff without having any choice feels a little bit outdated. There are some fun new tools (like the 3D printer) to help with that and you can give items to your teammates in multiplayer but that doesn't change the fact that a bunch of random loot is a very core mechanic to the game.

The other thing is that exploring the map quickly is a very important skill to practice in this game. Overall it's a good thing and to me, it's quite fun to practice that but it makes multiplayer require good coordination and communication between everyone. I'm kind of mixed about that because it's a fun challenge but it makes an already hard game even harder for new or casual players.

Anyway, game good. 7.5/10"

6816,"As soon as you are able, get the Artifact of Command. It lets you pick the item you get when items. Combine this with artifact of sacrifice and artifact of swarms, and enemies drop items and the spawns are doubled but they get half HP. Makes it really easy to break a character. 

For unlocking stuff like this, you'll have to make it to sky meadow, which is the 5th stage. Try playing on Drizzle difficulty so you can get there faster.

Game's fun solo but even more with friends. I've had 2+ hour runs with the bois and loved it each time. 

Overall it's a great game and I think most gamers would enjoy it, especially fans of Hero Shooters or Roguelikes."
6817,epic
6818,"Risk of Rain 2 is a solid game but in my singleplayer experience, it didn't feel as rewarding or replayable as I hoped it would be. The replayability felt low for me in singleplayer since it felt that the quality of the run was too much tied to item RNG. Also it felt like the game would be improved if the player speed was higher since some of the maps can get tedious to navigate through such as the final level."
6819,Awesome game. ive played it for hours on end with my mates and with all the characters the game has so much replayability
6820,"The amount of synergy, the smooth integrity, and the musical flow of this game is unmatched within the modern gaming world. Words fail to describe the level of awesomeness that this game is.
   The goal of this game is for you to never feel lost. No matter how many times you play, what you do, or where you go, you're always doing something right. The goal of the game, no spoilers, is to go through stage upon stage of a diverse, alien landscape completely overflowing with hostile threats. You can take as much time as you want during this wondrous escapade, too many secrets for even reddit to explore completely. the catch? Every single second you spend gazing at it's splendor, collecting precious resources, and fighting fiends, the game always gets harder. It. Never. Stops. Will you master the game and achieve an unmatched power level, defeat the game before it beats you, or fail to advance faster than the game does and succumb to the doom you fight so desperately against? Your adventure awaits."
6821,This game changed my life. Solid 11/10!
6822,"Since there's no neutral option, I ultimately have to give RoR2 the thumbs down although I have fairly mixed feelings on the game.

I've tried picking up RoR2 multiple times since it's release and shortly after putting it back down, and it boils down to a problem I don't have with other roguelites: Maybe 75-80% of runs end in frustration. Since this isn't a problem I have with other games in the genre, so I played a few more runs and found that it really boils down to what feels like a lack of any control over most deaths. 

Didn't get lucky enough to find mobility? You are incapable of dodging often enough to survive the late game. Didn't get lucky enough to find decent sustain? Unless you're already an experienced player who's not getting hit at all, your run will bleed out. Don't have a good build? Enjoy a 15-25 minute last boss fight which is mostly running in circles pinging away at a gigantic health bar, where one mistake will lead to immediate death. And these are the cases where you know what killed you. Often times you're managing a crowd of enemies just fine in the late game, and then oops, your health bar vanished for no apparent reason. This is compounded by the fact the only info you're told about your death is what scored the killing blow.

Everything else is there. The assets are great, the map designs are for the most part great, with a variety in environment, enemy designs are solid with the iconic foes from the first game coming back, survivors are all fun to play and the items are as decent as ever, boss fights are generally okay. But it comes together into a lategame that feels overwhelmingly influenced by RNG and enemies that can one-shot most any amount of HP,a game that doesn't really allow you to understand why you died and how to improve from it."

Although at times it may be a little frustriting, because you may be trying an achievement or gaining an ability and loose after haft an hour of a run, is very reinvigorating when you achieve it ones and for all.
Again pls try it for yourself if you haven't yet, it wont waste your time (maybe if you spend playing it to much like me hahaha but of course having much fun)
Also you can play it friends, which make it even better and hilarious at times."

6890,"Easy recommend. Beautiful visuals, great music, great gameplay, tons of variety. The characters are unique and tackle the game in their own interesting ways. It's a hard game, with a blend of strategic and tactical decision making. You have to defeat the problem the immediate enemies represent while crafting a build that while help you defeat bosses three stages and twenty minutes in the future. It's also a perfect game for shorter or irregular gaming sessions. I can play this game for a few days, a hour or two at a time, leave it alone for months, then come right back like I was never gone."
6891,"It may crash and free an quite a bit on multiplayer. That doesn't matter it is beyond fun. It literally makes me rage to play it every time. You 2 hours deep on what seems to be a god run? Nope, you get 1 hit. God I love this game. It's the most fun you will ever have raging!"
6892,"even though i can barely run this game with everything on either negative, low, or nothing its fun. adding mods isn't so complex you'll explode, the combat is really fun, and the game is all around unbelievably unique. think of Astroneer and some RPG fighter game made in unity had a kid. that's Risk Of Rain 2."

Edit: i think it's a little addicting"
6908,"The game is fun. FUN! You won't regret buying it. Especially if you get it on sale. 
Pro: 
- A lot of fun playing it with friends.
- It's a great pick up and play game.
- Great to kill a half hr at a time.
- great music and tight control.
- beautiful graphics.

Con:
- It takes a while for the game to become fun when playing solo. The first two worlds are slow and boring.
- It takes a while to get used to the items you get from chests.
- Wish there was a way to respawn your friends when they die during multiplayer.

This lacks a lot of QoL changes without mods.

[h1]Risk of rain 2.[/h1]

It has a very addictive and replayable, great gameplay loop: Kill monsters, get money, get items, kill more monsters, get money, get items, go to the next stage, repeat. The enemies come to YOU instead of YOU coming to [b]THEM[/b]. And, instead of the difficulty increasing per stage (Even though that is a factor) it increases with [b]TIME[/b], and that always keeps you on your toes and gets your heart racing in intense moments.

Characters compliment this greatly, as they all feel unique with their own gimmicks, playstyles, and all of them are at least PLAYABLE (some, more challenging than others, but every character can get a good run.)

The soundtrack is definetely not an atmospheric one, it sounds more like a great music playlist put together in a video game (except ...con lentitud poderosa since there was a particular level design choice that fit each other SO WELL, but I'm not going to spoil that), like hotline miami 2, but Chris Cotod.. Chris.. OKAY LET'S JUST CALL HIM CHRIS is a very talented composer, and made most of this soundtrack worth while.

Graphics are fine. Not much to say about this, it has a unique style but this ain't next gen, understandable for an indie studio that has been used to creating 2D games.

6959,"so much fun 
"
6960,it's just great. I did however like the final level of Risk of rain 1 better though
6961,All day fun
6962,"Waste of time.  Game is centered around a mechanic where difficulty increases with time.

Each level starts with a 30-60 second lull with no enemies.  There's no way to earn $, and literally nothing to do but wait for enemies to appear behind you.
Each level ends with a boss fight alongside a 60 second babysitting mission.

The core roguelike mechanic revolves around playing fast to avoid higher difficulty...and then the game intentionally wastes time at the start and end of every level - resulting in half your time being spent doing nothing or walking around.  This wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't become so punishing so quickly at higher time gates or if the fps gameplay was more fun.  But enemies spawn randomly and constantly backstab you.  Bosses are incredibly boring...they only deal damage through a singular cheese mechanic, but more likely you take damage from a flood of mobs - including random semi-boss enemies.  Nothing makes any sense and you usually die to fall damage or some stupid bs.  I tried to like this, but it's really disappointing.  The devs have pulled every f*cking trick to make the game more difficult, and the result is no fun...a bunch of cheesy BS that can only be beat with cheesy BS...such a waste of a game."
6963,"Amazing game, fun in single player but have had the most fun with friends."
6964,"A must buy if you like rogue-like games and just in general. Even though it's in 3rd person and different from all others just make's it's own and with an amazing soundtrack, satisfying loops, an amazing soundtrack, original items, and gameplay that make you feel like a fucking god. That's all. Compliments to the chef."
6965,"[h1] Playtime and Time/money [/h1]
Very replayable, but at the time of writing I'm 60 hours in and it's been well worth every dollar spent. 

[h1] Exactly what is this game? [/h1]
This is risk of rain.... 2 with a big emphasis on the 2 because it's 3d now, and that adds an incredible amount to the game that didn't exist in the first, it's just overall a very fun game that you run around shoot enemies and collect items to become stronger and stronger till you become a god or get run over by harder enemies. You can go to the moon though and beat the final boss if you've had your fill and it's a good thing to do as the final boss is an interesting last test for your character.

EXTREMELY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS

and it can be modded (with friends too) adding a buttload of replayability to the game.

[b] The Good: [/b]
The randomized items add to the uniqueness of every run
The artifacts allow you to modify the gameplay style to how you like
The characters are all interesting in their own right
The items are usually very interesting and can change up how you play completely
And the variety in the levels will keep you coming back for more without piling too much on you.


[b] The Bad: [/b]
This actually only has the same issue as risk of rain 1 where you don't start off with everything unlocked, you'll have to play through the game a few times (playing through a game takes about 30m to an hour or 7, depending on your style) in order to unlock everything so you can have fun in the ways that are fun.

[h1]So now the standard game rating:[/h1][list]
[*][b]Story: whatever/10[/b] The story takes a backseat but the observant will see it and appreciate it.
[*][b]Gameplay: 10/10 [/b] Extremely fun.
[*][b]Presentation: 10/10[/b] Fantastic artstyle and aesthetic.
[*][b]Soundtrack: 11/10[/b] One of the greatest soundtracks in video game history, it's on my list of songs to listen to normally, and it's good enough that normal people (not game nerds) would listen to it too AND not judge you for it.
[*][b]Replayability: 10/10[/b] Extremely fun to keep coming back to, playable offline, playable with friends, and modable

please buy this game so that they can make even more content."
6966,it can be a little confusing to new players but it is unbelievably fun once you begin to understand the game and learn how to become god more consistently
6967,What rain?
6968,
6969,"This game is a trip. It takes rogue like dungeon crawler type games to an insane level and brings out the beauty of the genre. The items in the game are all very unique and bring an enjoyable experience to getting them. Lunar items giving you downsides while giving insane upsides is also a really fun way to spice up a run. The multiplayer in this game is also really fun. It spikes the difficulty up to make it more fair and also drops more boss items depending on the number of players. For a majority of my hours I played this game with my girlfriend, and while most of it was spent her dying at the beginning of stages and me carrying when we played Monsoon, it was still an incredibly fun experience! I love everything about this game except for one thing. If you have the DLC that was somewhat recently released, then enemies named ""blind pests"" will spawn in. I HATE THESE THINGS, they fire the second they spawn in and do insane amounts of damage. Other than this enemy I actually really love everything that the DLC brought to the game! All in all this is a 10/10 game and is worth the buy no matter what the price."
6970,You either die a Commander or live long enough to become a Bungus infused Engineer.
6971,"Fantastic game, great sound track, awesome gameplay!"
6972,"Very addicting shooter roguelike. Once you start unlocking stuff, you don't want to stop grinding. Unlike other shooters, this game does not have high minimum spec requirements. Very ideal if you want a game you want to keep playing over and over without boredom."

6977,"the rain formerly known as purple and the games overall ost was the only thing that would stop extreme anger whenever one enemies attack would send me to -953 HP, also make it so that drones actually have an IQ and dont get stuck somewhere on the other side of the map?"

6982,gud game
6983,"This game has been a favorite since I picked it up in 2020. It can be challenging, but I applaud the devs for all the 'secrets' they put into this game i.e. needing a certain item to spawn a certain boss, and things like that. It makes every play just a bit different. Thank you Hopoo, and keep up the great work!"
6984,Risk of Rain 2 more like Risk of Rain Boo
6985,good game

6992,very much worth it
6993,"Great game, love the different character classes, each one with their own unique style of game play and unlockable skins and abilities. many different items to unlock and find on your runs as well as planets and secret areas to uncover. the game never feels dull, each run is unique with the character you choose, artifacts you use, items you find, planets you discover and bosses you fight. i highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys rogue like games. 9/10"
6994,"One of the best rougelike experiences out there, definetly pick this game up."

7030,Repetitive but its a good game. Especially with friends as it can get pretty hard at times! Playing with randoms is no fun as they constantly steal your loot and then you spend most of the time spectating as you get killed in seconds. SOLO or with a buddy is how i play this game!

7040,"HAH! You believe in rain? Rain isn’t real. It’s just a coverup for what the government is really doing. The government uses giant aircraft to dump carcinogens and poisonous chemicals like dihydrogen monoxide on us to try and thin out the population because we’re running out of food. Don’t believe me? Wait until you hear that the pig went extinct 25 years ago. All that “pork” you’ve been eating? It’s not pork. It’s the people that have been unlucky enough to die from the chemicals being dumped on them. The world government is trying to thin our population so that we have enough food to survive as a human race, is experimenting with various chemicals to see what they do to humans, and is feeding our dead to everyone to try and supplement our dwindling food supply.

7047,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
7048,most incredible game ever concieved by man
7049,chill layed back game.
7050,"Pretty cool game. The amount of unlockable items and achievements make it very fun to do run after run. You're also able to simultaneously read into the lore through item descriptions, or logs on enemies or stages, which is actually fairly tragic. 
Even though longer runs can become tedious at some point, my friends and I had amazingly funny moment (e.g. absolutely obliterating a final boss and much, much more). Whilst I have quite a few hours on my own in this game, I highly recommend this game with friends, as it is even intended that way.
8/10, some achievements are insanely hard to do, but ignoring those it's a really fun game, that we always come back to once in a while,"

7060,"As a rouge-like should be. The progression system does get more and more difficult as you go down the list of characters. However, if you were to take into consideration the four archetypes of players, this game hits all of them. Explorers will be able to explore each level and discover different areas of reward, killers will be able to mow down enemies, socializers will be able to show off their cool builds to people and different random runs, achievers can show off that they beat the game on Monsoon in X amount of time with Y artifacts enabled, you get the gist. 

Risk of Rain 2 is the pinnacle of hitting all four player types within a rouge like genre and will probably continue to be for a few years until they make something even better."
7061,"Very fun and addicting game. It's core idea isn't new, and has many games revolved around it, but this game perfects it, especially with the jump to a 3D space. Most of the items are fun and balanced. All the characters designs are lovable and fun. The difficulty scaling feels fitting for all 3 difficulties, hard but fun game. 9/10, Play it when its on sale."

7111,bro this game soi good
7112,"Risk of Rain 2 is a wonderful game that takes everything we loved about the original 2D game and further improves it in a 3d space. 

The gameplay is easy to pick up and fun to master, the art style is simple yet very pleasing to look at and the music is catchy as all hell.

If I want something challenging, I set the difficulty to monsoon and actively pick artifacts that would make the game harder. If I just want to murder waves of countless mobs after a long day of work I have those options as well.

Its a great game to play with friends, multiplayer works very well, and on the easier settings its great for younger kids as well.

Its a game you can pick up and put down very easily, you don't have to invest a lot of time into it, but if you want to unlock all the achievements then there is enough content that you can invest the extra time if you wish. 

Also (sorry valve) if you have a switch then this is one of the games i strongly recommend getting on that platform. It's perfect for playing during a long commute."

Risk of Rain 2 is a surprising achievement not only for its insanely fun and accessible monster hunting action, but also for its seamless cross-platform multiplayer and non-intrusive free-to-play mechanics. Removing much of the supporting systems' complexity from games like Monster Hunter leaves a core that’s immensely fun to dive into for quick sessions or hours on end, even if the depth outside of combat and crafting is occasionally lacking."

7128,"When Covid locked everyone inside I stopped seeing my dad over the weekends for four months. We had played Risk of Rain back when I was seven, so when he found out that a second game had been made, he bought himself and I a copy so that we could play well we were both stuck inside. He passed away five months ago, from a heart attack. Now when I play this game all I remember are all my fond memories of unlocking characters and reading through logbooks. just a month after his death, I bought a copy for my cousin who had been almost as close to him as I had been, since her parents weren't the best around, and now I had spent nearly as much time playing this game with my cousin as I had with my dad. we still miss him dearly, but all of the fond memories lighten the pain.

 ( Also, me and my cousin just bought the new DLC and it's dope as hell! Fun times all around. )"

10/10 great game, have fun fighting over loot when you play with friends."
7151,good game. recommended.
7152,"I played this game on beta for 12 of my 16 hours and returned a week ago to play with friends. I didnt like it much back then but since it had been a few years i decided to try it out again. The game has not improved in any metric whatsoever in those years, with the exception of new content which only goes to make the game more of a cluster f*ck.

Visuals
The art style of this game is simple and works well for the game. That being said, playing this game past the first 20 minutes is visual diarrhea, there are so many brightly colored flashing effects and massive areas of effect that totally destroy visual clarity, that it makes it difficult to even look at the game at the worst of times. 

UI
This games UI is not good. Its not bad but its not good either. Its really unhelpful overall though, especially in the places it should be most helpful. I havent played this game in three years. There are dozens of items. Why dont they say what they do before i pick them up if they can brick my build? Is it really that hard to program? I shouldnt have to get a mod that doesnt work in multiplayer to try and decipher what a rare item does when i see one of it's tier once a game. 
Another UI complaint I have is a specific experience where I opened a scrapper, and right after a monster spawned in from of me. When youre in a menu in a game and an enemy appears, what if your first thought? Mine is escape. Escape from menu. Every game for 20 years. Not this one. It opens my pause menu and click back onto the screen to escape that. Where i click back in is where my best item is and it eats it. Nice menus.

Gameplay
Of every roguelike i played this game has the least build diversity. Items are all passive stat increases to your character or on hits for your character. The exception to this being activated items and lunar seed items. 
The activated items are one of two things, buff for your character or area damage.
Lunar seed items can brick your build if you dont know what they do. This has happened everytime ive tried picking one up. I complained about this to my friends and they said ""oh yea i dont get any of those it usually isnt worth."" Neat.

Final Thoughts
Third Person Shooter Rogue-like with entirely generic and uninspired mechanics, poor visual fidelity and less than great UI makes a game that I will never play again. I know a lot of people love this game, including many of my friends but its just so... underwhelming. The final game for me was great up until the final 2 round. In the next to last round I got one shot by a chain of explosions set at my feet by a dying enemy right at the beginning of the stage, sitting me out for 15 minutes waiting for my friends to complete the level, followed by the first item I picked up in the next level bricking my build from high attack speed on hits with ranger to a replaced primary skill that could only be deployed every several seconds, with no tracking aim. I went from massive thousands of dps per second to low hundreds. Games trash man, I dont get it"
7153,"Fun game with low skill floor and high ceiling.
Many characters, passive and active items to collect during each run.

You can cheese monsoon (highest normal difficulty) with relics (activatable passive at character selection), but there is a ascension system similar to slay the spire that makes the game much harder bit by bit with relics disabled."
7154,"I 100% recommend getting this game. its very fun, its very easy, relatively affordable. I have had some trouble opening the game but its still very fun."
7155,"It's muck but worse. Great game overall 10/10, would buy again."

7240,"The game is overall great with a few hiccups here or there. 

Gameplay is fun, addicting, and has a great loop that makes you wanna keep playing, in the last two weeks as of writing this review I have added 35 hours to my previous time played. While I am not the biggest fan of the games soundtrack it is enjoyable enough and it is a good listen on occasion, although I would rather listen to my own music or a podcast. Graphically it is good as well, and the fact I can run it near max settings on a 2018 700$ gaming laptop is very pleasing for me since I don't have to give up fidelity for more frames. The character selection, map, and item selection is good, with the base game giving a wide selection of playstyles and terrain to have fun with and master your skills.

Some downsides is mostly having to do with difficulty. It can be extremely easy, even on normal mode, to fall drastically behind to the progressive enemy strength curve. Be it from not enough chests and multi-shops spawning, to the stage teleporter being far away from spawn or the teleporter being hidden inside or under some stage geometry. Enemies gold and xp not scaling as quickly with their levels be it from the timer or stage makes each beginning stage very slow, which causes the loop of being behind in items and on the timer which dictates how hard the enemies have gotten. My only other real issue is the relatively small character pool and enemy variety, I wish there was more base characters and enemy variety in the game, since it can get boring at times playing the same characters over and over and killing the same enemy but with different attributes and such if you are on a long gaming session. I've also occasionally ran into spawning falling through the map, but it's only happened to me a couple times in my 38 hours of playing,

Overall the game is good, it has some personal grievances with me but nothing severe, after all I keep playing the game lol. While the issues the game has for me can cut into its fun factor from time to time, in the grand scheme of things it isn't the end of the world. I highly recommend this game, it is a solid 8/10 experience, be that playing by yourself or playing with friends."

Notes:
I recommend buying the Survivor of the Void DLC; it includes a couple of extra things, new dimensions, and 2 new survivors to the game that make the game even more fun! 

When you first start out a run, there are different ""stages"" that the run goes through. The three difficulties (Drizzle, Standard, Monsoon) determines how long/fast each stage progress through time. This game is the literally definition of mayhem when you progress longer into your run.

WARNING: Runs are NOT savable. You have to complete them in one sitting, either beating the game, obliterating yourself, or disappearing (fate unknown). (Although you could kill yourself but it could prove difficult when you're broken OP and kinda pointless to take a loss).

While this game is soloable (solo runs), it is more fun to play in multiplayer. Modded versions (both single and multiplayer) are also common and are also very fun as well. 

Overall, the game is a massive blast to play, especially with friends! Highly recommend getting this game 15/10!"

7275,fun
7276,"Risk of Rain 2, a game I didn't care about in a genre I hated, has become one of my favorite games. 

TL:DR - Risk of Rain 2 is a Co-Op (4-Player) Third-Person Rogue-Lite with a focus on 13 unique characters, who gain items through semi-randomized stages on various parts of an alien planet, traversed by using teleporters. Their main goal is to survive and escape via a multitude of exits, but most predominantly their captive ship, which the main boss has on lockdown. The game has a blend of character abilities and items, which alter how every run is played, ranging from minor buffs such as ""+5 extra armor"", to ""Every kill summons sentient spectral daggers which lock onto a target and bleed them to death"". There is a very large amount of lore to every item in the game, every character, species, etc. It also rewards the player for playing the game and completing achievements, as every achievement unlocked adds a new item for use. It has curated challenges every week, a wave-based survival mode, and a mode which adds up to 8 extremely hard modifiers on the hardest difficulty based on your skill. Every mode has a leaderboard as well. 

As I said at the start, I never really liked Rouge games. I enjoyed the few I played and welcomed the challenge, but, I like to hoard items in games and play a certain way, and since you lose everything when you die or win, I ended up not playing as much because I always had to change my playstyle away from what I liked. With Risk of Rain, I get to pick a character and set of abilities which are always there, but are affected by the items I get. It allows me to play in a style I want, but each run is changed due to the way I need to utilize that character's kit with different items. In this, Risk of Rain gives the player great amounts of freedom. Below is a short summary of each main feature. 

The Characters: Risk of Rain 2 has 11 characters by default (13 if you buy Survivors of the Void) all of whom offer a unique playstyle, different from the rest. By default, you will have 2/11, and the others are unlocked via basic challenges told to you in the selection screen. While some are similar by means of primary attack (Loader and Merc are primarily melee for example), their other abilities dramatically alter how you traverse the planet (Loader can swing around the map with a grappling hook, place electric drones, heal on hit, and no fall damage; Merc can dash multiple times, weaken enemies, and has a double jump). However, every ability in every slot can be changed via completing challenges for each character, unlocking new ways to play a character (Loader can do an AoE explosive slam instead of the shock drone; Merc can throw blades instead of dash). These challenges will usually test your skill with a character, as they encourage you to do goofy things, or give you insight to different strategies (One of loader's challenges reveals that gaining momentum to gains extra damage). Additionally, beating a run on the max difficulty will unlock a unique outfit for each character. 

The Items: There are 6 (7 with Survivors of the Void) item tiers in Risk of Rain 2. The color is related to the tier of the item, ala Borderlands. Despite the term 'Tier' being used, almost no item is truly useless. Every single item is good and has a place for a build in the game. Each tier has items that correlate to their purpose, such as White items being basic upgrades, Green items being more for utility, or add benefits to attacks. Red items are considered Legendaries, and dramatically increase the player's power. Yellow items are Boss items, as they are exclusively dropped by bosses, and each boss has their own item, albiet with a small chance to drop. Orange items are 'Equipment', or an extra, universal ability, which can drop randomly from chests and are usable by all characters. Blue items are specialized items which come with a great benefit, but yield a great handicap. Uniquely, they can completely change your character's abilities in exchange for others. All items are unlocked via playing the game passively, and unlocking achievements. An example for each tier is listed below. 
White:  ""+25% attack speed""
Green:  ""Gain an additional jump"".
Red:      ""Killing an enemy has a chance to resurrect them as an ally until their death""
Yellow:  ""All critical hits deal bleed damage, enemies bled to death will now explode""
Orange: ""Gain 100% critical chance"". 
Blue:      ""+100 damage, but -50% health""

The Gameplay: The game starts with you landing on the planet with nothing but your skills. To progress, you need to find a teleporter, indicated by distinct red sparkles it gives off. While doing so, you will be constantly attacked by monsters. Defeat them to earn gold, use gold to open chests scattered around the stage. the difficulty is based on how much time you've been playing, and will mercilessly punish slackers who cannot loot or kill efficiently. The game is incredibly simple, yet the more you play, the more intricate it becomes. Enemies will scale with your level, new monster types will begin spawning based on the time and stage, and even elemental variants will become more common. There are 6 (7) elemental types, which all give bonuses to the monsters, and possibly even their allies. Ranging from healing each other on their death, removing your ability to heal/cloak, or simply inflict freeze or fire (These 'Aspects' can drop for players, giving you a permanent, passive elemental buff, but its a 0.025% chance). Eventually you may be 2-hours into a run and ONLY bosses start spawning because the game understands you're too powerful for default enemies. Then, they too, become elemental, special bosses that can negate some of your status effects or healing. The game thrives on chaos and extreme power-tips. Additionally, Risk of Rain 2 has a lot of secrets, such as endings, items, and even map details that open new areas, all found via exploring the stages. The game has more than just the repetitious, yet satisfying combat loop, It rewards exploration and experimentation. 

The Lore: it may not look like it, but Risk of Rain as a series has some impressive lore. It covers every single item in the game, as well as every single species, boss, stage, character, and even reflects some entities not found within the game. It has a very large world building scene, all discovered via the log entries and some key details on the stages, reflecting the way in which Dark Souls covers some of its stories. In that regard, Risk of Rain also delivers, as it elaborates on the tale of each item and their original wielder, the main bosses' emotional states and background, the survivors of the crashed ships on the planet, etc. There are hundreds of logs to read, which are given to you as you use an item for the first time, defeating an enemy, finding it on the stage in a hidden spot, etc. The game rewards your time in more ways than just power. It rewards your curiosity as to why you're there, or why everything wants to kill you on sight. 

Overall, Risk of Rain 2 is an astounding game. It offers exceptional gameplay, paired with a huge amount of build variety per character. It has a massive stockpile of weapons, gear, and items that make you feel like you're gaining strength, as most items provide meaningful stats. The stages are all unique and isolated from one another so it doesn't feel like you're playing the same map every stage; it has a massive artistic appeal due to the designs of each stage, enemy, and attack. The game respects our investment to it. The more you play, the more you devote time to achievement hunting, or to a character, it will respect you enough to reward you something new, every time. A new item, a new character, or a bit more lore to help understand what your purpose in-game is. I'd definitely recommend buying this game at full price if you like Rogue-Lites, or want to try to get into them.

I'd also recommend an umbrella."

9/10, it´s my 3rd favourite game and I would really recommend it to everyone."
7301,"my friends forced me to buy this, stayed for railgunner"
7302,good game
7303,"Game's fine - fun even. Played it through to the credits.

However, I bought this game so I could unwind after work absent the typical gamer toxicity you find in multiplayer games. While the faithful recreation of the ""rofl lol get wrecked noob"" kind of messages every time you die may be charming to some, it wasn't what I was looking for and will be a turn off to players looking for a single-player rogue-like experience to unwind to, so I can't recommend this game on those grounds.

To put it another way, I don't care to spend my evenings on a rogue-like that berates me for dying when dying is an integral and expected part of the rogue-like experience."
7304,"The game is great.
But I won't give it a positive review until you fix the bug that crashes the game at final boss."
7305,"Excellent Shootager and rougelike
"
7306,"Very hard and fast paced. Nice to have a game where you can squeeze in a run every now and then.
"
7307,"In the very first few hours playing with friends,
I got the Glowing Meteorite
and then coming across an equipment drone, without zero clue what it does, I activated it

The entire sky was blue for 80% of the entire run with my friends screaming in confusion as one by one we all died.

7356,One of the best rouge likes I've ever played.
7357,i be playin this with my friend for hours. hell yea
7358,"More fun than it looks, recommend either reading the wiki or having somebody thats experienced play with you first few times to understand whats possible"
7359,"ITS AWESOME
"
7360,"The best enjoyment of  risk of rain, is how how much you can customize the experience, from which of the survivors you want to play each giving different play styles, to being able to customize that further with alt skills adding more variety. Hell, maybe you dont like a certain aspect of your characters kit at all? Use heresy items and you have even more options.

Want just a fun ride without much stress, or even a good way to learn a character and unlock things? Well you have drizzle, and you can play drizzle with no penalties, maybe you want to kick it up a bit and play rainstorm or monsoon? That's also perfectly viable, and by doing so you unlock some extra goodies that arent remotely mandatory what so ever.

want to really punish yourself and play eclipse? Go right ahead! Test your endurance and brace that brutal challenge, you can do that, and the game will never force you to do so as it provides as much benefits as playing drizzle.

Maybe you really wanna make a run interesting and start turning on artifacts? Sure, thats a great way if you just want something different. This even includes the double edged sword known as command since using it actively slows you down late game, but it can be really good for those tricky unlocks, or maybe your a loot goblin who wants a raw power trip, well then turn on sacrifice.

The biggest strength of Risk of Rain, and why its so popular is that it provides many, many ways to play for different people, and all of them are correct. Can playing with randoms who dont have the same playstyle as you be annoying, yeah it can. But that can go for any game, LFG options are available even if outside the game.

Drizzle, Monsoon, Command, Glass, Simulacrum, Eclipse, all are equally valid ways to enjoy the game!

Definitely a great game i would recommend, and if your new to roguelikes, i think this is by far the best entrypoint into the genre"
7361,"Perfect game for playing with friends, can be as casual or advanced as you want it to be."
7362,"Great game, wish I had bought it earlier"
7363,zxs
7364,"Solid rogue like game, a lot of replayability and a lot of fun. Great art style, music, items, characters, bosses, monsters... they are all great.

The only issue I have with this game is you can play the game where you can select the items you get at a given rarity (as opposed to random items) by using an artifact (you unlock them in game). There are I believe more than a dozen artifacts, but this one artifact COMPLETELY CHANGES the game.

Yes you can not use it, but it makes builds so much more powerful and satisfying that the game feels way slower and harder (in a bad way) without it.

I wish that in game when you got an item, instead of getting a random item you could choose from 3 or 5 options, I think that way you wouldn't be able to go absolutely crazy OP builds and also have some RNG in it. 

I'd give it a 9/10"
7365,yes
7366,good
7367,Its a 3rd person Binding of Isaac without the mommy fetish.

7373,"I only got ror2 on steam two days ago, but I've been playing on console for hundreds of hours and cam fully say that this is one 9f the most repayable, well designed games I have ever played. Even though it can be a little daunting to get into for new players, I thoroughly recommend this game to everyone interested in the genre"
7374,"Positives:
+ Steam Achievements, and Trading Cards.
+ Ten plus characters with alternate skills to unlock.
+ A crazy amount of skills, and abilities to collect and use.
+ Every run feels different even after 300 hours on the Xbox Version, and 10 on PC.
+ 4-player Co-Op (16 player if you edit game files).
+ Cross play with Epic Games Store.
+ Multiple game modes at the start of the game.
 
Negatives:
- Online Lobby search ""feels dead"" at times.
- Game is WAY better with friends who can communicate."
7375,"Really fun to play alone and with friends, as well as it is fun to play around with all of the characters finding stupidly broken builds

7398,i find its better played with friends
7399,"I'll try to keep this brief. I have multiple friends that play this game over and over, doing run after run after run, for hours on end back to back. They convinced me to buy the game and DLC while it was on sale. 

The game has many playable characters which have different mechanics, attacks, and play-styles, this combined with the many random items you find throughout the game give it a lot of depth, and pairs nicely with the mechanic that directly ties enemy difficulty to how long the run has lasted.

It's a decent game, unfortunately that's all it is, and I stopped enjoying it after only three or so runs, after that it's just the same repetitive slog, where your fate is decided by item RNG. 

It's not worth the $25 price, and absolutely NOT worth the almost $50 price when you add all the DLC into the mix. I'd only suggest getting it if it goes on a really big sale."

It's so much fun learning the items and figuring out fun combos to try to get and the amount of 'secret' things to find in and about the game just adds to it. Can't recommend this game enough if you're into the genre."

7471,"Be advised that this game needs some serious quality of life enhancements to make things less painful for anyone going into it solo and blind. 

Here is some advice: 

- Commando, despite being the marquee character, is probably one of the worst in the game. Pick someone else as soon as you can. 
- Play on the lowest difficulty level until you learn the game, then ramp up the difficulty from there.
- Your primary objective is to find the teleporter and activate it. Go open more chests later once you have the money from the teleporter fight."
7472,"nice game
"
7473,"Easily my favorite roguelike game of all time. RoR2's gameplay loop is like doing weed without the doing weed part. You just get so absorbed with the flow of the game you lose focus of your surroundings and can only really think of the game. Which shows how solid the gameplay is overall.

One thing I need to bring up is the music. The whole soundtrack has a weird and alien motif to em all that also fits with the otherworldly feel of all the maps you go to throughout the game. Not to mention they are straight up bangers in their own rights.

The game itself lets you choose between a set cast of characters that are still being added with more upcoming updates and dlc. No character in this game plays exactly like the other which helps add another layer of replayibility on top of the already high ceiling of replayibility in the game.

My personal favorite thing about the game is how it goes about with the unlockables. They range from equippable items to characters to even character abilities. I love this unlock system so much is because to unlock one these options you always need to do a specific thing while playing the game. Some challenges may require you to kill a certain amount of enemies with a specific ability, maybe you have to reach a high speed level while playing with a specific character. Some of these challenges require you to do things with certain characters that you might not have thought to do before and in turn you would also get a cool unlockable to use on your next run. Its a constantly moving feedback loop that makes the gameplay all the more exciting.

RoR2 is so hectic, so fast paced, that returning to this game every once in a while may just lead to more hours of insane fun.

7488,"This game is a proper masterpiece, and I find myself coming back to it, even after unlocking everything several times through, each run is unique and will never happen again, though you could eventually get the same result. for a rouge like having a proper boss (or rather 3) for the multiple unique endings, Get the DLC if you have the cash, don't if you have the friends. I wish the items would in vanilla have live amounts, similar to the mod that tells you how the stack works from its math side, I.E telling me the actual increase in damage cause by having 2 sticky bombs versus just 1, but modding is off with DLC at the moment, a personal problem as far as i can tell (and just to put it out there, currently rex/fiend main)"
7489,I have a lot of fun with friends AND solo play.  I find that I am able to improve despite not being great at the game.  And finding new combinations of equipment is always fun.  Lots of secrets a lore to find.

Every run is unique and different and there is a lot of variety to how the survivors play.   It deserves its great rating.  I also like the DLC with some almost all good changes to the game in this update.  I still keep it installed because you never know when I will want to play this for an hour or eight hours.

One of the best rougelikes out of the ones I've played. Super fun alone and with friends. I wish some attacks were less frustrating to deal with, like Grandparent's Solar Flare or the Lunar Chimera's Rapid Fire. All I want is for the player to be given the ability to actually dodge them instead of having to use environment or running away to stand a chance. Also, buff Mercenary a bit. Just a tiny bit. Nothing game breaking. Increase his base damage maybe? Swing speed? Eh."

7582,"I'll start off by saying this game plays very well but it's not even close to what some of the tags say. I don't understand how this is a rougelike. Rougelike games typically require some level of skill. For instance, it's nearly impossible to grab items on the screen without taking severe damage since the enemies just never stop spawning, even for a couple of seconds. The more you kill, the more they appear more quickly and in increased numbers. So you just aim your cross-hairs and keep the trigger pulled while hoping for an escape path, This game is a 3D bullet hell where you're constantly surrounded by an increasingly large swarm of enemies. I don't find bullet hell games fun but, if that's the kind of game you enjoy, this one plays well.

Edit: You can give me all of the clown awards you want. I didn't allow comments because I'm not opening myself up to abuse from die hards. Games like Hades, Going Under, Streets of Rogue, and Gunfire Reborn share common traits like learning enemy patterns, proper timing, and using the battlefield to your advantage. Risk of Rain 2 is a never-ending-swarm simulator where none of those concepts apply and most of the reviews or tags are misleading and not helpful. People should know what they're buying before spending hard earned money on this game."
7583,"This game is so much fun. It's fun with friends, or alone. Never gets old.
I think I'm addicted..."
7584,Never ending satisfaction
7585,"Bigger Bungus, Better Person"
7586,"Leaving a review for this game is fairly challenging  as i have mixed feelings on it. So i will break it up into pros and cons for simplicity sake. (This review will largely focus on Monsoon the highest difficulty setting, but will be applicable to other difficulties as well.)
Pros.
-lots of characters and variety for many different play styles
-the rouge like characteristics keep runs fresh and interesting
-the recent SOV update is extremely polished and mostly added good things to game.
-Its a nice casual game to run through with friends.
-the game is very in depth and has a lot of neat little features and tricks that you can learn with each character.
Cons.
-its difficult when playing with friends to keep track of the amount of items each person is getting, often times leading to one player being severely under-powered.
-If you are playing with friends and die early on in a stage you are punished severely, you will not collect any items putting you way behind, you will get no XP, and you will spend the entire rest of the stage simply spectating others playing. this can lead you into a downward snowball of being repeatedly  killed at the start of stages due to the increasingly stronger enemies, and the distinct lack of levels and items.
-for a game where runs often take hours to complete, often times they end with you being killed in one shot by something you could not see coming.
-By far the worst of the negatives comes with the change to one of the final bosses, Mythrix, and more specifically the addition of phase 4 where he takes ALL of the items the player has up until that point. in many scenarios this will result in a swift death, keeping in mind one would have spent hours getting to said final boss. for some survivors like Railgunner who has adequate range and little need for items this phase provides nothing but a simple hurdle. but to those without ranged attacks, Mercenary, Loader, Acrid. This phase seems completely one sided and unfair. The issues is further exacerbated by certain items. if you were to pick up an item that gives you a summon, he now has it and will actively use it against you while you have no movement speed, defense, or health to protect yourself. using another example, if you were to pick up an item called safer spaces (which blocks the first hit you take before going on cool-down) on a character with little ranged it becomes near impossible to actually damage Mythrix which is the required action you need to take in order to receive your items back. there is many more examples of items that almost completely nullify your chance at winning the main point is that this phase limits what items you can and cannot pick up, or forces you to seek an alternative ending for certain characters leading to a rather un-climactic end to runs and or frustrating deaths caused by picking up certain items (which is one of the main mechanics in the game) it literally is punishing you for playing the game. 

With the play time that I have it is easy to discern that I largely enjoyed this game, and if you are actively interested in a casual game to play with some buddies I would recommend it. However, this game is extremely frustrating and frankly unfair at times. my main issue as should be obvious is with the added phase to Mythrix which creates a huge artifical difficulty spike, which affects certain characters drastically more than others at a point in the run where you would have spent a considerable amount of time just to get there. this game can be fun to play with some friends from time to time, but is often times extremely frustrating and unforgiving for the amount of time required for each run.

7600,"While at first this game was fun, I find it more annoying than anything. The main gimmick of the game is playing fast so that later parts aren't as difficult, but when you do that you're underpowered as shit. Even on the easiest mode, by the time you reach the last areas you're screwed no matter what. I would like to note that this is mainly from a singleplayer perspective. I have almost no friends who have this game that still want to play it. When I did play with them, the game was just as hard and unrewarding, but at least I had someone to talk to during it. Maybe it will get better as I play, but I see no reason to continue. The gameplay is unrewarding, the characters range from OP to why would you ever choose them, the areas are repetitive and depending on your character very hard to traverse, bosses are also repetitive/repeated multiple times in one run, and the story isn't gripping at all."

It is genuinely the most fun I've had getting beat up hundreds of times for hours at a time.
15/10 Highly highly recommended."
7610,good
7611,"I love this game, but god the gameplay loop gets really old fast. Its not finished, and the fact that a paid dlc was released for content that feels like it should've been a part of the base game is lame. DLC used to be huge additions to the game, not little bits of content here and there. The base game is extremely bare bones, and once you unlock all the characters and their skins it becomes boring. Wouldn't recommend unless the they actually add more stuff to the base game, which they have, barely. 

In short, i love this game and how it plays, but its still in beta. Dont release DLC's for a game thats still in beta."

7630,this game is so addictive in a good way! the multiplayer has allowed me to have so much fun with my friends. the music is also amazing. the music adds so much to the game play it matches the vibes of the zones that you travel.  10 out of 10 amazing game.
7631,"A great time! Much more than just a mindless shooter game. Beyond your character's abilities are and the basics of how to move and interact, you are given no instructions. You must fight, defend, explore, discover, unlock, and, most of all, do it as a team (or at least, teaming is much better than solo in my opinion). The game teaches you to think about your enviroment and abilities and use them to your advantage in order to progress to the next stage, and to unlock new areas and items which you probably thought never existed. The final boss doesn't have to be the end - there are other ways off of this world."

7639,"This is, THE GREATEST Rouge-like of all time. Even just basic gameplay feels great, every character has a unique gameplay style, making builds around certain aspects of their characters is great (since there aren't many items that will ""ruin"" a run, most items that don't fit into your build will still help you anyways), area design is perfect (since while every area has a random spawn locations for chests/the exit teleporter, but the level design itself is the same every time), and the soundtrack is GAMING. Very easy to get overpowered, but one wrong move will still throw you straight back to square one. Great for multiplayer as well. Truly perfect. ALSO MOD SUPPORT, THAT'S A THING, DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MOD SUPPORT."
7640,No better game out there 10/10 will die to Sahelanthropus surprise spawns again
7641,"Amazing game! Super fun to play alone, and even better with friends. 

It might take some time to get used to the game, and it can feel a bit overwhelming at the start.
There are 14 Survivors to choose from, all are unique with their own mechanics, and a LOT of different items/upgrades to learn.

Matches are about 30-60 minutes going the ""intended"" path, but you can also go on forever.
Multiple gamemodes to pick between as well.

Something that i really like is that every achievement is tied to an unlock, and if one person in the lobby has the unlock, everyone has it.

Definitely get the SotV DLC as well.

Some of the challenges to unlock the various moves and items can be a bit annoying but most are achievable relatively easily if you set up your runs specifically for them.

I hadn't touched it in a while, because there just wasn't all much content to being with, but today I did, and playing it now, the situation has managed to almost entirely reverse itself. From DLC that is far overpriced for the minimum it provides to gameplay tweaks that actively discourage playing the game, the developers have managed an impressive campaign in self-destruction."

7718,"I came into the game expecting it to be as good as Dead Cells based on the number of positive reviews that it had received. It's not as good. Not by a longshot. 

Now, I'm not saying it's a bad game but... generally speaking it devolves into a big numbers simulator later in the run. This would be fine if the game was designed in a way that allows you to do amazing stuff when you get that far, like Dead Cells, but... the numbers is all you get and you either insta-gib enemies or they insta-gib you. Some people may find that to be enjoyable but I'd prefer to actually have some gameplay that goes beyond aim-kill and yes, that is just my personal opinion.

I'd give the game a middle of the road score if I could but because Steam only allows for polarized reviews I'm gonna give it a thumbs down. If only because the game feels really, really shallow.

I do hope it rains, for this puddle is exceedingly small."

I first started playing the game back in Early Access, before a lot of things were added to the game. I had pirated the game at that point thinking it wouldn't be a permanent staple in my gaming diet. After my 2nd or 3rd run, I knew for sure that I had to buy this game. Every penny of the price tag is worth it for the amount of fun I've had. I can still load up the game today and discover things I didn't know you could do.

With the release of Survivors of the Void, as well as talk of new DLC being released in the future, I can not express through words how much you need to buy this game"

In my opinion this game is a must buy for any rougelike fan.

This game doesnt have the fluffy story of destiny 2 but its get the gameplay better.  You can grind completing all the accomplishments and average gamer can do it, and then even the extra logbook content for some more goals.  Then after that its just a fun as heck game thats super replayable because of rng and friends and different characters.  You can break the game, the game can break you, or you can even use in game mods in the form of artifacts to do even crazier runs.  What a diamond in the rough this game is!"

7846,"[h1] 10/10. All of the Risk, None of the Rain. [/h1]

Great game honestly. Amazing music, Fun game-play, Helpful and Friendly community, what more could you want? I loved the game even in the early stages, after it got recommended to me by a friend. The SOTV DLC imo wasn't needed, but it definitely added some different and fun changes / challenges. Even if you aren't into rouge-like games, i would still recommend this game, its nothing like I've ever played before. Another thing, is the lore; There's so much lore hidden around but its enough that it makes a cohesive story. Looking into the lore isn't required, but i would say check it out, it gets very interesting.  

Good luck, fellow survivor."

7868,"It's one of the best chill n play roguelike. This game is one of the games that you can play to relieve some stress by casually playing as well as talking with friends. The mechanics n build of every character also differs a lot if you want to learn to play this game in higher difficulty. Difficulty of the game increases over the time, so you have to complete the levels as fast as you can and even the normal difficulty is hard to beat. I mean I haven't even completed the game at normal difficulty yet but the thing is I don't mind that.
The way game is made, even after losing you learn a lot of things about the boss who defeated you as well as the different items you got in that run so every run in the game is quite unique in its own ways. That's the reason why the game has unlimited play ability and every time you learn something new and improve from that. This helps you make a build which suits you according the way you play. I haven't played a lot of games which are this rewarding as your time n experience increases.
This is the reason why I can totally recommend this game to any casual gamer who wants to try something new."
7869,yes
7870,game is too good
7871,Have not experienced any rain in 70h.
7872,From graphics to user interface this thing is good
7873,When the Rain is Risk (x2!)
7874,I enjoy

7876,Oh shit its raining
7877,This game sucks...
7878,Pretty fun ngl
7879,rain
7880,its ok
7881,"The game is decent but it gets so repetitive and enemies turn into bullet sponges and game doesnt have that variety when it comes to maps ,maybe the new dlc would make it more fun but I didnt get satisfied from the main to risk wasting money on a dlc just to make the main game fun"
7882,"Had to switch to a controller because my finger went numb. 

Now I can play another 100 hours."
7883,if you like a solid rouge like with 3d movement and guns try this and enter the gungeon too
7884,fun
7885,piss of pain
7886,As an fps player I feel really satisfied about this first rogue-like game of mine. Call your friends!
7887,"I loved Risk of Rain and played the hell out of it, and when I found out about Risk of Rain 2 I was confident enough to buy it early access. I did have fun with RoR2, unlocking the new characters as they were added in and trying out new things, but when the last ""free"" character was announced, I instantly lost interest in the game. Announcing paid DLC of characters, levels, items and game modes before the game was even out of early access killed my want to continue playing, and that of anyone I knew who played it.
You can have fun playing this alone for some cool builds and hectic runs. You can have fun playing this with friends for some crazy antics and ramping madness. But if you end up paying around $35 dollars and then are asked for more than $20 more for basically the full game, I wouldn't blame you for dropping it."
7888,haha gun go brrrrrr
7889,yea
7890,decent
7891,f u n
7892,good game

7894,"Honestly, one of the best games i have ever played. 

Buy it, you won't regret it"
7895,God runs are the reason why I play this game.
7896,Do not be deceived and expect actual rain in this game as there exists no such thing. You have two choices that aren't totally yours to make when you start a run; you either become the rain or get washed away.
7897,Great game about exploring and fighting monsters
7898,yes
7899,bungus good
7900,this is one of the games ever
7901,This game is cool but I still miss my wife
7902,"The game felt a little weird at first (not a bad thing), it was because I didn't know what the hell I was doing and trying to figure the game out. I did a few stages and started to get the hang of it. Once my friends and I got going the game was so addictive. I highly recommend this game but be aware it is a high pressure game of tense firer fights all the way through. The character classes, items, level design, enemies, etc are all perfectly developed for you to have fun with it. The replay value is very high and for $13 bucks this is a deal for sure! The first game was ok but part 2 is amazing!"
7903,run slow. shoot slow. buy parts of bird slow.

7927,"it is a good game
"
7928,"Quite possibly my favorite game in my Steam library, I already owned it on console but this is definitely the best platform to play it on!"
7929,good game ver fun
7930,Something about the cross platform play with epic games is horribly messed up. And has been since they launched it. I just realized you can toggle that cross play on and off in the settings. Really hope they fix that.
7931,"3d roguelike? that's good? can't be.

In all honesty, this is one of those that absolutely eats your time. you can pump in 200 hours and still not unlock everything, but there are ways of gaming the system so that you don't miss out on everything. 

Devs don't seem to want to nerf anything that's good to so that's a plus. 

go play it"
7932,it just gets better
7933,Amazing roguelike monster shooter. Soundtrack is top notch. Every character is fun to play. Easy to lose yourself for hours playing this.

7948,"A typical roguelike game will have a honeymoon phase while you learn the game, try out various builds, and find exciting combos. Once you've experienced everything the game has to offer, the prospect of playing more generally loses some or most of its appeal. 

Risk of Rain 2 is an exception to this trend in that my enjoyment of the game has steadily grown the more I play. Even with nothing new to discover, the core gameplay is fun enough that I'm now playing it more than ever. Would solidly recommend to any fan of the genre."
7949,goofy funny times
7950,"a wonderful seizure machine whose experience literally essentially is enhanced under the influence of a Spinel Tonic, particularly actually contrary to popular recommendations by most optometrists in a generally big way."
7951,"This is a masterpiece and we all know it but there's a big BUT in here and that's for the multiplayer option that is really cheap it needs much more work on it and it could so many abilities such as trading items or like dropping the item you accidentally picked up and much more. the game itself it's amazing i hope it has an amazing community and amazing devs who really listen to us! 

Thanks for all the work 9.999996/10 <3"
7952,"i took a big risk buying this game cause i didnt even know what it was about. Now im sitting back during the rain outside sipping on some ""fresh apple cider shhhhhhhhhhhhhp aaah thats some good cida"""

7958,Its fun.    :)
7959,"Pretty fun and casual little roguelike with a decently sized chunk of lore embedded, although it feels a bit cryptic and hard to read. Multiple difficulty settings and no punishment for playing on easier modes is a very nice feature, difficulty settings are also well balanced. Game feels easy on easy, challenging on medium, and a struggle on hard.

Difficulty scaling is probably the coolest mechanic in my opinion. I haven't seen this in any other game, but it works so well. It's a clever way to punish overpreparation but also reward underpreparation. It allows you to play the game two ways. You can play slow, and get a lot of money and items, or play fast, and just slay things while barely touching on chests or cash, and either way has the same difficulty.

Multiple survivors with ACTUALLY different playstyles is a cool feature. Typically games like this with multiple characters have different abilities, but overall very similar gameplay. So far from what I can tell, the survivors in this game each seem to have a specific strategy you will be using throughout the whole run. For bandit you will always be turning invisible and getting to the backs of enemies, for huntress you will be constantly sprinting, for REX you have to carefully watch your healthbar, etc.

I also heavily appreciate the manipulation you can do the RNG in this game. Multishop terminals that give you a choice of 3 items all costing the exact same is nice. Shredding items you don't want and being able to bring them to a 3D printer and making tons of an item you do want is even nicer. Artifact of Command allows you to turn off RNG entirely if you are going for a very specific set-up, and you aren't punished for it at all."

7978,"One of the greatest games ever made, truly like no other."
7979,Just started playing it. All I have to say is this game is a masterpiece and a must-play. Suitable for literally everyone. And it went from 2D risk of rain to 3D risk of rain 2. I honestly don't have to add anything else to this review. Amazing game.

7986,"I've played this pretty much exclusively with friends and it is probably some of the most fun random chaos you can have without a true ""party game"" setting. The enemies are super great and actually pose challenges, the gear is super diverse and all of it is usable and allows for any type of game-play, and overall it is super enjoyable overall. I highly recommend this!"

In short download the game is worth every penny. And do not get upset if you do not succeed for the 135th time. The game is just too difficult and you have to lower the level of difficulty

The game play loop is addicting.
It takes time to learn the basics, but you'll soon find yourself enjoying the gameplay.
Different from other Rouge-likes, Risk of Rain 2 doesn't allow you to get ""stronger"" or get any permanent upgrades. You will have to practice your skills to be stronger. The game does have permanent unlock Artifacts and alternative abilities, which allows you to have new play styles and new game plans.

Overall, heavily recommended."

Also, stuff can get complicated and there are a lot of hidden stats so you might wanna use the wiki."

8081,"Absolutely amazing fun with friends and family.
Played Risk of Rain with my friends for hours and now I get to play the second one even longer!

Immortal temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Fallen weak on my knees, summon the strength
Of mayhem
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can't run away
Keep walking the line between the light
Led astray
Through vacant halls I won't surrendеr
The truth revеaled in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost, and now they remember
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking black clouds and isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames, I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descent in misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsession's pulling me
Fading, I've got to take what's mine
Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette
Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict of darkness, summoned from the ashes
The puppet master congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power?
Then come try and take it
Beyond, the tree, fire, burns
Secret love, bloodline, yearns
Dark minds, embrace, crimson, joy
Does your dim heart
Heal or destroy?
Bury the light deep within
Cast aside, there's no comming home
We're burning chaos in the wind
Drifting in the ocean all alone"

8115,game good
8116,"garbage
You pick up an item you can't drop without finding a certain OTHER item. This item halves your health. Now any simple attack from any ordinary mob can kill you in 1-2 hits, and they spawn like crazy.
Now imagine you make it all the way to the end, the final boss dies and his minion just whacks you while you're passing by and ends your entire run.
Now imagine that doesn't happen in the next one, and you make it to your ship only to see that you have to ""defend"" it while it charges up. If you don't get to it on time, you're forced to wait for the game over screen, since the ship can't charge up in time before it's game over. HOW THIS PERSISTED AS A CONCEPT BAFFLES ME.

The game is AT BEST a flash game from 2012. It shouldn't cost money, it should pay you to play it instead.
I never write long / serious reviews for games, but this game is so popular and so fucking un-fun that I can't help but express it.

If you have a brain cell in your head, skip this shit."
8117,BETTER THEN MUCK
8118,watch out for rain btw
8119,good game to waste a couple hours away from your life.

8131,"A stark reminder that real life is just existing until you die, and your own circumstances are largely arbitrary.

Sure, you can simulate what it would be like if you could pick starting conditions and use special rulesets, but that ultimately defeats what little meaning your ""playthrough"" already had. It's better to just suffer in silence, or play a different game entirely."
8132,"Great game. lots to do, great graphic, music is brilliant and many ways to approach each run. Worth the price twice over and the DLC is great as well."

8152,"there is no rain, but the game is still cool"
8153,"The game was very fun, I'm not sure if it is endlessly replayable, since a lot of end points of item builds are just shooting crits as fast as possible, but I did get a lot out of this game. Its also really fun with friends"
8154,"fun
"
8155,Yeah.
8156,"PRO:
- fun game with friends
- looks great, fun repeatability 

CON:
- Multiplayer crashes constantly ( game is 2 years old...)
- Multiplayer disconnects constantly ( game is 2 years old...)
- Cant rejoin multiplayer when disconnected ( game is 2 years old...)
- Kicks all player randomly ( game is 2 years old...)
- Game crashes on certain graphics cards ( game is 2 years old...)
- Game crashed on start up ( game is 2 years old...)

And this is not just specific to me, A group of us play ( 4 people) and this happens for everyone, its dumb. the developers should be disappointed for a 2 year old game."

No regrets."

8160,Really cool Roguelike shooter.
8161,"I'm going to be honest I bought this a while ago and tried it and at first I didn't like it, it sat in my library for a while then one day I was looking for something to play quickly that I didn't before so I gave it a try again. I got spanked like it was my job but I persisted after a bit finally beating the first boss, once I learned the gameplay loop I was hooked, getting that much farther each time. I absolutely love the music and after learning about the lore of the first and this game it adds extra punch when the tempo changes and you're no longer on the backfoot and actively dominating... then dying stupidly due to my hubris. It does what it sets out to do and is as deep story wise as you want to dig at it, fantastic game!"

8219,"Yea, this game is amazing. One of only three games (that I've played) which truly execute on the roguelite genre to it's fullest (the other two being Hades and Dead Cells).

8283,Whelp! I'm afraid I am re-addicted. (Played it on switch for 65 hours before this.)
8284,"...time, Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only just arrived. You've done a great deal in a small timespan. You've done so well, in fact, that I've received some interesting offers for your services. Ordinarily, I wouldn't contemplate them. But these are extraordinary times. Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you...if and when your time comes around again. I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman. I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of...well... I'm really not at liberty to say. In the meantime... This is where I get off."
8285,"Although you won't really see rain, there is always a risk of it.

This game is a rouge-lite type of game, with tons of replayability and many things to unlock. The gameplay is addictive, and although repetitive at first glance, depending on your build things can get very interesting. There's quite a few characters, and each character can unlock different abilities to add some flair to their builds. Top this off with different items which can synergize with your character's abilities, as well as with eachother and you've got yourself endless combinations. Playing with friends is an entirely different experience, and i highly recommend it. The game itself is not demanding (unless you get pretty far and a million enemies spawn), the soundtrack is pretty good and the visuals, although simple, have a charm to them. The DLC available for this game is what DLC should be, adds more stuff to do but isn't essential to the experience.

The only downside to this game compared to other similar games is that you cannot save your progress during a run, which can be inconvenient since the runs can be lengthy. This forces you to either finish the run or die, which means you should reserve some extra time when playing."
8286,One of the best rogue likes i've played
8287,As addictive and thrilling as it is frustrating and cruel. Unique art style and design

8299,"Risk of Rain 2 is almost always a satisfying game to play. It features tons of unique characters, abilities, and items, and it's massive amount of achievements give the game an incredible amount of content and objectives for players to follow. When I first opened this game there were only three characters, Fifty hours in and I'm two away from having the entire roster. Initially I chose the Huntress character ,since railgunner seemed way too complicated and commando was just bad, and I enjoyed the game. The real problem arose when I realized the character had a major flaw though, she simply didn't do enough damage. After trying unlocking Mercenary I tried him, and it was fun, but he didn't work well with my friend's characters. I tried Artificer, and again I didn't do enough damage. No matter who I played I just couldn't win, especially in team play. This was only the beginning of my frustrations. So much in the game began to annoy me. Whether it was certain enemies (I HATE blind pests), bad rng, or MUL-T players taking all my crit-lenses, I was constantly frustrated by this game. Eventually the game got to me and I started to become a worse person in many ways. First it was in the game, I would hog items, I would insult my friends, I would act awful, but then it became an out-of-game thing. I became a rude, decrepit, and vile shell of my former self. Eventually it went too far and lost everything. My wife left me and took my job, my home was repossessed, and I was excommunicated from the Mormon church. I had nothing left but my steam account with this cursed game. I decided I'd load up a run, I called my friends and together we faced the immersive world of Petrichor V one last time. It was a simple run, medium difficulty with no artifacts, but that run would turn my life around. We cruised through the levels and reached the final boss in his lunar domain. This was it, my final, my last recall. Our MUL-T player was the only one left by the end of the fight, but it only took one player to carry us to victory. That same MUL-T who had stolen my crit-lenses not too long ago had won the game for us, and so it was a wonderful victory. I chose to watch the credits for the purpose of sentimentality, and what was at the end was an experience words cannot do justice. It was a strange form of bliss, not overwhelming, but more than adequate, something in my soul congratulating me on a job well done. as all the thanks scrolled past I read those delightsome words. 

""and you, yes you! Thank you!""

And all was well. My journey had been worth it. 
6/10 (blind pests really ruined the experience)."

Be aware that it is somewhat time consuming though, if you look for a game to do a quick 20 minute run, you won't find it here. You cannot ""quit & Save"" a Run. without mods at least.

8321,This game allows you to have fun with your friends and enjoy a good time together. The rage moments in this game ultimately make the pogger moments rewarding to a whole new level. From sweating to memeing around there is a playstyle for everyone in this game. I would recommend this to people who want a fun game to play right now or if they have the money. THIS GAME IS POGGERS thats all I have to say.

8337,"A genuinely fun game to play, especially with friends. I've had a blast playing this, and I can't recommend it enough"
8338,"It's a recommend if you like difficult rogue-likes with engaging combat and multiple strategic options for victory. There will be runs you lose because you get unlucky (welcome to rogue-likes), but for the most part your performance truly is the main difference between life and death. There's also a large community with guides out there if you need extra help (like I did). Really really fun--if at times really really frustrating. 

There's content here to keep you busy for a long time if you want it to :)"
8339,I f*cking love this game. 9.4/10. Definitely buy it. Recommend mods to add replay value.

8347,this game is sick i love this game
8348,"[h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]

[b] Visuals: [/b] 
The art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.

[b] Story and Setting: [/b] 
RoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.

[b] Music: [/b] 
The lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.

[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]
Drop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. 
Most items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.

[b] Game time: [/b]
There is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.

[b] Online: [/b]
There is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.

[b] Bugs: [/b]
No bugs or technical issues.

[b] PC Requirement: [/b] 
Without a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.

[b] DLC: [/b]
Survivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.

[b] Price: [/b]
Worth every penny.

[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]

[b] Rating: [/b] 
The Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. 
I highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]"

8350,"There are a billion rogue-likes out there but this one feels goooooooooooooood. From the animations, sounds, varied enemy design, fun items and move sets, this game gets all the basics right and doubles down on everything fun about video games big recommend thx Hopoo"
8351,fun 3rd person action shooty roguelike. fun writing. i love the dog and the lady with the bow. buy this game if u like having fun and also dying a lot.

8360,"The simplicty and the pure simple joyful feel you get from playing this game is ameowzing.
The game is very friendly pc and have a lot challenge as the level design also top notch.
Once you get hooked on this game you would forget that you already in top level and hard to die xD.
It would be more nice if we can had more maps, enemies and character in the future, though with the new dlc just add new char and enemies, not much new map and thats what make it feel bit dissapointed but i'll take it.

Fun game to solo and more in co op, you'll love pew pew pew your guns here and grind to the hardest level.

8372,"Wish there was a middle like/dislike button. Decent enough roguelike with one of the best OSTs of all time, but lacks the depth of builds that many other roguelikes have. It always seems to be pick up everything except the like 2 items that will brick your build, and sometimes you win. Pretty lame when you compare it to the build customization and choices you make in games like Isaac and Dead Cells. Get those games before this one, and listen to the OST of this game on youtube (The Rain Formally Known as Purple=amazing)."

8374,"It's rare that I find a shooter that I like. It's rare that I find a multiplayer game I enjoy. It's *especially* rare for a game to be both of those things, but still something I can have any amount of fun with. Risk of Rain 2 is all of that and more.

There's bound to be at least one (if not many) playstyles you enjoy out of the selection they give you, the game has a way of keeping things fresh from run to run by changing both the layouts of their maps and which maps you come across entirely, the progression system is straight nutty, and all of this is wrapped up with mind-melting visuals and beats to back it up. If you're worried about not having any friends to play it with, that's totally viable; I've probably spent at least 65 hours on my own at the time of writing.

Give this game a shot. It may beat you into the dirt for a while, but when you get into the flow, there's nothing that quite matches this game at what it's trying to do."
8375, good game
8376,"This is a great, and I mean great game for all gamer levels from beginner to advanced. The bullet hell aspect has had me coming back for many many hours, and the fact that it can be played neigh on infinitely gives it a very high replay value. It can have quite the difficulty spike but in my opinion that is one of the best parts, keeps you on your toes and guessing. all in all a solid 9/10 on my scale."
8377,"Very fun game, Good game play, fun bosses, a lot of secrets!"
8378,not enough morbius

8431,lots of content every run is different good to play with friends
8432,yes
8433,Words cannot describe this game. It's just that good.
8434,"After playing the first Risk of Rain extensively, I wasn't terribly sure how well it was going to translate into 3D. Damn am I glad my worries were unfounded; unbelievably so...

Play the game, it's amazing; OST is god-tier.

There's also Bungus, which is pretty great."
8435,"It took a bit to make it out of early access, and now it's made it with all the features"
8436,"Meh.
I don't know. It's a good sequel, I guess.

But more than seldom you die for some code or software reason, you don't understand. I just stood there, two hours in, no enemies around and just died instantly. And that's where it really pisses you off and you stop playing the game. There was literally no reason for me to die there. The game just took all the time I had spent to build up my super strong guy to epically kill the boss and flushed it down the toilet while rubbing its digital middle finger right in my face. And it happened like five times now!

I loved Risk of Rain 1 and still think this endeavor here is quite cool so I have to keep this thumb up. I just hate when shit crashes on me especially when you can't have a savety save. Probably won't play again.

EDIT: Changed to thumbs down. This just pisses me off! Always these games which could be super duper good and then they didn't make it right. It does not deserve its praise, sadly."

8470,this is the pinnacle of rougelike gaming. it's various characters and abilities leave you wondering what will happen next as every time you play you get different kinds of abilities and a variety of characters to play. deffinitely one of my favorite games at the time. Personally I think the first few levels lack any sort of interesting gameplay or challenge which is why i give this game a 8.5/10

8480,"A while my bf had bought this game, and played, then getting it for me to play it with him.
Then I also had done a few runs with some of my online friends. 
Since I am not a Pc native, I'm very glad that this game has controller support
I have played on a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 (2019ver), and the game certainly runs well, with a little lag but after a while it smooths out
Because this game is a roguelike, things are not unlocked off the bat, but with each subsequent run, you get more entries on items, environments, artifacts, enemies, and can even unlock characters , so it always feels like you're getting something out of each run.
And it gets even better with friends. (and possibly more successful runs)
As you get deeper into playing the game you'll also learn that certain items are good for each character. With that mentioned; the modding community is absolutely amazing for ""Do you like Sett or Kindred from lol?"" You can play them in this game as skins for the existing ""survivors""/playable characters  
Don't like how rng based items are? You can get an artifact for that; which those also unlock depending on how long you'll play/if you're willing to do the work to unlock them.
And the addition of the void expansion, its integration feels very natural to the game itself. 
This game is definitely worth the price."

8482,Addicting and challenging and it has great gameplay and characters
8483,"Risk of Rain 1 was my favorite games of all time... you slowly grow from having a pee shooter to basically going to a full on GOD DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN YOUR PATH! 

And its no different here in risk of rain 2! in fact I would say it is BETTER here with the new 3D environment away from the 2D one that risk of rain 1 had... you are one SPEEDY BOI and the idea of the game is pretty much the same.... you get a bunch of stuff until you eventually become an unstoppable killing machine. 

Defiantly recommend it."
8484,Very chill and satisfying game
8485,Great game. Very very good.
8486,Game good I guess
8487,risk of rain 2 is one of the games of all time
8488,"so ive 100%'d this game now

yea who cares about marriage or love i'd 100% ror2 again instead"
8489,bungus
8490,"[h1] I should've brought an umbrella [/h1]


Risk of rain 2 is a game that takes a little but gives a lot, like enough to fill the mariana trench and then some. And yet each and every aspect of this game has been so polished and refined, it’s absolutely insane. For instance, there’s currently 11 survivors in the game, (with an additional 2 with the DLC), yet each survivor plays so much differently from each other, and every single survivor is viable, not a single one can be defined as ‘bad’ (except commando lol).The survivors are so diverse that there’s truly a playstyle for everyone. Wanna fly around hurling fire and lightning, while summoning ice walls to freeze groups of enemies? Wanna spray bosses in poison and watch while their health bar whittles away while standing in the background, laughing maniacally? You can do that.  Wanna go around shooting random enemies while calling in an entire AIRSTRIKE? Wanna guess what i’m about to say next? You can do that. Also there’s a timer and a little difficulty meter that shows that the game is steadily getting harder as the time on the timer grows. This is such a good decision, by rewarding the player with an easier time when they speed through areas, and loot and kill efficiently. This also means that the game respects the players time, no one wants to spend an hour and a half only to have their run ended by a random enemy.

[h1] Riskiest decision [/h1]


Risk of Rain 2 made some great decisions in terms of design and visuals, and this game differs a LOT from the previous games. One of the biggest and obvious changes is its transition from 2d to the 3d plane. Probably the biggest risk that Risk of Rain 2 took and boy was it the right decision. The whole feel of the game just fits with the 3d aspect, and it adds an insurmountable amount of absolute chaos to the game. Hordes of enemies run up in front of you, sneak up from behind and flank you left and right, you’re constantly running around and doing your best not to get overwhelmed by the crowds of enemies. And movement feels so smooth, sprinting around, jumping above enemies while trying to keep your distance from the swarm on all fronts.

[h1] flood of music [/h1]


The music fits the game so well, that for me, the game and the soundtrack are completely synonymous, the music makes the game and the game makes the music. These tracks are absolute headbangers, the guitar riffs of tracks like ‘You’re gonna need a bigger ukulele’ and ‘köppen as F̷̬͈͚̃̄̚ὐ̶̻̃̉͠¢̵͉̩͇͍̒̾̕κ̸̢̻͆̔ ‘ mesh with the chaotic goodness of Risk of Rain 2’s gameplay and combat and let you know just what you’re in for. And the music also serves as a guide, when the music really starts to pick up indicates that you should be at the teleporter event and trying to move to the next stage, and if it loops, that means that you have spent way too long on this stage.

[h1] You're gonna need a bigger ukulele [/h1]


To sum up the difficulty of the game… It's hard, like really hard. There’s three difficulty options: drizzle, rainstorm, and monsoon. None of these difficulty options ever make the game feel ‘too easy’ or ‘unfair’, hopoo did a great job of balancing this game. And this game is EXTREMELY challenging, especially on monsoon. The boss fights are intense and there’s no feeling like the one you get when you complete a teleporter event that you fought tooth and nail to get through. And without spoiling much, the final boss is almost certainly going to make you look like an absolute fool, he’s a tough fight for sure. Now if the three difficulty options aren’t enough for you, you can spice things up with artifacts, these are gameplay modifiers that seriously shake up the game, there’s one where it lets you choose whichever item you want to pick up whenever you grab an item, making it a lot easier to get those fables ‘god runs’. Or if you want to make the game harder, you can activate one where it takes away 90% of your health but allies deal 500% damage.

[h1] conclusion [/h1]


Risk of Rain 2 is easily my favorite roguelike games, in the top 10 of my favorite indie games. The amount of replayability this game has when you can choose different builds for different survivors with different loadouts is nearly infinite. The game ran absolutely flawlessly on my pc, with no issues in sight. This is a game that you can always boot up after a long day at work and just have fun.

Risk of Rain 2 easily gets a 9/10 in my book.

8491,"Best soundtrack of any game I have ever played. Gameplay is also dope

8492,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold"
8493,"I just did 100% achievements and I'm not done with this game ,gonna get the dlc 2 seems cool"
8494,"a fun and exciting looter shooter, with lots of content to unlock! each run will always feel different due to character selection and artifacts. and with monsoon and eclipse mode, the game is always challenging. The DLC is also a must get, adding two new characters, a whole bunch of enemies, stages and lots of new items. one of my all time favorite games."
8495,suprisingly fun with friends
8496,i liek teh vr mpd
8497,good game just hard to find teloporter it has amazing creatures even poopy flying buttholes

8509,Yes
8510,"Somehow this game can make me feel like the dumbest, least talented player imaginable yet it still be enjoyable enough that I continue to smash my head against the brick wall of its time scaling difficulty. Incredibly fun, wildly unforgiving."
8511,Ahoy!

8513,Fun
8514,good game

now its time to find friends"
8516,.
8517,The game is ok but the mods are 👌
8518,Best game to play when you just wanna chill
8519,"Absolutely excellent. Risk of Rain 2 is the rare sequel that builds and adapts upon it's formula without making it's predecessor obsolete. In that sense, RoR2 is almost a spiritual sequel in the sense of how different it plays from the transition from 2D to 3D space, but it clearly is a sequel in the best way. Each character on offer here brings such uniquely different playstyles, that every run feels challenging in a way that it didn't before hand. You're given abilities that make you feels powerful, but enemies that require smart use of those skills to be successful. And, the game is paced in a very clever way, making you feel powerful as a newbie and cunning as a veteran. It has secrets that encourages players to share information they have found. There are builds that synergize in ways you wouldn't expect. 

Ultimately, Risk of Rain 2 is a triumph. A roguelike that feels old-fashioned in it's presentation by being simplistic: runs that are random and require skill, but also completely modern: extremely distinct characters and playstyles. Please, pick this up. It is one of the best multiplayer experiences I've encountered in years."
8520,"Risk of Rain 2 review:

POV: you are the british news weatherman."
8521,Good.
8522,"good game, if you want to win use heavy loader. Also buff Rex, hes my favorite but he sucks ass."
8523,"I almost beat the boss, he was in the second to final form and I'm downright pissed he killed me with a one shot, I was on easy/green mode and the dial was on HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, I ALMOST had him and I'm downright so angry that I couldn't beat him, I was so close, so, so close."
8524,no rain but some risk
8525,Very fun game
8526,This game made my life 50% more enjoyable
8527,I LOVE RISK OF RAIN 2
8528,"Marketing this game as a coop is wrong. There is no revive mechanic. And the scaling is based on the player count. When someone dies early on, the game is still scaled as if they were alive. Until these two key things are address in multiplayer player i call this entire trailer for the game a ly."

8531,good for a 15 minute run ending in misery and death or a 2 hour plus malestorm of hell from above
8532,fun for the family
8533,one of the best roguelikes to grace Steam with its presence. absolutely a must play
8534,"Very fun game, I love absolutely everything about it."
8535,"bought this game after seeing a bit of content and can quite confidently say, this game is like basically heroine, my nervous system goes through so many stages of dopamine fueled emotions it is simply indescribable. all you need is that one run, that one item, everything to just line up. and you died to a jellyfish blast, well i can just do *one* more run.

im so addicted that within my first week of buying i have put over 30 hours into this game, merely me starting this game has also infected previous addicts to return to their habits. the best part is you dont even have to pay your dealer for more and more hits of the good stuff. no microtransactions and almost endless replayability 
absolute masterpiece 10/10"
8536,bro the rain is formerly known as purple!!!
8537,"Best game i've played and probably one that i'll never stop playing. The only pet peeve I have with the game is the void enemies, specifically the collapse debuff. It's so op you could be a god, get collapsed and instakilled but I guess something has to kill you. 10/10 anyways"

It does a great job of being able to stack various items and items working in tandem to allow for a wide variety of game play from run to run."

8577,this game raw bruh
8578,"I'm a sucker for roguelike games and i really liked this one, the problem with it is that after getting good at the game and thinking you are invincible every run, you die to one shots every single time, nobody likes getting one shotted at any game, but in this one every death you get is a one shot which just kills the game for me, one second you are at full hp, the next you are dead, and stop saying that you just have to dodge stuff after a certain point, because after that certain point it's humanly impossible to dodge everything due to the dozens of enemies surrounding you at any given moment.
Edit: Misspeling"
8579,Amazing game I have so much fun playing it.
8580,I FUCKING LOVE UKULELES!!!!  YEAAAAH!!! UKULELES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8581,fun
8582,Phenomenal Game only thing is i wish there was more content. While there is the eclipse mode which makes the game harder i feel that there should be more hard content rather than just making the base game more difficult. The art style is so sexy and the soundtrack is what brought me to this game. If you ever need a game to run up alone or with some friends then I would greatly recommend Risk of Rain 2

8598,"Game would be fun, but since the survivors of the void update, my game freezes when I try to actually play it. I've updated everything, reinstalled, performed every bug fix that I could. It just stopped working on my machine. I decided to wait until the next patch, as I've submitted tickets. Well, the next bugfix came and the game is still broken. I've been unable to play this game for a couple of months now and I'm kind of ticked off. Especially since it's only unplayable after I've long passed the 'no refund' point."
8599,"Great game 
No rain"

Good Graphics
Cons:
Very Hard (Which isn't really a con unless you suck at video games)
Rating: 9.7/10"
8606,Only played one game so far and it was making my brain vibrate due to how much was going on.
8607,good game
8608,This game is challenging and different every time you play. Very good for playing with friends and challenging yourself.
8609,"Bungus (\/) (;,,,;) (\/)"
8610,"""WHAT THE HELL KILLED ME?
I WAS LITERALLY UNKILLABLE, I DID THE MATH! I DID THE MA-A-AAAATH!"" - You, probably 4 hours into a multi-looped run.

Wrong, you are never unkillable.

The game will ALWAYS get you the second you let your guard down - and that's why it's great! 

No matter how strong or powerful your build you have to stay engaged and on top of every movement, or this game will end you and your dreams of killing Mithrix the god of hammers and salt, and boy has he got salt in quarry loads from all my suddenly ended runs.

Buy this game, buy the DLCs, make friends and play this game with them, cry at eachother when they steal your red item for the 10th god damned time in the run because you picked up a crowbar they wanted at the start of it. ALSO MOD SUPPORT! INFINITE POSSIBILITIES! 

9.5/10 - amazing game

Has quite a few unlockable characters and has many unique equipment items in game that also changes how your characters appears, The various worlds are beautifully crafted with enemies that require different strategies to tackle and a boss fight every time."
8652,game make me sad because there is no rain :(
8653,Risk of Rain 2 is a good example of a Sweet Spot game. Has a good amount of RNG to keep it interesting but enough resources to control some outcomes. Gives an opportunity to hone in on your skills and master each character. Always a heck of a good time with friends. There's never been a run that felt unfair losing. DLC-- Totes worth it!
8654,Yeah this game is super good and easily acsesible for anyone of any skill set to play. It also has super unique characters and items that are fuel the fun of the game. I like it a whole lot definetly a 9.965/10

8658,"Watch as everything explodes, burns, or lazers thrown at you. 10/10 session of madness"
8659,"I think a big reason why its a good game is because:

developers are smart people. they understand how to keep things in the game that are fun, and dont remove fun aspects of the game in every patch 

they understand how to make a fun, playable character except artificer 
all of the characters have some sort of similar playstyle to another game, making it fun for everyone from any kind of video gaming background, and for artificer if you like the one Cod4 mission where you're a gunner in an AC-130"
8660,good game
8661,real
8662,"I loved this game up until the recent updates. The recent updates/expansion completely broke the game's net code causing it to be impossible to play with anyone above ~150ms (e.g. anyone in a separate geographic region). I have had instances where people on 1Gbps fiber connections playing together, someone in Asia and someone in the US, where game latency got upwards of 30 seconds. Someone in Asia spawned into the next level more than 30 seconds after the people in the US.

Played through the entire pre-release and beta without too many issues with their net code, but something has changed recently which has made playing with people in other countries near impossible. The current state has made the game unplayable with a number of people in my friend group, so I therefore I cannot recommend this game to anyone with similar geographically scattered groups."

8664,Seesh. The soundtrack goes so hard I forgot it came with a game.

8697,risk
8698,One of the most fun roguelikes out there AND its multiplayer? That's an easy cop if you ask me.
8699,"is fun
"
8700,"A really fun shooter/beat-em-up/idle game, depending on your character and items. All I know is it's fun. You get the roguelike experience of discovering the items in the game and what they do, finding what ones you like, and then randomly getting that combo that's just godlike and your having the time of your life decimating everythin- aaand your dead. But it was fun as hell and you wanna go again cause there's way more fun combos to experience.

Also have to credit this game on its size of ~2GB as it's quite common for games to go 50GB+ and that hurts your drive alot when you have a ton of other games to worry about."
8701,Game makes head hurt.
8702,"I like hpw fast paced this amazing action game is.

8707,GOOD GAME! FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS
8708,meh it's okay
8709,i cant stop playing
8710,This game would not let me play unless I made and linked an epic games account. I have played a lot but I cant agree with that.
8711,Mithrix and his spinning attack sux cox
8712,This game is the Razorwire to my Hellfire Tincture
8713,"Definitely one of the better looter shooter / roguelites  I've played next to Enter the Gungeon. Achievements are actually meaningful to progression since they unlock new items, characters, abilities, or game-modes, exponentially increasing replayability. You can also spend hours in the logbook reading item descriptions that contain lore for both new and returning players of the series. Probably one of my all time favorites, all I can say that is bad about the game is that the Survivors of the void DLC isn't necessarily worth buying at first, I'd recommend playing Vanilla before deciding."
8714,oof
8715,yes
8716,sometimes i like to play these games from time to time

8723,best giga chad game
8724,"One of my most played games for a reason. Keep coming back to it with or without friends. The gameplay is unmatched and I've been rooting for it ever since launch. They followed through their roadmap and they made even better dlc. It's a roguelike so if you don't like resetting after a death, I'd suggest playing another game. The death loop is not for everyone but once you get the hang of the mechanics and looting systems, hours will pass by without you noticing how much time you've spent on this game. And as always, friends are a core part of what makes this and anything more fun than it already is! 

[b] TLDR [/b]
Probably the best 3D roguelike out on the market. Good class variety and a LOT of mechanics to mess around with. Friends make it even better."

8726,I like the game
8727,Yes
8728,Gup.
8729,So good
8730,pretty good
8731,Bettern than Risk df ran 2
8732,Whats not to like
8733,I don't usually enjoy roguelite types of games. They often feel boring and repetitive after awhile. I thought Hades was boring and everyone loves that game. What makes Risk of Rain 2 different from other games in the genre is how each run feels brand new and things constantly change in the game. The maps are different each run and the abilities you acquire are different as well. The game is gorgeous and the music is incredible. It is easily the best roguelite game I have ever played. It is worth buying on sale for sure. I would buy the DLC as well. Avoid playing with cross-play on if possible.
8734,"it rained, i pooped and died"

8736,
8737,easy to fall in love with
8738,"It's a fun game, a bit rough to start since it doesn't have a training mode but not really a dealbreaker on that.

I will warn though that Multi-player is a bit buggy, and it's difficult to connect via cross-play with friends on Epic."
8739,very money
8740,"To Describe Risk Of Rain 2 is to Describe Insanity itself. Lemme put this as simply as I can. Try to imagine Cthulhu. Now try to imagine putting him on the moon, giving him a murder boner because his brother died because YOUR group of survivors killed them in the first RoR, and then he turns the entire planet you are going to, into a planet that wants to murder you. Full of items that gradually mutate your character from a simple helpless survivor to something Doom Slayer would say ""Nah I ain't screwing with that"". And imagine said survivor being so powerful he can one shot bosses with but a simple graze of shotgun or swing of a katana. And then you die by a piddly fireball from a Lemurian and you sit there wondering ""WTF was I killed by?"" And then you get angry at your loss of progress and then try again. And again. And again. Until you beat the final boss or die by an RKO Bomb outta nowhere again. And then you do it again. 

That. Is Risk of Rain 2."
8741,TF2 Review from november 2017
8742,this game is so much fun do not buy it

Once a few things are unlocked the game really opens up and lots of play styles are fun and viable. I enjoy it most with friends, but it's perfectly fine solo as well."

8773,"fun
"
8774,"If you like shooters and roguelikes, this is a must-try. Every part of this game is simply magical.

Characters: Each one feels very unique in playstyle and they are all so fun to play. Wanna point and shoot? Wanna teleport around? Wanna be an amalgamation of spiderman and one punch man? How about bird? Sit back and watch your machines do your job for you? The variety is top notch.

Items: There are SO MANY items. And most of them are very fun to use. The element of randomness gives you broken combinations at times (it's a great trip) or quite bad ones (and you try to survive and progress all the same). Both of these make for interesting games. At times you get complacent because you think you're strong and suddenly you just die. On the other hand you feel hopeless as the levels pass until you get the one item that saves your run. As long as you don't take the bullshit deaths and RNG seriously, it's always fun to get back into a new game.

Atmosphere: I think this is what makes me keep coming back to this game. The maps are really good; very interesting to traverse and play through. The music slaps hard. It just feels so damn good as you go through the environments, riddling enemies with holes.

And if you're bored with all that? Then you have game modifiers that significantly change the way you play. You can make challenge runs, or make ridiculous builds, or even simply get to the power trip stage of the game within the first 5 minutes,

Lastly, the DLC released (Survivors of the Void) took the game to another level. Almost zero complaints about it. The included content was like a breath of fresh air with new maps, music, characters, items, mechanics, the works. All of this fits with the existing content nicely to make a very cohesive bundle. The devs have done one hell of a job with it and the game as a whole. They also listen to the community and fix the various issues present (ty also for buffing Arti <3 she deserves it).

I think my only gripe with this game is that after playing it, I can never enjoy the first Risk of Rain the same. I am a huge fan of the first iteration and what they've done with RoR2 is nothing short of phenomenal.

Chef when?"
8775,Its raining its pouring.
8776,it good

8799,"Risk of Rain 2 is probably one of the best games I've played this year.
All though the graphics aren't something to be wowed about, I've sunken so much time into runs and honestly it's felt like a blast. This game is great to play with friends as well and I overall recommend it.
And the music? Chris did really well with making the music for each level and it shows man, I've taken some time to sit back and wait till I hear that cool ass guitar solo. But this game is great, the gameplay is smooth and fun, and its chaotic. Do NOT stop playing until your eyes start melting."

8808,"want to accidentally kill an hour and a half of your time without realizing it? This is the game. Music is amazing, graphics are amazing and the animation style is unique and has a lot of hidden details that make it more and more fun to play. A great game and one I will always fall back one because there is always something new that will happen or its fun to try new builds to see what works. You can have a god like 3 hour run and then immediately get killed within the first 2 minutes the next run. It has something for everyone and keeps presenting new surprises and challenges."
8809,Very fun game. The worst part about it is how addicting it is
8810,great
8811,"I spent 50 hours trying to beat the final boss, and when he finally fell I was given an ""escape"" segment with a 3 minute time limit and no instructions on what to do. I died at what should have been my moment of triumph because the devs didn't bother putting a ""jump in the glowing orb"" indicator.

Way to kill the player experience"
8812,"My friends and I just got done with a game where they made my health so low that when I turned into Heretic for the first time I died immediately and I stayed dead for the rest of the 2 hour run.

Great game 10/10"
8813,IT'S AWESOME!
8814,This makes both my computer want to die and my hands as I clutch yet another 20 tougher times in hopes I do not yet again get one shotted. I love getting so powerful that my screen just strobes and the base just bursts my eardrums from the pain of my enemies.
8815,"Out of all the games ever made, this is one of them."

8825,zombies but more fun
8826,"I highly suggest this game if you haven't played it, you may have seen it around, or heard the name a few times, but what's so special about it? Why should you buy risk of rain 2, Thats a question i'd love to answer. There is one part of game design that i think is the most important. Fun. A game isnt playable, if it isn't fun, now let me tell you why risk of rain 2 fits that category. It has diverse and unique unlockable characters, multiple stages with various variants, all of which are a blast to explore, even the worst ones, the items are all interesting and fun, nothing makes me happier than seeing a soldiers syringe drop, and that only increases your attack speed by 15%, there are some bad items, and sour ends to runs, but the good ones make up for it, and last but not least don't get me started on the shenanigans that can occur when you get one, maybe two friends to play this game with you. Knocking dunestriders into pits, coming up with the wackiest most overpowered strats of all time, watching the enemies behave in stupid ways, all of it, is fun. Risk of rain 2, is a fun game, an experience that can keep giving, and if you feel so challenged, try eclipse mode, as if monsoon wasn't already enough. Buy this game, It's good."
8827,There is a lot more to do than you might think. A lot of things to unlock and try out. Visually impressive and great soundtrack
8828,very scary spooky horror game
8829,"Good game, but frustrating bugs and design choices.

Nothing quite feels as bad as getting to the last stage and grabbing a new lunar item with unknown, run-ending consequences.  Ask me how I know..."
8830,definitely one of my fav games on steam. Definitely a game you chill with or go absolutely crazy with just depends on what you want to do with it

8838,yup
8839,pog
8840,good game
8841,kill them
8842,"One of the most addicting video games I've ever played.
Purchasing the game without knowing anything about it was one of the greatest recommendations that I got from a very good friend of mine. Curiously, there were a couple of aspects of the game that made me want to keep playing. For example, I really wanted to beat the game in the beginning and I wanted to unlock all of the characters. After that I wanted to get the abilities for each character. There was always something that kept me going. But the most important aspect was that I wanted to [b]get better at the game[/b]. Learning the characters that seemed the most interesting and experimenting with different loadouts and playstyles, even if they mostly lead to defeat, were significant elements of my playthroughs.
It's also worth mentioning that time seemed to pass faster than usual while playing this sometimes surprisingly challenging and difficult but ultimately fun game."
8843,it's great especially with friends.
8844,I'M RACIST
8845,cant create multiplayer lobby
8846,"if I had to give this game a rating on its own I'd give it a solid 10/10. 

1. unique art style that really fits with the game.
2. solid replayability, like that's literally the point of the genre but some people just kinda stop after they've 100% the game.
3. Genuinely FUN characters, just like how that dev(I think co-founder of the studio?) said: the different characters' ""balance"" aren't as important as the fun aspect. Not his exact words but basically what he said
4. Lots of items for multiple types of builds. 

If I had to give the community a rating I'd give it an 8/10

1. Most random people you play with are epic, plenty of art for the artsy people as well as plenty of just overall laid back people.
2. However some people try to min/max the items they get in multiplayer which is suuuch a tilter. Like BRO just chill out and have some fun and stop trying to do the whole ""your bleed is better on my captain while you're loader"". No shit sherlock, I'm trying to have some FUN not tryhard at a roguelike. 
3. Lots of people will only play modded, there's plenty of stuff in the base game but they just want to overload it and have 4x the items which is just wack to me. 
3a. Yes There are some fun mods like certain character mods, but from what I have experienced, modded characters are generally too busted and you get a boring breeze through mithrix. Granted there are multiple balanced ones such as Miner, but then you get the teammates that are playing as sett and nemesis enforcer."
8847,Big knockers the GAME!
8848,"thank you risk of rain number second, very cool!"
8849,"very nice and different from a lot of other games. 
super fun and nice build with the heroes that are in the game. 
nice that you decide yourself how long your runs should be. 
whether you want melee or range, speed, dmg, movement and so on.
most enjoyable with friends, makes it easier to progress and unlock.

I just got this game a day before writing this review and put in a couple hours, then i bought it for my wife tonight and spent another 4 hours playing with her WE HAD A BLAST and i think this will make its way into a weekend bonding time between us thanks for making it."

All the characters are unique with their own pros and cons and no character feels like another, and with about a dozen to choose from and unlock, every player can find a character that suits them. Also, multiplayer will most likely be a major deciding factor for most people and it is very fun. While besides a couple hiccups, the multiplayer seem to work pretty good. The gameplay loop is also very addicting, I have over 15 hours on the switch, which for me, is pretty good."

This one particular person that I'd play with -- mind you, only to gain free access to expansion content-- spams Mocha and Red Whips simply to extirpate the map of any and all items.  Often, I will approach a chest as the legendary, although ponderous MUL-T only for a detestable, caffeine-induced Huntress to dash by to completely and unethically rat my loot.  There are frequently stages where the only loot I get is a measly equipment and one common item... quite sad.  If only certain teammates did not engage in such unethical activities this game may warrant more than a 1/100 rating.  Please stay away at all costs."

8911,"Simple enough to be ""pick up and play"", satisfying difficulty options without being too unfair about it, lots of replay value with friends. Artifacts allow for some granular control in setting up runs. Also, you can be an acid puppy."
8912,"Amazing on god, I'd kill a family of nine to play this game."
8913,issa very good!
8914,"Risk of Rain 2 is an absolutely stellar game that grabbed me by the neck and forced itself to be my new hyper-fixation within hours of getting it. A friend gifted this game to me so we could play together and I couldn't be more grateful for it. The replay factor is amazing, getting achievements grants you new items and characters (which makes it feel all the more rewarding when you get them), and the lore, while vague, is a beautiful story when put together. The learning curve and over all handling aren't that difficult to grasp either, which makes this game perfect for people looking to get back into computer gaming like I was."
8915,its fun and the dlc makes it more fun
8916,Try this trick with gups to make tons of cash!!! (Ghor hates them)
8917,Really fun to play with friends or just to burn time
8918,"Jocul merita o incercare, e foarte distractiv cu sau fara prieteni te poti bucura de el, avand ceva gamemode-uri, caractere, boss battle-uri, dimensiuni diferite, nivele de dificultate si ceva puzzle-uri super interesante. Dupa 30 de minute de jucat intrii intr-o transa si uiti de timp, inca un plus urias al jocului este muzica de fundal. Eu l-am cumparat la reducere (12-15$) si nu regret ba chiar il recomand!"
8919,Amazing game in every aspect. I easily find myself dumping hours into this game without noticing. So be careful if you have a family because they will disappear after this experience.
8920,"My life is misery, but this game is fun."
8921,wow
8922,"This game is great.  It’s gorgeous in its simplicity. The music rocks (really recommend picking up the sound track). It can take up to an hour for a run, but you can stop whenever. Fun to kill a little time if you need. Lots of achievements to work towards, or character unlocks.  Lots of game modes. Multiplayer is fun.  Good modding community."

8930,"Probably the best rougelite/like game I've ever played. If you like high skill/high reward and a little RNG, Risk of Rain 2 is the game for you."
8931,I do not like this game
8932,Very good game :)
8933,Very good game. I recommend you to play it with friends ( if you have any of course ).  I played this game over 400 hours with friends and we don't get tired of it!
8934,[ 8.9 / 10 ]
8935,"I love this game, I've played it alot solo and would do 3 hours runs on other consoles before going to sleep alot. Too bad my friend doesn't like playing it in co-op 8/10"
8936,"All fun and games until the entire lobby picks Engineer and turns the game into Bloons TD6

EDIT: I take everything back. Playing Engineer is very relaxing, and the game turns into Minecraft."

8942,"Excellent game to play with friends, also alone, although it is something more than challenging you to pass the stages as quickly as possible so as not to have a ""greater"" difficulty or be a Pro and kill everyone.
I really recommend it.
Common problems

1. Desync - It only happens once in a while, but when it does it's the worst.
2. The online is half dead although it is an excellent community.
3. You can bug in epic moments, but they cause grace and hate towards the game."

8964,I am a big fan of rougelikes and ror2 has been a great experience overall the amount of character difference in gameplay is very nice to see in a rougelike and not to mention the music in this game usully when playing other rougelikes i see myself turning the volume off because its boring but the music in this game is so well made it even brings out emotions in me. some criticisms i would have is just a small one and its final boss variety but i understand that deals with more of the plot of the game then the gameplay itself other than that i cant wait what you do with this game i will most likely b e playing it for a while!

But simply put- if you like roguelikes, shooting things, slashing, punching, maiming, obliterating, staying up far too late for the continuation of a god run, or just really good music, you should give this a shot.

The DLC adds two additional characters who both have their charms, as well as a bunch of new and fun items and locales. It's worth buying if you want to support the awesome devs."

8985,"If you were looking for a game review this is the wrong place but if you want to know how to make a chocolate cake, this is the place for you.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 8 in pans (We often line our pans with parchment paper as well)
In a mixing bowl, add the dry ingredients: sugar, all purpose flour, unsweetened cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients for 1 minute to blend.
Add softened butter a few pieces at a time while the mixer is on low speed. Mix until the dry ingredients look like coarse sand and the dry ingredients are moistened. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
In a separate bowl whisk the eggs, milk , oil and vanilla until blended.
With the mixer on low speed, SLOWLY add about half of the egg mixture to the dry ingredients. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 1 1/2 minutes at medium speed. Scrape the bottom and sides of bowl. Add the remaining egg mixture in 2 pourings, beating for 20 seconds after each pour. Scrape the sides and bottom of bowl.
Next, slowly add the cup of hot coffee (prepared instant coffee or brewed) and mix another 30 seconds until blended. The chocolate cake batter will be very runny. Don’t worry!
Pour into 3 prepared 8″ pans and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until the center of the cake springs back to the touch or a small wooden pick comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached.The cake layers will pull away ever so slightly from the sides of the pan. 
Cool the cakes 10 minutes on a wire rack and then turn out of the pans.
*Yields approximately 9 cups of batter, plenty for three 8 inch cake pans and a nice, tall cake"

8987,"Pork Vindaloo Recipe

Ingredients

15 dried Kashmiri chiles (see note)
2 teaspoons toasted whole cumin seeds
2 teaspoons turmeric
2 (1-inch) pieces of cinnamon
9 whole black peppercorns
7 whole cloves
1 teaspoon sugar
10 garlic flakes (or 2 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped)
1 inch-piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1/2 cup palm vinegar, or 1/3 cup rice vinegar
1/2 pound pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
Kosher salt
1 medium onion, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water

Directions

Combine chilies, cumin, turmeric, 1 piece of cinnamon, 5 peppercorns, 4 cloves, and sugar in a spice grinder. Grind until a fine powder is formed. Transfer spice mixture to food processor or mortar and pestle and add garlic, ginger, and vinegar. Process or pound until a fine paste is formed. Scrape out paste into a small bowl and set aside without washing food processor.


Place pork in a large bowl and season with salt. Add half of spice paste and turn pork to coat. Add onion to food processor and process until a paste is formed.


Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion paste (do not wash food processor bowl), remaining 4 peppercorns, remaining cinnamon stick, and remaining 3 cloves. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is soft and oil is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add remaining spice paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates and mixture starts to sizzle, about 5 minutes longer.

Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes. Add water to the food processor bowl and swirl to rinse. Pour mixture into pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover, and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 1 hour longer. Serve immediately with bread or rice, or for better flavor, cool, store overnight in a sealed container in the refrigerator, and reheat before serving."

8989,Brilliant game. Worth every penny.
8990,"once you play all the characters it gets very stale as the entire game is just killing mindless creatures with no strategy. I didn't mind the monotonous gameplay as the story was pretty concise, but after this recent paid DLC I feel like the developers spit in my face. The DLC should've been free or maybe 5$ at MOST as it barely adds anything to the game, meanwhile Terraria is planning another free massive update. I feel robbed of my time and money."

8996,Is good but add sex
8997,"Honestly, the game feels super repetitive and boring.
While the selection of survivors is definitely a strong point, all of the run 'building' is really just picking up anything you find. Basically all of the items help you in some way, and if you come across a printer for a good item, like syringe or teddy bear, you're going to jam all your stuff in it cause those items are so good. Little player agency and actual run crafting ruin the game for me. 
Also generally all the visual clutter, and the whole timer system with maps that don't seem to be built with it in mind suck."

Set everything and everyone on fire, including your friends. Run so fast you can move from one side of the map to the other in a single second. Make everything explode just by looking at it.

9101,"The Fire Spirit card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4). It spawns a very fast, area damage, short-ranged Fire Spirit with low hitpoints and moderate damage. It resembles a small chunk of flaming coal. Fire Spirit launches itself at its target when attacking, destroying itself on impact. It is the same as those spawned by the Furnace. A Fire Spirit card costs 1 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy
The Fire Spirit's area damage is very useful against swarms of weak, small troops like Goblins, Spear Goblins or Minions. However, due to its relatively low health, placing it next to these units will result in it dying before it can attack. Placing the Fire Spirit at a distance allows it to safely deploy.
Against the Mother Witch, you want to place it close to her instead, so that it is killed as part of its attack instead of being killed by the Mother Witch, otherwise she will spawn a Cursed Hog from it.
If timed correctly, a Fire Spirit can damage all the Lava Pups just as they explode from the Lava Hound, defeating them.
Due to this splash, an effective strategy is to pair it with troops that deal high single hit damage but are easily stopped by the small troops mentioned, such as the Mini P.E.K.K.A. and Prince.
The Fire Spirit will connect to a Princess Tower provided it is equivalently leveled. Although it can easily be stopped, its cheap cost often lures out cheap spells and can cause opponents to over-commit Elixir-wise with their defenders. If used at the start of a match, it can also act as a way to tell what deck your opponent is using based on the card that they use to stop the Fire Spirit.
Fire Spirit can compliment pushes effectively due to its good cost-to-damage ratio and fast movement speed. For example, if the player is pushing with a P.E.K.K.A. and Fire Spirit behind and the opponent drops Minions to counter for example, the Fire Spirit drops the health of said units to be finished off by a Zap or cheap ranged units to protect the P.E.K.K.A, letting her continue towards the tower without taking extra damage.
It is most effective with fast moving troops like the Hog Rider, as they will not collide with each other as much during an attack.
A Hog Rider and Fire Spirit combo can make short work of Cannons.
The player can use units to soak it up. For example, the Skeletons or another spirit result in a neutral Elixir trade.
For more Fire Spirit value, a Furnace costs 4 Elixir and can spawn up to 7 Fire Spirits, giving the player almost twice as many Fire Spirits for their Elixir. It can allow for more consistent chip damage to Crown Towers and can bait spells due to its cost. However, the Fire Spirits do not spawn all at once, and its upfront cost is higher, so in a situation where the player needs quick area damage, the Furnace is much less versatile.
Occasionally, it is a good idea to combine the Fire Spirit with spells to defeat certain troops for a low Elixir cost. With a Zap, it can defeat anything up to Wall Breakers, with Arrows, it can defeat anything up to Skeleton Dragons, with Fireball, it can defeat anything up to a Night Witch, and with Lightning, it can defeat anything up to an Inferno Dragon. Use these combinations when you are lacking better counters for these troops or to get a good Elixir trade that would be granted compared to using two Spells.
Pairing the Fire Spirit with Electro Spirit is very effective, as they both cost 1 Elixir, which will only use a total of 2 Elixir. This combination can take out units such as Princess, Minions, Archers, Bomber, Firecracker and can even completely stop a Goblin Barrel with the help of the Princess Tower. This combo can help a lot of decks which try to bait The Log or Arrows, since the combo is very effective against swarms. It is also good on the offensive side, having more damage potential than The Log and can hit air. The player should make sure to deploy the Spirits a short distance from their targets to ensure they can finish deploying and attack successfully.
Although the Fire Spirit’s area damage radius is not enough to completely stop a tower-centered Goblin Barrel, there is still a way to counter the Goblin Barrel with Fire Spirit, although 2 of the Goblins will still get one hit on the tower (240 total damage at tournament standard). Place the Fire Spirit on the tile directly behind the tower, and if timed correctly, the Fire Spirit will push one of the goblins toward the tower, and it will one-shot all 3 goblins. This trick is very precise but can be pulled off consistently with practice. A tip for timing: Place the Fire Spirit at the exact moment when the Goblin Barrel is one tile above the river."

9123,amongus moment
9124,"Sit back, relax, and let me tell you a story; the first few times I tried playing Risk of Rain 2 over the period of a year or so, I kind of hated it. There I was, dumped into a big open area with things slowly popping up to try and kill me, and the only real guidance to help me in this new world was being told to “locate the teleporter”. So there I was, plodding around slowly, not exactly sure what I was looking for, and very occasionally picking up items that only seemed to make me a tiny bit more powerful. In short; I bounced off the entire experience pretty violently – it just wasn’t my definition of a fun time.

The funny thing is that, no matter how you approach it, pretty much every run starts off in this slow, laborious manner. True strength is an alien concept, you’re slower than a snail with a limp, and swathes of time can pass with nary an interesting thing happening at all. But then you start to learn how to methodically sweep each level, power up as best you can, and move on the next. And suddenly there are more enemies out for your blood, you’re faster, and there are further items to get. So you repeat the process. Then, before you consciously know it, you’re flying around the map at supersonic speeds, firing off missiles and explosions, and killing several super-powered bosses at once before they can even acknowledge what time of day it is. And oh boy, does it feel DAMN good. 

[h1]Strength in numbers[/h1]

This is the true genius that Risk of Rain 2 how to offer, boiled down into its simplest form; everything grows exponentially over time. For example; there’s a huge amount of different items to collect, all offering abilities ranging from the simple to the absurd, and picking up multiple instances of the same thing only increases its effect. Take, for instance, an item that has the chance to completely block an instance of incoming damage. Interesting enough on its own merit, but the more you get the more that chance increases, to the extent you can theoretically stand completely still and simply shrug off massive flurries of attacks. It’s kind of like being a sci-fi Mike Tyson. 

As time rolls on you sense yourself achieving godhood, and you’ll achieve many a wild run where you can merely look at a giant cluster of powerful foes before they turn to dust and ashes a moment later. But here’s the catch; while you’re powering up, so are the enemies, gaining their own new abilities and generally packing way more of a punch. As such, any delusions of godhood can easily become your downfall, as you’re always in a situation where daring to slow your pace or making one tactical error can be all it takes to suddenly find yourself watching how hard you can die. As such it always feels like a battle for survival; you’re always in a rush to find more gear, fixing the turrets and drones dotted around for their all-important assists, and desperately hoping for the moment the screen fills with explosions and madness that makes it so you’re the only one left standing. 

Through the midst of all this, the game runs incredibly smoothly – you can reach the point where your frame rate will take a nosedive just to the sheer amount of stuff happening, sure, but you have to put in a real conscious effort to get there. This ability to run so effortlessly is certainly helped by the games basic graphical design, but I don’t really mean that at a criticism – even though decades old PCs could probably pull off what’s on display here, the game still had its own distinct visual style and charm. Besides, I’d rather have a smooth experience than a stunningly good looking one.  

[h1]A manic mix-up[/h1]

There’s also a massive amount of variety in what’s on offer here. Not only do random items immediately make it so no two runs ever feel the same, but there’s also a ton of characters to unlock, all coming with their unique playstyles. Take the Engineer, for instance, who is slow as molasses but makes up for it with the ability to put down two defensive turrets… Which immediately inherit every item that you’ve picked up. Or the loader, where your goal is essentially to swing through levels like Spiderman and try to punch things and make them dead at eye-wateringly high speeds. Then there’s tons of challenges to beat to unlock new items for future runs, secret levels, and hidden artefacts that can wildly change the way the game plays (Side note; the way to get these is a good puzzle if you’re so inclined, but honestly? I’d just look it up). Want to make it so there’s double the amount of enemies and you’re the literal definition of glass cannon? Knock yourself out! Which, considering your choices, might happen sooner than expected… 

What I also like about Risk of Rain is that there’s an option here to suit every mood. Want to really challenge yourself? Crank the game up to its highest difficulties and sweat to even try and survive the initial levels. Yet if your mood falls on the opposite side of the spectrum, where you just want to get your hands on a tough unlock without problems or melt armies in moments, the game’s still there for you. There’s no penalty on you turning things down to easy, using some of those aforementioned artefacts to make things even smoother sailing, and going to town. The game always seems to want to try and bend and break it to your will, challenging you to try and come up with new ways to create chaos, and I really appreciate that.

Oh, and before I close things off, I’d be remiss to mention the incredible soundtrack that’s on offer here. Composer Chris Christodoulou has created an incredible array of stuff here, full of eerie alien vibes and guitar solos that go so incredibly hard I wouldn’t be surprised to learn if his guitar caught fire during recording. It’s one of those rare soundtracks that I’d eagerly listen to on those occasions I dare to leave the safety of my house and venture out into the great outdoors, and that’s high praise indeed. 

So that’s Risk of Rain 2 – a game that went from something I actively turned my nose up against, to one where I’ve easily put sixty hours into it, and would happily dump in sixty more. If you need any further proof you should pick this up, consider this; I look around all the incredible roguelikes I’ve played over the years; Hades, The Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Darkest Dungeon… The list goes on. Yet even against such competition, such classics, I still wouldn’t hesitate to highlight this as one of the absolute best in the genre. Buy it. Go. Trust me – your purchase won’t even be a risk. Of rain. Um… 2.

9139,"If you're looking for a Rogue like game, with a lot of shooting, looting, and boss killing, this might be a very good option!
Many different characters, with a lot of unique skills and abilities for you to try out.
There are SO many Items and Equipment for you to find throughout the stages, with many to combine to enhance one and other to make your build even stronger.
This game is really friendly for casual players, since you can set the difficulty yourself and increase it when you feel like you want a challenge.
Overall really fun and rewarding, yet re-playable and addicting since there is so much to discover in the world.
This game can be played Solo and Co-Op, and yes you can pause the game in Solo. (Wich is great, since your play through may last for a while)

I give it a 8/10

9140,This game got me very wet (get it? rain? wet?) jokes aside this game will make you return to monkey
9141,"I think that Risk of rain is a very unbalanced game. The game is like 50% luck, some items can almost break the game, while not getting other items can make the game unplayable. A lot of enemies have cheap one-shot attacks that kill you out off nowhere, they are not super hard to dodge but its annoying to have a 30 - 40 minute run just disappear from an attack that just feels cheap, and the new DLC is even worse with this, many of the new enemies have atleast one attack that just kills you. This game is neither fun nor hard, its just annoying"

9157,"I have good and bad feelings about this title. Well made, fun gameplay loop. Damage scaling on the hard mode ""monsoon"" is satisfying for about an hour, and then everything--and I mean *Everything*--Oneshots you. This paired with the frankly insulting death messages is not exactly a great time. 
I know, I know, theres a point to these death messages. However, like the meme comments they are inspired by, they remain mean-spirited. Play something else if you arent a masochist.
As a masochist, and one with thousands of hours on arguably harder games, I think there could be some polish on the base game that would bring serious shine. However the studio opted to have DLC.

9160,"fuck the shitty ass garbage ass voidling fight. Not only do i have to carry my friends BOTH TIMES, but the instakill laser chooses to go through your cover by flipping a coin. ""oh looks like i rolled heads and you will die after the 40 minutes on my boss fight because i chose to change the very concept of a laser to affront the gods and physics and every law of the videogame. Why did my laser not go through your cover last time? well because fuck you thats why. Yeah do your hour long run again motherfucker bitch ass cocksucking boss fight worst thing ive ever done in a game good lord And dont even get me started on the shitty platforming sections inbetween. If i wanted to play platformers for some dumb reason despite the fact they are by far with no contest the worst genre in gaming, i would play fucking mario or some dumb baby shit. But no im here playing an actual videogame and wow look at that now im forced to do a little mario baby shit game inbetween my shit long boss fight where its a 50/50 on whether or not cover acts as cover. it wouldnt matter if my co op team was worth a fuck in a fight but nope im the only person in the game that knows how to move and shoot despite having the worst build out of any of them i still have to carry 50 hours after they've died and are sitting on their chairs, jackooling and telling me ""oh you should do this"" ""lol how did you miss that"" as if they didnt just fucking die to the first phase in the first 5 minutes of the boss.

9174,I really enjoy this game when i sit down to do a run it ends up being a 60-100 minute run its honestly just a lot of fun to do on your own or with friends. Only downside is it seems that when you do the multiplayer you usually fight for things like lunar coins or items in general. Anyone who i've recommended it to loves the game and everything about it. It seems like the devs really care and always update it with new content and new things to do plus the community is very nice and friendly.

9209,"A big expansion off the original, the 3D environment and new systems and items work very well. 

Great to play solo with a podcast or livestream in your ears. Fun to play with friends, but a little bit more challenging until you get the hang of things."
9210,"I really wanted to like this game. I loved Risk of Rain 1 and roguelikes in general, so I bought it day 1. There are some things I really like about this game (e.g. when you're geared up, it feels really good to dominate so many enemies), but I still barely played it because it never felt great to play. I came back to it a number of times hoping I'd change my mind, but I never did. 

This game just ends up being massively unfun because you'll spend 30 minutes running around collecting loot only to get one-shot by something completely random. In other games, it doesn't feel as bad because you can usually see what you die to and thus adapt for future playthroughs - I don't feel that way in this game because the deaths usually don't feel like things I can learn from. Plus, the loot chests are so scattered around the level that you're just constantly running around to collect it (either that, or leaving behind so much loot because you're also fighting the timer). 

Multiplayer actually works really well in general, but it has another huge flaw: loot is first-come, first-serve and not shared. It's difficult to remember any good times during multiplayer when you're either being left behind in terms of loot or being called a loot goblin for finding more than your teammate(s).

I'll probably come back to this game, because (like I mentioned before), I really want to like this game. But it's left me with a sour taste in my mouth almost every time I've picked it up."

Surprisingly, my local weather doesn't actually have much to do with this game other than Risk of Rain 2 being a good timesink when I'm stuck in my house for 330 days out of the year due to constant, unending, gloomy weather forcasts.  

All the different characters have a unique feel so there is a lot of replay value for me, and getting lucky with the right power-ups can make me feel like a demigod of sorts."
9284,fun game but takes a lot of time
9285,"Risk of rain is an acquired taste at best and obtuse at worst. I would lean towards the former. The visuals are the most overcrowded visual nonsense I've seen in a video game later on. The game is basically unplayable without looking at the wiki since item's don't tell you what they do until you pick them up and so you might ruin a build on accident while you're still learning everything. The game can make you feel like a god if you get a good build going but bad rng means you've wasted an hour. My biggest complaint with the game is how the visuals and the sound design come together its like the opposite of dark souls. Nothing feels weighty or of consequence and with bosses randomly spawning into later stages I get it but also in something like elden ring I go ""yeah that big smash will probably kill me"" and then it does. People with hundreds of hours in this game frequently will ask what even hit them for their entire healthbar whenever they die. The game's solution to completing a run for like 2 hours of continual powerups is to just make a lot of things able to one-shot you, which is frankly pretty weak and it shows the inexperience of the development team. The way that difficulty increases feels inelegant and artificial as the random nature of the builds allows for infinite possible player states they try to counter this with blanket numbers go up. The game essentially will feel like a steamroll and then you will die in one hit. 

Its rough as shit around the edges but its fun with friends after you take some time to read the wiki."

9287,I like the creativity of this game and love how big and wide the information about the stuff in the game is it can be a hard game if played too long in 1 run but that makes it more and more fun also its hard to get bored and repetitive because you have all sorts of characters nothing really I dislike about it

9302,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9309,"Horribly balanced. The entire game is focused around forcing you to stay in areas for so long that the difficulty becomes entirely impossible to beat. Enemies are way too spongy and deal too much damage. Stay in stage 3 for just a minute too long (Maybe because the teleporter spawned on the exact opposite side of the map at the top of a mountain and the game decides you're not allowed to have any mobility items)? Now the overwhelming army of invincible ads are going to kill you in one hit and you have to completely start over. And forget ever getting items to circumvent this; They take all of your money, give you piss for xp, then set you in a new stage with increasingly more expensive chests, all while enemies still only give you $2-$3 each (That's if they even spawn, to begin with. Very often, they just won't spawn any enemies for minutes at a time, but don't you worry, that arbitrary timer is still ticking away, exponentially increasing enemy damage and health, all while you're left in the dust to get fucked).

Buy any other game than this."

9324,"Its not even a question of quantity over quality. The release speed of content is slow. Kinda painfully slow. It would take them probably a minute to look at the worst characters and increase their base damage by 1. Would that be an amazing fix that instantly makes them viable? no, Would it help? yes 100% yes. If they want to take time and think of a good fix I respect it, but in the meantime pushing out lazy changes like that would be welcome. I understand its a small team, but its such a successful game that it just confused me that the game is how it is."

9329,"Final boss is still incredibly unbalanced and unfair, capable of one-shotting you at any stage of difficulty. If you're lucky enough to kill him, you can still lose the run if you didn't get enough mobility items and thus die in the escape sequence. This makes two achievements, one of which unlocks a character, complete RNG at a basic level. 
Good game if you like becoming more and more powerful until your options are either kill yourself or let yourself die. Otherwise, you'd be better off playing Binding of Isaac for that ""god-run"" feel but an actual balanced chance at ""beating the game.""
Or play the original game. The mechanics of the game fit it better since you can't get one-shot by a mob you never saw spawn behind you, and the final boss is properly tuned."

9347,"As someone who has put more than 500 accumulative hours into this game (console and pc), I can safely say its one of my favorite games I've ever played. That said, it's not without it's faults. What developer Hopoo Games have created is truly astonishing for such a small development team. Its a fun, addicting, and rewarding experience that only gets better the more you play and learn about the game. The inclusion of select-able difficulty is necessary as it allows players to play at the pace they want, and how they want. The in-game god mode via the command artifact allows for experimentation, as well a level of fun most games are afraid to give you. Speaking of difficulty, however, I must say that the difficulty balance of the new game-mode Simulacrum leaves a lot to be desired. The inclusion of the new enemy types, coupled with the shear amount of enemies present at any point in time, tend to lead to some b******* deaths even at normal difficulty less than 3 minutes into a run. Aside from these balancing issues, the game is still incredibly fun to play, and I recommend it to any gamer out there. I've showed it to my girlfriend, my brother, my dad, and all of my friends, and they've all enjoyed it. (Co-Op is great too.)"

9357,"This game has high and lows, there are days where you get good rng and days where you get bad. When you eventually get your ""God run"" you will never forget it and will continuously crave to reach that point again. This is genuinely the only reason why i keep coming back. 

As a co-op only gamer I cant recommend this game enough to my friends, the skill cap is so low that anyone can pick up and learn the game within an hour and immediately get them addicted to it.
Even though ROR2 doesn't require too much skill, it can require knowledge on items and enemies, but that comes naturally from the replay-ability.

The one thing I wish for this game is to revert back to the old ""zone/storm"" system, you take too much damage from it now and it feels weird, although thats bias. 

Otherwise, get this game, you wont regret it."

9362,"Great game but with the most recent patch there's been a major bug!! We literally haven't been able to get over 40 minutes into a run without the game glitching and kicking everybody out but the host. This happens with anyone trying as host. After this occurs, every player that was kicked out black screens when trying to join a lobby, even after resetting the game. This seems to be fixed by somebody else hosting, but then the problem just happens again."

9364,"From a casual's perspective... I love this game. Most games nerf everything and kill interesting build combos but Risk of Rain 2 encourages them. Every crazy stacking buff you can think of ACTUALLY works. There aren't a bunch of caveats where multiple debuffs don't stack, or stop stacking at two effects, or whatever arbitrary situation the devs come up with. If you have turrets, all of your buffs apply to your turrets. It's awesome.

Get tons of power ups, fight tons of enemies, use a variety of characters, and lose track of time every time you play."

9387,"Easily one of the best Rogue like games out there. After 255hrs I still play it regularly. This is one of those games you wont regret buying at full price so if its on sale its a no brainer. Get it, enjoy it."
9388,"One of the easiest games to play that I've ever gotten. By that I mean it is super easy to hop in and let the chaos ensue. It's a beautiful game that I haven't even tried multiplayer on yet, and still have a blast running and gunning and slashing. Something people have mentioned to be a problem is crashing when doing a ""god-like"" run, but that isn't really surprising. If your computer can't handle 54 enemies exploding all at once due to 14 different inputs of damage in one shot (that's only sort of an exaggeration scenario), then it will freeze for a moment, or even crash. There's only so much a game could do to prevent that aside from not allowing you to make volatile combinations of items, and if you weren't able to do that, the satisfaction of watching an army crumble before you because you snapped your fingers would be lost. You can either deal with not having good enough hardware or lower the settings. I never played the first game, but I'm happy I was here to catch the second. Many different characters for many different playstyles allow you to try new things constantly. A beautiful rouge-like, and not a game you wanna miss if you are a fan of punishment. Probably super fun with friends. Can't confirm."

9427,"This game is amazing and it's price is worth it for a masterpiece like this.
This is my favorite rogue-like and it's what got me into the genre.

The game=play is extremely well designed due to its feature of ever-increasing difficulty, and being able to unlock characters, abilities, items, and artifacts alone incites you to play more after a few runs.

The amount of characters you can play and unlock ensures a play-style for all players, with near-endless possibilities for your equipped items!

Furthermore, if the game doesn't quite hit the spot in terms of game-play, the ability to unlock artifacts that change the game-play drastically and different loadouts for your survivors ensures that there's something for everybody!

P.S. If you have a friend who plays Risk of Rain 2, you should play with them because having a pal makes this game more fun and wacky."
9428,"Played commando, got unlucky with items. Couldn't beat 3rd boss because he outhealed me. Nothing I could have done to win the level I just got unlucky."
9429,"I like it
"
9430,"This is a complicated review to write, so I'll try and keep this concise. I love this game, but am not recommending it so that people will actually read this, and possibly feel more informed before deciding whether or not to give it a go. 

THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED IN MULTI-PLAYER: it's simply where RoR 2 shines. Get 1 or 2 of your buddies together, pick a few of the starter characters, and dive in. You'll die quite a bit at first, but once you get the hang of it, you're going to have a blast. It's fast paced, has a continually advancing difficultly curve, and forces you to learn how to adapt to whatever load-out that you're able to cobble together. Mad fun. 

SINGLE-PLAYER: Unless you're prepared to do some out-of-game research to wrap your head around the mechanics (i.e. understanding PROC coefficients/chains) this mode will feel like ass to the 10th power. In my opinion it's wildly inaccessible to new players, even with the in game Log Book at your disposal. Just know this: You're going to die. A lot. And not even come remotely close to the end-game for a long, long time. And when you finally do, you're going to get unceremoniously owned. The good news is that if you watch some Youtube vids, study a bit, and practice, you'll die slightly less, eventually beat it, and might just enjoy yourself 20% of the time.  

In summary: Get some buddies together and enjoy. But if you're going it alone, save your money and spend your time punching yourself in the nuts over and over instead; you'll have a much better time, and an extra $25."

9476,"It can be a bit slow near the beginning, but it starts ramping up REALLY quickly once you unlock your first items and artifacts, everything else is as good as everyone says it is; the gameplay is satisfying, the soundtrack is a masterpiece, and the game is not afraid to let you break it in terms of the shear power you can amass in just 30 minutes, that is, if you can live that long.

Not to mention, the game has fantastic mod support, allowing you to modify the gameplay to your desires and even add new characters to mess around with.

Overall, 10/10, in my opinion."
9477,Everything a RogueLite game should aspire to be and more. This game is in my opinion pretty much perfect and the DLC made it even better. Just play it if this type of gameplay appeals to you.

You will never find a 3rd Person Shooter with better gameplay, music, intriguing story, and so much more

There is so much BS that big AAA studios crap out for $60 while this game sits at an easy $25 USD, and has Devs that actually care about this game and it's community

The DLC is a little bit less enticing, but honestly, for a company this great, I'll easily shell out $15 for that.

Seriously, it's great.

When you have a character like the archer, who has the EXACT SAME ANIMATIONS, EXACT SAME SPEED, and runs TOWARDS THE DIRECTION YOU PRESS (wasd) you should be able to expect to sprint no matter what you are pressing.  WELL TOO BAD, FUCK YOU! ---Some dev, somewhere.  You let go of W?  fuck your sprint.  It aint happening.  Gotta press W and your 'toggle' sprint key again, to start sprinting again.  This not only gimps your movement, it will cause you carpal tunnel.  I know this because I have had carpal tunnel, and just 10 mins in this aggravated it.

9563,"This game is great. The game-play is interesting and challenging while still being accessible to players new to the rouge-like genre. Each run is unique and the wide variety of characters is amazing. If you are on the fence about this game, I recommend you take the plunge, you will not regret it. It is fun alone, and even more so with friends. Have fun."
9564,"Sometimes too risky, Alot of risks have to be taken to play the game. Also no rain 2/10"
9565,"very good you shoot shoot and im being arrested for tax fraud since i havent payed them since 2005

9566,"fun, but the final boss is a bit of a disappointment."
9567,this game sucks
9568,There is a big risk of rain
9569,includes many bugs and insects when it didnt even need to i am impressed
9570,"I only bought this game yesterday, and I can't stop playing it! The amazing interpretation of a rogue like is beautiful to me and this is legit the thing I've been looking for my entire life! But there's really only one sentence that sums up this game perfectly, ""One more run.""."
9571,An awesome game. I highly recommend it.
9572,Easily one of the best Rogue Like power trip type character builder games to ever exist. No if ands or buts. Its worth the price for sure.
9573,"So my friend and I were debating on whether or not to buy this game. I mean, yeah it's only $8 but we were a little strapped at the time. It looked fun, though, which is why we were hesitant.
My friend decided to bite the bullet--he is the one with the better job, after all. I had to go handle my dog, so I was gone for the moment he downloaded it, but I saw the result. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before in my life.
He used to be a fairly heavyset guy with pimples all over his face and an awkward demeanor; not unlike myself, though more so I suppose. The man I walked into that day was different. I saw a 6'3'' bronzed warrior with perfect facial hair and a gleam in his eye that could make any lady drop at his feet. His phone immediately started going wild with notifications about the millions being depositied into his brand-new Cayman Island account. At that moment, I knew what I had to do.
I powered up my crappy laptop, barely even meeting the specs, and told Steam to install this game.
At once I could feel my crotch bulging as I grew three whole feet in as many seconds. The scruffy excuse I had for a beard was replaced with a layer of hair so glorious Zeus himself was jealous as I also grew six inches taller. I wasn't a large man before, but any semblance of being out of shape melted away from my frame like butter in an oven and my muscles gained glory I'd only dreamed of before. Even my dog, who'd only been a pug before, now stood proudly by my side as a German Shepard-Husky mix while a beautiful woman appeared in my arms, who is now my wife. Behind my friend, I saw the ghost of Genghis Khan nod in approval.
We played for a little afterward for giggles. That was fun too."
9574,buy it. now.
9575,i like the game
9576,"Its Excellent dude. Highly addictive, tons of replayability."
9577,The game is fast pace and addicting what is not to love

9595,This game is the only 3D roguelike that I've come across and it amazes me with it's simplistic yet complicated design. I find it very fun to get lost on a new world or die to a new enemy. Overall this game is just a load of fun and a blast to play with your friends.
9596,"0/10
there isn't any rain"
9597,"Well there's not much i can say about this game that hasn't already been said, other than it saved my sanity during the pandemic. I instantly got hooked with the simple yet intriguing game-play loop. This felt like cod zombies from the good ol days before it went to poop. Its extremely addicting and easy to just pick up and play. You download the game press play and boom you're in it. No starting zones or long waves of texts to get you going. Great to play alone and with friends. Me personally my favorite character to play is the huntress. Shes super easy and really strong, not to mention you unlock her super early. p.s. stay away from the shrine of chance its just not worth it"
9598,Best run I've had yet!  *Malachite*  *Quit to desktop*

"
9605,"Ridiculously fun and addictive game. Engineer is so easy and fun to play. 

Rest of the heroes have a some degree of learning curve associated. 
Game should have a tutorial on how to effectively play each hero. Some hero are fun like the one that punches everything but that hero is really poor at taking out aerial targets."
9606,5 Frames of fun.
9607,"There is a Slight Risk of Rain Twoday, but thats Okay, as this game is Great!
10/10 Would Reccomend"
9608,Amazing roguelike that really feels satisfying. All the characters play different and make it fun to do multiple runs to try out new things.
9609,"This game is insane in the membrane.

Void expansion added some much needed difficulty for long time players"
9610,Endless fun action
9611,I have played captain for so long now that I think that my microbots will deflect my personal responsibilities. 10/10 would do smushed achievement again!

Hurr durr commando best character


Great game, pls buy I need more people to play with :)


The dlc is decent depending how much you like the game and value money.

fun fact this game is vr compatible with some configs

also rndThursday is a very fun ror2 youtuber worth watching, he does screw some things up and leave important stuff unmentioned but he is entertaining and you usually learn a bunch.

Not much to complain about that can't be fixed by mods but more vanilla features is always nice, I wish there was a way to reveal the teleporter location after a set amount of time, I've had runs where it doesn't spawn and other times its hard to find and I'm pretty sure there aren't mods that let you do these specific things. also playing some of the levels over and over can be a little boring, it would be more interesting is maps like Scorched Acres had some randomly generated aspect

Mod support is welcome and very fun, there are alot of great mods. I will make a list of my favorites and add it here and in some mod profiles and spreadsheets eventually but here are a few simple ones I think everyone should try that make the game more enjoyable.

9623,"it is realy fun... if you get at least one of all of the commons and uncommons, you become unstopable. and the final boss is realy easy.
please invest in this game"
9624,addictive
9625,"Love RoR2, just a spectacularly done game"
9626,"good
"
9627,"Very Fun Game for those who just want to turn off there Brain and have a blast playing, most characters are easy to unlock and fun to play with the hard characters to unlock is by beating a final boss which is not too bad, add on the fact of dozen or items add in for many different builds for different runs Makes this game Super Fun and Good to Replay many times

If I have to say a negavite about this game it would be some missing survivors (But with the Void DLC tells me the others like Miner and Such will Comeback) and some more stuff like a few more items to Artifacts but that could be fixed in the next DLC or Major Update"

9645,"I started playing the game a lot in febuary, and i board at school and ive already sunk 100 hours into this game.

(This game uses the ratings i use for roguelikes, eg: story, gameplay loop, repeatability etc...)

Story: ★★★☆☆ - There is a story, but its more of a side thing. You can look at the story by reading the logs, there's not really a story while playing the game, which is good in my opinion.

Combat: ★★★★☆ - The combat in this game is amazing, not as amazing as other games but still very good.

Gameplay loop: ★★☆☆☆ - I like the gameplay loop, but you are basically just doing the same thing all over again. While there are some times where you do something different, get used to looking for the teleporter.

Repeatability: ★★★★★ - This is a roguelite, and I would say one of the best roguelites with repeatability, I have been playing for a long time and I have not got tired of the game. (ive got burned out, but never bored). You will have a lot of fun with this game, and the randomness of the runs makes each run feel unique.

Difficulty: Normal-Hard - This game has configurable difficulty, Going from drizzle, which i would not recommend playing as it teaches you almost nothing. to Eclipse 8, a difficulty thats based on Monsoon (Which is the hardest main difficulty) with modifers to make it even more difficult.

Moddability: ★★★★☆ - This game is highly moddable, you can practically change the game in whichever way you would like, the developers are not against modding, but it doesnt look like there will be any offical modding support. If you want to play with mods, download r2modman and have a blast.

Final Verdict:

Excellent   (92/100)"
9646,i have downloaded this game like a week ago and it has already replaced any other game i play (for the most part). music is an actual banger its scary how much one person can do with GarageBand on their phone. please get the game its actually pretty pog

9654,"This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

9658,"Risk of rain 2 is a perfect video game. its great by yourself, but really try to play with your friends. play all the classes. don't feel bad for playing on drizzle. play with artifact of command if you want. just have fun.

 yes buy the expansion too. 

this is one of the greatest games of all time."
9659,bruh
9660,"I recently got all achievements, this is an addictive game and the Survivors of the Void DLC made it even more fun. Void Fiend is possibly my favorite character to play as just due to how versatile it is.

This game is best played on low end machines that can barely run it when lots of particles, effects, and enemies are on screen on high difficulties, the sheer power you feel when your computer runs at 2 seconds per frame because you wiped the map clean in two attacks is hilarious"

9675,"in terms of bang for m buck, risk of rain 2 might be the best game I own on steam. Charming art style, incredibly replayable, characters that feel really distinct from one another, challenging, and music that slaps so hard my dick fell off. There's RNG to it for sure, but it never feels cruelly unfair, and when you get a few good drops going, the game gets SO FUN. The devs really put no limit on how powerful you can become, and after learning playstyles and items better, it's crazy how some bosses/stages become sooo much easier and you get wildly better. I still haven't found all the secrets myself. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you like rogue likes, or shooters, or colorful, creatively styled games."

9700,amazing game and Thiccify mod makes the game 10 times better
9701,lit
9702,big fan of pressing two buttons and seeing a million numbers on my screen before being evaporated by a rogue projectile the next second
9703,Careful. What feels like 10 minutes of game play is actually 5 hours.
9704,"Godlike roguelike. cartoonish 3D platform survival roguelike that is super addictive. The game is starts as ruthless to the beginner, since it teaches the player to memorize certain monster attacks, how to multitask, and how to plan out a run or a certain build. The game rewards player for simply playing the game; you get to encounter new enemies, new items, new survivors, new maps, different endings, etc.

The game offers a great multi-, and single player experience. When playing solo, the story line gets quite tricky, since it is a continuation to the first game. In the item descriptions you can read/figure out what is going on but it doesn't tell the whole story.

I can also recommend the DLC as well. It brings fun mechanics to the game along with new class of items to collect."
9705,i dieded :(
9706,"if you have money buy risk of rain 2. if you have no money but have things, sell them, buy risk of rain 2. if you have no money, no things, and no soul, stop lying, sell your soul, and buy risk of rain 2"

9711,I work from home and it gets boring sometimes and I play this game.... so basically work pays me for playing.

9713,A great progression of the game play from the first game!

9718,"lots of replay
"
9719,This game is just amazing it has SO many different characters and playstyles. This game is an absolute must play.
9720,"I am literally ADDICTED to this game - Like...i think i have a problem. Every run, i wanna get MORE powerful than ever before..MORE weapons...MORE drones.. and the crazy thing is.. this game allows you to do JUST THAT. no matter what level of power you were able to attain, you have an opportunity to be MORE POWERFUL - AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHh"
9721,Great game! The concept of 'Risk of Rain' is one i'd like to see more often!
9722,Cool visuals
9723,"It's amazing, worth every penny any price. 10/10, buy the DLC too"
9724,"A roguelike with no replay value. It's kinda funny it has so positive reviews, but it makes sense as most ''gamers'' also like games like fortnite. No sense of quality, just mindless repetitive action, same thing, again and again. go play a real Roguelike like deadcell. Dont waste your money with this, unless you like wasting your time."
9725,"Too much risk

Not enough rain"
9726,Nice chilling game (first levels) and hectic run and gun (later on).
9727,i say a few videos about it and felt it was the best game i have ever seen

Play it on your own or with friends... DO EET NAO!
But honestly, it's a really fun game.
For the price it is DEFINITELY worth playing.
 1-4 player lobbies. tons of characters, tons of fun unlockables.
I'd say for Co-op Rogue-Lites it is one of the most enjoyable ones out there."

Big learning curve, but that's about the only bad thing I can think of. 4 player mutliplayer (which can be increased with mods or dev commands) so you can play with all your friends! All in all, fantastic game, and I highly recommmend playing it."

Would recommend :)"
9744,"Ended Up soloing one of the hardest bosses in game ;-; (My friend died in a duo) And lets just say it was the first boss I beat no one else, I have to say that spending 6 hours playing this game is just so much fun when enjoy the characters the game itself is a 10/10 And 6 hours was just a duo with me and my friend yelp review moment anyways I hope this game would get more survivors to make it more interested :)

10/10 Would Fungus Again"
9745,"I'm like 40 hours into this game and I feel like I'm barely getting started. Everything is excellent, co-op is very fun. I rarely enjoy roguelikes this much, there are just so few barriers for entry and fun. Everything is clearly designed to be as fun and exciting as possible. The game itself doesn't explain the immense depth, you'll need to either have friends or hit YouTube/Wiki for unlocking everything. Lookup how to unlock the Artifact of Command, and good luck."
9746,great game
9747,Super fun with friends. Except when they steal your stuff then its not fun. Then friendships are destroyed. Then you don't have any friends to play with. Then the game is no longer fun. Now you wasted your money
9748,The quintessential co-op game. The boys are most definitely back in town.
9749,Game is a dopamine dispenser. Nuff said. You'll be back for more.
9750,Awesome game if you want to pass time I recommend getting the game it is so much fun in my opinion.

9772,Amazing Game! Really Recommend it!
9773,"it's fun, with or without friends. has scaling in difficulty so learning the basics isn't difficult. Sound and visuals are spectacular. Lots of different build types so while basics may be easy, end game and buildcrafting can be a little more complex but not impossible.  Def worth a pickup if you're bored with the current market and want to try something new."

9780,Game IS UNIQUE! Every run has different risks. Every turn you make and every move you attempt is different. Everything you do changes the way the game works.
9781,"The game has a nice learning curve, and it always feels good when you get to play and have a progression to the endgame."
9782,"Absolute great game. Definitely one of my all time favorite games, this is a complete step up from the past game and the DLC just adds so much more to the game."

9796,I can easily sink a couple hours into this game without even realising it. Jamming to some music while going on god runs or playing with friends always makes it better. The dlcs actually improve gameplay and personally improve the game overall. highly recommend

9803,"Im 61 years old and this is one of the few games me and my sons play together to bond! They love doing quests, and slaying the radioactive creatures! Wish my late wife could see us all playing together"
9804,"love the game,
fun and yea"
9805,"This game is a blast, great artstyle and characters. The Loot is diverse and very rewarding. My only wish is for the damage calculations to become more optimized as when you get to late game you can often crash the game with how much damage you do regardless of your processing power (too much math for your cpu to take at once)."
9806,but where is the rain?
9807,"Super fun
"
9808,dun just make sure you have good survivability for monsoon
9809,"A fantastic sequel to the first one!  The 3d element adds all sorts of strategy.  All the classes are fun(some definitely funner than others), the music continues to be amazing, and the art is perfectly adapted from the first game."
9810,"Take an umbrella, there's two risks of rain"
9811,"Risk Of Rain 2 is one of my most loved games, the soundtracks and the gameplay are really epic, with a cartoon-ish design that really fits the game, the difficulty of it is painfully nice, yes, painful and nice. . same way for spicy food being painful and really loved by many.

𝘈𝘯𝘺𝘸𝘢𝘺  I really heavily recommend the game if you like being a survivor who is fighting powerful enemies and pushing through hard waves and bosses while also discovering beautiful maps and soundtracks and uncovering secrets and easters and achieving what others didn't.

The fact that you can co-operate and add deep mods while the vanilla itself is impressively nice is quite insane, many might not like the game basically because they like realistic graphics and non-stupid logic(s), this game have some of these things and it's unbalanced if you use the powerful artifact that allows you to choose any desired item instead of getting one randomly.

Overall the game is really fun and you can keep challenging yourself by changing artifacts and adding things that is pain for you and you think they are annoying but they actually spice up the gameplay and making it challenging that you decide to do it even though it's really hard!"
9812,"I absolutely love this game. There is so much stuff to do from JUST UNLOCKING THE CHARACTERS. Don't even get me started on the alternate abilities that all but one survivor(DLC) has. Then you have the fun possibilities of making builds for each character (meme builds lol.) You want challenge? You'll meet your inevitable doom no matter what unless you fight the final boss (which is SICK,) and you can give yourself pleasurable pain of playing monsoon or eclipse. This game has everything you can possible want in a rogue-like game. If youre not sure whether or not to get this game, just get it. You wont regret it."
9813,Played Thousands of hours on console. Finnaly upgraded to a pc and its still fantastic. Definatly one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10 would play again.
9814,Lots of fun
9815,jolly good fun
9816,absolute W game
9817,O block bang bang
9818,"If your friend(s) convince you to get this game play a round or two solo on characters to get familiar with the characters and the gameplay, and how the different items function because your friends WILL go at lightspeed you won't learn anything and the game will get frustrating fast."
9819,good game makes me not wanna die
9820,güd
9821,last bboss is too hard need nerf
9822,"Not a bad game. 

Difficulty: Its not hard per say... just annoyingly unfair at time. I mean in my first run ever on the default difficulty I managed to make it to the end of insane before I got curb stomped.
For unfair take my most recent run for example. I just landed on the snow world (dont know what the actual name is) with the first character. Duel pistols guy. Anyway. I was looking around for any item crates. Only found 2 of em before it got to normal with like 4 gun turrets not even remotely close to the teleporter. And the boss was the stone giant. 
Ow.
And to those who say ""Just git gud."" One can only get so good thanks to the reliance on dumb luck rng. And its not like I'm not up for the challenge. I play RTS games and let me tell you, they ain't easy.

Visuals: Unimpressive but the art style makes up for it.

Fun factor: I've only played singleplayer because my friends are playing other games (I will update this part when I do sit down with them). The game is fun but I get frustrated easily so I have to take breaks.

Some might say ""Oh you've only played this game for 2.6 hours before reviewing. How could you possibly judge a game with that little playtime."" And the answer to that is easy. Because I like the game."

9884,I played about 70 hours of the original game Risk of Rain and I think this is the best adaption of any game to 3D. Quite possibly no other developer would be able to do such a great transition. The game is fully fleshed out with the latest DLC of the game that makes it feel like a completed game. I am happy the small game I took a chance to play a ton in my early teens has become such a monolith on the indie game scene!

9902,"Risk of Rain 2... 

With a crap-ton of achievements... And DLC in hand. Runs are either hell or hella fun. Of course luck is your biggest kicker, if RNG don't like you today, you have to try tomorrow or the day after or the day after... Point is, the game doesn't kill on purpose item-wise, so complaining about loot-tables won't do you any good buddy. Bottom-line is; you either have bad-luck or you don't. 

Now when it comes to skill, that's your own [REDACTED] problem pal. By the 100th or so hour, you could probably attempt Monsoon, other-wise, get your unlocks in Drizzle or Rainstorm and not be stupid about it. The game will kick your [REDACTED] as much as it wants if you don't toughen up. 

Uh... Now for personal experience... Commando and Captain are the most broken, effect stacking or calling in a 1000% or 40000% attack is equivalent to the Glassing of Reach. How is this possible? It's possible because  I just hit and run random stuff till it dies then proceed to summon the inner loot goblin. Accurate to like 99% of RoR2 runs. 

Anyways other characters are fun too, but Commando and Captain are always going to be the cracked DPS characters. Other characters though have their own specialties and ways to mince everything on the map (except Artificer, what the [REDACTED] is she good at besides looking pretty, be heavily RNG based, and be extremely [REDACTED] mobility-wise, in general, she just sucks).

So, have fun and enjoy the immense pain that is to come, good luck getting Purity or something, you're going to need it.

Highly recommended, hence the review. one of Smoothest 3rd person action i've had so far. the Random nature of it makes it a true blast of fun. of course those who don't like randomization(RNG) can use artifacts to make it easier or even harder. fun for all manner of people. easy to sink hours just mindlessly surviving. or it comes crashing from a stray bullet/attack from an enemy when things get chaotic, alas that's what makes it so good.

9978,very good game
9979,"dis a good one
i often struggle to enjoy roguelikes because they are repetitive by nature, but something keeps bringing me back to risk of rain 2
maybe it's the diversity of stages and enemies that can make every run feel unique
maybe it's the limitless combination of items and powerful builds that you can make
or maybe it's chris christodoulou's BANGER soundtrack
whatever it is this game is sick"
9980,"Multiplayer, this is a 3/5. Solo, this is below average at like a 2/5. It feels as if everything is left to RNG, and good play (unlike Isaac) can very rarely actually save a run. Hard games can be fun, such as Synthetik which is one of the hardest games I've played, but the way Risk Of Rain 2 does it is just not my cup of tea and is rather confusing. Speaking of the runs, they have become extremely repetitive after about 30 hours in the game. I have no clue how so many people enjoy this game for it to be Overwhelmingly Positive, but I can only guess that it's due to the game being pretty braindead and the repetition encourages braindead gameplay. I would take Synthetik or Binding Of Isaac any day of the week than this monotonous game that misleads with its ""variety"" of items. In terms of unlocks, again very boring and monotonous. The unlocks require specific objectives that are much too specific for what they are. Want a new ability for your character? Too bad, have to kill an enemy in 1 hit to get it. Want a new item? Too bad have to chase enemies off the stage instead of actually playing. It's just not fun compared to Binding Of Isaac's linear unlock system for actively playing the game and completing runs. God forbid they decide to rework the Mithrix fight to be fun to work up to, the pillars are easily one of the worst things about the game, even somewhat requiring the players to outright skip them with items on harder difficulties. His fight in general, while it can be somewhat rewarding, is very tedious and honestly kind of anticlimactic. Speaking of the multiplayer, it's not even that good or polished. The lack of being able to see the amount of items a teammate has during a run stops runs from being balanced. Sure, you can technically see the amount of items, but you can't really count each individual item during an intense run. Multiplayer's balancing is all over the place, this is probably due to there not being enough items on each stage. Not being able to share money or even share items makes playing multiplayer feel like more of a lone-wolf type of experience rather than something that actually requires strategy and cooperation. No, none of the stuff I am saying is because of a ""skill-issue"", these are genuine things that I find off about the game regardless of whether not I'd win or lose. 

As for the positives, it can be interesting when you have good synergies between items when you actually have a scrapper on the map. No scrapper, no satisfactory runs in my opinion. The act of stacking one item to see how good it is can be very rewarding. The graphics, while not being that exceptional, has an alright art-style behind it. The character variety is just okay, some characters are completely terrible while some characters are completely broken but that's just normal roguelike things. Story-wise, meh it's okay but not as good as Isaac. It can be satisfying to one shot enemies, but every roguelike has that. Honestly, it's hard for me to find things really good about this game. Bring the clown awards on if you want, but overall this game is lackluster at best solo and just ""okay"" for time-wasting on multiplayer."
9981,"Very good game, fun and engaging gameplay with very high replayability, I'll definitely continue playing more than I have"
9982,Multi use!!!  Phenomenal game with infinite replay-ability but also functions as a stress test for your pc if your run goes on long enough.

10025,"The game it self is real fun as a singleplayer, but playing with a friend is a real pain in the a**. You cant play one run without desyncing. The Host can play without bigger problems but the Co-player always desyncings and doesnt even get feedback on it. You only realize it when enemys wont die or an ablity stands forever. 
I hope it will be fixed soon so i can change my review to positive."
10026,The game is actually very fun and I will change my review as soon as the multiplayer desync bug is fixed. Can't get one full game without desyncing and this problem needs to be addressed.
10027,you smell if you hate acid doggo
10028,"Game is really fun but, why the hell do these hour+ long run rougelikes not have a save feature, i cant start a run late at night without having the idea that if i get a god run i just have to let it go IT SUCKS.

fun game tho :)"
10029,"Risk of Rain 2 is a lot of fun, but for some reason the multiplayer won't work with me and a friend. We bought this game to play together and when we are in a lobby, whoever joined the host will randomly disconnect, and will no longer be in the server. It looks to the host like they are just running away or standing still. I can't find any explanation online as to why this is happening. 

Edit: Apparently disabling the Epic Games crossplay for both people has fixed our issues, when this game works it is a lot of fun!"

10057,"lots of fun, the game itself is short but there's a lot of replayability, especially regarding the different things you can unlock."
10058,I would recommend this game for the soundtrack alone.
10059,Anyone can sink dozens of hours into this game. God mode is achievable as long as your computer can handle it :)
10060,"Very interesting dynamic and atmosphere, I find it really fun when I'm looking for something moderately challenging."
10061,The game needs the ability to save & quit a run. Otherwise it's a fantastic roguelike to play with friends: when you have a free day to play.
10062,"its fun cause its challenging

10063,"It's really fun H&S as FPS game. To be quite honest I didnt find the concept captivating, but it comes out together really fun"

10065,This game is kinda hawt not gonna lie.
10066,"This game is overall maximum fun. But since the Steam-Epic Interop changes (I think the least people asked for) the game no longer runs as fluent as it did before. Therefore, the game received two new nicknames from me and some friends of mine that I think best define the game when played in multiplayer: Risk of Pain or Risk of Unity, due to the unforeseen game-freezes (that are more likely environment update freezes although own player movement is still working) because of wonky network code. I really hope the next update fixes it. But as of right now I would not recommend anyone to play it with friends until this issue got fixed. A real fun-crasher."

10068,fun game and haha funny carbon engi turrets go birrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
10069,"As the god almighty Moist Cr1TiKaL said himself ""a lot of games shy away from making you too strong for fear that you'll get bored of it"". I can confirm I did not and will not get bored of this, the game is a blessing from god. I managed to rack up around 35 hours of playtime in just 5 weekdays which I have never achieved before, the replay-ability of this game is mind blowing considering the extremely cheap price of the game. Money well-spent."

And if I'm not feeling it for vanilla I'll fire up for a 20+ mods version with monsters, artifacts, characters and 100 or more items added."
10121,"I was given this game by a friend who taught me how to play it. Now, 671 in-game hours later, i can definitively say that this is hands down THE BEST GAME I've ever played! It's very arcade-y because every run is unique, and even if you just play this game at a base level (I.e. without delving into any of the lore or collectibles/unlocks), I can guarantee you will have your money's worth of enjoyment out of it... and that's not even taking into account the DLC!! TLDR: 99/5 stars; easily something I could play for the rest of my life (and probably will)"
10122,!
10123,"This review includes DLC content, though the base game is just as good.

> On killing an enemy, spawn a lava pillar in a 12m (+2.4m per stack) radius for 350% (+280% per stack) base damage.

This is the Will-o'-the-wisp.
Ever wondered what'd happen if you stacked a hundred of those?
Yeah, well, be my guest.
Been there, done that.

This pretty much sums up RoR2 core mechanics.
3d, run around shoot enemies, loot stuff, do a few things to get additional progression (unlock more abilities and characters, unlock artifacts which are basically per-run modifiers) and replay the same game over and over and over and over.

The modding community is thriving, so grap r2modmanPlus and pull the latest mods or something.

Runs smooth on GNU/Linux, though some mods seem to be unhappy about that it seems (just as some Rimworld mods really don't like case-sensitive filesystems I guess).

The game works smooth in multiplayer, though you want to make sure you have legacy IPv4 connectivity since it's using the Steam networking underneath, however I hear there's some new crossplay that might fix that.
Dedicated servers exist too.

I dunno what to say, if you're into repetitive gameplay full of experimenting with different item builds, or hard gameplay, or just breaking the game making your money counter wrap around because it exceeds 64-bit.… this game's got it all.
If you're looking for something 100% balanced though, this is not it.
This game is exactly as balanced as need be to make it fun over and over again, it's not built for competitive gameplay."
10124,"can kill beetles :)













I do NOT like beetles :("
10125,this is risk of rain an it fun it but sometimes don't work
10126,Very fun rogue like. It has a lot of content to just dump into it and I'm not even half way there.
10127,"Have friends? Prepare to lose 2-3 weeks of your life.
Don't have friends? Good, at least you don't have to compete and fight for items because it's just as fun without them."
10128,it makes me cum hard
10129,Game is awesome. Just cool. Easy to waste an entire night playing this.
10130,"This is a game that keeps on giving. Even when I thought I saw it all, me and my friends continue to find hidden game content throughout that further enhances the game. They are also reasonable to find, you just need to keep an eye out while you play.

The core game play is challenging and can always keep up your attention in a good way. I am super excited to see all the content that is within the game and will certainly be purchasing the DLC once I get there!

I will say though, as there are a lot of enemies your PC will have times when it lags. Settings can be altered to lower the lag, but I would consider taking that into account if your PC isn't the greatest."

10153,"the problem with this game is it's only really fun co-op but if you die in co-op not only do you just have to sit and watch until the level's over and you fall behind in items. So you die cuz you're bad and then get further behind so you're more likely to just die again. It's not really clear why you die a lot of the times or how you can play better or differently. I keep playing because my friends do, but I would never recommend it."
10154,"You can´t stop, you start your first round then die try again and go up 2 stages, and boom 5 hours of your life gone"
10155,good
10156,"Good game, dont get scared by the initial butt blasting it gives you, it gets way more fun when you go further.
"
10157,"Risk of Rain is a Rogue-Like shooter similar to newer titles like Returnal. You and up to 3 other players must run through a gauntlet of increasing difficulty to the end in one go without a party wipe. You can customize the difficulty to an extent to be as punishing as you really want it but this is by no means an easy title regardless. To supplement the ever increasing difficulty is the various items you can collect throughout the levels to increase your odds of survival. 

This game is hard and it can get repetitive since it does not change much throughout playthroughs. Personally I did not like the title due to how grindingly repetitive it got after a few difficulty (to me frustrating) rounds. However, I can respect the vision of the developers as well as its affordability. Just because this title was not for me does not mean its not for you. If you like games where you have to ""get good"" and are a fan of the rogue-like genre you will enjoy this game, especially if you have a team to play it with."

10190,would not recommend. play Enter the Gungeon (ETG) instead. the much better roguelike (this is not satire this is true)
10191,"The best way to describe Risk of Rain 2 is with a timeline of my typical playthrough:
Just starting - A little sluggish, fighting off monsters now and then
15 minutes in - Ramping up, fast-paced action
30 minutes in - I'm flying across the map obliterating enemies and looting chests without looking
60 minutes in - I've become an all-consuming human-machine-plant-instrument hybrid, annihilating armies of otherworldly creatures with each breath I take
61 minutes in - I die instantly

Awesome game!"

You can become so powerful every enemy dies in 1 hit, or you can struggle to even beat stage 4 because you spent too long looking for items and are severely behind. Either way, it always feels like it's your fault that you are ahead (or behind) and the large variety of items makes the game very replayable."

10231,"A really good and addictive RL. Endlessly replayable and with huge diversity of items and ways to play.
I played for 53h so far (on normal) and I didn't win a single run.
I will update this review once I win at least one time."
10232,"Risk of Rain 2 is truly one of the best co-op games in recent years. This game completely reimagines the original and succeeds spectacularly in many ways that its precursor failed. As a single player game, it has plenty of challenges and is definitely a good game. However, when you add some friends, the chaos of more enemies and the variety that a mixed team of characters can bring really pulls the game together. This game is a must buy for anyone looking for something new to play with their friends. 
The real selling point of this game is it is the perfect game for friends to get together and play. I, like many people, often feel like there is nothing new to play when looking for something to do with friends. Everything feels worn and tired, with nothing really attracting people enough to be something really fun. This game is the easiest to pick up and have a good time. The variation of every run keeps it fresh, and the casual vibe allows people to relax and enjoy themselves. That isn’t to say this game is easy, this game can be hard as hell. But even when trying for monsoon runs, the casual nature keeps it feeling low key and fun.
Even if nothing else attracts you, the pure dopamine of stacking a single item to infinity is something that every person must feel. The game encourages stacking stats to an absurd degree, which makes becoming completely overpowered and broken something achievable and super satisfying.
This game allows for a huge range of playstyles and pushes you to try and learn as many new things as possible. It is as casual or as hard as you want. For any group of friends looking for something new to play, this will satisfy any needs you want."

You go through the same 15 or so maps, but each time the entry and exit points, chests etc spawn at different locations. Familiar enough to know your way, but varied enough to keep you interested.

Similarly, every character feels and plays differently, each time you unlock a new hero, you have to look at the game from a different angle.

Also, there are tons of, TONS OF different items. Plus artifacts that change the game mechanics. Strongly recommended.

10281,"Waves of monsters seek to destroy you and the longer you live the harder it'll become. Multiple play styles for your choosing. Hundreds of abilities to combine, stack, and risk for domination. Going in alone or a squad is worth the challenge. Best part about defeating a boss, that boss becomes a normal spawn and they stack. No run will ever be the same!"

10311,"Fine -- great, even -- if you want to casually kill some time or do zany things with your friends.

If you're more goal-oriented and like to take on whatever challenges the devs have put in a game, you might want to pass this one up: past a certain point, it's essentially like playing roulette with your time and effort in ~30-minute intervals, except that you can only bet on one space. The game balance is somewhere between nonexistent and nonsensical, largely a product of the developers seemingly forgetting that haphazardly layering randomness upon randomness doesn't produce a framework amenable to satisfying player experiences when it is done in a way that completely avoids offering the player significant agency in the random outcomes.

If you want to finish the Eclipse challenge game mode, do the Simulacrum challenge mode on anything more than base difficulty with half of the characters, or just generally have a consistent experience where you feel that your losses are mainly attributable to your own failure in gameplay skill and not to the haphazard way that the game was thrown together... well, enjoy it, I guess."
10312,"It fun and I am endlessly swapping between having some idea what I am doing, and no idea what I am doing. And I finally have some idea what going on. Most of the time. 

Also try to speed run or you will get destroyed."
10313,"Honestly one of the most addicting and fun games to play. I may be biased, but roguelikes are always the most entertaining and this game is no exception. Infinite loops, fun, yet challenging, unlocks and achievements, and each character is very unique to play. Now if only I could beat Mithrix on Monsoon difficulty ;-;"
10314,"Fantastic, absolutely worth the money and time. Have fun guys, also love the pause button where you can continue a run through kids meltdowns."

10319,i hated on this game for 2 weeks. downloaded it and now im fkin addicted. ITS WORTH THE PRICE. its hard yet so much fun to beat the game. with friends its EVEN BETTER. not to mention its an INFINITE stacking game. lets say u get a item for like +10% dmg? and lets say u get that item 20 times now u have 200% damage. its crazy fun and im addicted.
10320,its hard to play ive been trying to get rex or acrid also whenever i try to get the worth every penny achievement i can never find the robot to get it but its a very fun game that is adicting and i cant think of anything else ITS GOOD :D
10321,yes pp
10322,"amazing gameplay. I found it easy replay

Especially with mods."
10327,too good
10328,llllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
10329,"""...And his music was electric"" so is this game. This game rocks in every way possible and has amazing mod support via R2modman which doesn't stop achievement progress. The game devs poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. 
 With the newest expansion it adds even more to the game. Risk of Rain 2 can be taken at any pace, taking too long on a level will cause it to get harder, which is a double edged sword, you can stay on a level longer to get all the items or just rush to the end and make it easier. 
 No matter how you play the game, with 14 different and unique characters and tons of fun stuff to do it's easy to get locked into hours of nonstop playing.
the game to me very few downsides, if you are a fan of rougelikes, this one is a must play."
10330,good game
10331,like overwatch but not toxic i hope actual match making is improved for multiplayer
10332,"Absolutely fantastic game, infinitely replayable, one of my favorites, so infuriating that I broke my mouse."
10333,"very awesome game enjoy playing it alone and with friends awesome game
"
10334,A great game that continues to be very fun even after every death. Join the fun in solo or with friends (friends are funnier experience.) 10/10 would buy it again.
10335,"A fun roguelite made by an amazing down-to-earth downteam that I talk to once in a while in their public discord. This was easily worth the $25 and the soundtrack. 

The gameplay loop of this game is fun. Slowly becoming more powerful by nabbing wacky items and tearing my frames apart due to how much the game wants to throw at me has been an absolute blast. The progression of the game gives a reason to earn more achievements and to 100% the game, and I particularly enjoy that as it is a good motivator for me.

Never have I been so invested in the hidden lore of a game as this one, telling a story behind the scenes to us about betrayal and morals.

The dev team have also outright stated that they would rather put fun over game balance in this PvE environment, which I actually really like. While some characters do get sidelined for this, I am still happy that everything still has this feeling of ""new"" every time I play.

Hopoo Games never ceases to amaze me with their games. This is one of my favorite games of all time and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with $25 to spare, and then spend $15 on the DLC if given the chance."
10336,nice
10337,All around good game. Has replay potential. Multiple game modes. I'd say the DLC is worth it too.
10338,"> Get an ability to heal every time i deal damage with my automatic weapon.
> Think I can't die since I heal faster than all the damage I take.
> Get one hit by a normal enemy.

10351,"Risk of Rain 2 is nothing short of an amazing game, with tons of hours of playtime to offer without it ever getting boring or feeling repetitive, with countless additional challenges to offer. On top of that, the devs are still working to continuously improve the game and provide additional content, such as the release of the Survivors of the Void DLC.
On top of that comes the vast archive of mods available for the game. I have personally made a lot of use out of the R2modman mod manager and will continue to, both solo and with friends.

P.S> Never not take a shaped glass"
10352,"so good, i bought the game"
10353,Amazing action game. The mods also can give new life to it.

10362,"Game's so good that it made me leave my first game review in nearly 20 years of gaming. 

10/10 must play for those who enjoy getting ridiculously OP, wrecking stuff for a while and then suddenly dying a hilarious and infuriating death. Lots of variety in the run playstyle with artifacts, survivor choices, and item drop RNG to keep it interesting. 

If you really want to spice it up, there are tons of mods available to make things get crazy too."
10363,This game is awesome! Too bad I defeated the final boss with my friends in a day tho. My only wish is for this game to have more content in the future.
10364,GOOOOODODODODODODODOD

10370,If you like roguelike games and have a friend to play with then I’d definitely think about getting this game. I first started this game because I saw my friend had 60 hours in and suggested it to me and I went from him holding my hand to becoming a ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ slayer this game is amazing and with the new dlc it only gets better if your reading this and you haven’t gotten this game yet then you aren’t doing yourself a solid get this game and the dlc and go to town.
10371,"I should loop at least once.
Eh, I'll do it again.
Okay one more time.
Fine, last one.
Maybe another.
This has to stop. No more looping.
Couldn't hurt to do another loop.
My game crashed."
10372,gud gaem
10373,Amazing fun and even better with others!
10374,"Step 1:
Survive long enough to obtain god like powers

Step 2:  
Stub your toe and die"
10375,"yes.
"
10376,"very good
"
10377,Incredibly fun game play. Frequent updates keep the game new and enjoyable. The mobs and items all have a unique way to play around them which keeps you on your toes. Survivors are the perfect difficulty to unlock and each plays differently yet they are all fun. There is truly a way to play this game for everyone. Aesthetically amazing and the soundtrack is perfect.
10378,"Very fun 3rd person over the should styled Rouge-lite, with tons of action and fun even thought I wasn't really initally into the genre, this game made me enjoy it and with base game there is tons of replayability especially with the new dlc.

Now all that is with out modding: the modding community is huge, with a discord server, a large variety of mod types from modded items to characters from anime, other games, even custom character designs, it's all great and I'd recommend if you enjoy the base game, grab RoR2 mod manager and have some fun with all the mods/modpacks and character skins etc...the game is lots of fun you can just get lost in and spend an hour+ on some crazy run, beyond worth the $30 ($20 base game + $10 dlc) and all the modding is free so it's just infinitely changing content that you can keep coming back to, changing some things around and getting a different but similar experience.

Lastly, if you're new to this style of game don't feel embarassed of only being able to play on drizzle at first, it'll just take some time and practice, as well, the game is just for fun, just enjoy yourself and don't worry about being the best player or completing a run on Eclipse 8 any time soon

10401,"This is an AWESOME game. It has a ton of replayability, where every run is different. There are so many things to unlock and challenges to complete, so I'm always coming back for more. It's also extremely satisfying when I become super overpowered, so that I'm practically instantly killing enemies. Even when I 100% this game, I'll still be playing it. Also, the DLC is definitely worth the money, in my opinion. With the new characters, items, and enemies, I love this game even more."

like the only reason i'm giving this a don't recommended is because there's no ""meh"" option and it's just barely not good enough to recommend.
technically speaking it's fine although it has been a little less stable since survivors of the void came out.
it's a half decent rouge-like if your a fan of the genre. although if you are a fan of the genre you've probably played games way better then this. 

it's not really a good game. it's not really a good rouge-like. it's just sorta ""meh"". it exists and that's about it."

Just make sure you're quick enough on your feet to get some items before they're all gone. 11/10 fantastic indie game.

10448,i like this game
10449,Very low risk of rain. I have played this game for 64 hours and haven't encountered a single water drop falling from the sky. I will continue playing this game until it rains.
10450,"Absolute masterpiece, Ahoy!"
10451,Good Game :)

10458,"Best roguelike Ive ever played, period. This is the gold standard that all other roguelikes should strive to match.

The game is super simple, shoot enemies to get money, buy items with the money, get stronger, enemies get stronger, keep getting stronger to keep up with the enemies and eventually you become this monstrous singularity of death that insta-kills enemies before theyve even started their spawning animation with a thousand stacking debuffs and effect chains. Customisable difficulty and modifiers to unlock mean you can tailor the game to the experience youre looking for. It can be so easy you will rarely ever lose, or so hard that every win is something to be treasured. Youll need to play the highest difficulty to get 100% completion as survivors alternate skins are unlocked that way, but this doesnt limit the modifiers, so you can enable those to make the achievements easier. Everything else can be unlocked on Drizzle.

The music is outstanding, this is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time, a weird blend of psychedelic and electronic synths that fill every area with personality and atmosphere. Go listen to ""They Might As Well Be Dead"" right now, and without ever seeing the level this plays on, youll know everything about it. The soundtrack is perfect.

Theres a great variety of characters, all equally playable but not equally balanced, so you get a wildly different experience with each one. Nothing feels out of place, and each character has unlockable alt skills that you can earn by completing achievements with said character, giving every run a new objective to complete. Theyre usually challenges that only that character could complete with their skillset, whether its Mercenarys ""dont touch the ground for 30 seconds"" or Loaders ""land a punch travelling at 300mph or faster"". These keep the game fresh for many hours, but even after youve unlocked everything, its still fun to just pick up and play. Characters are unlocked in a similar way, varying from simple stats you need to reach to ""take the fuel array out of the drop pod and carry it to the top of stage 4 without falling below half health because it will explode and insta-kill you"". One of my favorite challenges in the game, actually.

Speaking of ridiculous numbers, this game is built like an old Nokia phone. Since the power of your character and the rate at which enemies spawn is constantly increasing, you eventually reach a point where the screen is permanently full of damage numbers and effects and you can barely see whats in front of you. Everything in the game scales, every item stacks and nearly all stats have no cap to them. You can pick up 100 movement speed items and jump the entire map in a single leap, pick up attack speed items and shoot the ground so fast that the recoil lets you fly around the stage. And somehow, I have never managed to crash this game. Ive seen runs that go on so long that your money counter overflows into the negatives, and no matter what you do, the game just handles it. Its incredible.

If youre going to buy the game, the DLC is just more of the same, but it increases the base difficulty somewhat with some new enemy additions that are stronger than base game ones. It integrates with the base game in a way that expands on nearly all the base games features, so get the base game first, see if you like the core concept (and the difficulty), and then consider the DLC later for more stages, more items, more characters, everything."

10479,"Game crashes constantly and freezes up constantly. Especially when I am literally seconds away from obliterating, grabbing an artifact or unlocking any major progression period IE character, skin, skill etc. My PC was just built a year ago and I know for a fact it isnt my hardware, it happens to all 4 of the other people I play with daily also and they have had this game longer than myself. I dont even frame lag, most of the time I am literally just running to a point with no enemies on the screen and we all notice the clock stop and no one else is moving. Also crashes on start up nearly every time I try to play. Do not recommend unless they fix the constant crashes."

10548,"Got the game to play with some friends from work. We ended up playing about two 3 hour runs and the next day I did 4 solo runs to unlock almost all the survivors and just to get better at the game. Not only is playing with friends fun as hell, but playing solo is also a great challenge and is super fun to see how decked out you can make your character to 1 hit bosses by the end of it!"

10550,kerblam
10551,worth it
10552,"The character designs range from okay to bad. The items are what you would expect from an indie. The difficulty is easy to impossible depending on those item drops. There is no thinking about combinations of items. There are items you want and items that are bad. I bought early and supported it all the way along it's drawn out and disappointing road to launch. They always promised more, more, more, but at 1.0 it still had insultingly little content for a roguelike. Every playthrough feels almost the same. But that's okay, they promised to keep adding content after launch for their loyal players.

Just kidding, you have to pay again.

In a world full of high quality roguelike games popping out left and right Risk of Rain 2 is an insult. I will never support an early access game again purely because of this dumpster fire. I can't comprehend the positive reviews. Why? It doesn't measure up in a single metric vs other options out there. The original Binding of Issac had more content than this and you can pick that up for a fraction of the cost.

If you've demolished every other roguelike out there, are suffering extreme withdrawal symptoms, and have money to burn to feed your addiction then knock yourself out. It's fun for the first 15 playthroughs or so. Then you realize how shallow it is and wonder whether it's worth playing another couple dozen hours just to find those last few hidden secrets. The different characters and the playstyles they bring can shake it up a little bit, but at the end of the day the gunplay is repetitive and the lack of item depth kills this game. Maybe if I bought the dlc it would come closer to feeling like a full game instead of a demo, but that's not happening until a 90% off sale."
10553,great game.  those damn blind pests are a mf tho lol smh
10554,This is the fastest a game has hooked me with it's gameplay loop. I have lost myself in this game. I will never be the same. Highly recommend
10555,funny guys do funny things to kill BAD ANGY GUY THINGS
10556,"This game deserves all the praise it gets. It's absolutely amazing and one of the best indie games out there. The game play loop is incredibly addicting and all the unlockables give you a reason to go for one last run. The characters are all very well made and diverse. Its difficulty is also really impressive as it manages to handle exponential challenge in a way that doesn't feel like bs. Everything scales to you really well. I will say the rng aspect of not getting the right items / money can be annoying, but it's apart of that hook to suck you in and keep playing."
10557,game good
10558,good
10559,"Yes, yes very good. Very good sir."
10560,good game
10561,"This game is absolutely amazing. I did receive this game as a gift, but it's been an amazing gift. The base game has a HUGE amount of content, and the Survivors of The Void DLC is worth just as much as the game despite being less in price. So, take this review as don't feel pressured to buy the DLC, you'll have hundreds of hours worth of fun with just the base game, but the DLC is AMAZINGLY worth it for the content it gives. This game ALSO allows you to play DLC content (excluding survivors) as long as one person in your lobby (or just host, I'm sorry but I forget specifically) has the DLC, which is amazing. The modding scene is also amazing, with loads of content to try if you want even more. And, of course, the soundtrack is beautifully composed, with tracks that will make you hype, happy, or cry from how amazing and beautiful they are.

Honestly, the only downsides I can think of is how many items, mechanics, and things to commit to memory there are, and it can feel overwhelming to many (myself included at first). Some challenges to unlock items are also a bit hard to do. Both downsides, however, are a VERY small fraction of it all, but need to be said for the sake of an unbiased review.

I only have 255 hours at the time of this review, but I know this'll be a game I play for thousands. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you played RoR1 (which I didn't, sadly), or are a fan of roguelikes in general, I think you'll love this game."

10593,"I didn't particularly enjoy Risk of Rain 1, but I figured I'd give RoR2 and Hopoo another shot.

Boy was I glad I did. This game is fantastic. After unlocking classes, the game only gets better. This game is a solid 9/10, with soul, charm, and charisma. I love its short tidbits on each item, the absurdity of some exchanges, and the level design.

Truly what games, especially sequels, should be."
10594,its like among us so there for the game is good
10595,"this game is super fun
"
10596,The game requires you to remember badly designed items by heart in order to be able to decide how to build your loadout. Not enjoyable game design. Levels suck and battles are boring.
10597,"I am an avid roguelike player, and from the numerous amounts I have played, Risk of Rain 2 is among some of the best ones out there. Insane amounts of replayability, a pretty good multiplayer mode which is really fun to play with friends and constant updates from the developers keep the game fresh. What I really like about the game is the wide variety of characters and abilities, I could play 1000 hours of this game and still not be bored of it, the music is actually amazing and synchronizes well with the atmosphere of the game. Among other roguelikes I have played, Risk of Rain 2 satiated my one desire, to become so broken/overpowered to the point where my PC hits 10 FPS and everything dies on the screen. This game is really addicting and crazy fun to play with friends, I would highly recommend this to any person who is skeptical about the roguelike genre and/or if you think it is too daunting to play others like Isaac, EtG, Dead Cells etc."
10598,"Not worth this price  ,I wasted my money
"
10599,"More like Risk of Addiction 2. I tried this game out of curiosity and now I am racking up hours in this game like mad. Real fun loot'n'shoot rougelike type deal. There's plenty of stuff to have fun with!

10622,"[code]A satisfying romp with diverse playstyles and neverending challenges. [/code]

This took a while for me to click. At the beginning I was incredibly frustrated because it felt like I wasn't progressing - barely unlocking any characters, items or anything else in terms of meta progression. 

As soon as I accepted that this isn't necessarily a classic Roguelite where you can accept to come back from every run with some incremental advantage but that the content is instead locked to give you goals to work towards I could truly start to let go and enjoy the game for what it is - a slick romp through ever-evolving challenges. 

The characters available are pretty diverse - both in their playstyles and in the skills that you need to excel at them. I'm not exactly a great shot so I shied away from classes that required precise aiming. Instead I opted for classes like the Huntress or the Engineer that either have some form of auto aiming or other means to deal damage while I focused on movement and placing myself. 

Especially in the beginning it might seem like being accurate is all that you need to excel but the more you advance and push yourself the more the actual strategy comes into play. Movement and positioning are paramount - both luring monsters into patterns that keep them bearable and dodging all the attacks that can take off huge chunks of damage. 

The difficulty levels are pretty good at giving you different playstyles - the normal and easy difficulty make it so that you can heal up quite quickly after taking damage, allowing for a more reckless playstyle. Only on the highest difficulty do you feel every single hit and how long it can take to recover half of your health bar. 

In some ways the game does feel like a travelling salesman problem - since the game gets progressively harder the longer you take per stage you are always trying to traverse the levels efficiently. Quickly find the exit, earn money as efficiently as possible and get as many upgrades and other ways to increase your strength as you can while staying efficient. It's an interesting approach and it makes it much more strategic than it seems on the outside. It's a very different feel to something like Left 4 Dead since there's not only how to play your character from second to second but also the fact of: how am I going to approach this level?

If you buy and start playing this game then do yourself one favour though: look up some guides as to how to unlock the characters you're interested in and how to unlock items. Some of them are almost mandatory and it's almost impossible to stumble over some of the best ones by simply playing the game. 

All in all? Highly recommended."
10623,Perfect game to pass the time when bored or in my case on bed rest. Aggravating as heck when playing with friends but that's apart of the fun! Each run holds many different experiences and i greatly recommend it!
10624,ery good
10625,okay
10626,"This game is amazing, I've had some of the most fun I've ever had on a rogue-like on here once I got used to it, 10/10, would play again."

fantastic game design"
10631,
10632,This is a very good game
10633,"genuinely fun game, once you get used to whichever character you use you start flying through levels
it has a large collection of unlockable characters requiring varying playstyles, which is both great for those who like to fully master one character, and for those who switch characters / playstyles depending on their own mood
it has a great hidden story, stylised gameplay and tons of variety with the upgrades and artifact systems

definitely recommended for anyone who likes to slay entire crowds of mobs, roguelite games, expansive upgrade systems and hidden lore"
10634,"Sadly I would love to recommend this game to other players but whenever I try and play co op with my friends we always lose connection, we've tried nearly every solution out there but we always get timed out."
10635,You can play as goku having drip with mods. thats a 10/10 game of the century

10640,"normal game fun 
dlc = do not corrupt your squid poylp"
10641,"This is an AWESOME game. It has a ton of replayability, where every run is different. There are so many things to unlock and challenges to complete, so I'm always coming back for more. It's also extremely satisfying when I become super overpowered, so that I'm practically instantly killing enemies. Even when I 100% this game, I'll still be playing it. Also, the DLC is definitely worth the money, in my opinion. With the new characters, items, and enemies, I love this game even more."

10658,"I got gifted this game a while back and never touched it because I was playing other things at the time. Eventually though some of my friends convinced me to play it with them and holy shit this might be one of the best games I've ever played

I've gotten 100% and played for countless hours and I'm still playing solely because of how different and fun each run can be. Yes that's something that can be said for all rougelites but I haven't had a single boring run with this game and I always figure out new things you can do with certain items (give Light Flux Artificer a try and go freeze-lock the final boss). Even when you do get bored you can mess with the artifacts that you can unlock and there's also some pretty good mods out there. Also the soundtrack is so good there isn't a single bad track in there.

Please give this game a shot if you're into rougelites, third-person shooters, if you just want a good game to play with friends, etc. You won't regret playing this masterpiece of a game. (Thanks Hopoo)"

10667,"It's 218 minutes into the run. I'm so fast that taking even a single step breaks the sound barrier. Every enemy that spawns near me dies almost instantly, and I have long since lost track of how or why. My computer, screaming in agony, struggles to display the visual effects and damage counts created by my dozens upon dozens of items. Suddenly, a handful of bosses spawn just outside my sphere of influence and wombo combo me to death. I go from well over maximum health to zero in less than a single frame. ""Dang, oh well,"" I think to myself as I start up a new game."

10669,"got 100 sodas after hitting shrine of order after 3rd loop, and proceeded to break my own game with my own movement 10/10"
10670,"This game is an awesome roguelite, my friends and I have visited every environment, slain every enemy, and seen every item and we're still coming back for more. Nothing compares to being an hour into a run and feeling unkillable and then just flying off as a lifeless corpse without knowing what killed you until the defeat screen comes up because of the amount of stuff on the screen. The addition of the Survivors of the Void felt like a breath of fresh air as a plethora of new items and a couple new survivors found their way into the game that certainly spiced the late game up, being able to fight the final boss and then go on to fight a final FINAL boss by petting a glass frog on the moon is awesome."
10671,good
10672,Good with friends; one of the few games I found both mods and base game to be really fun. The DLC makes things alil annoying sometimes but it allows for replayability and makes it so achievements feel fun to get (minus 2)

10688,"Super visually impressive. Setting + enemies are colorful and, combined with the music, give off these ""edge of the universe""/""lost in space""-vibes.

Shooting + choosing upgrades is easy fun. Each class is unique and satisfying.

Downsides: the game doesn't explain itself very well. You'll need to dedicate some time to understand each upgrade. Also there'll be times where you're just waiting for enemies to show up, and that can slow down a run, which sucks because a run can last an hour if you're like me."
10689,cool game with fun boss
10690,absolutely yes
10691,you drop onto the planet then proceed to beat up a peaceful local resident and stole their lunch money then you use that money to open a chest that fall from space then you use the item inside the chest to further beat up the local resident and so on...

10721,"When thinking of other multiplayer PvE style games like L4D2 and PAYDAY2, the gameplay is structured around a team-based environment where there is very little player agency. Often times the decisions the player makes aren't nearly as important as how well the team deals with threats together.  Risk of Rain 2 is genius in that it gives the player the maximum amount of agency without reducing variability in the amount of options there are in tackling the game. Whereas in other games it can be nearly impossible to win if a party member dies or messes up during a run, Risk of Rain 2 has such variability in item drops and ability choices that solo carrying your team is very possible; in fact, this is how most runs go.

The art style of the game plays into the action roguelike formula as well as it can, with clean lines and simple animations allowing the player to have crazy amounts of things on the screen while still being able to tell what is going on at all times. The simplicity of the abilities and creature designs should not be overlooked, however, as there are so many complex interactions based on various items and combinations of those items with abilities that learning what each character does feels easy, yet rewarding.

Now lets talk about the soundtrack. Christos Christodoulou orchestrates an insane mix of synth wave and rock music unlike any other game out there right now. The OG soundtrack already had multiple songs that I would listen to by themselves, and the DLC soundtrack is even better... There are some songs that sound like movie trailers; my only complaint is that the music is so good it can be distracting at times while you are trying to not get swarmed down by a swarm of insects.

Difficulty in games is something that can be extremely hard to balance, and yet again Hopoo Games hit the bullseye. All difficulties are rain-based, with 'Drizzle' being the easiest and 'Monsoon' being the hardest. On drizzle, it's very easy to just continuously loop and max out what your character and the game engine can do, great for days you just want to relax. And on the complete other side we have monsoon, where you are on your toes 24/7 racing against the difficulty slider as enemies start getting crazy amounts of damage and health. Rainstorm is a nice middle ground where experienced players are left wanting a little more and new players wish there was a little less. A perfect medium. 

Items follow the typical rogue-like style, ranging from near-useless (Bustling Fungus) to game winning every time you see it (Lens Maker's Glasses). BUT what I enjoy most is there are 'bad' items in every tier that can become good depending on the game state, but good items will always be good. I will never feel punished for taking a Lens Maker's Glasses, or a Bustling Fungus, but if I play the engineer then I like seeing the Fungus way more than I do on other characters. Item interactions are almost never negative, just varying levels of positive. This is a lot different than a game like BoI, where bad items can literally cause you to lose your run. The scrap system allows you to turn items that are under-performing into potentially higher tier items that can save your run, which is just genius... seriously why do so many roguelikes like 'reroll' mechanics like these it gives the player so much freedom. Anyways, speaking of higher tier items, there are great and near-useless items at every item tear, so rolling a red (the highest tier) item doesn't mean your run is an insta-win, which really helps the game feel fresh while adding another layer of difficulty. The best part is, there are modes you can unlock in the game that allow you to choose your items, allowing you to even play some games where you go for a specific build.

Survivors in Risk of Rain 2 need to be studied by other game developers. When this game released there were about half as many characters as there are right now, yet each character is 100% viable. While some characters are more consistent than others, each character has 4 abilities (and sometimes a passive) that are simple to understand while feeling unique to each survivor. The unlock and achievement system feel organic and fun to plan around (except for Ethereal >:( that one sucked). The DLC added 2 more survivors and a bunch more items and yet the new characters feel just as easy to pick up and learn as the first survivors, as if power-creep isn't a word in the Risk of Rain 2 dictionary. It feels just as rewarding playing every character and I think there is a survivor for each type of player out there. Like to sit back, let the minions do the work? Play Engineer. Like to dash in and out of combat, never letting an enemy touch you? Play Mercenary. Like to dual wield, and go pew pew? Play Commando. Like to be slow but powerful, and hoard items? Play Captain. Risk of Rain 2 offers the player so many choices before even entering the game, with each character having a myriad of ability combinations, and even a special skin if you beat the game on monsoon, it's really a perfect balance of simplicity and uniqueness.

In summary, I feel right now a game that costs $25 ($35 for base game and DLC) and has this much heart put into comes along so rarely. Hopoo Games, which started as 2 students at University of Washington, took an already excellent 2D roguelike and landed the jump to 3D. I love this game. This game defines fun. I play other games and wish they were as fun as this game. With almost monthly dev updates and a thriving community, I don't see how this game isn't a slam dunk for every fan of multiplayer games.

10/10 - You need to get this game, I can't wait to see what Hopoo does next."
10722,10/10 best way to zone out and kill an evening. Co-op is fun and the unique characters that each require a completely different play style makes this a game I can see having nearly unlimited replayability.
10723,big
10724,I have acquired eyebags because of this game.
10725,its okay(i love this game)
10726,Multiplayer server's make's warthunder look good.
10727,"I don't like it, there's no satisfaction from gunplay at all.
The game is very easy if you get proper items, all enemies have tracking attacks so if you run you essentially can't get hit."
10728,"Honestly, this is just a great game. Great to pass the time with when the internet is out. The game changes with each play through so it has amazing replayability, and loads of secrets to find! Each time I've done a play through I've been thoroughly entertained, i can even listen to a podcast or music to chill out (or just listen to the phenomenal in-game music and sound design!) It's also incredibly fun to play with friends!"

10734,good game
10735,This game is dope
10736,"I have to recommend this game because it is like 90% good, but the moon zone really was a giant mistake.  It takes too long, it isn't fun or interesting, Mithrix isn't fun to fight and by design can't just be circumvented with item bullshit like every other questionable boss.  You basically might as well get to the moon and then just start a new game if you're trying to have fun."

The game is obviously called ""Risk of Rain 2"", but currently I have played the game for 94 hours and it has never rained a single time implying that there is no risk of rain. Perhaps I am just missing something. I will keep you updated."

10755,"Risk of Rain 2 is a really good game and fun game to play with your friends:
-You have many classes from which you can choose, each having their own uses and abilities. 
-There are multiple maps and enemies, each offering a some-what balanced difficulty. 
-Items variety is really nice, each offering different effects to the character, either offensive and deffensive
-Visuals are vibrant and beautiful and the Sountrack provides a very good atmosphere to the areas.

It is the same maps, same weapons, same people fighting the same bosses, same monsters, and no variety. I would say, that if you want a good co op to play with your buddies, get this game.

[b] Risk of Rain 2 is a fantastic game. [/b] This game got me into the roguelike genre, it's my first roguelike game and I love it. If you're familiar with roguelike games, I'm sure you'll like this game. If you don't recognize the genre, absolutely try it. I truly recommend this game.
[b] Survive, kill monsters and loot chests to collect items, charge up the the teleporter and defeat the boss, head on to the next environment. [/b]

The gameplay is absolutely amazing. [b] Fun, difficulty, unique, high replayability, and great soundtrack. [/b]

 The characters are well done. Hopoo Games know what they're doing here. [b] All of the characters are unique, and different. [/b] It's what makes them all fun to play. Their abilities complement each other and are well balanced. If you learn their abilities and master these characters, you will become stronger, better than ever.
 There are so many items in this game and the fact that you are NOT limited to a number of items is amazing. [b] You can get as much items as you want, you can break the game in so many possible ways. [/b] You can combine items with other items to create a godly build. I love it. 
 [b] Difficulty increases over time, and affects overall gameplay. [/b] A great twist to the game that I enjoy a lot. This makes you value time more, and strategize how you're gonna play. 
 You know how this game is titled Risk of Rain 2? Well, [b] there are many risks to take in this game. [/b] Lunar items, Shrine of Blood, Shrine of the Mountain, I can name so much. It doesn't even have to be an in-game item or structure. The player could take risks themselves like staying on a stage to farm for more items. The fact that making these risks can be worth it or screw you over is fascinating.
 [b] The environments look wonderful and have fair game designs, Scorched Acres brings me pain sometimes. [/b] Each stage has multiple environments except Stage 5. There are also hidden realms that can be accessed through portals which add on to the run. A great addition that makes your runs more interesting, if you enter them that is.
 [b] The soundtrack is phenomenal. [/b] Not even my damage hits as hard as The Rain Formerly Known as Purple. The music needs all your ears a listen. Chris Christodoulou is a brilliant composer, and it shows with his work on this game. The music bops and encapsulates well the expressions it was supposed to capture. My absolute applause. 

Dunno what else to say. The developers put heart into this game and I can tell. [b] It's a great game, absolutely recommend it. [/b]"

10806,"Amazing 3D rougelike. I wasn't a big fan of ROR1, but I love this game. The gameplay is fun and intuitive, the setting/lore is interesting, and there's plenty of content to keep you busy for a long time. The only real issue is that in multiplayer, if somebody dies even once, they're likely to significantly fall behind on items compared to their teammates for the rest of the run."
10807,"This game is a blast to play both solo and in multiplayer. Quick action and easy to learn leads you to running this game until it's 4 am and totally lose track of time. If you are a fan of rogue likes, this is a game for you for sure!"
10808,worth picking up if its on sale. every second of this game is fun.
10809,Very fun and entertaining game. You should try it out
10810,isa good
10811,"Broken and beautiful.

It's the best way to describe the game. When you first get it, it will be difficult; few survivors (characters), few items. You throw yourself in, run after run to learn how different enemies behave, where are chests commonly spawning on maps, and what are some of your favorite items to pair up. Playing it solo, and its a good game to grind through. Play it with others online? Its a whole different feel, but very enjoyable. Play it with friends? You're in for some fun.

As you unlock more things, the game opens up for even more fun ways to play with new survivors or the infamous artifacts. Though most are means of flavoring up challenges, some combinations of them can completely shift the dynamics of the game to be highly in your favor or against you if you want for variant challenges than, ""the highest difficulty setting.""

Just when you thought the game couldn't get better, they add a purchasable DLC that is worth every penny for not just adding new survivors, maps, bosses, enemies and items, but adding such things in a way that can put entire new and fun spins on how you choose to play and build your character as your go through map after map.

For me, it is the most fun game I have ever played with friends. Stack enough of the same item, and the game shifts from ""I'm trapped in her with you"" to ""You're trapped in here with me"" in the most overpowered, hilarious ways where you feel like you are ascending to godhood. This is a game was made with love; you can tell so by all the possibilities and nick-knacks the developers put into the game (especially considering why they made this game 3d instead of 2d like its predecessor). 

If its on sale, get it! If it's not on sale, buy it!"

10/10"
10824,"Excellent game, an evolution of the previous one in every aspect. To a certain degree, it shares the Risk of Rain 1 problem where as you get more and more powerful late into a run, the game gets easier and easier and the survivors feel more and more alike, but it is much less of a problem here than it was in the first game. Apart from that, I have 0 complaints. The core gameplay loop is wonderful, the music is amazing, and the sheer amount of content is incredible."
10825,so good ong frfr :weary:
10826,fun

10838,Remember to disable crossplay if you don't want to randomly DC during a multiplayer run as of the 4/17/22 patch. Otherwise the game is great.
10839,cool
10840,fun
10841,"Yeah, they got the formula just right."
10842,it good
10843,"Lots of playtime, allthough pretty hard
"
10844,fun game god runs are easy with artifact of command
10845,"One of the most fun gameplay loops in any game I have ever played

The sense of progression is feels amazing. I got the game when commando was the only starting survivor, and struggling through the first three stages to unlock huntress, as well as any other items available, was incredibly rewarding and that is how every character unlock feels (apart from railgunner because it comes with the dlc.) The range of different play styles between the characters also keeps the game from getting boring quickly. Tired of Speed running with Loader? Try Rail Gunner: A more methodical sniper character that, with enough luck and skill, can one-shot basically any enemy in the game. Not a fan of the slow pace? Why not give Huntress a go! She can shoot while she runs and teleport a short distance. Do you enjoy the thrill of being on low health? Rex's whole kit is based around sacrificing your health to deal damage and then healing it back up. Want to focus on killing as much stuff as possible? Bandit has an ability that gets stronger every time you kill something with it.

Speaking of abilities, the game is further made more interesting by the alternate abilities each character can unlock (unless it's void fiend.) As previously mentioned, bandit has desperado, an attack that deals more damage for every kill you get with it, but this is an alternate version of Lights out, and ability that resets all your other ability cooldowns whenever you kill with it. Or, again Rex has a whole set of alternate abilities that don't try to kill you when you use them. There are obviously the best abilities to pick for each character (I don't think anyone would rather take Engineer's bubble shield over the harpoons) But these are, fro the most part, locked behind achievements, so getting the better version feels good because you are being rewarded for playing the game well.

Another thing that keeps the gameplay loop interesting is the items. Your item load-out can completely change a run. The free legendary on stage four, for example, could end up being a frost relic, encouraging you to get more up close to the enemies to kill them better, or it could be that one that multiplies all of your missiles by three, which is just broken as soon as you get atg missiles, fireworks, or even if you're playing as engineer since it also applies to the harpoons. The way items can make or break a run is incredibly frustrating, but not in a way that makes you want to quit. If I lose a run because of bad item luck, it makes me want to go back in and try again to see if I can do better.

I have more I want to say, but also it's half past midnight and i am tired so TLDR: This game has an incredibly enjoyable game play loop that keeps itself fresh through the powers of unlockables and fun RNG."

I mean like you could open up this game and start a run on about 30-50 mins average and still die to some BS reason and then you can just closed the game."

The only strength I can muster is pressing Q to burn the whole map down with my gasolines. The randomly dying elites trigger my brainstalks and the purple screen assaults my eyes. I try desperately to dodge the dying Void Devestators while their death sounds make my brain cry in agony. I finally arrive at [its] sanctum, finally I will slay [it]. A mass of purple orbs hit me and my character is dead, holding 3 Combat Elixirs. I am defeated, body and soul. I know I will be here to die again."
10945,"I said I didn't get how this game was so well reviewed and I still don't.  It's chaos with no direction, repetitive when you have to replay the same levels over again, and becomes a spectator simulator for long periods of time which is oh boyyyyy... the most fun feature.  Shoot bullet sponges, pick up items, shoot more sponges.  Depthy gameplay guys.
I was on drugs playing it, still not good."

10953,"To start off, I knew a lot about Risk of Rain 2 prior to the newer update (basically since the announcement of the new DLC). I had Risk of Rain 2 on Switch and racked up 160 hours on the game. A lot of this time with my friend doing monsoon runs. Now, at the time I basically completed everything for the survivors (I had all the alternate skins and abilities) as well as discovered all the major items and got every artifact. Then... for me it got a little bland after this. So I stopped playing because the updates were so late to console compared to PC and the game just wasn't as good as it is on PC. 

Anyway, enough about my memories of the game on Switch. Now that I have the means to play Risk of Rain 2 on a gaming laptop, I have been having great fun with the new stuff in the game as well as the DLC. Honestly, I think I may rack up another 160 hours on Risk of Rain 2. Only this time, on PC. So, in terms of if you should buy the game or not, go for it. I didn't really give anything gameplay wise in this review but this is a game where I truly recommend buying it. It's among my all time favorite games. 

So, I give Risk of Rain 2 a solid 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10"

10990,"after getting 100% on the game i am yet to find the rain

10991,risky
10992,"This one hits all the right notes for me. Enter a rogue-like, sci-fi dressed third person shooter with enough variety and nuance that any given run on any given character will feel all just enough different than the prior. Mechanics are high skill high reward, monster familiarity is rewarded. More of the same that made RoR1 great and I look forward to picking this up with friends on the odd game night ever onward."
10993,"Really good game even if you play it with your friends or not. I recommended your guys to play it with mods after you finished the game. What a masterpiece!! Also, the DLC is worth the price, don't miss it if it on sale

10994,pog
10995,This is such an upgrade from the original Risk of Rain. Everything just feels and plays better. It’s also a lot more accessible as well to a wider audience. Though I definitely think the original game was more challenging
10996,YES
10997,Makes you feel like a god and does so much damage your frames drop. What more could you want?
10998, Good luck trying to find a multiplayer room to join. Multiplayer was the reason i bought this game.

This is one of those games that I keep going back to."
11000,"I would recommend this game to anyone. It is a fun and interesting way to pass time, as the lore behind the game itself is actually really cool. Experimenting with different items and doing the challenges keeps the game from getting boring."
11001,nice
11002,Awesome work and I love the visuals. Different items make it kinda hard when you are starting out but with time it will start to make sense. Very chill if you are waiting for a friend or you want to have some time for yourself. It can get long if you are playing with a friend however it's great if you like to hunt achievements together.

11005,"First time playing I hadn't even googled the game yet, I just picked it up from the store page and started playing. It's intuitive enough to play blind, but bit by bit you develop the skills to make it even more and more enjoyable. Absolute delight to experience, I would highly recommend."
11006,Chance of Precipitation 2
11007,enjoyable experience with friends
11008,its good
11009,I hate this game

11011,"Third person bullet hell, can be fun situationally. In my experience, it tends not to be."
11012,eh
11013,"Endless fun and replay value, there is everything that you want for a rogue like game. Challenge and build variety make for a different run each time, worth the price, pick it up if you can."
11014,Damn it's good.
11015,It fun.
11016,"Amazing game, just buy it already."
11017,"Bunch of classes, and power ups. Sci-fi/magic rogue like exploration where you build your character differently based on the items that drop each run. Bit intense, but addicting."
11018,Boom Boom
11019,"This game is a lot of fun! It's my first time playing a rogue-like game and as of writing this post I have 79 hours on it. It's fun to play both alone and with friends! (Up to four people.) Haven't tried the new DLC yet, though my friends say good things about it. It's been a bit of a learning curve, trying to make different builds and learn how to play different characters. You can always look up videos of tips on Youtube for good builds, and probably can find stuff on Reddit and here in the Community tab as well. The music is also nice! Repetitive, especially if you're doing a long run, but not in a bad way because it's pretty good quality. Yeah! I'd recommend this game (:"
11020,"Spawn, get items, kill things, get overpowered, stub your toe and die, repeat"
11021,"i can get to stage 17 on monsoon but cant beat the fucking boss on easy with op build. wanna know why. he has fucking insta-kill moves, ON EASY, because the fucking one hit protection doesnt do shit. honestly a bunch of bull that makes me want to pee on my pc the stare at my moniter for 5 minutes. and trying to do any kind of achievment for new abilities literally requires you to have the luck of dream and win the fucking lottery 30 times in a row. come on, at least make it skill based, not having to just HOPE what you need spawns in after the literal second fucking week of grinding for a single fucking item to even spawn, cmon, 2 weeks is just excessive. make it skill based at least, jesus christ. well im going to go continue to play this game out of spite then rage and lick my asshole"
11022,"""Well actually, its  a rogue lite and actually its poopin smart en smitten"""
11023,"GUYS THE FUCKING FIXED THIS GAME BRO I NOW CAN RECOMMEND AGAIN. IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF ANY TYPE OF FUN, GET THIS GAME NOW. VERY GOOD GAME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY IT MORE."

11025,"This seemed like the sort of game that my son would like, so I got us each a copy so that we could play together. I now have over double the hours played that he does. It's that good."
11026,Very fun
11027,"Honestly just the best way to pass time if you have nothing better to do, no matter the difficulty. Each run somehow manages to be different from the last despite being a loop."
11028,pew pew gun go shoot
11029,penis and balls :)
11030,"Risk of Rain 2 is a masterpiece roguelike that is nearly perfect in its execution. The characters you can play as are amazing and can shine when you get good with them (Whos Artificer I dont know any character named that) The difficulty scaling is great and how it requires you to learn how to manage it and if grinding for one more chest is the right choice or a fatal one. The items you can get in the game are great by themselves but when combined with others or stacked to higher amounts can make you feel like a god til you realize that a overloading brass contraption just hit you and now you've died.  There is many enemies to deal with that can and will feel overwhelming they were made well and require actual thinking (or a LOT of items) to manage especially during the teleporter event. After early game, if you fail to pay attention for a singular second you will die . The bosses themselves are great to fight and most dont feel like they are too overpowered and can relatively be killed in a sensible amount of time. 

9/10 worth base price"
11031,remove elder lemurians

Recommend it whole-heartedly! :)"
11065,"Great game! No run is the same and there are tons of items, characters and abilities to unlock. Must have if you like roguelike games"
11066,It's a really fun and always refreshing challenge and the fact you can just break it if you really want to is fun

11072,"This game has only gone up in quality since its first days in early access.
If you like seeing BIG damage numbers, being blessed and/or forsaken by RNG, Learning about item synergys, Then try not only Risk of Rain 2 but it's predecessor Risk 1."
11073,"There's enough reviews that talk about the excellent and incredibly engaging gameplay that ROR 2 provides, and truly it's one of the few shooters that I actually genuinely enjoy. There's something for nearly every playstyle that one may have, such as close combat or sniping or whatever. 

But, what truly made me enamoured with this game, is the lore. The logbooks are absolutely chock-full of stories, lore pieces, characters, etc. And there's so many pieces of lore that connect to eachother. I absolutely didn't expect a game like this to have so much thought put into the lore behind the items you use to completely demolish swarms of bosses and enemies. At this point, I'm actively playing the game in hopes of unlocking more of the logbooks as I play. Some of the stories are genuinely heart-wrenching and really get you invested. It's so fascinating to pick up an item in the game and know exactly what the story behind it is.

11074,rained at least once

11079,"If you like PVE games that:
- are Highly Replay-able
- Have unique play-styles to fit many different players
- can be easy when you want, and harder when you are up for the challenge
- Small Storage Space for countless hours of Game-play
- A fresh and unique take on the Rouge-lite genre

This is the game for you. Mess around, shoot stuff, no 2 runs are the same. Honestly, one of the best games I've ever played"
11080,"This game is my first ever rogue-like game, and I was instantly hooked. 10/10 IGN"
11081,Game fun. Dlc make is even more fun. buy the game if you like lean
11082,Risk of Rain 2 takes a little time to learn but once you get adjusted to the gameplay it's really really fun. The sheer amount of replayability and variety it holds also makes it fun for anyone who enjoys looping gameplay.
11083,"If you're not sure about getting this game, get it. I was hesitant, not usually the type of game I enjoy, I haven't been able to put it down."
11084,BEst game evah!! play now kk.
11085,gg
11086,You should play this game now!
11087,"Having initially bounced off the game, I came back to it when some friends got the new DLC and enjoyed much more the second go.
Just be warned that some of the achievements are complete bullshit. Looking at you, Merc: Ethereal."
11088,Noice Game
11089,Great game and Chris is a god
11090,I hate lunar items
11091,"Simply put, this is my game of the year. If not that, then it's now my all-time favourite rogue-like. Each character is interesting and diverse, no two play-through's are the same and the lore is - in a Dark Souls-esque fashion - only available by acquiring the many and varied different items throughout the game, or through logs collected from slain enemies. 

Risk of Rain 2 introduces you to a hostile world, in a mysterious galaxy, and only directs you to fight for your life. How much you get out of that experience depends entirely on how interested you are in experiencing it. I've enjoyed every hour I've played of this game to-date, which is more than I can say for *alot* of recent multiplayer shooters and a much-needed breath of fresh air to enjoy with friends or solo. 

Death is just the beginning. Oh, and, Sky Meadows is a f***ing banger."
11092,Risk is a really good game but since the crossplay came out its started to lag out and glitch the game during multiplayer. please fix it.
11093,Pathfinder go BRRRRRRRRR

*Can Confirm Huntress has a huge dumptruck*"
11102,help
11103,This game is really fun and easy to pickup and put down
11104,"Do you enjoy roguelikes? Yes, you do. Trust me, you do. This game will prove that. There's something for everyone, from Mercenary's triple-S Stylish gameplay to the Captain's orbital bombardment and powerful shotgun, to Acrid's. uh. Dogness. We are all love Acrid.

11115,bungus amongus chungus
11116,"An old friend of mine from highschool bullied me into getting this game, and it's great.  It's fun to turn off my brain for awhile and run around an alien world with a shotgun blasting strange creatures to smithereens.  It's also great to do with old friends, myself and a lot of my bros play this while we chat and catch up with each other.  The lore is also quite interesting, though hard to find in game.  However there's several videos online of people compiling it, if you're interested.  The combat mechanics are splendid, and the character roster is diverse.  By turning on different artifacts on the deployment screen, you can modify the game to suit your preferences.  The way that the difficulty goes up the longer the game goes on is unique, or at least I've never seen it before.  I like it.  It's a lot of fun, and I definitely recommend it.  If you're having trouble, I suggest that you find a friend who's better at the game to carry you and teach you how to improve.  Best of luck, and have fun."

Tons of characters and item progression to keep things fresh, but progression which relies on skill and achievement challenges rather than slogging multi-hour grinding.

11159,"100 Hours in I'm wrriting my first review. 
Lets just start by saying if you don't like difficult roguelikes this game is for you. And if you want to absolutely get your ass kicked this game is also for you. 

This game is a unique experience for anyone trying to have a good time. Solo is pretty fun, but most fun is when you play with friends."

-Customizable Skillsets

-Tons of Replayability

-Awesome Soundtrack

I absolutely love this game and I've only had it for a month and a half.

Awesome game, 9.5/10 because blind pests exist."

*update* I've put 100Hrs into this game at this point and it's still just as fun as when i picked it up. Even dying is comical 99% of the time as my body rag dolls from the impact of the high damage it took to kill me in late game. 10/10 I don't feel like this game is getting old any time soon and I'm still having trouble putting it down long enough to go to bed."

11176,"Game good but you will constantly get hit with the bullshit if you don't set aside your ego and learn what all the items and enemies do beforehand in easy mode.

11193,cool
11194,"Fuck balance, take 99 crowbars."
11195,Good fun game
11196,With the current state of multiplayer I cant recommend the game too much. I purely play this game for multiplayer but I don't think I've had a single run where the game would desync and I would find players running out of world boundaries causing the game to pretty much end the run there. 10 straight runs after an hour where it consistently happens. Until they fix this bug I can't recommend the game

11209,"A chill and at the same time HECTIC action rougelite. Deep and interesting item combinations as you run around the stage to get enough gold to buy them and get strong enough to eventually beat a boss, or loop the stages so to conquer even stronger and more dangerous enemies.

11226,"JK! I would definitely recommend. I even own it on the Switch and PS5. It's honestly a great arcade game. The only problem I personally have with the game is that the beginnings of runs are pretty slow, so it would be nice if there were an option to speed up the spawning of the enemies."

It was just me and Mithrix in a 1 on 1 Battle to the death, first phase went pretty well though a little long due to low gear. second phase a little chaotic but doable. It was like that one scene in Star Wars episode three where palpatine and Yoda are flying around with Lightsabers.

But the last phase… there were no words between me and my brothers for the sound had been drowned out by all the lasers. The boys were cheering me on through messages! It was emotional, chaotic, and tears were even shed.

But as I spammed my right shoulder button and probably broke my hand doing it for about 55 minutes… we won the 3rd fight!!! Unfortunately died on fourth. but it is not what matters this was a battle of pride.

All I can say is if you have not bought risk of rain 2 or it’s DLC. please get them both on the summer sale you need to experience this masterpiece!"

11262,"A man and his wife are out and about when it begins to precipitate. The wife says, ""Oh, it's raining, dear!"" and the man says, ""No, it's snowing."" They debate whether the precipitation is rain or snow for a while before the wife spots someone in the distance. It's the couples' friend, a communist called Rudy. The wife calls Rudy over and asks, ""Rudy, dear, what would you say this precipitation is?"" Rudy responds, ""Why, this is rain, Ma'am."" The wife then turns to her husband, triumphant. ""See?"" she says. ""Rudolph the Red Knows Rain, Dear.""
12/10, best weather app on the market. The dlc was a slam dunk."

11294,"Take a classic (Risk of Rain) and make it 3D right? We have had a lot of tragedies before from this formula. Not with Risk of Rain 2. So many different builds, so many fun environments. So many characters and upgrades. So many ""just one more run"" thoughts that have lead to 5, maybe 6am gaming times. It's addictively fun alone, and enhanced further with friends. I highly recommend giving this a shot."
11295,yes
11296,"One of the best games i have ever played. the base game great and the DLC makes it even better. the only thing i can think that the game needs is maybe a few balance changes with ""some"" characters nerf loader just a little bit.

11319,"Even after 80 hours this game never stops bringing in challenges for any style of player.
Tons of (play to unlock) characters can bring out different play styles and combinations of items that you prefer to make your build the best for your run.
All of the games mechanics seem extremely well balanced, and their Discord server is full of fun and helpful users will to help you understand everything you're seeing!
The fandom wiki page covers a lot of nitty-gritty details and even mathematics of game mechanics, but most importantly it helps you learn what items do, and how to unlock those items for later runs!

I highly recommend this game whether you play alone or with a group, good times are made here."

Fantastic game, I love slowly learning what every enemy and item did.
And then getting one shot....
And then learning what to do in order to avoid getting one shot!

Getting a god run is fun, multiplayer is great and stable, sure it'll become boring after a while but damn that must be a LONG while!
Oh and the gameplay modifiers are also really good, and the secrets, love the secrets.

Almost 100 hours in, can't wait to play more and probably buy the DLC eventually!"

11387,"While watching Gearbox PAX East 2019, I wasn't expecting to encounter a game that would draw my attention more than the game everyone tuned in for. 

An amazing game that can have its already fantastic gameplay loop quadruple in value with friends (you know, as long as you coordinate slightly). The satisfaction of somehow winning with the items you are dealt will never leave me. 

Main menu Logbooks provide the subtle and not-so-subtle lore that exists. Deciding to piece things together rewards you with the context that is very important to me. (I'm a sucker for juicy lore).

Top that off with the beautiful music and great playable survivors and I could just gush about this game for hours.

In conclusion, Risk of Rain 2 is the game that I will always recommend to someone looking for something to play.

I'm looking forward to the next expansion and beyond."

11407,"Very fun, highly addictive due to it's fast, easy-start gameplay. One of my favorite roguelike games to date. I highly, HIGHLY recommend Risk of Rain 2."
11408,9/10. incredible roguelike with great mechanics.
11409,"A great game where only one thing is constant.
You never understand how you died."
11410,"Oh how the mighty has fallen...

What was once my most recommended game for anyone - even to those dwelling outside of the rogue-like genre, has become a complete mess after the addition of the Survivors of the Void DLC - ironically changing the game negatively even for people that did not pay the bloated price for minimum effort content. 

Risk of Rain used to run smoothly and the in-game systems came across as intuitive for players. Besides the lack of patch notes at or after the release of Survivors of the Void, leaving players guessing what all had been changed, several critical bugs (and... to be discovered later, ""features"") prevented previously accessible content from being achieved. 

Changes to the void field affects everyone - not just the owners of the DLC. Characters are no longer able to survive in the void fields and with it progressing the level timer it is no longer a viable challenge to take in order to get a couple of extra items. 

This is really unfortunate. I cannot believe that Hopoo has been so foolish - even in the most recent April 19th patch notes there was nothing detailing relevant fixes and devastating nerfs given to new items that make them unusable and undesirable. 

Shame on you, Hopoo. 

I may reinstall the game in the future and update my review if anything changes - however, I can no longer hold my breath as we are already moving into the third month without any adequate changes or community engagement."
11411,One of the best looter shooters I've played
11412,E
11413,pretty fun
11414,One of my all-time favorite games ever. Super addicting and challenging. Every game you play is different causing you to adopt a new approach. I see myself always coming back for more. Love the new DLC too.
11415,wish had dlc :(
11416,"Excellent game and lore.  Good upkeep by the devs and engaging action.  Relaxing to go into for a single run, exciting for God runs even after so much time.  Co-op shenanigans are also hilarious."

I originally found a hard disc copy for PS4 at Five Below for $5 and after an hour I knew I needed the best version of this masterpiece. It's so fun I literally put down every game I was playing, including AA titles in my backlog, (I literally had just bought Ghostwire Tokyo) because I am having too much fun. Oh, and the mod scene is AMAZING! I could keep going, but just buy this game. And if you really want to have fun the large majority of the player base is on Steam, don't waste your money on the Epic Games version."

11468,SO GOOD ITS A MUST PLAY
11469,wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
11470,"This has easily become one of my all time favourite games to play. It's great single player but it absolutely shines as a multi player option. Offers almost endless versatility with your builds which gives you the option to become an unstoppable god, or to go full stupid and turn the entire world into rockets and explosive maracas. 

Highly recommend"
11471,"For 24.99 it is a solid bit of fun for the 25 to 30 hours it takrs to unlock most things in the base game. But like some rouglikes/lites once you unlock most things there isnt much fun left to be had.

Whenever i play this, despite having numerous ways to actively control my character, I often feel more like the game is on auto pilot. This is probably because every item except a gear item (which you can only have one at a time unless playing a certain character who can use two). Is passive.

There are some that just boost health or defense or what have you. Then there are some that are attacks, flashbangs for example, but they only fire on a percentage chance when you attack.

The result i found is halfway through a run you end up fighting almost on auto pilot and the game does the rest. Much like an arpg the fun is more in build planning considering most people have it set to choose items that drop.

This is different from a game like Hades where player ""skill"" is far more important.

This game is still fun though, especcially with random drops instead of choosing so you have to wheel and deal with what is provided. Regardless of which way you play it is worth it at full price, in the USA at least. If you really like Arpgs like diablo etc where making overpowered builds is most of the fun i think youll have even more fun than  i did.

11472,"They should rename this game to Risk of Blazing Gup, The Omnipotent Overlord"
11473,very fun
11474,nice

11477,very fun-

11479,"Shoot, loot, die, repeat. This game sounds repetitive, and it is, but it's the perfect 3D roguelite. There only progression systems are an easily obtained (without notepad, even!) currency which allows for more sidegrades than upgrades and unlockable skills. The enemies are fun to destroy, easy to learn, and nice to look at. The playable characters all feel reasonably different with a handful standing out as real oddballs, but all are plenty powerful and fun. Infinitely stacking nearly any item in the game allows for some truly wacky stuff.
Overall, I've bought this game for three different systems and still feel like I got an incredible deal."

Best played with friends, but solo works too.  A lot going on here.  You're going to die, a lot, and it's ok.

Unlocks are reasonable and rewarding - RNG sometimes just craps on you.  Don't feel bad playing on easy  to get used to some stuff but the regular default difficulty is definitely more rewarding."

All of the survivors are fun in their own ways and you'll find one you love the most and play the fuck out of. For the majority of the time I've played this game, I would main captain, but then the dlc released and oh my god I love railgunner so much. Multiplayer is fun as fuck and modding makes this game even more fun. You do have to learn what items are best for each survivor, but I find that to be a part of the fun. And hey if you don't want to learn the hard way you can watch some gameplay tips instead, whatever floats your boat. Definitely worth the buy."

Every achievement unlocks new items, characters, or movesets which gives you more incentive to explore and experience the game which is nice. The game is as hard as you want to make it with varying difficulties, a hodge podge of enviorments, a list of unique characters, strategies, and loot whoring. i would say good for about 30-40 hours for your average gamer, much longer for the perfectionist with friends. 
-side note- Give this game a few character unlocks before you judge it, i didnt dive into the game until i found a character i liked"

11595,This game is gud
11596,"This is without a doubt one of the best rogue like games i have ever played. From the first run where i got gang banged by 4 wisps at once before i even knew what the controls were, to my latest run that allowed me to 100% complete the game, I had a fucking blast. The difficulty curve feels rewarding to get past, and even once you pass it, you never have to worry about the game getting boring. You can die from absolutely anything in the goddamn game, keeping you from becoming god and being invincible (sometimes). I can not recommend this game enough, if you love the rogue like genre of games, you need to add the risk of rain series to your library."

11668,"[h1] A sequel so good you'll ask ""There was a first entry?[/h1]
Risk of Rain 2 is a sequel to the game of the same title without the number. A third person PvE rogue like that focuses on making your characters powerful to combat an increasingly scaling difficult environment and enemies, featuring many playable characters with alternative playstyles.

[h1]There was a first entry?[/h1]
I never heard of Risk of Rain outside of people on SiIvaGunner begging for ROR rips and even then I never really saw gameplay of the first but all I know is that the first game looks VERY LITTLE like the sequel when it comes to graphics. Aesthetically, the game has a rather vintage scifi feel to it with bubble and bulb based designs. Graphically, the game is 3D unlike its predecessor. It utilizes a bit of a mix of low detail models with minimal texturingon characters, with much more detailed environments. The feeling of space here is genuinely threatening, comforting, and unnerving when it needs to be.

[h1]There was a game before this one?![/h1]
The game's sound track is genuinely amazing but good luck saying your favorite song is the song from the void fields. 

My favorite song is A Glacier Eventually Farts (And Don't You Listen to the Song of Life). Which is indeed the name of the void fields' theme.

[h1]WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN THERE WAS A GAME BEFORE THIS ONE?[h1]
ROR2 goes along with the other many great games that had sequels that managed to make people forget and neglect the original. Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2, Persona 3, Worms Armageddon. You name it. This game is genuinely super fun and super easy to get into. Mods are insane, from Quality of Life improvements to the game to remove certain filers or add new ones for chests, or straight up adding Ganondorf from the Legend of Zelda with his Super Smash Bros. Brawl moveset, complete with Ganonciding. This game is fun in single player and even more fun in multiplayer."
11669,REALLY SOLID. Just very good.
11670,The only point you have truly won this game. Is if u can get it to crash
11671,"This game puts you through the 5 stages of grief in each run through.

11688,"This is a great roguelike. Try and unlock most of the achievements without a guide, since its really fun to do so"
11689,"shoot gun, kill big boy, good"
11690,"Up there with Dead Cells as one of the best rougelikes I have ever played. It is incredibly fun and will stay that way for a very, very long time. Please give it a try if you're even slightly interested (the time mechanic isn't as scary as you might think it is)."
11691,good game
11692,Super fun and fast paced! The game is a lot more complex than it seems at first glance. Big recommend!
11693,This robot dog goes NUTS over gasoline.
11694,who would have thought doing the same thing over and over and over again would drive you crazy? good game. tells you nothing so it feels good to learn how it works.
11695,Fire game
11696,Fun
11697,k
11698,im still bad at it :(
11699,lots of fun
11700,Great game!!
11701,"Incredible game, just buy it. Endless fun for good prices."
11702,"No amount of letters that I can arrange in compelling fashion could accurately describe how GLORIOUS and BRUTAL this game can be. It's well worth the money and It's the only game I've been able to consistently play over the last few years and never get bored of, end of story. GET IT."
11703,GOOD

11705,Chaos
11706,Simple fun
11707,Easily top 3 of all the rogue likes I've played. The artifacts really help tailor your play style to whatever difficulty you want.

11711,Yes
11712,nice game
11713,it is a very fun game but gets repetitive and needs more content
11714,yes... of course... obviously
11715,"One of the best games ive ever played, fantastic, thrilling, intense, you feel like a God. Good game."
11716,"Deceptively deep, incredibly unique, and awesome coop shooter not like any other."
11717,its ok i guess
11718,Great Game
11719,"you get a sense of intensity and are always on the edge from beginning to the end, you can become a one-shotting God, but then the enemies will ditch their peons and bring out their elites, and the reinforcements will only increase in numbers, you lose yourself in the murder and enter a trance, death everywhere...
then you get one shot by a shitty peon that has some crazy properties to their attack.
1/10 trash game wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy."
11720,Why is my piss red

11722,this is good

"
11729,Honestly one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time. Very well developed and is a lot of fun to play by yourself or with friends. This game has brought my joy of solo gaming back. Also love being able to scale depending on how difficult you want it that play through.
11730,"good game

11731,Suuuuuuupeeeeeeeeer fun game
11732,it's great
11733,good game
11734,Yep.
11735,"How early access should be done in every game.  Devs are super transparent about whats being worked on, and provide regular updates."
11736,GOOD
11737,its aight i guess
11738,"If this game ran from a 5* rating, it'll be a solid 4/5
Single-player is bearable with enough random aspects, along with achievements and achievement-gated skills that help keep the game-play relatively fresh.

Multi-player is where the game truly shines with a variety of mixing up artifacts, grabbing your mates' loot and challenging bosses at a game phase where a single touch will shatter you.

//SPOILER//
DLC is worth the grab with a new alternative ending and boss, a few new maps and new survivors, with a good chance more might be added!"
11739,This game requires negative iq to play and you still win
11740,"i had a house, a wife, a few kids. but all that changed once i started playing this game. our wifi sucks so i normally get a hotel room in order to play this game and i told my wife i was just working late at the office. she found out and thought i was cheating. nope. just playing this sick ass game. getting a divorce soon, shes taking the kids. good, i dont want them messing with my bandwidth."
11741,"i love it, never gets boring and can be played little to no effort depending witch difficulty you choose the dlc added a bunch and i needed more charicters and bosses + items and more. over all i loved this game top 2 along with terraria but RoR2 is top tier best game 10/10."

11747,Good rogue like. Turns to chaos quickly. Good fun with friends.

11754,"I would like to go on the record and say that you should not purchase or play this game if you are planning to play it solo. You will require many friends if you wish to slay the creatures I have seen. Or, moreover, the beast that follows me into every game I play. Without allies, you'll have no chance. I figure if I cannot kill him, you may be able to.

I tried to play this game solo, picking a character and jumping in, enjoying the soundtrack, getting a feel for the items and weapons, wondering if this would be the end of my curse. The end of this tragic series of events. How wrong I was.

I must have had my game once again corrupted by him, as this time, there were no enemies, and I quickly found him sitting there. I could have sworn he laughed as I rounded the corner, taking immense pleasure in the fact he had yet again ruined another game for me. 

I tried to run away, but he did something and a gravity field around him drew me in, and he grabbed me. I was then subsequently fucked by a monkey. During this violent onslaught, I managed to scoop my pistol up off the ground, and shot him in the foot, which caused visible pain, and damaged him. He took an angry expression, and continued the onslaught, chucking me away and vanishing.

Can he really be beaten? Can someone.. other than myself even discover this monster? Only time will tell. Please, do not make the same mistake I did. Bring backup. Maybe you can defend yourself, as I have failed to do.

I've sunk well over 100 hours into this game at the time of reviewing and I have no intent to stop playing any time soon. I played on console before buying it on steam with the release of the latest DLC (Survivors of the Void) and it was worth every penny.
I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone reading this."

11777,"Risk of Rain 2 is a game you need to atleast beat once to truly appreciate it, but once you enter stage 6 and kill the final boss for the first time, oh boy, that's when the addiction begins, you start playing run after run, unlocking survivor after survivor, trying to unlock every item, the game keeps you playing for hours and hours at a time, the average run usually takes around 30-60 minutes, but it can be as short as 1 minute or as long as, well, there is no real limit, the stages can loop forever, which makes the game super replayable. No 2 runs are the same and it makes the game feel unique while also familiar at the same time."

Sniper:

“Boom. Headshot.”

[The meet the sniper title card appears. The scene changes back to the sniper in his trailer.]

Sniper:

“Snipin’s a good job, mate. It’s challengin’ work, Out of doors, I guarantee you’ll not go hungry,

[The scene changes to the sniper brushing his teeth in front of a mirror. On the side, there are three pictures. A blu scout and a blu engineer, with x’s drawn over them, and a blue heavy, with the camera zooming in on him.]

Because at the end of the day, as long as there’s two people left on the planet, someone’s gonna want someone dead.”

[The scene changes to the blu heavy, firing away before getting shot in the head. The bullet goes through his skull and hits the blu demoman, who gets his bottle stuck in his eye. He fumbles around, screaming and shooting his grenade launcher, before he falls off the bridge and into some barrels, which then explode.]

“Ooh.”

11791,not very replayable tbh

11796,its pog champ
11797,"Buy it
"
11798,"The Good
The Single Player Itself Is Good But This Very Much So Feels Like One Of Those Games Ment
To Be Played With Friends Without Friends Its A Good 3 Stars With Friends 5 Stars And I Havent Even Got The Artifacts Yet 
Artifacts Are Modifiers You Can Put On Before Going Into A Run Think There Not Enough Enemys Artifact Of The Swarm Instead Of 50 Theres 3 Jillion Dont Know What Survivor To Pick Artifact Of Metamorphosis Every Time You Load Into A Stage Your A Different Survivor What 1 Shot Artifact Of Glass You Get 1 Shot And You 1 Shot 

The Bad
The Only Bad Thing I Can Say About This Game Is The Fact All Survivor Alternate Abilitys Are Achievement Locked
Of That Alone That May Not Seem That Bad But Some Of The Achievement Are Ridicules 
Yes Sometimes You Can Get Some Just By Playing But A Fair Majority You Halve To Look Up A Guide 
And Theres Afew You Have To Look Up A Guide And There Still A Pain To Get 

Final Statement 
Great Game To Pick Up With Some Friends Its Insanely Replayable And A Riot With A Group Of Friends
My Only Gripe Are The Survivor Alternate Abilitys Being Locked Behind Some Ridiculous Achievements 
Besides That 1 Thing Great Game And If You Arnt Sold Off Of That Its Like If Muck Was A Character Shooter

Also A Heres A Challenge To Do With The Boiz 
Artifact Of Glass + Artifact Of Swarm 
Beat The Game With Those Artifacts On Monsoon And You Are A Certified Gamer"
11799,woah really
11800,Very fun game to play. Great if you are just trying to get use to PC controls.
11801,‼️
11802,  I feel like it would be easier to give up a meth addiction than than to stop playing this game. Its formula is so addictive. Every play through is different. Every character is unique and fun to play. the new dlc completely changed the game and made it almost brand new again.
11803,Fuck this game is addictive.

11826,Everyone and their mother knows Risk of rain 2 is an amazing masterpiece of a rogue genre. What everyone doesnt know is that this game has a fully fleshed out vr mod that made me like characters i didnt even like while playing on computer. On top of that i can play risk of rain 2 in the same room as my wife who has never played rogueliikes before  because of vr. GG NO RE best vr roguelike on the market and one of the best vr games. TLDR: VR Mod OP.

11837,i am not good at this game
11838,Hyper addictive and fun co-op
11839,It's a lot of fun there are a hand full of survivors to chose from each with there own play style i have this game on my xbox so iv'e been playing for some time now if you looking for a really fun rouglike game this is it!!!!

11848,"The movement is fluid, the combat is dynamic and satisfying, and the music is electrifying"
11849,its good
11850,"So like this game is good and all but I wish I had friends to play it with... Anyway, the game itself is very polished and the replayability value in insane since you always try to come up with a build to match the item rng. This is one of the only games that make the first 10 minutes feel like an hour and anything after that feel like seconds. All of the survivors are non-identical and their playstyle is vastly distinct, each survivor comes with unlockable alternative skills, allowing the player to experience the game differently on the same characters. The items themselves are meaningful, at least most of them (fuck fungus that shit sucks unless corrupted or on stationary engi turrets), and collecting hundreds of them in longer runs feels very rewarding. 10/10 game
P.S. The music fucking slaps, best OST I've heard in any game."

11861,Fantastic game with lots of replayability!

theres this item called Spinel Tonic that lets you experience cocaine

11864,yes
11865,endless replayability
11866,Game legit cured my stomach bug buy it and you'll like it.
11867,This game makes cocaine feel like doing itself.
11868,"I've played a few hundred hours of the first game and never felt like I ran out of things to explore and interactions to play around with. This sequel not only stays true to that vision of sheer openness, but also expands on it to a degree that seems almost impossible. Every item feels like it has a place, and every survivor has a unique method of making themselves known as iconic. Truly an upgrade, never a bore; a must-buy for anyone who values replayability and endless options!"

11891,ay lmao
11892,"One of the best co-op games available. Challenging, rewarding, characters for any playstyle, and a crazy amount of hidden/secret content to discover. (Seriously... after 100 hours I think I have 63% game completion.)

Solo runs are enjoyable as well, but the game truly shines online."
11893,Fun with friends
11894,"so fun 
JUST DONT START WITH COMMAND
i had watched alot of yt vids before playing and all i saw was afrtifact of command for insane runs, but when i played i instantly got command and it was SO hard to get off of it, so just beware if you want a real fun challange use artifact of glass tho it is just insane and a real test of not your damage dealing but your doging. so yeah (also dont shame me for a run-on sentance i just dont like punctuation)"
11895,Probably one of the best games I have played in terms of fun and value. Only downside is you kinda need an hour+ for a single run.

11937,VERY COOL
11938,"yeah
"
11939,I have played this game on and off sense early access way back when borderlands 3 was announced. Coming back with every update. This game is a very good rogue-like 3rd person shooter. Hopoo games is a very consumer friendly development studio. This is a great game to play with friends as only one person needs to have the dlc for everyone to utilize its content (except characters) So you can have a sugar daddy friend and still experience most of what risk of rain has to offer. The content pipeline is pretty consistent. Honestly I think this game is better than most titles in the market.

11953,"How to play
1. Become God
2. Die"
11954,"Risk of Rain 2 is a great, action-packed roguelike that is perfect for someone looking to get a taste of the genre.

Much like any other game in the genre, RoR 2 gives an endless amount of replay value without really ever going stale. When I first bought this game, I put 60 hours into it in the first 2 weeks alone.

One thing that this game gets right compared to other roguelikes is its ability to make you feel truly unkillable. While you can definitely get to this point in most roguelikes, RoR 2 takes it to the next level, to the point where some runs have you zooming across the map at mach 11 and killing every enemy in your vicinity just by standing next to them. There are certain roguelikes that seem to cap you from completely steam-rolling the game (Enter the Gungeon comes to mind, with most weapons having a damage cap against bosses), while RoR 2 seems to embrace the idea of becoming God and wreaking havoc. Even then, in this god-like state, you are vulnerable to being one shot by any random enemy that lands a hit on you late game, so it still forces you to be on your toes even deep in a run, which is a tight balance that RoR 2 is able to pull off.

Beyond the gameplay, RoR 2 has a very appealing stylization that gives it the look of an alien planet that it was going for. It has very smooth edges with low amount of visual detail up close, while being able to convey distinctly what each enemy and object on the map is supposed to look like. Complementing the visuals, the sound track goes hard. With a lot of the games I play, I like to mute the in game music in favor of my own, but I simply can't do that with Risk of Rain 2. They did an incredible job on the music for every stage in this game.

Another feature in this game which puts this game over a lot of other roguelikes is its multiplayer. Very few roguelikes even have multiplayer, and even fewer are able to pull it off well, but RoR 2 does both. You can play with up to 4 people online with item spawn rates going up to compsensate, and it is a blast. There are some hiccups with multiplayer, with the main one being that if you die, you are simply forced to watch your friends continue to play and collect items without you, but I'm not sure how you would fix that problem anyway. Overall, multiplayer is a welcome addition to RoR 2.

The criticisms of this game are few and far between, but the chief one I have with the core gameplay is the teleporter events late game. Anyone who has made it to ""super late game"" (which is to say anytime past your second loop through or so) will tell you that having to wait for the teleporter to charge in late game is a big waste of time. What ends up happening quite often in this late game scenario is you will start the teleporter event, kill the boss instantly, and then have to wait the 2 1/2 minutes or so just sitting in the circle waiting for the teleporter to charge. This grinds the gameplay to a halt and slows down what should be a constant fast-paced game, in my opinion. My suggestion is this: if you kill the teleporter boss in under 1.5 seconds, cut the time it takes the teleporter to charge in half. This might not solve the problem completely, but it might help the stagnation of just sitting inside the circle and doing nothing. Beyond this complaint, the gameplay stays fun and exciting all the way through.

Overall, this is a top 5 roguelike and a top 10 game all time for me personally. The feeling you get insta-killing everything on the map once you get to a certain point in the game is unmatched, and the journey to get to that point is engaging as well.

9/10, Mul-T double rebar is the best"

11963,monke
11964,Risk of Rain 2 is an improvement on the original. This game only has 5 stages. But the amount of content makes this game last forever. There are dozens of items to spice up each run. This game is worth the money and you WILL develop a chronic addiction.
11965,"coolio game, just hated trying to find a scavenger so I just altered my save"
11966,Im addicted :)
11967,Absolute banger
11968,"Torture the Unity game engine with 40 stacks of soldier's syringe. Fast-paced, item stacking lunacy in the form of a third-person shooter."
11969,"Ever since the dlc came out you cant play the base game, It just crashes on launch i've tried every solution i could find online and nothing worked, hopefully the devs can find the issue because this is a great game when its playable.


Edit they seem to have fixed it or my monitor some how was the issue."

11977,"Despite the fact that I've played this game for 150 hours I think I'll leave a negative review.
I had a lot of fun playing this game when it just came out. Most of my hours are from the first version of the game when it wasn't ""overbalanced"".

While most of the game loops are very solid, the characters are interesting, maps are gorgeous, achievements are fun, and more, the thing that ruins this game for me are random incredibly unfair enemy encounters that end a normal good run.

Death comes whenever the game wants you to die, and it doesn't matter how early or late you are into the run or how strong or weak your build is. And everytime it happens it feels like there's nothing that you could've done to save the run. It feels 100% unfair. 

Here's one example: Somitemes instead of a regular boss the game spawns a group of elite enemies. I got 5 Elder Lemurians with shields. That means I had to both keep my distance from them and stay in the teleporter so that it charges up and stops the regular enemy spawns. And on top of that to kill a shielded elite I had to keep shooting it or it will regain all of it's shield in 2 seconds AND it has a lot of hp AND it is one of the most aggressive enemies in the game AND there are 5 of them AND I'm playing as a class that has to be close to enemies to damage them. Obviously, I died

Here's another one: I was having a 1 hour long run and trying to get to stage 50 in the simulacrum mode. At wave 40 the game gave me a modifier, an artifact of glass, that reduced my hp to 10% and gave me 5x damage. I died immideately. -1 hour of my life, can't wait to do it all again.

These things happen very often. 90% of my runs end in dissapointment and with a feeling that I've wasted 30-60 minutes of my life.

This game is bullshit."
11978,very nice
11979,i would let this game impregnate me and my wife

11988,Great multiplayer game so much more than just a round based survival. Lots of cool combos and builds you can do and the character selection is large and each one is unique and plays its own way. would recommend 10/10
11989,its really fun with friends
11990,"A really good roguelike, has a really nice difficulty curve as well."
11991,The real risk is doing 5 runs and you've pissed the day away.
11992,Huntress got me bricked up at 2am on a Monday night brvh....

12016,"haha i shoot the jellyfish he explode ahehehe hoo hoo :)

edit: thanks for seven billion likes"
12017,"It's good.  I like it.  Run around, frantically shoot at stuff, and feel your brain turn to goo as the scene steadily dissolves into flashing neon explosions!  I find each of the survivors to be quite unique, and they all take time to learn to play effectively.  The items often don't seem like much at first, but as they stack up can have significant impacts on gameplay.  Playing with artifacts can have a massive impact on the game, allowing for greater variance between runs.  Then there are the alternative game modes which I haven't even really touched after 175hrs, so there is definitely a lot of content here.  Oh and the soundtrack slaps.

It has some problems.  Most notably, how common it is to die instantly at pretty much any point in a run.  This actually seems to get more likely the longer your run goes on, which makes it that much more frustrating because of how much you stand to lose.  As a rule, I think one-shots are a design mistake except in exceedingly rare circumstances, such as during major boss fights on the condition that you can learn the behavior and learn to avoid it.  Alternatively, they're fine when you won't lose much progress.  In this case, you might lose an hour or more of playtime in a way that feels pretty cheap.    

But despite some design choices I find pretty questionable, it is on the whole a very fun game and I do not regret my time with it."

12028,"This game has so much in it. I love to play with players of the Discord and some friends as well. I keep finding new things to do and I have yet to discover some things and I love the mods! There is so many aspects of the game such as speed running, pvp and and some simple runs and more I have yet to discover."
12029,"Can't beat that feeling when you suddenly realize that you're 4 hours into a run when the last time you checked it said 70 minutes. Tons of replay value, very fun."
12030,"I loved the first Risk of Rain so much that when the second one came out and I saw it was in 3D, my initial reaction was ""Oh no, they've ruined it. There's no way they'll be able to recreate what made the first game so cool.""

I'm happy to report that I was dead wrong.

The core loop here--killing enemies to get gold to open chests to get items to get OP combos to utterly destroy King Nothing--is so incredibly satisfying that I find myself thinking about it when I'm at work or in class, or out having a fancy dinner.

Pre-loaded with challenges to complete to unlock even more items, characters, and equipment, there's no shortage of goals to work toward. Unlocking playable characters, items, equipment, alternate ability loadouts for characters, relics... there's a ton. I haven't come close to unlocking everything after 70 hours, and that's *with* help from the wiki (which you'll most likely need, as some of the requirements for unlocking new things are insanely specific).

The music and art are impeccably designed and executed, and create a stylish, unique atmosphere for you to romp through. Animations are fitting, not distracting, and communicate exactly what they need to. This thing looks, sounds, and FEELS like nothing else in the best way possible. Every character has their own unspoken personality, and every environment feels alive and lived-in.

$25 is a steal for this much high-quality content, made an even better value proposition by the engine and mechanics behind it all that make you want to do it all again immediately, but maybe a slightly different way; just one more run. If you can find it on sale, picking this up is a no-brainer. And once you realize you love it, pick up the expansion. It's more of the same high-quality, cranked up to 11 with purple-hued particle effects. What a game."
12031,"Lets just say i'm glad I didn't spend a lot of time on this game and buy the DLC.

What is most fun about this game you ask? Well from the little time in this game I can tell you...
Burning alive... meh
Standing in the void..? FUN

My save got wiped.

I did some research to try to fix it. I discovered there is a bug that can occur, but it's fixable. Unfortunately, mine is not. The bug I found involves the game making a new, empty save and refusing to acknowledge your old one. The fix is to simply copy the contents of the old into the new. I, however, don't seem to have an old save. I have two files: One which is completely empty (0 KB in size), and one with contents, but a whole ton of 0's in stats that definitely should not be 0's.

This promptly killed any and all interest I had in this otherwise really good game."

12131,"[h1] Answering a question nobody asked or wanted to be answered:
""What if we made a roguelike where a single mistake instantly ends your 30 minute run?""

From the creators of risk of rain 1 here is risk of rain 1 again but this time its 3d with barely any new content!!! [/h1]

The entire ""ThE GAME getS hArDEr the MORE TIme YOu Spend in a RUn"" gimmick is so so stupid and ads absolutely nothing. 
This is never an issue unless you are playing a slow character and the rng doesnt give you any movement speed items which just feels unfair and stupid.
The game being harder on later stages is literally the default for the genre anyway.

After like ~30 minutes the enemies already one shot you so pretty much nothing changes from that point with the exception of the endboss becoming borderline impossible.
You can spend 5 days straight looping levels and farming up items just to instantly die on the third stage of the WHITE HUMAN WITH A HAMMER final boss because he takes all your items and then one hits you with a single shot because hes max level.
Whats the point of spending the entire game collecting items just for it to take them all?
And the race against time at the end these arent reasonable challenges they are arbitrary garbage designed to screw first time players over.

In every other roguelike dying is part of the experience but here it always feels like youve been cheated cause its always without a fail some random critter that swatted you out of the air with a fireball probably from off-screen too and just like that your 30 minute run is over.
The progression is pretty bad all around you unlock a handful of items but half the stuff ive unlocked still hasnt even shown up hours later cause the drop rates are just that stupidly low.
While other games in the genre have you go up against sometimes hundreds of different enemies across tons of areas you are mostly just shooting the same bug, lizard and flying skull through your entire run.
They just get tankier and later come in different flavors of monster energy [elites] glowing in a random color making them stubidly tanky while still being the same stupid little bug.
Other roguelikes have interesting enemy and challenge designs but all risk of rain has to offer is basic projectile spitters and melee attacks the most interesting attack pattern that isnt a boss is a big lizzards linear spread of fireballs. yawn.
All the maps feel exactly the same with no enviromental hazards or stage gimmicks just stage 5 has some flying rocks that sometimes hit you and throw you off the map deleting most of your health. yawn.


Random elite enemies make any build that isnt bleed and attack speed worthless.
Being thrown off the map by unreasonably high knockback attacks gets you stuck in a loop of being reset to the island just to fly off at mach speed cause your momentum wasnt reset.
You constantly get thrown into the stratosphere if your toe clips an incline with too much movement speed.
The teleporter charging always finishes at 99% not 100%.
Some basic enemies lock onto you with hitscan and then shoot you while off screen or plant near insta killing acid puddles on the ground that you wont be seeing cause you are looking up shooting at the aforementioned goons.
A few bosses have big AOE attacks that mostly just one hit you or put 300dps dealing burn stacks on you and all your drones unless you hide behind a wall which rarely ever works sometimes I had entire mountains between me and the center of the attack and still got hit.
Player drones get stuck on everything including the floor whenever possible and just sit there until they die to some basic enemy attacks.

Maybe not that big of a complaint but the item/monster/area log in the main menu doesnt have a button to mark all as read so you have to click every single entry to remove the notification like cmon you added a 3d model viewer but you forgot something this basic??

Oh did I mention that its been 2 years since this released on steam?


All the items amount to is [dmg on hit] or passive stats anyway so theres never really a ""feel"" of having a special build you just always shoot the same gun at the same 3 types of enemies the only thing that changes is how fast their healthbars go down.
You spend most of the game just stacking lowest rarity items anyway.

Theres no alternate routes to take or any noticable difference between a near 100% savefile and a fresh one.
The biggest run changers are the artifacts (various modifiers) that you have to unlock in an utterly mind numbing challenge room where you just kill enemies while you get shot at waiting for keys to spawn for a few minutes.

This is just not a good roguelike but at least its actually a playable game unlike the first one.
25€ is a pretty steep price for a half assed remake like this
Gungeon or Rogue Legacy 2 are cheaper than this and they are infinitely more polished and have more content.

In conclusion this game is great if you want a headache from hearing the same player gun shooting mp3 for 30 minutes straight.

[h1] Solid 6/10. Mid as hell. Feels more like ""Risk of Rain 1 3D Early Access"" than a sequel.
Id still give a thumbs up but this game absolutely does not deserve 96%.
Steam reviews are just meme garbage anyway.[/h1]


""polished and immensely replayble"" -IGN
Why is IGN still in business? Does anybody value their opinion? 
Dont show them binding of isaac or they might get a heartattack thinking its the second coming of christ."

12133,"this game is super good , you should play it to!"
12134,"meh, needs a chef character to round out all the food items."
12135,fun game good game
12136,"this is an amazing game and fucking wonderful if you have friends to play with, tons of content and pretty good lore if youre into it if not then fine.
however... the reason this is a negativ review is because of a very simple thing.
i just spent 2 hours on a run, i had every item in the game, most of them more then one. i defeated the final boss in the base game and moved on to do a dlc boss. after defeating the final boss theres a timer before everything fucking blows up so i was in a hurry...
i get to the place to get to the other boss and you have to give it a currency which you can only get through playing the game. i have 73 hours and only have 140 ish right. youre supposed to give this thing 10 of this currency and it will spawn a portal......
apparently theres a 10% chance for this portal to spawn after 10 coint. i didnt know so i kept giving it... 49 coins later. everything fucking explodes and i loose 2 hours of progress. i have never in my life been fucking so hard by rng jesus. thats why this is negativ... fuck this game, i love it 10/10 dont buy it"

12160,"I was playing an Eclipse 4 Engineer run and finally got to the end. I had a Volcanic Egg and Fuel Cell so I could skip Stage 6 pillars. I had a shit ton of healing drones from having too much money. I had a Pocket ICBM so my 3rd ability let out a swarm of 12 rockets. I found a Col Droneman on a Stage 6 pool and traded him for my 5 green scrap. I shredded Mithrix to pieces, but then phase 4 came around and Col Droneman fucking killed me.

Highly recommend this game this is probably the most fun i had from such a simple game.

If you love dungeon crawlers/roguelikes with no extreme backstory nonsense then this is for you.
Its all about challenges and challenging yourself!
HOWEVER if you love playing with drones or any form of npc ally this game sucks the life out of you by one shotting your entire npc gang with void enemy's.
A big part of this game has become comepletely unplayable for AI supported characters.... stupid void balls of one shot"

12203,"An incredible game to play. I have followed Risk since its early days in development and was so excited when it finally released, There is so much stuff to explore in the lore side of item and monster and the gameplay is amazing, the art style is on another level and the soundtrack is one of my favourite game soundtracks of all time. Get this game you will not regret it, then tell your friends to get it and play it with them."
12204,"One of the absolute best rogue-like games I've ever played. Different characters have different loadouts and completely different playstyles, makes sure there's always something different you can do and you can never run out of stuff to do. One of the most balanced games i've ever played by far. Each item has something to offer, and while some definitely are better than others, each item definitely has something useful, or some scenario where it could be useful.

In summary risk of rain 2 is balanced, exciting, fun, endless, chaotic in all the best ways, and one of my absolute favourite games of all time. No question about it. 

Definitely a worth while purchase if you know you like rogue-likes, but i do know this type of game is not for everyone.

Still definitely encourage all to buy this game, and even the DLC (personally I think you should play the game without the DLC for a while then buy the DLC.)"
12205,"The game is just good, there are a variety of ways to enjoy it and it's easy to dump hours into it without realizing it."

Worst Game Of All Time"
12221,"Top tier rogue-like. The gameplay is so much fun and offers a vastly different experience depending on the class you select. There are so many easter eggs in the game. Even 60 hours in, I discover something new every week! With the Void DLC update, the game became harder and more fun, too!

I want to especially point out the music in this game. If it didn't give me post-traumatic stress from dying horribly almost every run, I would add it to my playlist.

10/10. This is a game for the ages."
12222,good
12223,Great team game. 8.5/10
12224,"This is truly one of the most fun games i have ever owned. A game that no 2 runs are near the same, endless options of builds and hundreds of ways to have fun. The game itself runs amazing aswell as the graphics being completely mind-shattering a true sequel to one of the best 2d games made. I would recommend that you play this game with friends because it can make your experience 10 times better."

12284,I've never seen rain in this game
12285,"One of the best gameplay loops I have ever played. The games sole purpose is to complete achievements. If you like that sort of thing then this is a good game for you. 

The soundtrack is SEVERELY underrated. It is dynamic and works well with the environment you are playing in.

It is a challenge but not incredibly difficult. 

Best played with a partner or a whole group. Still okay when played solo.

INCREDIBLY well optimized. Can play for hours and make the game drop in frames but it will NEVER crash. Well done.

Overall a nice chill game you can grind to complete 100%. With a little bit of intensity thrown in from time to time

12294,"a really fun game about shooting hordes of enemies and watching them all pop into pieces because of the effects of your items

but it doesn't have a save feature so I cannot recommend this game to anyone who can't dedicate their entire computer to running this for many hours just because you had to go to bed or cook food

downloading things from unknown sites to obtain a simple save feature should not be a thing anymore in 2022. if you think a save feature should not be added because people might abuse it in their runs you might as well remove Lunar Coins because they can affect people in multiplayer"

Every character is worth playing even if you're turned off by their play style when you first try them. Every character is very unique and with the amount of items you can collect, there's practically an infinite number of play styles that mesh with items that you like. The music is also definitely a highlight, so much so that I found myself finding the OST and downloading many of the songs in this. Definitely worth every penny, fully recommend."

12337,"It has a lot of polish, sure, but it lacks any meaningful gameplay. By default the game just feels like you're pulling a slot machine lever, maybe you'll get a lot of good items, maybe not, you can't offset your runs with any amount of skill. Either you die early because you found crap, or die later because all of the enemies remove your ability to heal and have instant kill abilities.

12378,"This game is addictive in the best way possible. I've never not had fun playing this (after I understood how to play ofc, which didn't take long). Would absolutely recommend this to anyone, whether you have experience with the genre or not"
12379,"This game is damn near perfect. The only ""problem"" it has is how easy it is to accidentally have an 8 hour long session. So plan accordingly. But great map design, cool and balanced characters with good tool kits, great sound, strong variety of enemies and items.... Its just pure, simple fun. No dumb gimmicks or cash grabs. Can obviously tell it was made by devs more interested in making a good user experience than anything else. You will absolutely not regret buying this game at any price point."

12390,"Fun game that keeps me coming back for some relaxing after work fun
"
12391,best game ever
12392,"If this had the cost of a new AAA game I'd still buy it with no hesitation. This is also the only game that is worth me spending my time to review. Unless you hate rogue-likes and shooters, but that would make you about as weird as someone who likes pineapples on pizza. Those people are crazy."
12393,"Risk of Rain 2 is a great game that offers several different ways to play. Unlike most roguelikes I've played, RoR2 not only allows the player to choose between several different characters who all have their unique move sets. The game also gives the player a plethora of different ways to build their character while playing.

The game hosts a mysterious and quite fascinating story that unfolds as you get further into the game. Different locations the player visits, all either tie into the overarching story or tie into an individual character's story arch. This allows players who want to learn more a reason to play every character and to use their specific skills.

However, the game has one major shortcoming. Playing alone can become quite boring. The interactions you have with your friends or teammates, the pressure you feel when you have to carry your team to the next level, those feelings aren't there if you play alone. Although, there is a solution which is to join the Risk of Rain 2 discord where you could play with other people.

Overall I've had a blast playing the game so far and there is a lot more for me to explore in this game!
8.5/10"
12394,fun
12395,"Much like RoR1, RoR2 comes with a welcome host of challenges and reworks both from and new to the RoR franchise. I feel that if you have the time and money, it is well worth your attention. As with all games that Hopoo Games comes out with, I'm glad to see that your lust for excellency still exceeds my expectations."

Soild 8.5/10   9 with mods 

really fun with friends and yeah its swag"
12427,"Great Game, i would only buy it in a sale tho"
12428,i enjoy
12429,"I wrote a massive review but hit the ""no"" part instead of yes to see what happened - it deleted the entire review.

I love this game, you should too.

<3"
12430,Good game hate the insta kill doe
12431,I have had this game only for a little bit and already have 100 something hours on it. This is one of the best games I have ever played and It is a great experience. 100% would recommend.
12432,Not enough hot men
12433,"I LOVE Rr2 so much but the more you play you realize mid-late game is mundane, each run melts into being the same one. The concept of difficulty is fake in Rr2, the items play the game for you which means expression of skill simply does not matter. even with a plethora of item styles ur forced into the meta of prioritizing damage to keep playing, its either that or you become overwhelmed by the incapability of killing enemies and dying,  soooo youuuu better pick up the same old damage/damage complimentary items rendering any other builds useless and many items unusable. The game overall becomes a tedious methodical boring process, how boring are you to replay the same game-play loop??
i also believe thats why the engineer is a community favorite character because hes the only character with enough flexibility to make different builds/items viable making him and the game more creative which allows deeper experimentation (yes i main engi) 

its super fun tho and feels good to run it  the game is good at being a fun roguelike for maybe 2 runs now and then one of them on dlc (play monsoon only)  bc ur basically getting shi/tty head while swinging nun chucks its fu/cking bricked"
12434,it is po
12435,yeah
12436,AMAZING! GET IT!
12437,wungus
12438,"One of the best roguelike out there, expecially played with friends!"
12439,"A must play for people who love rogue likes.

All the story is in the environment and the logs gained from obtaining the items or monster logs.

DLC is fun and fresh way to play the game."
12440,It's nice
12441,It's okay.
12442,"My review of game after playing a few rounds modded.

If you play this game with friends they have to be very, very nice or you will get owned. You can get trapped in a poor get poorer situation as they suck up all the items. Second worst part of the game if you have friend skill issues.
Visuals are a bit of a mess but nice
My eyes cannot see chests well, color blindness issues
Modding easy now that the new mod thing exists
Characters are interesting, robot cool
Feed back on what I am doing wrong is non-existent, I have no idea where I am taking damage from, what killed me, or why I am dying at any point. Once in awhile I catch something shooting me with a laser.
Items are confusing and worse to read and deal with than league of legends, quite possibly the worst part of the game. Fighting game levels of learn this or die unless you full monke mode and just pick ""THE CRIT ITEM"". I can tell later on this will actually be pretty great, once you learn the items you could make some neat builds but in the beginning it makes me wanna vomit.
Music is fine but boring.
There is a lot of porn of this game???"
12443,One of those games you just need to have.
12444,"i play so long my fingers hurt
"
12445,collect item fight boss die get one shot repeat go
12446,very good with friends
12447,"This game is good. Frustrating sometimes. But good.

The graphics are a bit wonky to me but everything else about this roguelite is wonderful. 
"
12448,Well worth the risk.  Assuming you like to not get hit by stuff.
12449,big fun much fun very fun super fun. must play. would pay double the asking price
12450,"Absolutely recommend! Very fun to hop in and play when you've only got a few minutes to blow stuff up or if you want go at it and see how far you can get. Every run feels slightly different via raw game mechanics and acquiring just the right build to become god-like is addicting. I also feel like this is a game from a past era when you simply bought it and you instantly own every asset in game, You need only to unlock more goodies by... Playing!  ZERO microtransactions!* 

*(as-of 14 Apr 22 because, who am I kidding, no company is immune. It has been out for ~3yrs at this point but some don't go down that hole till the end.)"
12451,Simple concept with endless hours of potential game time. One of my favorite games.

12521,"Step 1) launch the game

12522,"I've never really been into rogue-likes; I've tried several and they never really meshed with me until I tried this one. I truly think the multiplayer aspect is underrated, being able to do runs with your friends makes for a crazy and chaotic time that can't really be matched playing single-player. Like any rogue-like, stacking whatever items can get things out of control in short order, but the different survivors make it so that you and your buddy can play totally different builds and don't need to BOGART each other's items. (fuck you though Jake, I called the first backup mag, idgaf if you paid for it)

I also really love the progression system. There are plenty of survivors, but you only start with a couple, and need to complete certain in-game milestones to unlock the others, which is cool because you start with more basic characters and abilities to learn the game, and then as you unlock more, their abilities and synergies are pretty whack compared to what you've had before, so it makes for totally new experiences. The last dude I unlocked had this thing where you paid life for your abilities; that was pretty nuts to me.

I feel like the music in this game is pretty trippy, like I think you could just vibe to it, and it doesn't necessarily line up with the tone of the game, but in a sense that almost makes it work better for me. Every run isn't this huge, intense battle for my life where I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to see if I live or die, it's just another run, and if I die, then I can just boot back up and start another. I don't know, I think there's a certain beauty to the contrast of what you're doing and what you're hearing, and it really just hits for me and makes it much more bearable to keep doing runs after a big loss.

I see this as one of those games where I'll pick it up and play it pretty extensively for a weekend or so, then drop it and forget about it until I get another urge or I see a friend on. Then just repeat that cycle until I've actually exhausted what it has to offer, but in this case, I don't think that cycle ends until a potential RIsk of Rain 3 comes out."

Remember, that as long as someone has unlocked an item, downloaded a DLC, you can all play that content (minus the new DLC characters)."
12539,fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
12540,"I don't play a lot of video games, but I've logged over 110 hrs of active play of risk of rain 2. Its a five star game and everyone should have the opportunity to play it."
12541,"It's fun for what it is. It has a scalable difficulty, you could choose from three separate difficulties so almost everybody could get into the game even if you're not too skilled at these types of games. Story is very basic which is fine. I'm sure there's a deeper lore to be found if you investigate the areas thoroughly but hey, I haven't met anybody buying this game for it's story, people buy this because the gameplay is fun.

Levels are cool and unique, enemies are challenging enough and you could get pretty OP if you find a really good build for your character. The replayability is decent, people that are fond of the rougelike games have to spend more than dozens of hours before they get sick of this. Items are distributed properly in levels so you'll want to explore a bit more if you want to find them all. Characters feels great to use, some are a bit hard to master but you'll get used to it in time.

And of course there's a few downsides here and there, the main two for me being:
1) That sometimes, the teleporter is hidden in very obscure places that if you're a new player, it could get so frustrating just trying to find it if you don't have a scanner. It helps that  they've added fireflies around to indicate that a teleporter is in the vicinity but sometimes, it blends too well with the surroundings that it makes it difficult, especially for the colorblind, to see them.
2) Unlocking stuff is hard, I understand when it's the costumes since it's a type of flex to have the alternative costume for your character proving that you've beaten the game with that character in its hardest difficulty. But for the skills/items to be so frickin' hard to get? It could get overwhelming for new players, heck, I personally haven't unlocked everything since some of them are so frickin' hard to do. For someone just casually playing the game, it's a bit sad not being able to use the alt-skills or the locked items just because some of the requirements for unlocking them are a bit too challenging for an average player. Though, I'd say that you're going to be fine even with just unlocking and using the easy ones to unlock but it's just a shame that you couldn't use the item/skill you wanted just because of some bullsh*t requirement.

Asides from those two gripes that I have with this game, all I've got are praises for how fun it is to play. 

Final Rating: a solid 8/10 game
Good purchase (+ DLC) even when not on sale."

12549,"I die a lot, but I still play again and again. Worth the buy, especially with the new content out. Lots to unlock, to explore, and watching your damage go up progressively is always a nice dose of dopamine to the brain."

12571,"Red beams of light shoot down from the starry sky above, there is gunfire ablaze, the sound of creatures roaring and approaching from the horizon. It seems like all hope is lost as we are doomed to fall to these foes, but I have faith.

I believe this battle can be overcome. I had put my heart and soul making it this far with the items I have collected and the experience I have achieved. I had my friend by my side and with his trusty sentries I knew we would make it through. 

The air smelled of blood and gunpowder. We had won the battle but not the war. We knew they would come back, they always do. The next wave is upon us and they would come harder. It was at this moment that time seemed to stop for me and my friend. We both had our focus on the same thing but very different thoughts, because it was at that exact moment, the red beams of light, came fully together.

With a loud CRASH the giant hunk of metal falls from the sky and utterly obliterates my engineer's turrets. He is heart broken and my astonishment is blinding. I was dumbfounded, what could have caused this terrible event to occur? The wave came and with it he died due to him not having defenses. As I slowly fall to the same fate, I came to realize something, something terrible.

I dropped a diablo strike on his turrets fuck.

12599,it is a good 3d roglike

12607,"showed up to some planet, killed some lizard dudes, fought god. was a pretty good time!"
12608,"Straight up one of the best most enjoyable games i have played in a long time. Endless fun with friends, and near infinite replayability."
12609,Why don't you have this game yet?
12610,Pure addictive adrenaline....bring it on!!!
12611,Is good.
12612,"I'm a sucker for third-person shooters so this grabbed my attention fairly quickly. I played the first Risk of Rain and pleasantly enjoyed that and found the timer concept a challenging but fun feature to learn to juggle effectively. This timer has made a return in this game and I'm finding a similar enjoyment of learning to balance it effectively once again, however this time it's bigger and more intense than its predecessor. From the beautifully-varied environments to the wonderful selection of characters each with their own distinct abilities this lives up to being a worthy sequel to the original. I find myself booting up the game to play a single run of it but end up doing many more in one session, it's an addictive loop of wanting to do better each time and with all the characters to choose from you can mix it up and keep it entertaining for many hours. However what makes this game truly shine is when you can spend time on it with friends, and this co-op gives it some serious replayability. Get some friends together and go have a blast with it, laugh about how nuts it gets because it WILL get nuts."
12613,Titanic Plains is the only good 1st stage.
12614,where the fuck is the teleporter
12615,best game ive ever played.
12616,"Very addictive. Very fun playing solo and with friends, would recommend."
12617,An amazing 3d rougelike with so much potential for messing around or serious play. Amazing for casuals and speedrunners alike.
12618,If you're ever looking for a game that will give you countless hours of fun this is a great investment. I had a silly time when I was like overthinking a lot and just starting a run on Risk of Rain 2 and some music helped me a lot. It's great with friends but even better alone. I like it a lot because I can start a run and not need to worry about backing out if I need too do something. I will forever be greatful for this game it got me through bad time fr fr.
12619,Engineer = Bustling Fungus = win
12620,"It's like... literally my favourite game on pc. Well I say that about like 3 games, but THIS IS ONE OF EM"
12621,omg this game is so good
12622,"beautiful chaos, that i can break"
12623,"Risk of Rain 2 is one of the best roguelikes out there.

The gameplay is challenging, demanding you to learn the mechanics.
The story leaves you thinking, and wanting more the longer you play.
The music is beautifully written.
The art design and originality truly speaks the genius of Hopoo Games.
Everything ties so perfectly together, this game is a work of art.

Looking forwards to where Hopoo Games will take the future DLC packs."
12624,
12625,"This game has infinite different ways to play. There are so many different items that are all unique and compliment each character in different ways. The enemies are memorable and have unique traits and flaws like i have never seen before. I highly recommend you buy this game and get your friends to buy it too. It is a great co-op game and brings out creativity in teamwork. The Survivors of the Void DLC also is great and brought new enemies, bosses, endings, items, and more. I highly recommend buying any and all DLC available."
12626,shoot loot and sluut.

12629,The key to beating the game is buying ALL of the things.
12630,"Great gameplay, very replayable, amazing music 10/10 game"
12631,"Pixel style looter shooter romp a dooder that was a blast to play even if I had no real idea what I was doing or what was going on. Waves of baddies and me with weird gadgets, abilities, and guns a plenty just blowin em all up. Yay, really tho, it was a lot of fun and I found some actual progression and unlocks/hidden stuff that made my efforts feel actually worthwhile. with a good enough variety of areas and opponents, combined with well balanced and tight game play I thought it was a well crafted game. That was all before I even got into it with friends, on comms, which made it even better. Its great reviews are well earned, and I think it would still hold up rather well if I picked it up again today."
12632,"its freaking amazing
"
12633,"Over the last month I've played about as much of this game as I played Risk of Rain 1 over the last 8 years or so. I love the first game, but this one is so fucking good."
12634,good game if you like good games
12635,Good Game
12636,the best
12637,good game
12638,"Great rogue-like game with nearly limitless options for play-throughs. Every run will be different. You spawn in, run around and hunt for loot while killing mobs, teleport and repeat. 

This game is easy to play, difficult to master. The gameplay loop is very simple but there is a unique difficulty scale where the difficulty increases the longer your run lasts by time. Early on you have to juggle looting with moving on so that you don't get overwhelmed. 

I've had this game for years and still come back to it constantly. I can't recommend this game enough, I love it."
12639,good
12640,"If I could only play one game for the rest of my life, it very well may be this one. Unbelievable depth, replayability, variety, and most importantly, FUN. Grow into a god, die in one hit, and then do it again, and again, and again, and..."

12694,"this game is amazing, hard, rewarding, and you feel like a unstoppable force on a god run, but can still get smoked in under 5 seconds if your cocky.the artifacts add a fun new layer onto the game, and I strongly recommend getting artifact of command first, then sacrifice, then swarms, and after that do whatever.almost all items show on your character, so its great seeing your character go from a normal guy with a gun into a 6 armed, multi headed behemoth covered in all sorts of random things from a rocket launcher to a chunky arse hammer to a pair of glasses.

10/10 would die again."

12705,"This game is very fun to play with friends, I personally would not play it alone, but everyone is different regarding this thing, I guess. VR Mod works excellent as well, really nice to play it in VR. Sometimes gets too hard for my liking tho, you can literally die from one shot from an enemy, kinda frustrating, not in a good way. But overall I would recommend it."
12706,"buy, play, instant ear orgasm"
12707,I had absolutely no interest in this game until a friend coaxed me into trying it out and it became one of my top 5 favorite games of all time.

cons: major headaches 


should you play? yes just make sure to have pain killers before hand"
12709,"Very good game, even better with friends. It can be hard; but the words get good do somewhat apply here for it isn't supposed to be easy.
Replayability: Yes.

However, where is my Hyper Threader and Turbine Laser from the first game??
Why are they not in the sequel; this is my only real complaint."
12710,"Fawwwwwwk it duuuude
"
12711,Damn it feels good escaping this planet again and again and again.

1. Collecting the items are more addicting than drugs.
2. The final difficulty is called: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
3. You can be a lightsaber wielding mercenary that slices bosses to death"

Highly recommend."
12726,goog
12727,"If you like rogue type games, this is perfect. 

Summary
Basically you play as a character. And that character has a special ability within them. Then you go on an adventure and try to go the highest you can. And during that you can get upgrades. And that's really it, from my experience. 

What I thought was fun
It was really enjoyable to get upgrades and trying to proceed further. But what I have been enjoying is the achievement hunts. There are so much achievement that if you complete them you get an item that can be in your game. And achievements for characters, and just regular achievements. That is why I've been having a blast. 

Should you get it
Like I said if you like rogue likes then this game is pretty good. Read other people summary if you want more depth but I'm trying to make my review simple. I bought it 8 dollar on G2A but it is worth it for 25 dollars. But that's really it. Already 47 hours and there are more things I need to do on that game."
12728,"Get busy living or get busy dying.

12729,"An amazing Roguelike, each character feels different from the last. The Items and Artifacts you collect allow you to play differently every time. all around an amazing game, one of few games I actually felt like 100%"

12737,yes
12738,this game is very fun. a little hard alone but with friends its always fun!! a great game to play with a group or just you and one other person!!
12739,"Risk Of Rain comes with a Risk Of Pain, However unlike Max Payne, there is more than one character to main, crash in the land of sugarcane, become one with the cocaine, fueled by propane, jump into endless disdain, for there is a risk of rain, and with that rain, will surely come pain, more than that of maximus payne, from maximum pain the hit game, about max payne who both simultaneously is in pain and causes others to be in pain because he shoots them multiple times before they finally die. 

Good stuff."

The more time passes, the harder it gets.
Fight enemies, collect items, activate the teleporter an attempt to get off this hell of a planet.

And even if you are doing well, your run can end in seconds if you mess up once.
Good luck.

12761,what is fucking happening
12762,"only bad thing id say about the game is there is only two endings but its still fun regardless.
"
12763,"Cool game, good items, amazing customizability, and insane replayability."
12764,"I have many hours into this game and the possibilities are endless, However the downside comes from multiplayer aspect which I sometimes assume the devs never really sometimes test this. The game allows you to stack items in which gives you a effect and the effects stack depending on the number of stacks. Theres Artifacts in which it allows you to modify your game to a different complete experience. The game is meant to give a rogue-like feel your not attended to win every run your meant to learn the mechanics as you progressively unlock stuff. The things I may say the game is lacking is bug tests and multiplayer stability.

Bugs such as (Crossplay doesn't work perfectly yet...).

Now lets issue all the problems in multiplayer (The multiplayer community is sometimes toxic from cheat, hacking, modding, and even just starting tp from the gekko and stealing all the boss items in a multiplayer game, in some cases the 4th player never spawns when its a 4 player lobby (this occurs sometimes, or when connecting to a certain windows 10 device for some reason), the game is sometimes facing a underlying issue of once a single person dies in a multiplayer game their just out of the game cause their too weak to progress from the next stage of the run (however some mods actually fixed this issue but doesn't mean the vanilla game fixed it thats why I'm issuing it),

Many players complain about lag even tho guys the internet isn't meant to connect half way from the earth plz learn to read tags or ping before joining instead sending hate messages after joining plz aka. learn common sense!)(I have read some of the discussion page and people are begging for ""easy mode"" when its like rainstorm is normal and monsoon is hard, it is meant to be difficult drizzle is meant to be easy again... LEARN COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!).

This has been my review of the game and it is a excellent game I do recommend playing it! (The Review will be update if I find issues or bugs or just updates in general!) Milestone : I did it i played 1000 hours of your game!"

12803,"Yeah, it's pretty fun I suppose.
I put a little bit of time into it every now and again."
12804,"Risk of Rain 2 is simply the best rogue-like game ever made, even beating the holy light of Binding of Isaac. You have a wide range of characters to play with, each with different abilities, that have different playstyles yet all still rely on picking up the best items. RoR2 is simply a masterpiece and its soundtrack says so too.

Now with a DLC adding two new characters, new stages, new enemies, and new items, RoR2 is sure to bring you entertainment for as long as you live.

I HIGHLY recommend RoR2."
12805,my pc burn to crisp
12806,gud game tbh
12807,"I thought I didn't like roguelikes, well, this game proved me wrong. Despite some weird happenings caused by the random spawns, like when items fall off the map making it impossible to get them, this game is definitely one of my favourites both as a multiplayer and also solo game. Every game is different and the overall atmosphere is somewhat eerie making it feel like you're part of... something really cool. Fun game, also the most satisfying combat I've probably ever experienced. Thought I should review this with this many hours."
12808,An absolute wonder of a game that only gets better the more you play. Hopoo are one of the best game devs out there!
12809,pretty good
12810,"Playing again after 2 years; I accidentally sequenced myself and got 40 juice as Acrid and went to see god every time I sprinted as my friend chanted 'kill john lennon' in the background

12822,i like the easy to pick up game play and the look of all the mobs and people you can play
12823,this game helped me when i was sad
12824,"A game that can go from ""just 20 minutes"" to ""I cant believe that was an hour and half"" I really enjoy stacking item effects on top of each other, the music is a 10/10, its simple and never truly easy."
12825,Not full controller support in starting menus. If you run the game in a living room setting be prepared to use a mouse and keyboard.
12826,"There has not been a single moment that I regretted playing Risk of Rain 2. Every time I play it, I can't stop. The art style, Sublime. The gameplay, gratifying. The music, divine. Every single song in this game is a certified banger and elevates the gameplay. I cannot praise this game enough, easily one of the best games I've ever played."
12827,i can punch the stupid floating masks and 800 year old sand pots and the dum rocks
12828,cool and fun game
12829,Pew Pew haha... EXPLODES.
12830,Helps to work out the mouse finger muscles
12831,This game is my #1 game and has been since I got it before the full launch. While i think watching the game evolve and playing through all the patches influenced my love for this game. I still could not recommend it enough. The only regrets I have about this game is that I didn't buy it sooner and that i waited this long to review a game that has been so good to me. It has insane replayability and getting good at this game is one of the most satisfying experiences.
12832,"pew

12833,fun game easy to put a lot of hours into
12834,While repetitive it has enough content to unlock and play through to casually play for a hundred hours and still have a bit left to unlock. Or you can just look at the achievements and make a rush to unlock everything. Either way the game has plenty to do and is worth the price.
12835,mmm bungus
12836,"Really fun game that I have been playing alot with a friend of mine, but I do have some issues with it, somtimes I just can't find the portal witch sucks because I feel when I lose a run cus I spent 20 mins looking for it and can't find it it doesn't feel like my fault and that's no fun, I wish there was a timer that when it would run out would give u a compas to the portal just to prevent u from not being able to find it, I tend to not play alone because of this as I just don't have the eyes for this game, there is also one mechanic that makes this game so hard to play for me. Sprinting, I always feel like I'm walking and fighting with the ctrl key to fix it, I wish sprinting was just standard like an auto sprint and u only walked to attack because I have done entire runs walking because I forget to spam the sprint key to stay running, all this game needs is a single setting to enable auto sprint and this is a 10/10 for me but even then this game is awsome and an amazing party squad game for your frens"
12837,Great gameplay loop that builds on top of itself really well. Unlocking chests and getting crazy out of this world items will never gets old. (Get the dlc it is so worth it!)

12844,"I absolutely love this game, it is just endless heaps of fun, I'd usually write a funny review but this game genuinely deserves to be praised to the highest degree. Concrete 10/10, I like the developers, and the community is extremely friendly, you genuinely can't go wrong! :)"
12845,"Good game, RNG is bs sometimes not as fun solo"
12846,"This game is so solid in all its aspects: It is artistically astounding, the combat feels very good and they nailed the level of complexity, not too high, not too low. On top of that, it offers cooperative multiplayer, a rare commodity in these trying times."
12847,Great Game with friends tbh
12848,game dead and broken
12849,"Risk of Rain 1 is one of my favorite games of all time, and this game is about as perfect of a sequel as you could ask for. So much fun with near endless replay-ability, I've sunk a decent amount of time into the game and don't feel bored yet.

The new DLC that just came out is really really good as well, plenty more hours of fun"

[Verse 1]
Every time I'm left alone
My misery begins to drown me
Tied by a rope of anxiety
Thrown overboard

[Pre-Chorus]
As I'm pulled under the tides
Of this fast-paced world
(Of this fast-paced world)
I refuse to see

[Chorus]
Time will always be (be)
The thing that kills me truly (truly)
Open these eyes waking (waking)
From a dream feigning (feigning)

[Verse 2]
My lungs fill up with letdown
Disappointment in self and everyone
Expectations died in failure
Abandonment, my un-savior
[Pre-Chorus]
As I'm pulled under the tides
Of this fast-paced world
(Of this fast-paced world)
I refuse to see

[Chorus]
Time will always be (be)
The thing that kills me truly (truly)
Open these eyes waking (waking)
From a dream feigning (feigning)

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Choke
Die choking on your every word
Swallow every blasphemy

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Swallow every blasphemy
Eat out your heart and make it bleed

Tie the noose around my neck
Make this life end"

fun"
12892,big epicness
12893,"This is one of the first roguelites I played and I enjoyed my plays on it. The variety of the survivors and items makes it have high replay value. This is the game where you can really customize your runs. Multitude of difficulty modifiers and artifacts which modify the game make it so that you can change how you wish to play the game. Also, due to its item-stacking system, at a certain point, you will feel like nothing can beat you and you'll just obliterate everything in your path. 

However, it does have a bit of a grind to unlock everything (I still haven't unlocked all items!) and sometimes the game can reach a point where your system slows down due to the plethora of particles appearing on the screen. Also, even if you reach the point where you obliterate every enemy in your path, they can still kill you - quite easily, in fact! It just takes 1 small mistake and your run is over.

Regardless, it's still a joy to play. I recommend this, especially with friends."

12905,this game is incomprehensible and awful. 10/10
12906,9.5/10 - Amazing game solo or with friends. Every character is so unique that it makes the game feel entirely new. RNG can be a bit unforgiving and the learning curve is steep at the start but there is basically nothing wrong with this game. My only wish is that the game explained more in its logbooks so that it didn't rely on the online community to bridge the gap. Still a must play game on Steam.
12907,To forsake the shrine of the mountain is to forsake ones honor.

12912,fun and challenging
12913,"it gud time waster ngl 
"
12914,"+++Very flexible challenge and difficulty system that allows one to either cheese it, or experience great suffering and glory. (Easiest difficulty with OP modifiers for a relaxing run? I won't judge. Halo-style Legendary All Skulls On run for maximum pain? Good on ya.)

+++Lots of game-changing items to allow one to utilize the power of MATH and NUMBERS to create truly game-breaking builds. (One of the character's challenges is basically encouraging abusing math and stats to deal a million-damage shot.)

+++Very unique classes allow for very interesting paths for builds. (Character specializes in poisonous Damage Over Time? Why not set enemies on fire and make them bleed in addition?)

++Lots of obscure easter eggs, secrets, and other hidden goodies. (Wiki, much?)

+Optional lore tidbits for every single character, enemy, and item. (Having only played 2, I definitely feel like I'm missing out on a good chunk of background. Not enough to deter my enjoyment of the gameplay, though.)

-It is possible to get one-shot and just instantly die from an attack or combination of attacks. (Best solution for this is to play it smart and avoid jumping into high concentrations of enemies... but that's difficult for melee characters, for example.) 

--I'll admit, platforming over an abyss isn't my thing. I hated that in Destiny 2, and it still makes me shaky and sensitive in this game. (Feel free to remove this negative if platforming doesn't bother you.)

Another great roguelite/roguelike. 
When I first played, I... wasn't drawn in.
But I gave it another chance.

9.1/10"
12915,hmm today i will throw worms into the gravity well
12916,It's a game you simply don't mess with. Just got to deal with it. Play hard and fair!
12917,"Easy to learn, hard to master. No handholding tutorials, just pure, unfiltered gameplay.

This game get's straight to the point and will keep you busy forever if you are up for a rougelike that is outstanding fun to play. The multiplayer in RoR2 is so extremely fun, it has become an almost daily tradition to just jump right in with your best friends after a hard day at work and just go ham with all the crazy item-interactions this game has to offer.

Thank you Hopoo Games for an outstanding Game like this, I can hardly imagine how you will go further and beyond on your next game."

12929,"Lots of items and enemies to learn and unlock. Truly one of the most enjoyable games I have played with friends (and it is very much the most fun with friends). It can get redundant after awhile, but it is very much worth the buy. Just realize that some runs you will be absolutely busted, and others you will simply get rekt on. Just take some breaks every now and then so that you don't get bored too quick and the game doesn't get stale for you."

12951,I find enjoyment in this game. Nuff said
12952,"This game is amazing. The soundtrack, gameplay, visuals, are all so great. Either alone or co-op this game is a masterpiece! Not only that but this game is completely mod friendly so even if you get bored of the base game (which is very unlikely) you have tons of mods to choose from. The new DLC is my only slight gripe.***SPOILERS AHEAD***

 The new void zones are a pain in the ass to clear, and the even with updates, the bug that infect the normal enemies are super hard to hit. only two of the new void items are actually useful, and a couple of the red tier items they added feel a little underwhelming. Still worth buying and the price 100% though because both of the new surivors and the new final boss are cool AF!"

12973,"If you played the first game, even though 2-D, most of the fundamentals are applied here. You get a character, go through a level getting upgrades and levels, but try to keep a pace as the difficulty keeps increasing slowly. Obviously jumping to a 3D environment you don't have some of the benefits of its predecesor like a wide field of vision and easier to locate items and teleporters, but is nonetheless a enjoyable experience in every playthrough.

For anyone new to this game and doesn't know about how the first one works, I must aware that this is can become a difficult experience for a rookie. I haven't touched the first game in years and still had to relearn a few things, but is still all about how you invest your time on each level and try to not stall too much. Each character plays completely differently, so aside of achievement hunting and unlocks you'll find one to main and master a route. Combined with co-op and an quite active playerbase, you'll get a very different playthrough each time much like any other roguelike out there. Just be aware that a single run can reach more than an hour quite easily, so try to play the game when you have plenty of free time to spare. Unfortunately, the time investment is one of its few flaws. Unless you get the propersave mod, there's no way to make a checkpoint to keep playing later if you need to stop for any reason.

To be fair the negatives are very scarce besides the time investment issue. Some players might get easily lost looking for the teleporters, which while solved by just looking for red particles it also means low end PCs won't have that solution if they have to turn most settings down. This is specially the case with Sulfur Pools, which although my PC already has its years yet able to run some current games easily (For example Doom Eternal and Monster Hunter World), this map in particular seems to ask for an extra oomf even at lowest settings. Overall, some small hiccups which current PCs won't have any issue.

I enjoyed the first game and already getting more invested on the second. I recommend getting propersave just in case you need to stop due an emergency or something, and you're good to go to spend whole afternoons in just a pair of runs with this game."
12974,Really great game with a bit of a learning curve. Highly Rec. :)
12975,very goog
12976,Very fun game to play with a bunch of my friends. With mods I can have 16 players all together and it's quite hilarious.
12977,Too  much fun. Great with friends. No reason not to buy!
12978,"Satisfying shooter, all the different characters play totally different which adds a ton of replayablity. Def worth picking up if ya want something to play with friends, or a strafe and shoot kinda shooter to get bodied by alone."
12979,"Fun game where you spectate your fren doing a god run with 20 firework bundles and corrupted mushrooms on monsoon, after you died to dunno what, and can't get more items, so you'll just die faster with every stage and he'll get all your loot for an even godder run.

13030,I really like it. Every game is a new experience and you can make some really ridiculous builds. If you manage to survive at least 1 hour you can ascend to godhood. I recommend this game to anyone that likes to play long run games. But playing for long can be really exhausting. 8/10

13034,"This game is hands down one of my favourite rogue-like, and before you think ""but i don't like rogue-like games!"", this game is nothing like other rogue-likes, I've never seen a 3D rogue-like but this game did it amazingly. There's an incredible amount of content in this game and it's a fair, if not low, price for the amount that it has to offer.
The game has one of my favourite soundtracks. Every character you play is unique and looks cool. Each map has little secrets.
 The game has great replay-ability, and you can either make the game really easy if you want or you can make it very, very, very difficult on one game-mode.
The game also has a lot of unique mods and a very large community for it, making it possible to pour over 200 hrs.
I'd say this game is pretty easily a 9.5/10 only because i want some more characters in the game, but the 13 right now is probably enough."

13048,"It's a fun game but there are a couple of issues that make it not as replayable as it seems. 
The bottom line is the skill expression is lacking. It's not completely absent, but the game doesn't reward you for playing it a lot. 

1. The power creep

I understand that the game is PvE but that doesn't excuse at least trying to balance the survivors.
More recent survivors like Railgunner can achieve consistent runs every single time yet characters like Artificer and Commando are more reliant on item RNG. 

RNG should make the game more replayable, not make you feel like you were put in a scenario where there is nothing you could have done. At some point you will realize when the run is dead no matter how well you manage your time. Sometimes you don't get a single damage item as Commando or a single utility item as Artificer and your 15 minutes of that run is wasted. 

If all the survivors from the beginning were designed have the same consistency as Loader, Railgunner, Acrid, Bandit etc. then it would be fine. However, Hopoo seems to randomly decide when to balance survivors instead of it being the core focus. 

A good example is Mercenary gaining the expose mechanic. A bad example of this is with the new burn changes added in the latest DLC, Artificer's flamethrower now does less damage. 

I understand some survivors should be more difficult to play but that comes to my next point.

2. The difficulty is mostly fake.

There are some things you can react to as a player but a lot of times your death is going to be from a random stack of collapse or overloading orb or a blazing stone titan. Mechanics that either have very little counterplay or no counterplay at all depending on the survivor you play as. One shot protection is designed to protect players against these kinds of interactions, but more and more effects are added to bypass one shot protection. Yes, you could just get a raincoat every run or a blast shower, but itemization isn't something to rely on in risk of rain. 

Dodging in the game isn't difficult, you can circle strafe the majority of the enemies in the game and the rest are hitscan with no way to reliably dodge their attacks. 

This is also probably why there isn't a true melee survivor in the game. The attack that ultimately ends your run is something that isn't under your control most of the time. Mercenary is the only melee survivor in the game, yet the only solution was to add i-frames on a 5 second cooldown or don't even play him as a melee survivor. 

The first 5 minutes of every character all have a fun gameplay loop, but as soon as you enter mid-late game things start getting stale. Eventually every character plays the same as soon as the run gets good. You're only going to be pressing 1 button (usually your safest yet still most damaging ability) while running around in a circle. The uniqueness of each character is lost the further the run goes. 


Which comes to my final point - There really isn't an incentive to master a character when item RNG is so important.
 
Mercenary is probably the most complex character yet this is probably all by accident. Cancelling skills probably wasn't even an intended feature. Even if you are very good at playing Mercenary or any other character, there aren't really many ways to express your skill. The difference between a Mercenary that is mechanically skilled at cancelling vs a Mercenary that simply understands when to play safely is marginal. The difference between a Loader that has mastered movement vs someone just picking Loader up for the first time is negligible. 

In the end, optimizing your play doesn't increase your chance of success in a run by much. 

Not every PvE game needs to provide dedicated players with the ability to show off their skill, but the best PvE games reward you for the time you spend in them. 

It's games that properly reward you for mastery that keep you coming back for more."

13090,"This game is just terrible. Get this: In multiplayer there are limited items and if you get only 1 or 2 and everyone else gets 10+ it's snowballing from there so you will be useless the entire game. Ofc the community in this is complete trash as a result. They will rush movement speed bonuses to pick everything clean and even steal your boss relics. 

Unlike in Deep Rock Galactic for example teamwork is absolutely discouraged in this game. The only moment you play as team is to fight the boss because there is some more to pick up and nobody cares if people are elft behind.

13130,"Despite being riddled with a lot of questionable, if not bad design choices, this game is incredibly fun and will make your brain rot.

 (DLC is not necessary for the best experience, btw. I would instead say that in its current state, its clearly too buggy and rushed. Maybe pick it up while its on sale.)

The music is as usual great, the characters all feel pretty diverse and have their quirks, the gameplay is overall very enjoyable although i think that hopoo should really try to add features that the players have been asking for YEARS- a restart button, ways for dead players to keep up with the others, the ability to drop items in multiplayer, as well as small reworks of older survivors like commando and huntress, that really need some sort of buff. They are both fun in their own way but are completely outclassed by every other survivor in the game.
Changing the final bossfight a little would also be welcome as it can be cheesed with enough mobility and i guess a bit of experience. Funny moon man literally cannot touch you if you are in the air, and i believe that he should have a (reasonable) attack that can inflict pressure on high mobility players as well.
Maybe remove the final countdown before leaving the moon and make the ending cutscene trigger once you have reached the spaceship? Having to run from void reavers and moon explosions(?) is already pretty exciting by itself, i dont think that having to do ANOTHER useless ""teleporter event"" is very fitting, besides, the reavers cannot get within spaceship range, and if you dont attack them, you have no way to die. So, what is the point of the timer? Maybe make it shorter or make the players do something else instead of just waiting.
Some lunar items would also definitely benefit from a rework, for example gesture and brittle crown have NO drawbacks and can be picked up whenever, it really doesnt matter. 
I would mention the autoplay issue, which is a big one, but honestly as this point its useless because the devs would have to spend ages to completely rebalance the game from the start in order for its gameplay to feel more skill based than rng based. And i dont think they have the time, or the motivation for that. I just wish lategame was fun and didnt break completely with you killing all enemies on the screen just by looking at them.
Aaaaand many more problems.

I have to mention a last thing; one of the main selling points of this game is its multiplayer element. Yeah, a multiplayer that is only enjoyable with friends, because random lobbies are not fun. Please do consider adding the changes i mentioned at the start of the review, as the multiplayer experience really needs some extra polish.

Though, to be fair, you will only start to notice the games design issues once you have several hours into it, and at that point you will most likely be too addicted to care. Its still a fun game that i enjoy very much, so i still recommend it, despite probably sounding very judgemental in the above paragraph."

There's a lot of items to find, a lot of secrets to 'uncover', things to collect and unlock. Which is nice, even if I don't agree with the method of which some of these are gained.

I've gone through this game on multiple characters and to some degree I do enjoy the game, but it is one of those games where, there's a lot of good but also a lot of flaws.
Many times, some characters feel like they weren't finished or perhaps not even properly tested and another problem is that you can play for about an hour or so, eventually get fairly comfortable and then die to a single hit. 
Such, gathering health items or some of the defence items to try and negate damage is only going to matter early on.

There's been updates to try and fix some of the problems, though I still feel the game could be better. A few tweaks on some of the available character choices, some item changes and a change to the method of which difficulty increases and, I think it'd be a perfect game for its genre.

Give it a try~ Don't let the thumbs down I gave the game scare you away, that's my opinion and I'm extremely picky."

13205,"TLDR: most important part is below... 
I've been playing a lot of this one since I got it. It doesn't concern itself with too much other than enjoyable gameplay- a feature that is ******* rare these days. I like the music, I like the different characters (and subsequent different playstyles) and every character is a viable character to play if you're willing to practice. Or, like me, you might find a character the seems to just suit you. You can play this game over and over again and beat it over and over again with your own goals in mind. That might sound kinda odd, but you'll see what I mean. For instance, there are quite a few achievements to complete so I'll start a game up with that achievement in mind. The whole game could theoretically be beat in minutes if you're really good. Or, you can drag the game on for hours at a time (like I do) and see just how rediculous your character can get before you either decide to win on your terms, or, possibly die instantly because you're 3 hours in and you stood still for a single blink of the eye. Either way, it's fun. 

MOST IMPORTANT PART and I gotta put my Karen hat on for this one- this is a HUGE mention for any game nowadays. I have only encountered 1 bug and, honestly, I'm relatively certain it's because I'm using hardware from like 2014. And it occurred because of the shear amount of chaos that was occurring on screen after a run that I had dragged out for hours. And it wasn't even game breaking at that, I just got a kind of black box for a few seconds on screen that corrected as soon as things calmed down a little. Almost like the carnage was ""too much so we had to censor it"" in a way...Other than that, this game runs clean. I've never once crashed. Not once. I can't remember being able to say that about a game since way back in the day when I was on original Xbox. Honestly, It's like these devs don't even care about haphazardly piecing code together. And I never even remotely got that feeling like they rushed it. Where's all the bugs? How am I supposed to play or even enjoy a game that functions correctly? It's like these devs understand how systems and code work AND they're creative and quite frankly I'm offended and they should be ashamed. Where's the obvious signs of ""rushed-developer"" suffering? Did they even try to have someone breathe down their necks from the top? I bet these monsters even write thorough/understandable/helpful notation for their back-end coding. Disgraceful. Who actually understands how to use a graphics/physics engine suite these days? OH, btw, these blinkered philistines didn't bother to lock a single element of the game behind an additional pay wall. Seriously? No micro-transactions at all? What... do they expect me to simply have and enjoy the game that I already paid money up-front for? The ****? They'll never be AAA. No sir, not this way.  I just don't understand how a development studio can expect to release a fully functional/stable title, reasonably priced, that's also enjoyable and expect to make it in this market. 

Oh wait...."

13213,"Have you ever wanted to become powerful enough to fight god? Then this game is for you. It's one of the best roguelites of all time, and is every bit of addicting as you've ever heard it to be. It's an incredible feat of a game that I recommend to everyone.

It is one of the most mechanically satisfying roguelites in existence. They trim the fat to make it extremely streamlined so that you can focus on exponentially growing the amount of dopamine in your brain. Touch down on the planet, kill stuff, collect items, kill the boss, and don't linger for one more second. The gameplay loop is immensely satisfying. It's so easy to sit down and play this game for 10 minutes, but then you realize your entire life has gone by and you've spent 40 minutes playing, and now you're an unkillable god being. It's insane.

You don't get the same amount of power from other roguelite/roguelike games. Here, your power is exponential (and occasionally linear). Items stack to continue to raise the stakes of what you can do and how much you can resist. You're constantly hoping for and looking for items that are complementary to your characters kit. And when you do, it's just the right rush.

The characters are excellent, with their abilities being unique enough to make you re-think your favorite strategies every time you switch off of your main. The art direction is superb, the soundtrack is sublime, and the enemy variety is top notch. I've played the game for over 100 hours at this point and nothing has started to wear on me.

The more time you put into Risk of Rain 2, the more you get out of it. At first, everything is new and mysterious, the enemies are difficult, the items quirky, and the bosses are majestically powerful. But the longer you play the more you put the pieces together. Soon you'll know what the items do just by looking at their icons. Soon you'll start to understand the deeply rooted lore, hidden in logs and item descriptions. It's a vastly beautiful painting that slowly comes to form with the more time you invest. It's a really incredible experience. Not to mention, you can do all of it in a really top notch multiplayer experience.

The achievements are what got me hooked again lately. They're quite attainable, and for the first time in a long time, I've 100% a video game. One of two in my Steam library. The itch to complete them to get the additional character skills or skins was mind bogglingly addictive.

Beyond all of this, the DLC has been top notch. There's been a few updates that have had major inclusions to content that have been free, and the first paid DLC came out and it was worth every penny. I can't wait to see what else Hopoo has in store for us.

My only complaint:
I would have loved it if there was a ""training room"" of sorts, that you could go into to test damage values and stacks of items, and learn if items stack linearly or exponentially. There is the artifact of command, but that's just not the same, and still takes time to get the resources together to test things. Beyond that, if you play with the artifact of command, there's no item tool tips to help you remember what the items are, which is difficult if you don't see a lot of an item (especially red items). So even with my 100+ hours of experience, I've got the wiki open for reference. It would be nice to be able to just see all that in game.

All in all, it's difficult, it's fun, and it's infinitely replayable. NameBrand."

13235,"play for 75 hrs without vanilla, get used to the game, install mods, profit."
13236,"Gameplay loop; But fun. The eternal rogue-lite dilemma of game design. However, I still think it's a great pick up to play alone, or with friends. Has multiple modes of play, optional collectathons, and a difficult yet rewarding system of fundamentals and mechanics (and easy mode, if that's your cup of tea). All the characters have their own niches and all feel unique to themselves, as well as maintaining an ubiqutiously intricate balance centered around immediate versus long-term power. All of the survivors kits are fun to use depending on your play style and help you learn how to become better at the game through trial and error. The item system, while relatively less balanced, is also well designed in it's own right. The process of learning which items are better than others allows complex decision making while looting to evaulate the risk vs reward of your choices, while not outright demanding it if you only want to W+M1 slam some bosses and elites. No item is useless, and everything can work if you try hard enough, which I believe is a huge strength of the game.

Tl;Dr- Can be monotonous, but also fun in it's simplicity. Enjoyable as a tryhard or casual with lots of content to explore. Still updated and patched as of posting.

13241,"whats the difference between doors and risk of rain 2 you ask? well doors opens which would leave openings for you to go in. On the other hand; at some point, enemies would not even leave a fucking window for you to take a break."
13242,"(Minor spoilers ahead)

I both love and hate this game. It has produced some of my absolute best moments in gaming period. The reason I'm not recommending it because it's also produced some of my worst, and those are getting more numerous by the day.

Risk of rain 2 hooks you in by how amazing it is in a lot of aspects. The ease of introduction to new players, the gradual progression of beating stages and unlocking new items, the differences in character playstyles being some of them. There's a whole load of stuff for you to do and explore early on. The problem arises when you unlock everything you need to unlock and explore everything the game has to offer. Once the novelty wears off, all you're left with is the run themselves and when a run goes bad you're left with absolutely nothing but pain and misery. When it's my fault I accept it, but the game has it's fair share of bugs and bad design choices that can end your run through no fault of your own.

The timer is by far the worst offender in run killers. In my many many years of gaming, I HAVE NEVER had to manually leave the game because it outscaled me. Here I have. In fact, it has happened many times. No, I'm not spending huge amounts of time on a stage and picking up every chest, I know how to play. This happens even if you stick to the ""under 5 min per planet"" rule, particularly when playing low base damage characters. The enemies after a certain point just turn into bullet sponges. When this happens, it's beyond frustrating, as you have to manually exit out of the run as you can't progress. One time when I knew the run was already over because of this, I decided to kill the secret boss on Siren's call just to see how long it would take. I was playing commando and it took 20 whole minutes of holding left click for him to actually die. I guess if this game lets you achieve the highest of highs, you have to be ready for the lowest of lows. 

Mithrix fight is not fair. Not fair towards Mithrix I mean, as long as you're playing certain characters. When you're playing no mobility ones, it's not fair towards the player. His moveset is great on paper, but terrible in practice. One time I was playing captain and had a few wax quails and other small mobility items. I was dodging his attacks perfectly until he decided to charge and swing 2 times in a row for some reason. This obviously ended my run as it was undodgeable. So since I have to deal with this huge problem as captain, do I get high damage? Nope, the fight lasted like 15 mintues and then I died to an undodgeable attack. Captain sucks. He's fun though. Let me contrast this by an engineer run I've had. For some godforsaken reason, the devs decided it would be a good idea to make mithrix focus drones and HE CAN'T EVEN HIT THEM. With engineer, the Mithrix fight looked like, no joke, place two turrets down -> stand on top of a pillar -> watch. Even though I won, I felt so empty and disappointed that I might as well have lost the run. Feels like this shit hasn't been playtested even once. I want to add that in both of these examples, I had average builds, not some lucky god run. So is there any reason for me to ever pick captain again if I want to win? That's obviously a rhetorical question. One more thing about Mithrix... there's a reason other games make bosses immune to CC. When I played Rex, all I had to do to beat Mithrix is root and shoot him and he was dead in three rotations. Horrible fight, wasted potential.

Dying to bugs isn't fun. Especially when you're over an hour into the run and got a fairy decent build after many failed attempts. I've had ""death by planet"", a possible bug where even the game doesn't know what killed you (as I've read on the internet) happen to me multiple times. It isn't possible that I'm just imagining this, as I've cleared every enemy on the stage and just died randomly to nothing. The other time, I was on stage 15 I think, had many stacks of topaz brooch + the red barrier item and I've been noticing that my barrier seems to turn off and on randomly, even when I'm not in combat. Of course, a bit later I died because my barrier was in ""off"" mode while there are 200 enemies on screen. My guess is that in late game many calculations need to happens so sometimes it just bugs out.

I've already mentioned the bullet sponge problem, but my god it doesn't get worse than the moon area before the Mithrix fight. What a slog to get through, the fast pacing the game had before this area comes to a complete halt. Even if you were oneshotting enemies before this area, here you'll have trouble with lunar enemies and for all the wrong reasons. Instead of these enemy types being a challenge where you have to strategically outsmart them, they're just another huge bag of health with moderate damage. Not to mention that in this stage mobility characters have a HUGE advantage. if you're a low mobility character with not enough damage to consistently kill lunar enemies, good luck. Not only will you have to spend 10-15 minutes running from pillar to pillar and standing in place, but sometimes you'll get softlocked by two flying machine gun enemies that will not even let you get near the pillar. Worse yet is when they spawn on you while you're charging a slow pillar and you can't kill them. You'll have to spend 4 minutes running to the other side of the map to charge another pillar and then 4 minutes to return to this one, hoping they'll not be guarding it. Fun and interactive gameplay. Meanwhile you can choose a mobility character and skip this stage entirely sometimes by just flying towards Mithrix. What a joke.

If you couldn't tell already, I'm writing this review after a failed frustrating run. What pushed me towards uninstalling this game and writing this review is realizing that Risk of rain 2 does not respect your time. I was aiming to complete Acrid's alternate loadout challenge which requires you to kill scavanger. Pretty simple, right? Apparently not. I had a decent build, clearing enemies with ease as I've had 4 charges of my R skill with a few bandoliers to reset all 4 cooldown stacks. I've also had the red item that lets you jump high and slam into the ground. I've encountered a scavanger at around stage 10 and obviously went to kill him. The thing is, he was physically unkillable for me as far as I can tell. I've tried everything, from applying many many blight stacks, to slamming him with the red jumping item from 10km into the air and trying to combo it with damaging equipment, but nothing. His health acted like it was in a different game. It's not even that he was healing, he just took aoe dmg from my R and dropped to 50% health, but when I slammed him with apparently 10000% damage he didn't drop below 90%. On one slam, it appeared as if he actually gained health. I was tracking items that he was gaining via chat, but he only gained useless stuff. I found out he actually spawns with already equipped items and there's no way to tell what they are other than looking at them on his 3D model. This is way too much to expect from players, especially when there's already so many things going on on the screen because it's lategame. Yes, I know I could have skipped scavanger, however as I've mentioned previously, there's nothing left for me to unlock so I don't wanna just wander aimlessly into higher stages. Before I clicked play, I set a goal to unlock the alternate loadout and the game robbed me of that.

All in all, Risk of rain 2 is just like League. It hooks you in with awesomeness, but before you realize it you're addicted to the high it once gave you. The high rarely comes again and all you're left with is frustration, anger and disappointment. The worst of all is the feeling that you've spent time that could have been spent doing something else. If you have the strength to uninstall after unlocking everything, by all means buy this game it's worth it. However, if you have an addicting personality, STAY AWAY."

I love this game, got it about a month ago from today, and it has turned into my favorite game. This game has everything you would want in a roguelike, rng, endless stages, a butt ton of items, and a ton of replayability. If you want a game that you can buy, and play while you hang out with some friends, this is for sure one you can sink that time into."
13311,"I don't know where to begin. If the Environment, Unique enemies and variety in survivors doesn't satisfy you, the lore and the Secrets will. It takes time to find a survivor you like but once you get a hang of the enemies abilities everything becomes easier. My advice to new players: In a team, Everyone needs items if you're all going to survive and have fun, Share the Boss loot. In solo play, Mobility Is a Big help. Try not to stay in a stage past 3-4 minutes. Also BUNGUS (There's a huge bias here)"

13360,"This is by far one of, if not the, greatest rouge like games I have ever played. There are a ton of items to make every play through different. Every character is unique and extremely enjoyable to play. My favorite is Huntress, but every character is viable with the right items. I like the look and variety of the enemies and the difficulty gets harder as you play, but that is what makes it so fun. And just when the game starts to feel repetitive, artifacts and the recently added game modes can change how you play and make is much harder or just more chaotic and fun. Amazing game and would recommend to anyone looking for a great rouge like game to play solo or with friends."
13361,"this game is really good, especially when you get the goku mod"
13362,Bungus and now Wungus. Enough is said.
13363,"This game is my absolute favorite roguelite to play with friends, and by myself. It has a long, but smooth learning curve, and it is still fun to play and improve even after 400 hours. At first it feels like the game is very rng dependent, but over time you find lots of ways to influence your run and beat the rng. Even on monsoon, almost all games feel winnable to me. If you play long enough, eventually the game will give you what you need for a god run.

Depending on the survivor you play as, it has a nice mix of mechanics driven gameplay (both with aim and movement tech), or just game knowledge based characters that don't demand too much mechanical skill from the player. You can sweat it out in the extremely difficult eclipse mode, or just chill and watch the numbers go up, while the entire screen gets covered in explosions in the easier difficulties.

One piece of advice for new players, start on the ""drizzle"" difficulty. This game has a lot of mechanics, a lot of enemies, and a lot of items to learn. The higher difficulties just force you to make decisions faster (because difficulty scales with time, not just the level), and it can be frustrating to feel like you are losing to the clock while you are just learning the ropes. Once you've beat the games a few times on drizzle, then try the harder difficulties and focus on being efficient, and you'll find they aren't that bad."

Gameplay wise this game will keep you busy if you are willing to put the time into it as games can be long. There are a good amount of unlocks and artifacts open up tons of different ways to play on top of the many builds you can create. Other then gameplay the soundtrack is also phenomenal with my favorite being the theme on the moon stage.

13393,good game fun !!
13394,"Very cool, would recommend"
13395,"Addicting game with great music, visuals, and gameplay. I've put in a good 100 hours in only a month of playing, and I can only see that number getting even higher. If you enjoy rouge-likes, you will most likely enjoy this game, but this game is also very noob-friendly to those who haven't played any rogue-likes before"
13396,"If you liked RoR1 you'll like RoR2. Music, atmosphere, design, it's all back in 3D. If you didn't play RoR1 you won't miss anything by starting here. Stellar."
13397,wwwwwww
13398,Please dont buy. It is too addicting. You wont be able to stop playing. Ever. They have me. I have to keep going. Theres no other way. Please help me.
13399,"addicting, good gameplay, great artstyle, fire soundtrack, probably everything you need for a game."
13400,epic game
13401,"there is no akshan, yone, yasuo or gwen here

10/10"
13402,"Game so fast you do a run at 12 midnight and realize its 3am at the end. 
Also music bangs more than a redneck firing an assault rifle at a target range."
13403,Best game. Buy it
13404,Very Good game!!!!
13405,"Clay Dunestrider made me destroy my PC in a fit of rage, Which caused it to manifest into the real world as it then absorbed my life energy. I am dying as I write this review and I just want to say, Clay Dunestrider sucks.

13417,"Loads of fun, so addictive and i want more of this game"
13418,"Great Game, i only have a few hours into this game and already understand most of the mechanics of the game. and that's great because games like this can get so technical on how to play properly that you just kind of get lost on what you should actually do. 

my only complaint with this game is that it is how chaotic it gets at the end. and if you end up on a map with a lot of gaps in the ground you will probably die form falling eventually. its one of those game where you really should not take the epilepsy warning lightly.."

13421,Great game to waste allot of hours on and have loads of fun while doing it wont regret getting it at all
13422,amazing game to play with friends and have alot fun

13424,Bungus
13425,"I love this game so fucking much, I got it when it was still in the process of being finished and its become one of my most played games on steam. the game is fun to play with interesting lore, AMAZING soundtrack, and several 100% viable characters to play as. The devs pour their heart and soul into the game and it shows. The recent release of their first payed DLC adds some of the coolest monsters, survivors, items, and mechanics to this already amazing game. 10/10 would definitely pay full price it is so worth it. its great ot play solo or with friends hands down one of the best games you could get."
13426,idk if this is the right word but this game has great playability you could play this game for hours and still not get all of the achievements. i have played shooter games since i was 5 years old and this game is possibly one of the best i've ever played. with the game being roguelike it has a sense of worth to what you're doing because you could lose your run by just making one small mistake. the characters are amazing. no one character is bad. they all have their uses and downsides but they are all good. all in all this game is 10/10 and if you're looking for a reason to buy it let this review be the final decision.
13427,
13428,nice game

13432,if i ever see a blind vermin in real life i would gladly crush its thick skull with my bare hands
13433,Amazing game.
13434,it's fun and no round is the same
13435,Very cool game. lots of stuff to unlock. Supports challenging or more laid back difficulties of the game. many different playstyles to choose from with all the different characters. also available to mod if you can figure out how to mod it. even if you don't mod it the game is still very addictive.
13436,"Risk of Rain is action rogue-like game. Game is great and awesome, although dev team disappoints in few points. Visually, thank God it is not another pixel indie game. No hate, but indies can do better. Each map has different color pallet and looks unique and beautiful. Sounds, audio cues and musics are fine. Some of the musics are really interesting. Now gameplay, it is what you expect from genre. Keep repeating each map, playing different heroes, getting different items with a small change in each map. If you were never into this genre, ROR2 might change your idea. It is that good. And another plus for Modding community. You can 100% this game in 90hours, and another 90hours at least playing mods. Adding more items and heroes and lots of other stuff. Repetition hasn't bore me yet.
I said Dev team disappointed cause last update broke game achievements. I had to do some really hard stuff 2-3 times to realize it is bugged so I had to get them other way. Fixing few small bugs shouldn't take months."

13440,it is a very fun and engaging game the only thing that is bad is that you just cant have a quick run and most of the characters need specific  achievements to unlock .to be honest i do not regret my punches at all 10 out of 10
13441,Da
13442,
13443,cool gadgets new whips
13444,yes
13445,Yes
13446,Amazing game
13447,"Quite an amazing experience. The discovery of how to play, unlock new items, and combo them is just great! For someone like me, who puts long hours into RPG games where getting gear and stats increases matter the most, this game surprisingly satisfied those same needs in such a different way. Every run you can build your characters while working to unlock the long term benefits of each characters unique abilities and other characters themselves. There is a ton to discover, so I avoid googling anything and I still have many more artifacts to find. Lots of gameplay, and very unique each time. RNG loot drops in the form of items is great too!"
13448,Cool game
13449,"I wasn't planning on having a new addiction, but I'm a weak man! fun 10/10"
13450,The visuals in this game are on point! Along with the really fun dungeon-type gameplay and stuff (I love games like these). Probably one of the best financial decisions I have ever made. This game is a MUST BUY when you love dungeon-type games along with insane visuals.
13451,why is this game so hard
13452,My favorite game. Very fun.
13453,This game reminds me why I started gaming in the first place.
13454,Shooty bang bang fun time
13455,you get to start mauling everything with your fists
13456,Mix and match adventure. A little learning is involved but ultimately a good game.
13457,If you get past the learning curve (which isnt that steep) it will be great fun for over 100 hours with friends or solo. Easily the best roguelike on the website.
13458,"This game is SO GOOD. If you're wondering how this roguelike game goes, it's fun! You think they have no guts to let you go off the limits, to be a god? Not at all. They let you become a god. You can stack your items, combine those effects to achieve such lengths! So many characters to get, so many combinations to try, so many things to get, it's so satisfying and fun. I highly recommend this game!"
13459,Good game 11/10
13460,"Fun with friends, achievement farm solo"

13467,"This game is really cool, but the fucking Kip Kip boss can suck a fat one oml fuck that guy"
13468,Game is so fun almost as fun as penis
13469,Fun singleplayer game. Friends definitely make it better but it is great to past the time with. Plus you can pause the singleplayer aspect of the game.
13470,"brothers in christ, get this game"
13471,Addicting as hell. Infinitely replayable and an astonishing soundtrack.
13472,good game

13474,Nice relaxing button clicking simulator. DLC is very worth it
13475,fun
13476,i see no rain im good
13477,Absolutely beautifully electric
13478,"Honestly, some really good fun to be had with friends and alone.
Base game has alot of items, fun characters and gameplay you can repeat multiple times over.
DLC is worth the price, adding much more content that makes everything more enjoyable.
And there are unofficial mod loaders if you like mods. (r2modman)
also, soundtrack is amazing"

13483,cool
13484,Its a fun game that is not that demanding. Lots of different items that can change your strat every play through.
13485,good game
13486,Great game! Loved it on xbox and its even better on PC with the selection of mods and earlier/more consistent support from the devs. Very addicting and better with friends.
13487,can lean dog get a buff
13488,they treat you like an item
13489,Fun and good game to play when bored. Lots of fun with friends and really no complaints tbh.
13490,play it now
13491,"I really like the game, its rather grindy, but its very fun, there is so many possibilities in the game that there is a low chance you will get similar rounds"
13492,so much love
13493,i risked the rain and now I'm dead
13494,it's good i guess
13495,it is a game
13496,Very cool game for the price! Definitely wasn't interested when I first watched game play but my friends convinced me and I'm so glad. It's really fun!
13497,"It's alright. Sorry, what I mean is, it got it all right."
13498,love 2 load
13499,Didn't rain so far but there is always a risk!
13500,this is a certified lens maker glasses moment
13501,great game but when people take my teleporter drops i get mad.
13502,It's like league of legends but not league of legends 10/10
13503,This game is so fun i mean very fun!... But it fills me with unbridled rage beyond belief i hate this game more than anything with with my hear and soul but i love it sooooo much its so fun but its so unfun and terrible and i hate it but its great
13504,"very fucking fun game, personally after 3-6 long runs it gets tiring, but I always come back the next day, really fun with friends and its has such a large amount of combinations you can make out of collectibles and abilities it gets ridiculously fun."
13505,yes
13506,"amazing fun

13507,plant shoolinga
13508,Love <3
13509,Ever smoked crack? You ever felt the sensation feeling where you'll need another hit otherwise you're going to die? Perhaps you'll need to go to get some help addictions aren't healthy. Neither is this game don't play it your PC will die.
13510,the rain is very risky.
13511,"Great game, even better with friends :)"
13512,"I met gup and I was like ""yup gup!"" and then everthing was alright. (I like playing as jelly dog) Also for real tho this game has some really good songs and is an overall really good game that I can constantly replay at any point in time and I don't even get into the mods that I see on youtube for this game."
13513, You better wear diapers before starting a run because it can go so long you will shit yourself.
13514,"this is not not fun. if you havent bought it already, youre wrong"
13515,excellent game and soundtrack and replayability. it is really fun to try so many different builds with all the characters and even when I don't beat the final stage I sitll feel like I had a good time.
13516,It's pretty good
13517,One of the most addictive Rogue-lite Experiences ever made. don't be afraid to play on easy mode till you get the hang of it.
13518,ki
13519,"waste of money. the game is entirely dependent of the items you receive, yet you only get items at random until you can unlock certain artifacts which are very far in the game. ergo starting out in this game is a hellfest that is entirely rng dependent. This gamer is literally about stacking upgrades and you cant even choose your own upgrades??"
13520,"Massive replayability, and great soundtrack"
13521,e
13522,Just amazing.

13529,"Fun game, boundless amounts of content and incredibly interesting lore"
13530,Very Very Very good game.
13531,best gamne
13532,If you dont break the game or you computer by the end of a run you arent playing correctly
13533,"Risk of Rain 2, Is very much like an abusive relationship, no matter what, either you or the other will break. In this case usually the other"
13534,to many hours just to die
13535,god
13536,"honestly can't stop playing this game, literally one of the best games I've ever played and the new content is amazing! I definitely recommend this, *especially* if you are playing with friends."
13537,"I can't see anything, but I'm not dead so I guess I'm good"
13538,"fun 
"
13539,Very hard but it's my game of the years hands down. This is addictive!
13540,great game good graphic and storie
13541,"As a big rouge lite fan, this game really fills the need of another addiction. Really capturing and fun, thank you 
hopoo games very cool."
13542,i like it
13543,"Don't go chasing waterfalls, stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. Do go chasing artifacts though, that shit is fun as hell."
13544,
13545,This game can suck the soul and life out of you 10/10 I guess but honestly too addicting.
13546,why are they at risk of it??? its called an umbrella dude it aint that hard
13547,"Great fun, good to play with friends or even on your own, the grind never feels blatantly unfair."
13548,"This game is great. So many different ways to play with different items, characters, stages, bosses and endings. The list of synergies go on and on. Banging soundtrack, Impressive graphics, Refined and polished gameplay. One of the most fun games I've ever played by myself and with friends. 10/10 would loop again to get oneshot by a bell."
13549,Singularity the game!
13550,"I made a tier list for the most expensive items in ror2 if they existed in real life 
yes, gasoline is in s tier"
13551,loader. like my load all over
13552,"9 out of 10.
It's eazy to get mods just download r2modman do get them.
It's also fun to play with friends.
But the game needs more characters or maybe more dlc's.
It's fun to take a lot of soldier syringes and then shot.
great game.
"
13553,Very good soundtrack.
13554,"I'm not a really fan of roguelike games, but from time to time, I always play this game again and again.
Considering my lack of interest on this genre, the fact that I'm stick to it, even if it's eventually, have my thumbs up."
13555,Very fun with friends and good variety of characters and stages. Could use more story though.
13556,"Addictive.... the soundtrack I mean. One of the main reasons why I cannot stop playing this game. 
Other then that it's great fun."
13557,"...and so he left, with everything but his humanity."
13558,"Magnificent roguelike game, one of the best in this genre. 
Recommend to play,  9 / 10"
13559,"Theft + Arson + Genocide + Illegal Possession of mechanical, chemical and biological weapons. Great."

13568,Fantastic Game
13569,Huntress sucks
13570,"Only the best Roguelites make you quit the game after another bullshit death, just to reboot the game instantly and start another run. 

Incredibly addicting. Items stacking make for an insane build variety and give every single run a unique flavor."
13571,Fun game where every playthrough is different
13572,yes.
13573,dope
13574,sometimes you die in one hit and you dont know why
13575,"We finished the game in 6 hours and I don't find it compleling to run through the game over and over again to just unlock new classes.
There should be some secret levels but overall I don't find it appealing."
13576,INCREDIBLY ADDICTING  IMO  totally worth a buy dlc also adds cool mechanics and only costs a bit more if you get the bundle
13577,Sa'll good man

13580,constant cocaine overdose until you get run over by a car
13581,"Sick game, never gets old. I'm a huge fan of the artstyle, similar to BOTW or genshin which makes risk of rain 2 very visually appealing in my opinion as well as making it easy to run. The game is enjoyable even at the very start of playing, and the learning curve is very manageable."
13582,yes
13583,"Great game. Played it for 240 hours, haven't even started on the other game modes yet. Worth it full price and a no-brainer when on sale."
13584,"love the game so much its really good, just keep in mind you gonna get clap no matter what, just gotta learn some basic of how to play it."
13585,"Ok i didnt play much of risk of rain 2, but i can say this game is fucking awsome.

13654,"I've had a lot of fun with this game, especially since the new update. There's lots of replay value in this game as you try to unlock mastery skins and achievements, as well as try new builds for each of the survivors. Speaking of survivors, a lot of the survivors are fun to play and draw from common archetypes. While some of the abilities aren't exactly original by any means, I think this is actually a good thing, as it makes it very easy to grasp a survivor at a fundamental level and lets the player worry more about learning how the item system works in this game.

And of course, the items are really what make this game stand out! Traveling through the different environments and picking up different items to play to a survivor's strengths or transform how they play completely is something that's really fun about this game!

All this would be really lame without some tough enemies to fight however. And this game isn't lacking in that department either! There are plenty of enemies with different attacks to learn and dodge, and the game does a good job at keeping you on your toes especially at the higher difficulties. Some of the bosses can be challenging too, especially for a newcomer.

If I had any advice to give to new players, it would be this. Make sure to get plenty of items. If you go too fast, you'll just thrust yourself into battles you aren't ready to face. But don't spend too long either! It's about finding the right balance of looting vs moving. And of course, always stay moving. The key to staying alive in this game is to dodge, dodge, DODGE! While in the early game you may be able to shrug off a few hits, as the enemies scale any hit can become lethal. So stay moving!

All in all, Risk of Rain 2 is an excellent game and I've had a lot of fun playing it."

13659,If you want a rogue-lite look elsewhere. While the items are randomized everytime you play through the characters limit what you can do. Most character have very specific items in mind and items have very specific characters in mind and if they don't they are very bland and don't influence how you play at all.

13665,"I loved Risk of Rain and I really wish I could love Risk of Rain 2, but it simply won't run smoothly on my computer. The game stutters enough to not be enjoyable and causes me headaches after a few minutes of play.

I don't think I lack the system requirements: I've got an Intel i7-8700 CPU, 16 GB of RAM (4 required), and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 which seem way over the recommended setup. I made a few attempts at reinstalling/configuring it in different ways, but they all fell short.

As for what I've been able to play, I'm not sure the 3D suits this genre very much. A lot of mental energy is spent just figuring out which enemies are there, and due to their size, movement, and distance actually trying to aim at them gets painful very soon. I think it would be better off with some kind of enemy radar and aim assist (you'll be aiming at A LOT of small enemies): I don't think Risk of Rain has ever been much about aiming as it's been about choosing your target priorities and combos togheter with the items you drop, which the 2D version lets you do while relaxed on the other parts."

Its just a roguelike, but just good! Its hard to explain my feelings for this game (its just that good)"
13697,"the game is challenging and fun
"
13698,"HOLY, Where do I start???? I know why this game gets plenty of positive reviews, Its genuinely a great well thought out game Its very fun. There is a large variety of characters with different skill sets, Some characters are easier than others but most are tend to be easy to learn and have fun with. I really like how you can also customise the way you can play certain characters with another play style and still feel like you're still playing the same survivor. No matter how many times you die, loop, kill millions of enemies or beat the game, entertainment just keeps coming which compliments the replayability of this game. You grow stronger with near endless items stacking with each boosting your stats or chances  (Opening chests fuels my gambling addiction :)))))) With the new Survivors of the Void DLC brings 2 really fun characters, New items and alternative items that can corrupt others and give them new purpose and an endless game mode 'Simulacrum' which is equally as fun as the original. Its also very fun to play with friends (If you actually have any) and grief the run with 30 consecutive Glowing Meteorite equipment. Honestly, 5 hours in this game feels like 15 minutes its crazy how unique this game is it really feels like one of a kind. definitely recommended"

13722,"A fun, addictive rouge-like that brings an element of strategy. Every character has their own play style so no one player ever doesn't have a character they enjoy. You can enjoy endless waves of hell or defeat the boss and escape. Each enemy within the game has their own purpose with different gimmicks and designs.

13747,"Excellent successor to the fantastic Risk of Rain. Punishingly difficult roguelite shooter gameplay with nearly infinite replayability. Especially fun if playing with a friend or two in co-op mode.

My one complaint is that all achievements can apparently be earned while using Artifacts. Since the use of Artifacts can dramatically alter the difficulty of the game, this effectively renders every achievement trivially easy to obtain, and therefore not really an achievement at all. Want that special skin that comes with the Mastery achievement for your favorite character? No problem! Just activate the right combination of Artifacts, and waltz right through your run on Monsoon difficulty. Very questionable design decision, Hopoo. ""Mastery"" should actually mean something."

13766,"Risk of Rain 2 is a really fun game to play if you're just looking for some cartoony destruction, but also has a very interesting and detailed story that takes after the first game. The controls are a little weird to get used to at first, and there's a somewhat steep learning curve to getting through the game without dying, but once you do it's a fun game you can replay over and over -- and that point is emphasized on with the feature of ""looping"" during a game run."

The gameplay is so addicting, great environments, build variety, the different class plays, enemies, and man THE SOUNDTRACK SLAPS. I have encountered no bugs or crashes in my short time in the game. I love it. I am legit addicted, having a hard time putting it down to go back to my main game(s).

Riskymod + Riskyartifacts + Elitereworks + Dropinmultiplayer + Notenoughfriends is probably my go-to mod setup. Riskymod reworks the game balance entirely, riskyartifacts adds a few more artifacts for your gaming pleasure, elitereworks gives elites more impactful abilities while toning down their tankiness and huge damage, dropinmultiplayer allows friends to join mid-run and gives them some items to catch up, and notenoughfriends allows you to play with up to 16 people instead of just 4."

I have no complaints with the game, the only thing I would try to change a bit is the balancing on certain characters, as some of them are pretty reliant on specific items for them to be really good.
10/10 tho honestly"

I was getting Rex, we had artifact of command, kin, and sacrifice on. 
We tried swarms and honor, but honor failed and swarms lagged. 
The best part is
8 runs in a row
stage 2
beetle guards and blind pests
We had lots of runs
and the only run where we got past stage 2
was when stage 2 was beetles
That was the last time we attempted mastery with those 3 characters
because we got the achievement on that run.

No other words needed. My only concern is that the developers might stop working on it."
13862,"Here's a full analysis on the game:
Shoutout to my friend who genuinely got me this game and made me love shooting small beetles and lizards (you decide if that is real life or ROR2).
(TL:DR: This game is polished and has great combat/enemies/characters/items. 10/10 would break the game again)

Controls & settings:
They are incredibly well done even on default. It's subjective on what you'll use but it is still super good and the settings are just perfect. It can decide what you need for decent visuals and fps very easily.

Bugs: 
I love choking on void field air while I slide off the map eighteen times, and that is one of the only bugs that is there. Besides small little effects on my game or visual bugs, I'd say it is quite polished.

Combat:
As a quick-paced, roguelike and mild Third-person run-n-gun, I've entirely enjoyed the play-style despite it being the first I've played. Weapons don't feel overpowered unless you use items well. The only issue is that gup makes me feel bad for killing everything in sight.

Movement: 
I love moving at mach-1 due to infinite red whips and flying with bandit and railgunner. Holy shit why am I allowed to do this, it feels like a crime and it is super fun. This is the first time I've actually been able to escape the police because I have immense speed.

Optimisation:
The game runs smooth as fuck, nothing is cluttered and even the lowest settings will work for most people. Granddads running 1998 windows vista laptops will most definitely not be able to play, but at least they get to see commando dead on the title screen :)

Enemies:
The bosses are amazingly fun to fight, and enemies aren't too overpowered unless you are deciding to fight on monsoon in loop 40311 and you are 48 days in. The game is well-balanced and unless you're playing crowbar huntress you are on your toes at all times.

Achievements: 
Characters are blocked behind achievements, which gives more progression and allows you to pick a main quite easily because you learn their abilities quickly and want to try to get them. Items are a bit hard to get sometimes but that is reasonable. It would be good if you could hover over what items did with artifact of command though, so that new players playing with their friends aren't left in the dust.

Characters:
Speaking of items and characters, they all are special and unique. Some are even quite powerful if you use them well. Such as void fiend. 100% corruption is fucking overpowered but takes time to get. Artificer is seen as bad by some people, but clearly they do not own air fryers because you can literally be THE orbital strike (take that captain!).

Conclusion:
Overall, this game is the first I think I have ever reviewed that gets a solid 9-10/10. With such polished gameplay and dlc being made to increase the replayability of the game even further, you question why it isn't even more expensive.

13877,"The incredible feeling of being 30 minutes straight in a run and suddenly dying and still wanting to start another run, is something I haven't felt for a long time with this kind of games. What the people at Hopoo Games have achieved with the 3d scenery and how it works hand in hand with the mechanics of a Roguelike. The variety of characters, strategies and objects is something that definitely made me fall in love with this game. Anyway the great variety and quantity of items was the only thing that I didn't feel worked well in the game, because at the end it's not that you choose an item that you won't find again, but that as the runs last more than 30 minutes you will end up getting all the items (which I have to admit is funny). 8/10

13888,"I didn't really *get* Risk of Rain 2 until recently. Rather than emphasizing a lot of planning and strategize-ing like other roguelikes, it instead rewards in-the-moment decision making: which items you prioritize at any point in a run, which enemies in a hoard you take out, etc. It makes for a fun experience and when it gets dull, the other characters change the dynamic so substantially that it is like playing a different game. Must play if you have friends with the game too."

13896,"At first I found this game frustrating, and I kept dying before the first teleporter event, but after getting the hang of things and playing with some friends, it has become my favorite game on all of steam. Definitely worth giving a shot, even if you get stuck at first."

and didnt run around and hurt my self"
13898,"When I first heard one of my favorite games, Risk of Rain, was getting a sequel that would be 3-D instead of 2-D, I was very excited, but skeptical if they could pull it off. Now, 300+ hours in and 100% of achievements unlocked, I can safely say my expectations were blown away. The essence of the original was kept expertly intact making this game, which gives a familiar but still new and exciting feel. The returning characters and items all retain just enough to keep them true to their form, while tweaking some bits to fit the new environment and play style of a 3-D world. Even the soundtrack returns with the same amazing and atmospheric presence, Chris did a great job with it and I would rank it up with some of my favorite game music like Mick Gordon's Doom soundtrack. I cannot recommend this game enough to fans of rougelikes or really anyone who can appreciate a game that expertly does what it sets out to do."
13899,Everything
13900,It's really fun once you've gotten into a flow
13901,"I have tried and tried, but honestly, I just hate this game. Its boring, repetitive, hard to learn the items and maps and what is happenening after every run, playing online I have no idea wtf is going on in half the lobbies, and at this point I give up trying.

14015,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

14021,"Extremely fun no matter which survivor you choose to play. This is probably the most welcoming roguelike game to newcomers. This game has also been especially awesome to play since the most recent expansion, Survivors of the Void, which is fantastic, and I think this DLC was when it all finally clicked for me. So there's honestly no better time to play Risk of Rain 2 than now. Also Chris Christodoulou continues to do an amazing job on the OST and I can't wait to hear more when the next DLC expansion comes out. Now go shred through hordes and quickscope instakill all the bosses."

14025,"Honestly baffled at how Hopoo games consistently makes such a polished masterpiece even better. With how many variables there are, it's a marvel that the game doesn't constantly break.

Another thing, this game has such a deep and encapsulating lore. It's both horrifying and monumentally tragic at times.

Not to mention the visual flair atop the technical masterpiece, all bundled together with a bomb ass soundtrack.

My only complaint with this game is a few ""challenging"" implementations, as they put it. (I.E. the void fiend's charge, twip twip being unkillable, etc.)"
14026,
14027,"Its close to being fun, but its not quite there. There are a lot of little things that make the game feel like its designed to make the game longer but it just makes it boring.  Enemies barely spawn for the first 2 minutes of a stage so you just wandering around killing like 3 enemies a minute so you can open maybe 3 chests before you open a teleporter.  Annoying enemies spawns that have been added in the DLC make it more likely to just die to newly spawned enemies and just end runs of 30+ minutes, that felt like you barely got anything going.  The game could definitely benefit from more items more quickly.  Just can't recommend it until it tries to be less time wasty in the earlier parts of runs.  It does get better with spawns and monsters the longer into the run you go, but by no means every run you can get strong enough to where you don't just get overrun or 1-shot by a newly spawned enemy or boss 45 minutes into a run."
14028,Gud
14029,great game just bring an umbrella.
14030,I cant quit you
14031,"The most fun you'll ever have!

The game offers a pleasent, but also a rather challenging experience. There's a whole bunch of ways to play the game with a decent variety of Artifacts and game modes. I don't think there's anything bad about the game (besides the FPS drops later in the game). Enjoy the game. it's meant to be played with friends!"

Definitely one of my favorite games."
14042,this game is really func if you are bored with gaming
14043,My favorite game of all time!!!!!!!
14044,"So after my friends bought this game I got back into it, I didn't really understand the game at the time so this was another chance to give this game a try. After doing a few games, my friends and I wanted to play the game differently, so I took to Solo. And Boy was this game never meant for solo. On Monsoon It feels like no matter what I do, no matter how skillful I am, there's an external factor that doesn't allow me to win. Either a Bad spawn location, Bad Items or a fucking tag team combo happens and fucks me. If you're looking to play this game for yourself, and you want a challenge, I don't think game's for you. Since this game feels A LOT like it never had Singleplayer gameplay in mind."

14057,"A fantastic sequel to a fantastic game from a great indie dev. Item combinations in this game and the freedom of play can make any character and build feel godlike, and there's so much chaos to be had whether you're looking for an easy run, a normal run, or a tough-as-nails run. Every survivor feels unique and fantastic to play, and while some have a few kinks in them, everyone is viable and everyone can have you feeling unstoppable with the right build. Multiplayer scaling is a bit ludicrous, so the more players you add the exponentially harder it gets, but it's still a lot of fun. Even if you're not a fan of the RNG element, the game has an unlockable item-selection mutator that lets you play the game with your own builds every time. If you like roguelikes, this is a must-get."

14074,noice
14075,gud
14076,"Loved risk of rain 1, played it for a long time. Got suprised years later by risk of rain 2. Won't say its  better nor worse but just as awesome since I loved both style (2D, 3D). Will keep on playing on playing and sharing my love of this game to my friend. Made 7 people get this game they didnt even knew about and they fell in love with it too. 

One thing that could be nice for online is a toggle option that would make the item shared lock like in the first game so no one can hoarder everything (thats me btw ;P). I tend to have more experience since I played the first game and ususally open all box before everyone and forget to let them some. oops hahah.

Would defenitly like some more skin for the caracter. And I dont mean just recolor but like an alternative skin like mercenary. You could give them to your 10% of the prismatic run since they still dont give anything. That could be it for them ;).

Anyhow I recommend this game to anyone who like roguelite or even roguelike and like to see how far they can push rounds. Keep the good work Devs, super happy with the lastest DLC too."
14077,"Great game. Truly, it is. The effort that went into the modelling of every item, enemy, and Survivor is incredible, the work with the maps and obstacles is amazing. There was clearly a lot of effort that was put into the making of this game. I truly do love the ""unlock different parts of the game via achievements"" aspect of the game as well, as this is not a common sight. This game is definitely a very fun game, whether you play solo, or with up to 3 friends, the game play is almost always different, as you start at a random location, have random drops in chests, ect. but you also have the survivors playing differently, and you can even change the attacks on your character to change how that character can be played. For example, MUL-T can have the starter loadout of Auto-Nailgun, Rebar Puncher, and Retool, or you can have the Power Saw, Rebar Puncher, and Retool, or even double Rebar Puncher with Power Mode, allowing for this character to be played in different ways. Plus, with so many different characters that can be played, two games are almost guaranteed to be different. I highly recommend anyone reading this review to play the game, and even get the DLC, as the DLC adds new enemies, maps, items, and two new Survivors that play nothing like the other Survivors in the game. I truly think that this game is an amazing game that definitely deserves to be purchased and played by many people, for it truly is a great game."

It was a blast to just waste away at my computer for several hours with some of my favorite people. I HIGHLY recommend anyone to play this."

14098,absolute banger
14099,"So I'll list the pros first: RoR2 is very addictive. Runs usually take around 40 minutes assuming my retardness doesn't end them prematurely. Even when that happens, i just play again. There is a lot of RNG involved. From triggering item effects, to stage variants and what drops from chests. Personally i think this is really good and gives the game replayability. Even though item drops are random, there are still ways to make a proper build with the right items through scrappers, multishops, the lunar bazaar and 3d printers. Risk of rain is a game about numbers. There is lots and lots and lots of damage calculating and chance. I love having brain aneurysms thinking about fictional numbers, There is the game's trademark ""difficulty increases with time"" system. It's not as impactful as you may have been led to believe. Just take your time lmao.
Now i shall list the cons: Balancing does not exist. With enough experience it's easy to tell what surviviors, skills and items are better than the other. And finally the biggest con is the required grinding. Most surviviors and their alternate skills as well as items are locked behind achievements, Most are easy, but just as much is unreasonably difficult.
I still  think that pros outway the cons and you definetely should play the game along its DLC"

14125,"Risk Of Rain 2 is one of the most fun rouge like games out there and the best part is that you can play this game with your friends. (this review is spoiler free)

I'm assuming that you have read the main steam store page and have a general idea about what this game is about, but if you haven't I will make a short summary. In risk of rain 2 you play as one of many survivors going stage by stage killing enemies and bosses while picking up a bunch of items. In stage 5 in which you can either loop or do something else that I won't spoil (this other thing completes the run). You wont be able to slowly grind stages as the difficulty increases with the time.

[Positives]
- the gameplay is fun and action based
- the items are diverse and can synergise together to make unique builds
- the multiplayer is really fun which makes this a great game to play with your friends
- the UI looks great and is understandable 
- the rogue like elements makes this game insanely replayable
- there are achievements and unlockable skins and items
- the game is polished 
- each character is unique and each offer a unique experience

[Negatives]
- The monsoon difficulty (which is the hardest difficulty) can sometimes feel a-bit unfair but this might just be a skill issue on my part
- Some achievements are really specific which means you can't try to get a certain achievement but that is really just nitpicking 

In conclusion the polish, diversity and overall fun of Risk Of Rain 2 makes it one of the greatest rouge like games out there. I hope this review helped you decide wether or not you should buy this game"
14126,.
14127,I recommend Risk of Rain 2.
14128,It is very fun
14129,"This is a real good game I like it, also hehe 69"
14130,"spent 2 hours grinding wave 100 simulacrum and i died to being outside of the cell

14131,I can't stop. 4 hours on a 185 wave simulacrum run. My cpu almost crashed multiple times. Buy this for your friends and play til your computer crashes. Worth it 10/10

14147,nice
14148,"While 20 hours isn't much compared to some people reviewing it here, I think I got a good idea of the gameplay loop.
If you like shooting down hordes of enemies with random (or not random) loot you find along the way, you will love this. If not, there are ways to limit the RNG in the game via an artifact that can let you select what item you want, and can help you plan out/try out builds. Even if you're not into roguelikes, try it. With friends its something special, and even alone its pretty fun!"

14158,"Risk of Rain 2 is pretty damn close to being my favorite videogame of all time, and that's going up against a lot of games that have moved me emotionally in ways that I'm still working through, and games with decades of work put into them that resulted in perfectly handcrafted experiences. I don't know if I would call Risk of Rain 2 a perfect game, but it's by far worth the price of admission as well as the cost of the DLC content. No other game just has as much in it that I specifically enjoy as this game does, and that's saying a lot, like seriously this game is so packed with content and skill based learning curves and all of it is fun and engaging to me, like, how did they even do that.
So anyway I'm gonna be writing a multi paragraph essay about this game just to show how much I think it's worth your money and to give a general skim of what you're getting yourself into, starting with my own experiences with it.
The game paces it's content out in a slow, continuous dripfeed, both in terms of it's lore and it's items/characters, so you're never overwhelmed except maybe at the very beginning if you're new to roguelikes, but I was and I got along just fine after a small adjustment period where I had no idea what was going on. I'd STRONGLY recommend that, even for your absolute first time, you do not play on the easiest difficulty (Drizzle) unless you absolutely need to as an accessibility tool, everyone's different and if you have limits that's understandable, but I guarantee you will get so much more out of the game's default difficulty of Rainstorm. It starts with small victories, you get past the first boss fight, you start to get more items, find little hidden areas in the maps, maybe you even do a few runs with your friends. You start to learn whats generally good and whats generally less good, but you can turn those items that you don't want into scrap to potentially make it into better item. You start to stack items to enhance their effects and build out a few really solid runs. At a certain point you'll start to get consistent 'god runs' where you're able to blast past the difficulty scaling and make enemy spawns a joke, or even have the game play for you, that's when you bump up the difficulty from Rainstorm to Monsoon.
In my opinion, Monsoon is when the game changes from great to amazing. It goes from a fun playground of looting, shooting, and picking up fungus to a final exam on your knowledge of everything the game has to offer. You need to know what to look out for, when you need something, what enemies to focus on, and how to approach and manipulate their behaviors. This probably seems trivial and obvious to someone familiar with the genre, and it might be, but Monsoon is when the game totally just clicked for me. Enemies will start to rapidly outscale your ability to fight them, and you become increasingly reliant on movement tech and skill to avoid damage since its harder to recover health. It's really not that hard once you're used to it, hell at this point Monsoon feels like playing on Drizzle to me but it really shines a light on how good the fundamentals of each character you unlock are, and how they can interact with the game world.
Every survivor in this game feels like you're playing a totally different game in the best way possible. Simple dodge and shooters, mobile melee characters that can air combo opponents to death, dudes who build turrets like you're back in the 2fort intel room, there's a blood mage type character who leeches and spends health to do insane damage, and a giant tank with arms who swings off of pillars like Spiderman to charge up a singular punch that one shots bosses. Every character you unlock may seem simple on the surface, but underneath lies a whole host of clever techniques, good item synergies, and even variations within each character due to the addition of unlockable alternate abilities. There's always something to learn and grow from in every death, something that you could have done just a little bit better, or a different way you could have approached that encounter to have an advantage, or some way you could have made it out of a bad situation with a sliver of health left. Time pushes you forward, so you're always on to the next area, fueled by your desire to outcompete the situations you find yourself in, driven by the hope of some saving throw type item that turns your situation around, and with the size of this game's item pool, they do often come. You can get runs with bad RNG and still push through purely on skill and the tools the game gives your base character, and to me that's what makes this game special. It's a game you can totally take apart and push to the brink of its limits until your game is just enemies spawning in, instantly dying, and an endless pile of XP orbs and gold flying into you, but its also a game that can kick your ass, and it can because it knows you can always fight your way out of it.
Risk of Rain 2 is great because of it's fundamentals, and the fact that you can take those fundamentals to their absolute extremes if you know what you're doing. And hell, I didn't even mention the game modifiers, alternate gamemodes, or the DLC content, but it all just makes the game so much richer. If you have the money, please consider picking up a copy of Risk of Rain 2, I promise you won't regret it.
Until you find out what an Elite Brass Contraption is, of course."
14159,Never experienced so much boredom in a game before
14160, yea
14161,709 hours on switch just got it on here to play dlc early so like yeah the best rough-like I have ever played and trust me I play alot
14162,very good and nice 👍
14163,"  Honestly, nothing else like this exists in the gaming world. It's a hidden gem that deserves the attention of a AAA title. Fun when it's solo, amazing when it's with friends. You'll never have the same run twice. 

10/10 recommended"
14164,Pew pew pew
14165,Baller game. good single player and even better with friends
14166,How many games have the audacity to say OBLITERATE YOURSELF? 9/10 (1 point lost for lack of rain)
14167,i love cock
14168,Very unique visual style and fun fast-paced gameplay makes this a favorite to play with friends.
14169,i love how there's just a point in every playthough where you become an untouchable god and destroy literally anything that dares to come near you
14170,Good Game
14171,"70+ minutes Monsoon nothing can stop you, you oneshot everything, 15 will o the wisp, tons of crowbars and a ceremonial knife everything dies before they could spawn.... then you lift you hand from your keyboard to scratch your head... then you got VAPORIZED in 0.00005 miliseconds by a elite elder lemurian.
Really love this game."
14172,"After 54 hours i decided to come back and get the dlc. Now the game will refuse to launch and ive done everything from unistalling, to removing anti-virus and even trying to force launch in directx9."

14175,Amazing sequel to the first Risk of Rain.
14176,HAHA
14177,i want 2 see my family again
14178,"This is a great game, both for solo and with friends. Artificer is the best! Their an amazing class that can be used to avoid damage, and dish out just as much. Play her right and you'll succeed for sure!"
14179,Maybe the real risk of rain 2 was the friends we made along the way.
14180,".... good ..... 


that all"
14181,"Usually not a huge fan of rogue likes, but I really like risk of rain 2. The gameplay is satisfying and it feels really good whenever you get a nice combination of items in a single run. The lore isn't shoved down your throat, but there is a good amount of lore, if you're interested in it. I do have one complaint about this game which is that I cant pause a run and play it later, and each run can easily get to a couple hours so I have to make sure I have multiple hours to play whenever I think about getting on. Otherwise, I give this game an 8.5/10, super fun"
14182,gud
14183,It's a very immersive game with stunning visuals.You always keep finding new things youve never seen before.
14184,"Lots of fun with friends, enough variety in how you're playing to play forever

Kinda annoying how much visual garbage exists by the end of a run as I have no idea what's happening anymore"
14185,"it just works
"
14186,"I think this is the literal best 3D rogue-like in existence. Hopoo really went out on a limb with such a departure from their other games, but it paid dividends. No game is perfect, but this is probably as close as it gets. Just don't be surprised if you end up frustrated by the gameplay sometimes; monsoon is quite annoying, at times."
14187,"Game is so simple, yet challenging. Solo or with a group. It is SURE to be a good time. I highly recommend it.  Great team building game.  Can be frustrating due to the RNG in the game but its really really good."
14188,Dude its hard but its super fun to learn
14189,My eyes have never burnt so good.
14190,Gesture + Tonic = Win
14191,"The game play is spectacular with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Some directions on how to get the characters are not clear at all but regardless it has some great replay value and if you are wanting to try it out, I completely recommend this game!"
14192,"This game gave me a weird dog, dash man, bungus, and the ability to make my game a slideshow if i play long enough. For that I am forever grateful"
14193,nice

By completing achievements, or finding secrets, you unlock new possibilities and new runs. And if you 100% it you can buy the DLC."

Good luck getting your refund. If you like progression, this is not for you."

14212,very pog
14213,"Clear recommendation from me.

Unforgiving but ""beatable"" combat and alot of different characters... and a VR mod, that turns it into a bloody decent VR game, some odd default keybinding choices here and there tho. But I am sure you can change that, and if need be go into the mod itself and change those like the mod author would... Generally, get the game and enjoy... if you got a vr headset, get the game and do yourself a solid favor and try it in vr."

Tons of items to learn what they do. Good variety of enemies. Only possible downside is after 100+ hours, it gets repetitive. Unless that's what you like or if you need a game like that in your library. Absolutely grab this game if you see it on sale. The wiki is very thorough for any knowledge needed.

14239,"For such a ""widely acclaimed"" game (15-20K daily players, nearly 150K reviews with an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" score) it's [i]astonishing[/i] how the devs could've released such a half-baked buggy mess of a DLC ([b]Survivors of The Void[/b]) with only 1 tiny little patch that barely addressed anything (2 whole months in and counting).

So does [b]RoR2[/b] deserve the hype? It's a great game, sure. But instead of praising it ad nauseam, I'll just point some nitpicks... 

[hr]
Why are some Survivor alt skills so much better/worse than their counterparts? Just to name a few:

✔️ Commando's Tactical Dive is notably worse than Tactical Slide. Giving Dive something as simple as a 1s i-frame on activation would balance that.

✔️ Engineer's Carbonizer Turrets should be able to ""sprint"" (to proc corresponding buffs and finally offer a viable alternative to the otherwise dominant Bustling Fungus strat on Gauss Auto-Turrets).

✔️ Loader's Grapple Fist is useless compared to Spiked Fist. They need to be differentiated better to warrant a choice. Loader's Gauntlet skills are a good example of a sidegrade. The Fists are not.

✔️ Captain's Diablo Strike... what's even the point of this thing? It has no place in a game about [i]speed[/i]. Cut its drop time in half (10s), double its cooldown (80s). You can already delete most bosses in 5 secs by normal means anyway once you get going. Make Diablo Strike Great Again (!?) 

And that's just to name a few. 

Oh yeah, almost forgot. Inconsistencies and lack of clarity:

❌ Overloading Worm is not an Elite monster, so why give it the ""Overloading"" affix? Just rename it to ""Overcharging"" or something to that effect to avoid any confusion (e.g. [i]assuming items that proc off Elite monsters work on it, when they actually don't[/i]).

❌ Currently, the Burn and Ignite status effects stack on top of each other (thus appearing to be the same) while doing dmg independently (e.g. count as 2 status effects for the purposes of Death Mark). Why? Simply give Burn a separate HUD icon (a red flame instead of orange, if you like).

Yes, extremely minor. But attention is in the detail.

Same goes for Hellfire Tincture's debuff (which also counts towards Death Mark). However, this debuff (to both self and enemy) is invisible. 

❌ Captain's Defensive Microbots should be a passive skill proper (like every other Survivor) rather than an item. 

As an item, it can be lost to Scrappers, 3D Printers, and Shrines of Order. Despite this (losing Cap's signature item), Drones will still gain Microbots. Additionally, if Captain transforms to Heretic, they will keep the personal Microbot but Drones will lose them. And if any Survivor morphs to Captain via Artifact of Metamorphosis they will gain Microbots (for the remainder of the run) despite morphing into another Survivor afterwards.

Bonus points? Defensive Microbots' logbook entry [i]still[/i] can no longer be acquired as of v1.2.3 

❌ Why is Altar of Gold using the same (albeit recolored) model/render as Shrine of Chance when every other shrine is unique in design?

C'mon, Hopoo. Give Aurelionite a proper shrine."
14240,great game👍
14241,"Everything about this game is amazing. The gameplay, audio, music, community, and dev team are all great. My favorite thing would have to be the sound track, Chris Christodoulou goes hard and I regularly listen to the songs. This game also has a good size modding community and I appreciate it. It is definitely better to play with friends but I regularly play it on my own as well. If you are still on the edge I think they just opened up trialing the game on Google Stadia for free without needing to even login so you can always try it there first; however, just keep in mind that the steam version will be a better experience in the end as stadia is... well stadia."

14251,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

14273,"good
"
14274,"i got this game and you should to its so fun and entertaining and low-key addictive 
this game when starting a run feels like going from rags to riches"
14275,very fun and good. i play it alot :)
14276,"This game is absolutely incredible. I've played 170 hours and im still finding things to do. It has tons of replayability, and lots of unique characters to choose from. It looks beautiful, has an amazing soundtrack, and is fun to play. What else could you ask for in a game? I highly recommend you pick up Risk of Rain 2."
14277,"Very good game, the actual gameplay is very streamlined, music is good, and progression makes you think and is very rewarding."
14278,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES i HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!
14279,it alright
14280,cons: not enough rain
14281,"I have IMMENSELY enjoyed my time with this game! Easy to say it is one of my all-time favorites<3
It's fun to pick up and do a run or two either solo or w/ friends, and the new DLC has brought so many cool changes! I adore the new characters designs so much<3

My only real complaint is that some characters have a lot of items that don't rly work all that well with them, which I'm actually okay with to a certain extant! I feel not having to balance the items for all survivors means that more unique items can be made!
One thing I would like to potentially see is cosmetics for the existing characters, specifically new skins! I love the idea of these characters having a few extra looks, and would happily pay more for them to support the dev team!"
14282,"I love this game, Its a 9/10 game for me personally. Love the graphics, love the game play, and the optional lore is pretty interesting too. I got 200 hours on console compared to pc but that's only cause I got PC more recent. There is a ton of stuff to do and I rarely get bored, they add new stuff quite often. Not that there are downsides, a god run will take you quite a bit of time but its worth it, you will die in the beginning a lot and is frustrating but is a part of many games, what would it be without a challenge, play your own way."
14283,Funny wedding rings carry me
14284,good
14285,good game fun with friend too
14286,"It's a genuine improvement over the original; if you haven't played the original, I would say to start here anyway, I feel it's more accessible to start, but perhaps harder to master."
14287,"Risk of rain 2 is the first risk of rain but 3-D, which is a great thing, honestly one of my favorite games ever! The game-play is addicting, visuals are great, the soundtrack is fantastic, and its multiplayer so i can play with up to 4 people. I highly recommend. especially since it goes on sale often."

14290,Best Rouge-like game out there. Also the most re-playable game ever made. If you enjoy this game the expansion is also a must-buy.
14291,This is one of the games of all time
14292,pretty dope i guess
14293,best game
14294,"If you like rougelikes then this is perfect. Firstly, the game scales with time. At first you may not notice it but if you take too long you may be starting over. A lot of items are about proc/proc-chains. Some synergize better than others but for the most part there are no bad items except maybe a few that I think are underrated.

The characters are diverse in their abilities but there are specific roles they fill. There's alternative skill you can unlock that can drastically change how a character plays however preference should still be considered unless you want to do what is meta. Map diversity is alright (Better with DLC) and with it's official release it has a Boss instead of just being an infinite loop of the same stages. There's also a difficulty for everyone and even if you find it's hardest game mod easy there are plenty of mods that can fix that.

The DLC I felt really fleshed the game out more. Before items felt like they were lacking. Granted a lot of the items are really strong, the non-void items they added filled the main item pool fit well with some ok additions to lunar items if you choose to use them. A few more stages were added which is nice since they are quite good IMO. The characters from the DLC are pretty fun and fairly strong once you learn them and the game also brought new enemies to table as well as a 2nd final boss.

Lastly the modding scene is huge. If there something that you think should be changed or doesn't quite fit there's probably a mod for it already. Not to mention the modding community is very helpful in diagnosing problems with mods and the creators are usually quick to respond about bug report. Want mods but not sure where to start? There's a modding channel in the official RoR2 discord and people there for recommendation and the official modding discord a great place as well.

Also join the Starstorm 2(mod expansion) discord for a fun time."
14295,"yes

66 hours of sobbing and crying. Recommended, because it's fun."
14303,Very fun and replayable game. The game is hard but it is fun.
14304,i like the funny sword guy he's fun

14327,This game has given me hours of fun both solo and with friends. The new DLC is great and fun all the way and put new things into the game that brought me back and will probably make me hang around till the next update. Soundtrack is way to good and makes it feel way more epic and emersive.

14332,"One of the best roguelike games of all time, and some of the most fun I’ve had on a game. I don’t have loads of hours on this game, but I can say for certain that pretty much every hour I do have has been phenomenal. There have been very few times where I’ve gotten insanely frustrated. 

Ratings:

Soundtrack: 10/10- one of the best and most fitting soundtracks for any game ever.
Visuals: 8/10- very stylised but it works very well and the environments are beautiful 
Combat: 10/10- very very fun combat that feels very rewarding and can be very challenging
Movement: 9/10- with the help of items movement can be very very fun and always feels fluid and responsive.
Progression: it’s really fun to work towards unlocking characters and it makes the rogue like format so much more enjoyable since you have things to work towards every time. 

Overall 9.5/10"
14333,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

14361,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! This has everything a good game needs. Endless singleplayer content, great multiplayer, lots of modifiers to keep things from getting sour. The soundtrack takes you to another place, amazing work. On top of all the good stuff the game has, it keeps getting better. The dev team is amazing and know what they are doing. They listen to what the community needs, and doesn't remove content just because its ""broken"" unless it makes the game unenjoyable or unplayable. 
         In conclusion, Risk of Rain 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. So many other games I get burned out after playing too much, but this game has the right amount of chaos to keep me engaged. 10/10"
14362,"This game would be so good if they hand held a little more for where the Teleporter is or how to free the drop ship. I've spent countless games running in circles looking everywhere on the map for 30 minutes and then I just close the game and stop playing because there's no hint at all to where the objective is. Sometimes my toon is stacked with insane DPS and I'm crushing it, but I'm slow as hell with no movement items... so I spend ages trying to find the way out. Like after 10 minutes, 20 minutes... just give a hot/cold signature... anything!!"

It's very replayable with so many different options and things you can do, and on top of that, you can do it with up to 3 friends! It's perfect for a good time, for people who are serious, just want to have fun, or right in between. I can never get enough of this game. I will keep replaying it until I die. Thank you, Hopoo Games. You've made a masterpiece."

The modding community is very dedicated to this game and the stuff they make is insane. Ranging anywhere from adding entirely new monsters/bosses/items/difficulty modifiers and artifacts to make your runs even more crazy fun, to adding brand new playable characters to the game built from the ground up with their own move-sets and everything. (some more fleshed out and balanced than others but all fun none the less) You can quite literally turn this into an entirely new game through mods and shape it exactly how you want it! I have no negative things to say about this game except for the fact that iv'e been neglecting other games to play it all the time LOL"
14368,"Gotta be one of the most fun games out there. Incredibly well made, has infinite replay value, and the whole game has a really great feel and player experience. Very cohesive. Great soundtrack. Phenomenal devs who actually listen to their community. Couldn't recommend it enough."

14428,"[h1] The Best Kind of Rain [/h1]

Never have I fallen in love with a roguelike harder than I have with Risk of Rain 2. This is my most played game on Steam, and I reckon it will stay that way for quite a long time. The gameplay loop feels satisfying, and it's gratifying to discover that you've improved since your last run. The soundtrack for this game fits beautifully, with special mentions being The Raindrop that Fell to the Sky and The Rain Formerly Known as Purple. This got me into Chris Christodoulou's other works, and I've left feeling just as emphatic as I am with ROR2's OST. 

These feelings have only been amplified with the release of the game's first DLC. I'm having a blast going through all the new content, and I'm awaiting the next expansion(s) to give me more reasons to enjoy this already near flawless game. Highly suggest getting the DLC if you enjoy this game, cannot recommend it (or this game) enough."

Fantastic work, especially considering the ambition following the 2D, equally good RoR1. If you like roguelike games especially, give this game a go. Must buy."
14440,"This game is as addicting as it is rewarding. Rogue likes really have to balance the difficulty and progression if they want to avoid frustrating players; Risk of Rain 2 walks this knife-edge beautify.

14466,"Amazing roguelike, definitely the best since Binding of Isaac. I played the original Risk of Rain when it came out and was not really captivated, but they did a really good job of porting it to 3D.

The only complaint I have is the final boss. He's really bad. I don't know what they were thinking, but he can spam attacks that drain 90% of your health and is basically impossible for melee characters or characters with no mobility. Having a boss that you can only beat with certain items and classes is just not good design. Imagine doing a 30 minute run just to die from a single hammer swing. Still the other 99% of the game is good."

14488,very fun. very fast.
14489,Its a fun game that is really meant to be played with your friends. If you are a strict solo gamer you can still have fun but this game is peak when you have 2 or 3 friends.
14490,"In roguelites you're generally meant to play around RNG. Items affect the optimal way for you to play, and you adapt to what you get on a run, or you make guesses based on what you hope will happen with future drops. ROR2 isn't like that. Item RNG is just ""this item is good"" or ""this item is not good for this character"" or ""this item is always garbage"". Since you have very, very little choice in what items you get, this is pretty bad. It's complicated by the fact that unlike the star of this genre, Isaac, you can't always outplay damage. A LOT of damage is completely unavoidable, including a lot of attacks that can one shot you or juggle you into 100-0 combos. The primary way you mitigate damage is by deleting enemies before they can hurt you, but spawns are wildly random and some classes are reliant on long cooldowns to deal with certain types of enemies. It's common to have absolutely nothing spawn and just be running around with nothing to do but memorize item locations so you can speedrun them later, and not uncommon to have random hordes spawn that, given the wrong rng with enemy types and modifiers, mean unavoidable death. Also, most bosses have a desperation attack that will kill you if it hits, and avoiding them can only be done by having good item RNG or in some cases good terrain and enemy pathing RNG. Even having godly items isn't always enough, since a few bosses can and will fly out of range of all attacks for certain classes and one shot you if you try to run to the teleporter.

The game also does an absolutely piss poor job of communicating things to you. I enjoy figuring things out on my own, and this game sucks for it. You basically have to use a wiki for a lot of the core things that make the game somewhat tolerable work. It's got a lot of extremely lazy design and implementation - the game will tell you exactly how every item functions in the menus, but the in-game tooltips are absolute trash and in some cases not even present. The visual language of the majority of attacks does not in any way represent how they actually work, and some of them will probably take you dozens of times dying to before you understand how divorced the mechanics are from what the game visually communicates.

The only way I can recommend this game would be if you don't enjoy the discovery aspect of roguelites, you intend to play exclusively multiplayer (I've heard there are more items which mitigates rng if you're playing diverse enough characters) and you don't mind extreme, extreme randomness, both in terms of player power and incoming damage (which is, generally speaking, not mitigated by skill but by luck).

e - I have to say, the more I play, the more I see this game as a collection of flaws that really shit on a core good concept. Almost every mechanic is either poorly implemented, has no reason to exist, or only exists as a really weak band-aid for another really bad mechanic. The game is addictive because the genre is so untouched, but in terms of game design it's an absolute trash fire and I regret giving a cent to the hacks to developed it. Shooter mechanics are inherently good and hard to fuck up really badly, but they managed to make a game that's so random that in all the time I've put in can only think of maybe 2-3 times where I felt like I made a good decision or a good play, and almost always everything that happens good or bad is 100% luck. I'm sure if you spend a lot of time studying and playing around some of the worst offenders like the scaling system you can mitigate that to some extent, but it's just not fun in any way and good systems are entertaining to learn. Good roguelites you can look at every death and learn something from it. This game you almost never have anything you can learn."

14501,"I got this game as soon as it appeared on Steam, as I loved the first game - and was disappointed. I returned to it a few months before the DLC was released, and fell in love with it. Partly due to the expansion and polish it received in the interim, and partly assessing its on its own merits.

It's a great game to get into a flow state and zone out in action. It has beautiful aesthetics, amazing audio, and subtle yet fascinating writing. And it has great networking optimization so that I can play with friends on the other side of the globe with minimal discomfort.

Moreover, it appears the devs love it and intend to extend it for the foreseeable future; so I'm just looking forward to see what's coming for the most recent addition to my favorite games of all time."

14532,"This game is awesome, I have sunk way to many hours into this game and I always enjoy coming back to play it again. Each character plays very diffrently so whenever you start to feel fatiqued  you simply swap characters. 
This game does have a learning curve which you can simply overcome by reading guides or watching turtorials but honestly, buy the game, get absoutly destroyed a couple of times and very quickly you will get good. 

The only downside is eventually you get to a point where you dying is due to lack of skill or abilities, but instead bad luck. Which is almsot neccesary if your doing a god run 

Overall. 9.5/10. An amazing experience especially with friends.

14534,"Probably the best rougelike, though I'm not a fan of rougelikes in general. Game has very good art, standard music, decent selection of characters etc.

The survivors of the void dlc/update was a highly anticipated and rare addition that this game gets, unfortunately, aside from the new void items which there's a handful of good ones, was generally sub par. The rest of the update/dlc added Railgunner who is probably the most overpowered early game, but becomes completely useless afterwards. It added a void character as well that I haven't played but have only heard negative things about. The worst part was probably the new enemies being better off out the game than in. The new gamemode it added was also pretty good on the other hand, but there are flaws it has such as the beacon going to impossible locations resulting in death no matter what. In the normal game, you can spawn inside void regions and have a huge disadvantage instantly that you can't do anything about, void enemies can also simply not appear, leaving you on 1 enemy left until you decide to just give up and teleport to the next stage.

The game in general, without friends, is not very fun. 
With friends, you can get a solid 50-70 hours of enjoyment, despite those hours, half of it might be you just doing the same thing over and over. The game needs more content still because unfortunately there is a clear meta - a small number of superior playstyles which makes thinking outside the box doomed to fail which sucks for any game and double sucks for a rougelike - luckily, this has been addressed a little in the DLC with void items, but there are only a handful of useful ones, A lot of your playthroughs will mirror the last however the argument can be made that every play through is different if you don't have command enabled, but then it becomes an RNG fest which will result in you getting one tapped by round 3 or 4 although you can still get one tapped even if you are broken overpowered - challenging the meta is not really encouraged. The game needs better scaling for long runs, if you decide to loop after defeating the round 5 boss, the game turns into either you one tap or you get one tapped.

There are a handful of boss fights in this game, however most of the bosses are braindead and too easy, and in general the boss fights are nothing impressive and could do with a rework or new bosses. The final bullet spong- bosses are kind of a chore to fight, they aren't very fun nor very challenging and they both have a phase where they can one tap you (why?), which is the only threat they will ever give.

Whilst the review seems pretty negative, in terms of rougelikes it is probably the best one I have played despite this. Its gameplay is what makes the game and makes it fun even with those downsides primarily when playing with friends. It is also polished, not having any glaring glitches outside of the DLC content. If you enjoy rougelikes then this game is probably a must have."

14590,good
14591,"Yep
"
14592,"[i ]A hyper-speed experience that utilizes time mechanics to further enhance game play. [/i] 

That's a brief description of Risk of Rain 2 in my opinion. With randomization on item drops and many characters to choose from that have different play styles, the possibilities of what might happen when you start are limitless. 

The music composed by [u] Chris Christodoulou [/u] also encapsulates the game experience well.  With the music from the opening credits to the menu theme, to even just passive music.  It all ties together.

Seeing that Risk of Rain 2 supports multiplayer, and from what I know has a decent build for it just creates even more paths of play.  Join up with some friends, or play alone and conquer the game, whatever you want to do.

The game creates a choice in game on how to balance item gathering and teleporter usage, which encourages skill growth as eventually you learn how much is enough. An anti-loot goblin feature to say the least. 

Also a personal peeve I have with games that market infinite features infinite possibilities, often those games just end up overwhelming me and make the time unenjoyable.   Though with Risk of Rain 2, the customization is simple yet expansive.  There's so little yet so much.  It's... a nice change of pace.

The story is incorporated into the game via the opening sequence, cut scenes, logbook entries and such.  Fast enough to understand for combat junkies, lots of details for the lore fanatics.  

Truly a masterpiece I didn't expect to enter my steam library.  A welcome one for sure though.  

[b] Highly Recommend, Overwhelmingly. [/b]"

14644,"I can't quite remember why I purchased this game or how I came about it but I'm sure glad I did. This is a review of the initial game as I missed out on the DLC sell. Spent a solid amount of hours on this game and still haven't beaten the boss but still put the time in to do a run every now and then. I'm certain I still haven't discovered all the secrets but the things I've figured out on my own was pretty awesome considering I do believe I got this game on sale and was amazed at the content given on the initial game. Lots of customization with the characters and items available, things I still have yet to unlock myself despite having 40+ hours on this game. You can get lost pretty fast in this game and the time will fly by quick and it will be so soul crushing when you lose on a run. Would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of this game genre or anyone just looking for good ole fashion fun."

14659,"this game has eaten my life more than any gacha game ever could. I spend my free hours playing this game. I spend my taken hours ignoring my responsibilities to read the ror2 wiki. I spend the hours without any technology thinking silently spiteful thoughts about how bad artificer is. 

Okay for real though this game is kind of a masterpiece in most ways. It's replayability is kind of insane which makes sense because it's entirely built in. Not only does it take multiple runs to win, there are also many different ways to win, be it beating the final boss, obliterating, true obliterating, or, if you have the DLC, true obliterating. 
There are many different ways to go about a run, depending on which survivor you chose, and you'll probably find that you have a lot of fun with at least one of them. You can play as MUL-T and hit as many times a second as possible, or play as MUL-T and try to go as fast as possible for a crazy high damage utility, you could also play as MUL-T and get high damage sniper shots, or you can play as MUL-T and get crazy proc chains. There are technically other survivors too.
One thing that I don't like as much about this game is that while it does seem like you have all the agency in the world, in reality, every run without crazy artifacts are gonna look the same past the first 15 minutes. Items are random in this game so over time each run will slowly begin to look like every other, because while you may get more of some items than others, by the time you get enough items to start to have at least half the game's content at once you realize that this is exactly the same run as the one before it. 
Some items, and more importantly some survivors, are horribly unbalanced. Things like ceramonial daggers and brilliant beheemoth can turn your runs into clicker games while items like wake of cultures can literally kill you. This wouldn't be a problem if the two item's weren't both legendaries. Artificer struggles to survive at every stage of the game while engineer struggle to die as soon as he gets a white item (bungus). 
I think that this game could use a little bit more patching and some more content to make runs actually different from each other but overall its an insanely well made game. The music is amazing, the way that damage works is just as complicated as it is genius, the way enemies spawn is a little monotenous but pretty damn smart as well. If there's one thing I can say about this game, it's ""read the wiki."" Not even because you have to, the game is relatively good at explaining itself. I just think you should read the wiki because it's fucking cool. 

TL;DR: well made, poorly balanced and becomes very same-y after a while, but still really really well made."

14673,"Risk of rain is the best game i have ever played in my life.
Not the best *rogue-like*, not the best *loot-a-thon*, not the best *whatever*.
THE best game, i have ever spent my time playing. 

As of writing this review i have played a mere 129 hours, but that is in the span om roughly 14 days, because this game is SO fun.
I can name countless runs where something completely busted happened, only for that same interaction needing some fine-tuning 2 stages later because of the fantastic scaling enemies have in RoR2.

I have been playing mostly with the command artifact (that's how i have the most fun, sue me) which makes me able to pick what items i get myself, allowing for endless build possibilities resulting in even more fun!

If you like roguelikes and if you like fast paced gameplay with tons of replayability, it's a no-brainer.
Otherwise just pick engineer and go afk for 5-6 minutes at a time, you shoud be good ;)

Highly recommend this game if you enjoy grinding for achievements.

Also great for playing with some friends. I'd say about half of my playtime in this game is screwing around and having a good time."
14810,"I recommend Risk of Rain 2, because I think it is a very good game.

Risk of Rain 2 is a celebration of what it means to play an action game. It draws you in, and keeps you coming back for more. For the relatively small amount of time I've had with this game, I have yet to grow tired of it. 
RoR2 is a character-based rogue-like, each character appealing to a multitude of play styles. You could sneak around enemies as Bandit, dance through the air for minutes at a time as Mercenary, sling across the map and pound a beetle in the face as Loader,  air-strike an angry floating bell with Capiain, or gun down bosses as Engineer (missed a few, they are all good dw).
RoR2 rewards every play style. You can comb through every familiar nook and cranny for crates, making sure to squeeze every bit of loot possible out of the level, or you could burst through each level, dancing past, through, and in between bosses. 
RoR2 is not afraid to let it's players become demi-gods, but will test whether or not they shall remain, or be dethroned. RoR2 is not a game that will leave you shattered after loosing your best run. 
RoR2 is a game where your shattered runs become a grafted blade the player's wield for the rest of their runs. 
RoR2 is a nonstop heart-pounding adrenaline run.
RoR2 is absolute peace of mind.
RoR2 is panic-induced chaos

But, if you asked me what Risk of Rain 2 was, I think I would call it a work of art.
Blood, sweat, and tears put into a game that, in this day and age, delivers all you could want and more without skipping so much as a heartbeat.

I recommend Risk of Rain 2, because I think it is a very good game."
14811,"Very good, very fun, take it at your own pace, just get ready and no, this is DEFINATELY not entry level gaming"
14812,"Overall good, and even better with friends.

100% completion (which in this game also unlocks items, characters, skills & more) requires beating the game on monsoon difficulty with every character, which is the longest ""grind"" here. Other than that there are some fun challenges here and there, which shouldn't be too difficult."

14858,Bogus Binted?
14859,good to play with friends
14860,it's aight... kinda mid... 4/10 at best
14861,perhaps precipitation
14862,GUD GAME O MY GUD!
14863,"its either too boring because nothing can hit you, or it hits you and you die in 1 shot."
14864,jygugiihop
14865,I was kinda forced to buy this buy my friends but in the end all i can say is it was worth it the mechanics are fun and the game has a all round feeling that just makes you never wanting to stop playing it.
14866,fard
14867,"Game-play -> Check
Addicting -> Check
Ability to become God -> Check
Actual Rain -> Pending"
14868,"Have you ever wondered what 'Apotheosis' means, or what it would even look like? This game. Right here. You boot it up, get into your first run not even on Monsoon difficulty and [b]BAM[/b] yer dead before you even hit stage 4. ""Well that sucked,"" you think to yourself as you start up another run. The next few runs might yield much the same, you figure out what items do what and some potential combos that could work... that is, until you finally get [i]the run[/i]. 

I'm talkin about [i]the run[/i] where you so much as look in the direction of an enemy and it gets obliterated from existence.

I'm talkin about [i]the run[/i] where, in conducting death-by-disrespectfully-looking, you set off a chain reaction where you set off all the health bars on the entire map as, one by one, they deplete each one faster than the last.

I'm talkin about [i]the run[/i] where, as a consequence of all this OP bullshittery you are no longer racing against the in-game timer trying to out scale you, but instead your very computer as it tries desperately not to crash long enough for you to finish your run.

I'm talkin about [i]the run[/i] where you finally face off against the final boss and get him to his final stage, and it dawns on you that what he does next throws all your OP bullshittery back in your face, denying you the satisfaction of victory and likely pisses you off for a good ten minutes before you inevitably start another run.

For you see, when I say that this game is a textbook example of Apotheosis, I don't mean that in regard to the characters you play. I mean that [u]you, the player,[/u] ascend to godhood as you turn this game into your private playground and the enemies and items into your toys which you abuse with reckless abandon. Then, when confidence surges within you, you kick up the difficulty to Monsoon ready to take your rightfully owed Mastery Skins...

Only to get humbled by a pair of Blazing and Overloading Lesser Wisps four minutes into stage 1.

10 outta 10 would recommend this game which also happens to prove that overconfidence is, in fact, a slow and insidious killer. Plus it has an extensive modding community and multiplayer which can also be a modded experience."
14869,"A fun game both vanilla and modded. Playing modded is also extremely simple and quick. I would usually leave a slightly more detailed review, but I don't feel I have enough time played right now. Will probably update in the future."
14870,"Terrible weather app, I haven't left my house for days now, fearing that if I go outside it will rain.

9/10"
14871,Addicting and Fun
14872,fun game
14873,Fun.
14874,=D
14875,"after new updates, chances for you to get OP run is near impossible. Everything just decides to one shot you no mercy."
14876,Yeah its fun
14877,"You lose 3 hrs of your life in 0.00000001ms.
10/10."
14878,Risk of destroying your adversaries and computer...
14879,Never been so frustrated at 3am before and I have 4 kids..
14880,This is the worst game ive ever played
14881,"The game is very fuin, each game I've played has been different every run, even with the same characters."
14882,good game
14883,
14884,"Really good game, nothing else to say"
14885,good game
14886,I hate this game.
14887,very fun and addicting with or without friends :>>
14888,
14889,I am alone
14890,More like Risk of Trains hitting you by the time you hit late game. 10/10
14891,Better to play with friends :)
14892,aight
14893,good
14894,Pog
14895,epic game
14896,fun
14897,"Ok so, take my review with a grain of salt. The game itself is very addictive and engaging with a seamless transition from ""Oh good, I'm doing great."" to ""Oh damn oh shit oh fuck."" Not only you get to kill hordes of monsters who want you dead in their planet, but you also get to raid other places and pray that you're not facing other kinds of monsters that could potentially mess up your face. Just keep in mind that teleporters aren't safe zones.. Nowhere is safe... Maybe except your drop pod but I don't recommend staying in there."
14898,so good
14899,nice
14900,yes
14901,this game is teaching me a valuable lesson on hoarding
14902,"As a person who has a lot of sex with real life women, I believe that I’m adequately qualified to review this game. Risk of Rain 2 is just like having sex with women (not men). Although it is unable to perfectly replicate the feeling of real life sex, as it is the superior option for real men, it is still a close alternative for those who are too beta to ever experience real life sex or for those who had it so much (like me) that now they are looking for new ways to pleasure themselves. So go ahead and try the game out, the fact that it does not fail to make even my penis hard in a matter of minutes speaks volumes about how pleasurable this game is."
14903,"Best game, absolutely good."
14904,"Fantastic game. Can loop for hours, beat the game, do character missions, find secret chests, etc. So much to do; endless fun"
14905,good
14906,"Best game ever, unless you have epilepsy. 

There's a learning curve, but it's so satisfying."
14907,great
14908,Nice
14909,good game
14910,get it... now... this instant
14911,very addicting
14912,ABC

14915,It's good.
14916,the flames toil away at my skin
14917,"Really great game.
Lots of stuff to do"
14918,"man i fucking love this game man, mercenary? Like I just feel like I finally came outta the closet when mastering him, I felt like I could truly be myself and ya know what, like games don't really make you feel that often, Man.. Mercenary is soooo Yaaaaas yfm?"
14919,this is really what it feels like to be addicted to ketamine
14920,"Whippy dunko, honk bopper when bing scooter. If bing bibble (Whopper only) scrap bungus. fung dunkle overall, boppy dingo out of bonko junk."
14921,"Amazing game, the perfect sequel to an already amazing original game"
14922,play if you want your balls to grow
14923,.
14924,mOnKE
14925,"Iv destroyed this game on the console a long while ago, tried it out before the dlc an the game was definitely better on pc, but now ills i can say is this dlc unbalances everything fix it now, an no i shouldn't have to just turn it off no make it balanced for the beginning or remove that shit for the start, there's no fucking reason the dlc is that much more harder than the regular game, no fucking reason as soon as i start there's 12 + stone warriors with that new bs flying dbag. Make it so that normal isnt the fucking hard difficulty you cunts, its almost as bad as when the stupid fucking clay gunner was first added nerf this shit now, im not 20 minuets into the game im only at the first 3 mins an have no fucking items, fix it you dbags. I don't play this shit with people that's a waste of fucking time make the single player game mode for 1 person not try to force me to play with online losers. An no mater what anyone says I played this shit enough to notice exactly what was done fix it."
14926,10/10 top 5 game
14927,gg
14928,Tons of fun.
14929,"very funny lizard men
"
14930,Fatlas
14931,I've been playing for over 350 hours and i'm still not bored yet
14932,"I will try to be concise and direct with this review. This game is incredible if you are seeking a certain gameplay style. It takes some time to get used to, but don't be ashamed to use drizzle or rainstorm to get the hang of things. It can be punishing, but this creates this intense, authentic feeling of kill or be killed. The items combine with the character variety, creating so much replayability. The skill ceiling is high, but the random elements take enough out of your control to both make random runs become incredible, or other runs an upwards struggle.

This game shines brightest with friends. It gets very difficult, and if one player hogs items it can be a struggle. Personally, I would recommend trying 2 player co-op, then feeling out 4 player up. If you want, there are mod managers that allow you to make the game better suited to your friend group.

There is story, there is an ending, but the point of the game isn't to beat it. It's to play it. There are achievements if you feel like you need goals to strive for. Try your best to get every character to Eclipse 8 once you get good. Don't take the meta too seriously, fans tend to obsess over it. I recommend this if you want something you can hop back into. I don't recommend it if you are looking for something you want to complete, but if you want, you can always try Eclipse, RoR2's ascension system."
14933,yes me love game
14934,"One of the best games ever made, although it's style might not be for everyone go ahead and give it a shot."
14935,
14936,Make Huntress thicker.
14937,"Risk of Rain 2 has proven to be one of the best games I've ever played in my life. For a very long time I craved for a coop game to try and live again old times when I played along with my brother and friends. Hopoo Games managed to make it possible with this absolute gem.
Gameplay and overall mechanics are well balanced and extremely fun, with plenty of items and different character abilities for you to find the play-style that suits you better.
It's also a living proof that games do not have to be ultra-realistic to look pleasing.
Chris Christodoulou has achieved an amazing work of art with his soundtrack to this game. A progressive-rockesque music that gives you the chills again and again.
The Survivors of the Void DLC didn't disappoint. Brings 2 interesting new characters and a plethora of items.
I cannot recommend this game enough.
Hall of fame. Forever."
14938,"This game will not wait for you, it is hard to pick up, but boy oh boy is it a winner! The unique time-difficulty scaling and the fun survivors make for a fantastic game, along with the fact that you can actually mod this game as well AND those mods are compatible with multiplayer! Definitely recommend!"
14939,"It's great with friends, but higher waves might crash your computer."
14940,e
14941,Instant refund for not being controller friendly. This game doesn't have an option for aim assist for controllers for those who want to use a controller for this and are wondering about controller functionality.
14942,"Risk of Boredom 2

The game is overrated.

Spend your money elsewhere."
14943,"Epic Game, countless hours. Repetitive, yet doesn't get boring."
14944,"gooood gam make fun time, yum"
14945,don't forget your beans
14946,good game. even better with friends
14947,.
14948,"good game

update: still a good game"
14949,Bungus forever.
14950,it rained and I forgot my umbrella
14951,This game fun. Recommend. Yes.

14954,gup
14955,very good very fun yes. me play loader me punch yes. me spiderman
14956,its pretty fun
14957,"the difficulty scales over time, and by that I mean I should really stop picking opening every single chest in zone one, but ohhhh is it tempting... this gets bullet hell-ey real fast, on both your side and the enemies'
overall a fun mess of damage values!"
14958,100% achievements in 64 hours. I'm just built different.
14959,"theres no rain yet but the risk is always there i guess

also most runs will end up with you losing the will to go on with how godly you are lmao"
14960,gud
14961,Good game :))
14962,Good game
14963,"This was good, like that one moist sandwich that you will never forget"
14964,no comment. it's just great.
14965,"4.9/5

please delete brass contraptions"
14966,there is no reason for this game's soundtrack to go so hard
14967,"The replayability in this game is insane. I have so much fun every time, trying to get new achievements and have fun. 10/10 would recommend!"
14968,great game
14969,Amazing
14970,"Will willingly play for 4 hours at 2 am, fail the run and do it again the next day. 10/10"
14971,crazy good game
14972,Very fun you should try it out if you enjoy games that are fun.
14973,at one point game becomes alive and starts playing itself. I am watching the game play itself.
14974,my favorite part was
14975,Good game!
14976,This is the best Risk of Rain game of all time
14977,"I start a run and when I look up, 3 hours have suddenly passed."
14978,just learned that Loader is a woman
14979,Good game
14980,yum
14981,"YOU SHOULD OBLITERATE YOURSELF, NOW"
14982,"fun game
"
14983,"Sometimes I have a blast of fun sometimes I hate myself. Great game!
And the fact that there are mods that work in multiplayer and allow achievements is just too good."
14984,"Fun Game
Make sure to drink water on long runs to avoid headaches"
14985,pretty good
14986,This game is addicting.
14987,"Ummm, can I just say, heaven and hell together? <3"
14988,"I feel like I am really going against the grain here, but Risk of Rain 2 is, in my opinion, not nearly as good as people make it out to be. Sure, the game runs reasonably well, the music in the game is fairly good and memorable, and the graphical design is inspired, but that seems to be where my interest ends. The roguelike mechanics of the game are too punishing. For every one good run you get where you get good item drops and good RNG with the bosses you fight, there are five, ten, fifteen runs where you get horrible item drops and bad RNG. Without the right item combos, the characters feel incredibly slow and immobile. The damage output from all but the sweatiest characters is dogwater without the right items to back them up, which you rarely seem to get. Part of the fun of a roguelike comes from the fact that you enjoy losing and look forward to starting your next run, which never seemed to happen for me in Risk of Rain 2. Maybe I am not the right audience for this game, but several other roguelikes that have come out in a similar time period just play much better without the extreme lulls that Risk of Rain 2 seems to have. If you enjoyed this game, that is great, but you will probably enjoy Gunfire Reborn even more. People hold this game on a pedestal like it is this incredible genre defining game, and I really don't see that."
14989,best game
14990,very cool nice game
14991,me like
14992,favourite game of all time 10/10 have forced friends into playing and will force more
14993,"Top tier game, I could die four runs in a row and still want to play another. There is so many different items and characters that you will likely never get bored of this game. 10/10 Love it."
14994,I forgor
14995,may have played a little bit too much after watching markiplier played since 2019
14996,"The new airborne enemies in the latest DLC suck balls, but overall great game. Solid 5/7."
14997,good game :D
14998,It cool. I like. Mithrix? mmm sucky
14999,just shoot em up leamurians look silly
15000,i get 9 fps max on a good day
15001,very fun good 3d rogue like i want the dlc 7/10
15002,Nice.
15003,is good game
15004,Games really smooth and really fun to play.  only real gripe is when playing with others if they dont share loot haha
15005,"Perfect game, I have finally beaten! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlsAKDeoW2U&lc=UgzscC_6iZ1onMK0IGV4AaABAg"
15006,"too many good reviews on this game

its actually kinda bad"
15007,"I'm not sure how I haven't left a review for this game yet, but obviously yes it's amazing and you should buy it. Devs proved with the original that they are masters of fun and replayability and managed to translate that to a 3D sequel almost flawlessly."
15008,there wasn't any rain
15009,"You start up this game with a few impressions of the game, like the art style or whatever. You then end up finding out about Achievments and try for 20 hours of playtime to push thoese 20 fucking crabs off of the cliff. But then you find out it's the best addition to any game ever and you can start overdosing on virtual cocaine every time you walk out of that drop pod. This game after stage 10 feels like an absolute acid trip and has cost me 5 blue screens already. 10/10 would inejct and bluescreen again"
15010,"This game is amazing. I love the characters, game play, and most importantly I love how each run is different. It makes it easy to play for an hour, die, and just load up another run. I have to consciously exit the game or else I will spend 5+ hours playing and lose sleep.

10/10 would recommend."
15011,"FOR SURE not one of my favorite games. Default control feels terrible and you feel that really little time was spend on class creation, other than that, quite good game. 6/10"
15012,"Probably my favorite co-op game, really fun systems/items to learn, can't recommend enough."
15013,Just buy this game. Stop reading reviews and just buy it.
15014,It do be raining.
15015,Very glad they were able to make a dlc hoping for more dlcs in the future.
15016,"You either become god or get slapped by a beetle sneezing on you, 10/10 would die to being eaten by crab orb again."
15017,GOOD SOUP.
15018,"i like it
"
15019,"Fun game to waste time or play with friends, only complaint is somewhat wonky online."
15020,Honestly this game is so worth it. Get it!
15021,The real final boss of the game is your processor
15022,"11/10, would have my healing disabled by a malachite resulting in my immediate death again."
15023,"yes
"
15024,"this is one of the greatest games probably to reach planet earth. I don't even care what the aliens are playing, because they don't have Risk of Rain 2. I remember coming home almost every day in middle school and just absolutely destroying every hour i had on the original title.  I am not graduated and still playing risk of rain titles. Dont even get me started on how many people i ranted to when i saw the leaks for the second title years ago. its very embarrassing. Huge shocker to everyone i knew when the second game came out and ive been doing the exact same thing ever since. I still cannot believe it is a real game that i can hop on and play at any time because i still feel like it came out yesterday. thats how you know they did a good ass job at making a game. Im 100% certain that they spent many hours of love, creativity, and work into this game coming into reality from a few pictures posted to the internet. Now that gearbox is on it they are really unstoppable. i cannot wait to see what comes in the future for hopoo games, but hopefully it is only success and the loads of love that they deserve. i have never been a huge follower of game studios until now but i am so glad i have been along for the ups and downs of ror2 and cannot wait to see the continued development of my favorite game on planet earth. we all <3 you hopoo games (and chris the wonderful writer of the beautiful soundtrack) life goes on but risk of rain stays in my steam library"
15025,lots of content and even far more  if  youre willing to hunt secrets. multiple endings. addicting gameplay. easy to pick up. can sit down and play for hours or just get a quick run in. cant go wrong with your money
15026,soda machine
15027,This game is just goated with the sauce.
15028,Great game with tons of different play styles via the various survivors. If you like CoD Zombies this may be a title for you because its a similar style with hordes of enemies that get progressively stronger as you do. very different setting though with a lot to learn and do. Looking forward to sinking many more hours into this game.
15029,"if you like rougelikes, you will LOVE this game, fun characters, challenges to unlock said characters are able to be completed by just about anyone if you learn how to play the game well, and overall a really fun game, especially with friends :)"
15030,Becoming one of my favorites
15031,"fun  game, a lot of cool aspects"
15032,"fune gayme
"
15033,it only rains once tjis game fucking sucks -100000/10 dont install
15034,"Excellent sequel to the first RoR, with great gameplay and lots of content. Continuous support from the developer too. Recommended! (9/10)"
15035,pretty gud
15036,"Risk of Rain 2 is an amazing Roguelike/Shooter style game with amazing visuals, music and gameplay. If you are looking for something flashy, addictive and fun definitely give it a try."
15037,nice
15038,10 Out of 10 would recommend
15039,its good
15040,"Extremely fun, this is the most hours I've put into a game on steam. There are a few difficulty levels to let you tune your experience to your comfort (don't listen to all the people who insist you play Monsoon only), and the amount of secrets and additional content to discover and unlock are extremely fun and engaging. It feels like they perfectly avoided feeling grindy and made it feel rewarding to unlock new stuffs. 10/10"
15041,"This game is difficult, and it will kick you while your down, until you figure out strategies and/or brute force your way through. You will lose, you will die, and you will repeat."
15042,gaming
15043,rougelike are good. game are good. good rougelike is super good. good game are super good. this is good rouglike and good game. so that mean it is very good
15044,worth it
15045,Great game :)
15046,So much replay value. Great game and look forward to more.
15047,"amazing and addicting game, never rained though."
15048,Risk of Getting one shot by a brass contraption. Love this game!
15049,"So good.
Really, stop reading, buy this game
and the DLC too for the crimes of waiting this long."
15050,Great
15051,"great game, must have friends, boring solo, tons of replay value if with friends"
15052,death
15053,"As a mainly FPS player i can say that this game has a lot to offer, different characters, high skill cap, getting lost in the game for hours at a time on just one run.

This game is AWESOME"
15054,Bungus.
15055,"crazy game, difficulty scale goes from hard to hard to ""____ has been erased"" or your game crashes, every achievement unlocks items, multiplayer is chaos, basically an ight game."
15056,"This game never gets old. Weather I am playing alone to pass the time, or having a blast with friends. The DLC also just makes it even better adding more difficulty to the game. I was strongly recommend you play this game."
15057,"Very fun game, had a blast the whole time with very little downtime in it."
15058,"One of my top 3 games of all time. Super simple, yet it delivers extremely varied gameplay that makes replayability nearly infinite. I have just started trying to unlock every ability for every hero and the challenge has changed the whole game for me 10/10
"
15059,good
15060,"play game, life good"
15061,is fun
15062,cool game
15063,"Trust me, one of the best games ever made."
15064,Risk of drain
15065,"Get Items, Shoot Things, Murder Things, Get Money. Just like America"
15066,fun
15067,Really fun game. If you enjoy borderlands type looting and shooting. It's a tad similar. Tons of fun little quirts and challenging bosses. Great with friends.
15068,"nice game is good yes

15076,its a great game its very challenging though which is one of the big charms of this game
15077,Killer soundtrack that came with an addicting game
15078,"Fun game, gets stale after a while, but the modding scene is huge, there are so many mods for every single aspect of the game, devs are pretty cool as well"
15079,"This is probably the best roguelike on the market, if you have any doubts about buying this game then id tell you to ignore them and enjoy one of the best games I have ever played."

15097,Good game is very good!!
15098,I think this is the first time I have enjoyed being on the other side of bdsm.
15099,"In a sea of roguelikes, Risk of Rain 2's gameplay loop is what you'd expect from the genre, and with that gameplay loop in mind, I initially was worried for what the co-op play would be like. As expected, it is a pretty big problem. Players able to snatch multiple items from the boss, and then not being able to trade items to the other players. I think if this game added more in the way of co-op it could shape up to be a good game, perhaps great (think reviving downed players, or being able to trade with your friends if you accidentally pick up multiples of the same item). But what you get from this game is just sort of an all over the place mess. In one of my friend's words, it's ""more fun to think about than play"" which I would wholeheartedly agree with. The main game up until the final boss is pretty meh, nothing spectacular happening there. 

Spoilers for final boss below.
[spoiler] The final stage though is almost legitimately unfair with it's damage-scaling, with the enemies that you encounter in the stage not even worth fighting as they are literally just damage sponges that can tank more damage than you could ever put out without killing yourself in the process. That's not even mentioning the final boss fight which is the most piss-poor excuse for a boss fight I've seen in a while. Mythrix's attacks are hard to handle, and not in a good way. So much so that if you're in the air at any given moment for one attack, you're pretty much instantly dead. This, paired along with his cringe inducing ""bad boy"" dialogue that's spammed and the fact that he often will just attack thin air, but when he actually manages to hit you through some bullshit makes for a frustrating, not even rewarding to complete boss. [/spoiler]

This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the game, a third person item-collecting roguelike is a very interesting concept. But the enjoyment that I DID get out of the game is vastly overshadowed by enemies being able to one-shot you for no particular reason other than ""haha you've spent 45 mins on this game already, wouldn't it be funny if we deleted all your progress?""
Until they add a reason to actually play co-op (such as, I dunno... making it so that when you get killed you have a short period to be rescued by your teammates) and/or fix the damage scaling mechanic I give this game a thumbs down, as it is just not enough fun to play for what you're doing."
15100,game is amazing and a must have for any roguelike fan but really just reviewing to save current playtime.
15101,"excellent game, fuck brass contraptions tho"
15102,"[h1]Makes a 2 hour long run feel like 20 minutes[/h1]
[b]I wish i was joking[/b]
But this game has it all
You wanna have fun on ez pz mode and be practically immortal? Sure!
You wanna get murdered in 1 and a ½ seconds because you forgot to look out? Sure, we got that too

You want to use meme-builds, item stacks and have cheats? The game has built-in ""cheats"" [spoiler]called runes, they change anything you might want, even extra challenges[/spoiler]

I can warmly recommend this game, regardless if you are a casual 20 min afternoon player, or a 3 hour long challenge run marathon man.
Has co-op too, play with friends in any VC program of your choice, cordinate, wreck havoc, die miserably to a fire elemental ant."
15103,POG GAME
15104,"If you enjoy RPGs, Shooters, gambling, and repeatedly dying, you will certainly enjoy this game. I advise the buyer of only this--movement speed. You need it."
15105,It is a fun game. I think it is more fun with friends than solo. I would suggest using the Wiki to learn about the different items. Game isn't overly hard or easy. Pet the frog 5 times.
15106,Game is fun as hell but very VERY hectic. You like games that know how to make you busted if you got the time and commitment but also know how to very quickly show you how fast you can die inbetween bursts of lag? This is for you! Only thing that could probably make this a whole lot better would be steam workshop support for mods
15107,"Finally, rain in 3D."
15108,"Its ok

Generally balanced, but many unlockables have very, very large variations in the degree of difficulty it takes to unlock them, so much so that I'm positive many players will not unlock certain ones

This is quite a strange choice given the small number of unlockable items, and many characters core skills being locked

Mercenary is probably the worst character because you have to play prismatic trials to unlock his skills. just garbage

the core game is solid and because the items are so flexible the gameplay doesn't get too repetitive"
15109,Makes you feel like a god until a lizard kills you
15110,"Honestly the best roguelite I've ever played. It's 3D which is really cool but the best part about this game compared to other roguelites is the control you have as a player. Stages and items are still random but things like scrappers/printers, the bazaar between time and multishop terminals give you still a bit of control. Its quite the learning curve but you'll get there in no time. There are tons of cool items to find, use and combine and honestly no run is the same. There are numerous secrets and realms to find and when you've finally found them all there's endless new ways to experience the game. Different characters, different gamemodes and modifiers for your runs. Fun with friends but alone is great too. 

That aside I'm still salty about the unkillable Scavenger with medkits and Bens raincoat on my first mosoon Acrid run :/"

15117,"One of the best games I've seen, it seems like a fighting game at first, but after a few runs it becomes a religion.

Also get mods for it through thunderstore"
15118,"Numbers go up? Yes. 
But can they go even higher? YES!
Easy? Somewhat. You need to get gud with your movement and you're set!

Great game to sink some time in for a good hour and just grind your way through waves upon waves of monsters. I would say it's a bit less forgiving than most roguelike games even from the get go (I spawned on top of a fire beetle and died in just 7 seconds so that's fun lol), But you can play it on an easier difficulty if it's a bit harsh for you (I'd say if if you're struggling at stage 3 consistently maybe you'd lower it down for awhile until you're comfortable).

**EDIT: Although I forgot to mention this, I will say that Mithrix (aka the final boss) is quite the tough boss even after beating him thrice. So it's quite understandable if you did lower your difficulty because of him as he does feel unfair to fight against certain characters and certain builds after a certain point. 

The RNG can somewhat turn people away from this game as you can never guarantee a build that you like will be done in a run but I would say how you make of what you're thrown with is what adds to the fun of it (unless you loop it until you get what you want but by then your enemy isn't the mobs but your frames dropping with how many mobs that are bound to spawn by then).

There are a variety of classes to play and I will say the weakest one is the commando but ONLY if you don't know how the game works yet but all other classes are fun and unique in their style and power fantasy.

Although you can play mindlessly and just hack, slash, shoot or spit your way through the mobs, but if you're TRULY interested in really making your DPS or DEEPS go up in a variety of ways, then I truly recommend reading up on how the items work and installing these two mods through the Thunderstore Mod Manager which can help TREMENDOUSLY such as:

- BetterUI by XoXFaby
- ItemStatsMod by ontrigger

Those two are really helpful and don't really change but just improve your experience of it along the way as the item descriptions are a bit vague. 

And since we're already talking about mods, Other mods I would wholeheartedly recommend are:

- SettMod by lemonlust ( Really well thought out mod that just works beautifully aside from pummeling a few bosses! )
- Goku by kingginryov ( Takes a bit of time to get used to but it gets real good real quick, plus you got the DRIP )
- QoLChests ( Now I would've put this on the previous list but part of the challenge of RoR2 is being quick on your feet and your eyes as well, so this is more for a truly casual experience of not wanting to be paranoid if you left a chest or two behind )

I've only played the base game so I can't say anything about the expansion but I've sunk 25 hours in just playing the base version and your curiosity and theory crafting brain will be the limit to how many hours you'll sink in this amazing game!"
15119,"Video games are nice because they let you do things you'd never be able to do in real life.

15123,"Game is awesome and challenging!

Love the progression and level design, to me it never gets old with challenging designed monsters and bosses.

Powerups are King! Collect them all!"
15124,"I like the idea of coop, but this game is just too shallow and repetitive. Spawn on a map, shoot 500 enemies, teleport, shoot 500 more enemies, repeat, repeat, repeat until you and your team dies = new high score. 

Combat is boring, just jump and hold down the attack button for hours on end. On the first day I bought this I genuinely fell asleep playing it, which was bad, because it meant I exceeded the 2 hour playtime and couldn't get a refund. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for it."

Gameplay: 9/10 - Really fun to replay and perfectly challenging, only not a 10 cause there is some BS (ahem, Collapse, Void Seeds)
Soundtrack: 10/10 = Chris Christodoulou. Enough said.
Graphics: not really a factor you can rate, but it looks fantastic imo
Maps (I'm running out of things to mention): 8/10 - Very good overall, some annoying ones like the Sulfur Pools

Conclusion: Hell fucking yeah, buy this now. This is a threat.

15139,"Way too addicting.
You'll be dying a lot though so don't stress too much if you think you're not progressing at all - it took me 150 runs to beat the game for the first time.
Has scuffed multiplayer which is arguably even better than normal multiplayer."

15142,"RoR 2 is one of the best coop action rougelikes out there and one of my favorite games.

It's gameplay is phenomenal as well as the soundtrack. The amount of variety this game hold in it's replay value is amazing especially with the new SoTV expansion. Not only that. It has a healthy and amazing modding community that adds countless hours of content that can be enioyed with friends or a discord community. 

Can't wait to see what's next for the coming updates.

Definitely recommend getting at full price. Best played with friends but still extremely enjoyable by yourself

15145,thought i was a raid boss... died in .001234 seconds.
15146,"I bounced off RoR 1 pretty hard, but the extra dimension in this game adds a lot to the experience.  You'll likely feel confused and a bit directionless for a few hours, but it'll eventually click (a few streams or tips thread will help with that too). Wholly recommended, and the DLC is super worth it too."
15147,"Personally I have found myself lately becoming very angry while I play Battle Royale games. My days used to be filled with getting home from work, starting my PC, and just being... mad... while I played video games for 3 hours in an effort to calm down. I was reaching a boiling point of dissatisfaction with a hobby which I identify myself with strongly and I began to feel dread as that identity seemed to clash with my outlook on gaming. Why was gaming, which has such a profound place in my life, which was meant to bring me the most joy, making me feel so miserable?

Enter Risk of Rain 2. A friend that I just had gotten closer with asked me if I wanted to play Apex together sometime, and I embarrassingly had to tell him that I didn't want to play a BR with him because I can get a bit toxic in the heat of the moment, and didn't want to accidentally hurt his feelings or leave him with the wrong impression. So he suggested Risk of Rain 2 and gifted it to me for us to play together. I logged 50 hours that week.

I have re-found my love for gaming in the nice long runs as the 4 time heavyweight boxing champion of the universe, Loader and in the ""Peekabo I'm behind you"" back stabs with Bandit.  Yes - I still get mad by some BS death to a lemurian, a lesser wisp, or those STUPID rats that joined the fray in the latest DLC, but I just get to start all over again and think of fun new builds I can try with my next attempt. Suddenly the only people in my lobby are all trying to beat down the same enemies as me, rather than trying to end my game prematurely. Suddenly I'm [b]happy[/b]. 

This game is great. The soundtrack is awesome, the gameplay is so fun, the builds are diverse, and the community is full of wonderful people. I love Risk of Rain 2, and I think you'll love it too."

15151,"Survived 10 different defense objectives and beat the final boss with ease, and I die because the final defense objective had to be another wait and the moon detonated. Wasted 70 minutes just for that? Not worth it."

15155,"Risk of Rain 2 is a very good game. There are lots of cool unique characters to play as, I like Mul-T because he turns into a car and you can run over enemies just like how my grandfather ran over 13 kindergarteners crossing the road back in 1983. My biggest gripe with the game is that there was, unfortunately, no risk of rain (2). It's a good thing there was shredded half naked man with a hammer at the end or I would have left a negative review."

15161,"This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. There's so much to do, it's incredibly replayable, and it is immensely fun with friends. Modding this game opens up even more possibilities. I really hope this game becomes another Binding of Isaac, having a ton of DLC and so many different enemies, items, endings, survivors that each run will be entirely different from the last. Cannot recommend this enough."
15162,Fantastic game! With the addition of the new Survivors of the void DLC I cannot stop playing!
15163,"If you like video games in which you murder everything as quickly as possible before they murder you, collecting a vast array of unique power ups, all while trying to ""escape"" a planet that progressively gets better at killing you until it either succeeds in finality or you murder a god, Risk of Rain 2 is for you. 

Simple yet stylish art style, a great cast of unique and fun characters to play and unlock, 4 player online co-op, a boat load of unique items and effects that can make runs feel different and make you feel like an invincible hell beast, and even a budding modding scene. Plus some lore that gets into that cosmic high fantasy that really needs to be explored by other games. 

It's a rougelike, but a fun one. Plus you get a Ukulele. What's not to like?"

15175,"There's a fair amount to the game, but I just find the core gameplay to be far too boring. Also for a game that tells you to ""play fast"" it sure has some time wasting bugs. Ive heard endless praise about the game so as I played I tried to push away how boring it was, as I was sure as I unlocked more characters and played more, I would eventually enjoy it.
Unfortunately that never really happened, I've all the base survivors now and beat a few on monsoon. I only did it to get more time out of the game. I can't say at any point I was having fun, I really did try. It's not ""bad"" but it sure isn't anything close to what I've heard about it."
15176,"Genuinely one of the best rogue likes I've ever played, I played the first game on a school laptop back in 2018 and I fell in love immediately.

15248,"In risk of rain 2, you start out as an idiot with a gun, and over the course of 6 or more levels you continue being said idiot with a gun but now using your favorite item as a gateway drug and having so many of them that you are physically unable to live without it. The gameplay loop consists of you stealing people's amazon packages until you can find a teleporter to get you closer to the sweet release of death or some sad idiot with sibling issues. Difficulty increases with time, so you'll find yourself either doing a hectic impromptu speedrun or perishing. It's very easy to die and the game gets incredibly chaotic at later levels, so you better hope you got yourself some tougher times or you are going to violently explode the moment the difficulty reaches impossible. Luckily stacking items can get you some ridiculous benefits. Building characters can get really insane.
Build highlights include:

- purity go brrr
- my blood has been replaced with syringe
- bungus
This game also moves from a 9.5/10 to a 69haha/10 when you play with friends. Get a buddy or two and you will find yourselves giggling like idiots at 3am joking about REX's relationship status while you decimate anything that breathes.

15260,"[b]Risk of Rain 2[/b] is one of those cases where the transition to [b]3D[/b] actually enhanced the experience, though not without its awkward moments as the devs have admitted when translating characters from the prior entry to this one.

But over-all it has been a solid and thoroughly enjoyable experience even solo as I tend to play most of my games that way, though of course with friends the experience is further made even more fun as you'd communicate with everyone to try and distribute items to where they need to go to be able to push further and further into your runs.

The [b]DLC[/b] that has come in has been a blast to play with the new items and characters both old and new, definitely will be looking forward to anything else the devs have got cooking up.

Though if you haven't already check out the first entry, as it is $10 as of this review, if you're curious where this game has come from and have the spare cash to splurge with. Highly recommend both!"

15268,"As the game I played the absolute most in 2021 this game was probably the best game of the year for me personally. Combining elements of randomness but a feeling of ascending godhood is a feeling i havent felt from a good game in a long time until this game kicked me in the nuts over and over again with its Monsoon difficulty. What a fantastic game, thats all i have to say."

WELL GUESS WHAT, you're dead kiddo, you picked up this game and thought you were some hot shot, gonna play Monsoon huh. No, you piece of shit. You're about to realize fear, the kind that has you shittin blood. Here's how it'll go: First, you'll confident. Then... you'll fear... you will realize mortality and that only reason you haven't died is because you're not meant to... yet. Next, confusion ""What killed me?!??!"" followed by a cosmic pounding delivered by Dwayne the Rock Johnson (the guy from fortnite) himself. Lastly, tears... and godDAMN they will flow, like the dueling rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates. I'm so sorry, sweet sweet child, you weren't ready, none of us were...."

There is somewhat of a skill gap but just playing the game will get you better. If your thinking about buying it then just comp it.

15329,"Got this as a gift from a friend, and loved it so much that I bought the DLC, and don't regret it a second. All the characters are great with their unique strenghts, weaknesses and playstyles in some way or another, even slightly customizable by unlocking additional talents through achievements, and even then it's truly the items that will define how you're going to be playing or building your spec. While it is definitely fun by oneself... as with most things, it truly shines with friends, and despite being repetitive it doesn't get old fast. Either way, chaotic fun is guaranteed!"

15341,Game is very beautiful with great feeling controls. Good gunplay and great variety of items makes replay very appealing. What sells the most has to be the soundtrack though. Composer went above and beyond for this game. Solid 8.5/10. Grab some friends and get clapped by some mobs.

I think multiplayer could use a little help with high ping and mode formatting, but this is a predominantly single player game (the original being ONLY single player) which is easily in the upper echelon of Rogue-Likes/Lites."

Risk of Rain 2 is the Risk of Rain 2 of Roguelikes.

- I've put over a hundred hours into this game and I'll probably put in a hundred more. 
- Few games go from 0-1000 as quickly as RoR.
- Few games put me in ""the zone"" like RoR. 
- No other game has a soundtrack that comes close. Chris, you are an alien my friend!
- Few games make me force myself to stop playing because 4 hours have just passed and the sun is coming up..... 

Even after 100 hours I still love this game, and it still blows my mind. 

Hopoo Games, you guys are truly wonderful."

15384,great game
15385,This game has badass music and challenging play styles. Each different character is like playing a whole new game. Also there is no checkpoints
15386,"One of the biggest turnoffs with Rogue-Likes for me is how they prioritize luck and mental math over actual gameplay. Very few people find that fun and even fewer find it more enjoyable than nearly any other type of game. They have their niche and I do try to enjoy them, but going to practically any other genre is a drastic improvement.
Risk of Rain 2 is one of the few examples of that not being the case, though. Almost entirely because of the artifacts (game modifiers) and diverse character selection. It plays like an actual video game which is much more than most Rogue-Likes can offer.

7/10, absolutely worth a try if you enjoy Rogue-Likes with actual gameplay."

15431,"This game is an absolute blast with friends. Not only Risk Of Rain has a ton of fun characters to choose from, Risk also has a lot of replayability, especially with friends. Runs will not always be the same and you get to control how you play the game whether it be through stages you choose, you want to run artifact commands or if you wanted to, you can even mod the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that really likes Roguelike / hack and slash games. The music in this game is also absolutely amazing."
15432,"Great game, fun af rogue, no contest with a lot of others games. Only issue as of now, people are acutally hacking in the game, resetting their skills instantly, and doing all kinds of wonky stuff, if the games gets easy as you build you're character, why tf would you hack it? Is there like no ""bottom"" for pathetic?"

But I've seen it.
Perhaps they just haven't played it long enough, but after 120+ hours, I now realise something.

I've seen lightning fall from a storm cloud of missiles,
I've seen monsters wither under a hail of bullets and my screen flooded with enemies,
I've seen giants frozen by arctic blasts and shatter into a million pieces,
I bring the storm.
I am the rain."
15449,"Hours of fun trying out different builds and characters. It's fun to push the limits of how far you can go and what you can do. I only played the new DLC once but it was a huge rebalancing patch and has added hours and hours of more content. Play this game if you like rogue-likes, lots of action with a build-centric style and lots of strafing and dodging."

-Han-D still sleeping"
15486,"Alright, so let me put this game into perspective: this is the kind of game you don't binge. This is a game where you can literally spend infinite hours in a single run if you are good enough. Don't get burnt out.

OK, so this game can be summarized as a semi-rogue-like, with unlockable characters, adorable lore, and a scaling difficulty mechanic based on time in session. Be patient, learn what the items, do, and NEVER. Stop. Moving."
15487,Normalise prog rock/metal in game OSTs
15488,"pretty fun to play alone or with friends,
"
15489,"Risk of Rain 2 is easily the perfect game for people who love the roguelike genre. It features constant action, a variety of playable characters EACH with flexibility for different types of play styles, lots of content to explore, and there's always room to learn. That being said, since the game always has room to learn there's clearly a bit of a learning curve, but not to worry because Risk of Rain 2 also has a GREAT and helpful community to help you out when you need tips or advice. Before I found this game I felt as if and was completely convinced videogames have gotten boring, but after looking for games with roguelike elements with multiplayer capabilities, I was lucky enough to come across this game and from that point on I found the feeling I had been longing for over a long time, an actual DESIRE to hop on and play, and a constant feeling of refreshment of excitement every time I play as if it was the first time I played again. So like I said before, if your looking for a game with roguelike elements and multiplayer capabilities, I recommend this game to you. This is easily a 10/10 game from me."

15502,"With varied insane in-game battles and an outstanding soundtrack, Risk of Rain 2 (including the Survivors of the Void DLC) offers a lot of replayability and allows for some crazy fun game nights, either solo or with a group of friends!

[i]Tracked hours on Steam do not reflect my total overall playtime of this game. I own a second copy of Risk of Rain 2 physically on PlayStation 4.[/i]"
15503,"[b]this game is batsh*t crazy.[/b]

its some of the most fun and varied fun i've had in a roguelike and, as you can see by the hours i have, i can say that with honesty.

ive had runs go on for two hours and still i get one shot out of nowhere and go ""oh well, that one's on me lol""

if a game can have runs go for this long and it doesn't feel bad when you die, thats how you know. yeah, there's times you die and you're upset about it. but isn't that every game?

the items are varied, the new dlc is worth it and when you get better at the game, it feels [i]damn[/i] good

highly recommended, but do yourself a favor and start on drizzle."

15507,this game is rather addictive
15508,These Devs can't even write patch notes.
15509,Its ok game
15510,"Great graphics, great gameplay, great game. What more might you need? To entice you to mayhaps buy this game, here are some pros and cons that I can think of from the top of my head.

Pros:
•Immense replayability. With basically every run being different, and the large selection of paths and items, not to mention the characters, it makes for a great variety; and so, a lot of replayability.

•The playable characters, survivors, have different siills you can unlock via doing challenges for them. Like how commando can get a tactical slide if you beat the first teleporter event before the timer reaches 5 minutes. 

•There are plenty of stages and hidden stages, and all of them look amazing and are all pretty unique

•Most items allow for some really fun builds, and a lot of them are unique. Will O' The Wisp detonates enemies on kill, and so on.

•Enemies are very unique, some being more difficult than others (obviously) and some being very easy to deal with. Wisps are really easy to kill but fly in the air, making them a pain for mercenary.

•Artifacts are game changing mechanics that you can apply before a run, and really change how the game is played. The artifact of command, for example, lets you choose any item of the rarity you get from something, like a chest.

Cons:
•Some items feel as though they're just there to pad out the total number of items, and aren't very unique.

•Doesn't give close to any instructions for most unlocks, requiring most things to be looked up to figure out how to unlock. You CAN always just play for an excessive amount of time to find these things, but if you want to not spend a hundred hours figuring out where the void fields are, you might want to look it up. 


Well, that's about all I have to say. If you haven't bought the game yet, you should. It's basically a must play."

I wasn't really going to stick with the game any further, because i enjoy games which have some way to reduce RNG like dead cells and hades... But then i discovered Artifact of Command.

15570,Game is good. I liked the first Risk of Rain and the jump into 3d has been successful. Being unable to find teleporters after searching everywhere is a frustrating part of the game and I wish there would be some sort of solution for that other than scouring every last square inch of the rather large maps.

15576,"The sign is a subtle joke. The shop is called ""Sneed's Feed & Seed"", where feed and seed both end in the sound ""-eed"", thus rhyming with the name of the owner, Sneed. The sign says that the shop was ""Formerly Chuck's"", implying that the two words beginning with ""F"" and ""S"" would have ended with ""-uck"", rhyming with ""Chuck"". So, when Chuck owned the shop, it would have been called ""Chuck's Fuck and Suck""."

15588,"This game, like any rogue-like, is tempermental and defies any expectation of a smooth learning curve. Under most circumstances I do hate this, but running up to 200 hours, I have the secret to making this game fun in three easy steps

1. Create a public classic lobby. Enable the artifacts of honor and glass (you will have to unlock these, but the process isn't very long) and set the difficulty to Monsoon. Be sure that rules voting is disabled. Democracy is weakness.
2. Recognize that the game is no longer a PvE TPS, but a cooperative psychological horror. People WILL join without reading the rules settings of your lobby. Your role as the lobby owner is to watch them fumble and fall and cope and seethe and mald. You are a scientist with one question in mind: ""Why do people presume they get to have fun in the game you purchased"". Observe people disconnect after getting one-tapped by a flaming lesser wisp. Observe Acrid players not even have a chance to begin play. Try and get into the mind of what your players' goals and motivations are now that they are in a stressful environment. This is the true fun of RoR2.
3. Slowly modify variables. Is a player being just a little too persistent for your liking? Type in the chat ""let's kick this up a notch"" and add two artifacts of your choice. Are players taking too long grinding on the first level and you're getting bored because you already know difficulty scaling swallows the meek? Just activate the tele yourself without warning them as soon as possible. Their expectation of being allowed to play your game is putty in your hands. The most horrifying part is that there will always be new players coming in to replace those who rage quit. 

A very well built rogue like, with unique appeals to humanity's most tyrannical tendencies due to its multiplayer features. 8/10"

15638,good game
15639,"This game is INSAAAANEEE !! 
If u like roguelikes types this game is for you !! 
The game offers so much:
- Huge challenges. 
- The enemies can be so hard as a pain in the butt
- Nice survivors
- Very nice items 
- Many unlocks !! (items/characters/stages/Bosses/etc)
- Superb items build depending on the ""survivors"". You can became a God !  
-Sometimes the learning curve could be so punishable but it´s OK it´s what we expect in a game of this kind.

Overall give it a try to such piece of art. I recommended play it SOLO or CO-OP with friends and make a mess. 
PD : the music it´s just sooo F* Amazing fit it perfectly !! I loved the whole OST"
15640,based
15641,"You better be highly proficient in 3rd person shooters/mouse aiming in general if you plan to play above anything besides easy mode in this game. That being said:

Incredibly well designed roguelike sci-fi universe with VERY diverse characters to play and items to get.
New DLC just added a buncha stuff, its updated all the time and has a huge online playerbase.

buy it, play it, mod it, have a boy."
15642,yes
15643,"I have not found myself getting so invested in a game so quickly as I have with this one. It's a bit confusing at the start if you go in blind, especially if you aren't familiar with Rogue-likes/Rogue-lites, but once you know what you're doing, you have all the freedom to experiment with so many different characters, items, artifacts, loadouts, builds, etc. 

I have yet to play a few of the characters, but of the ones I have played, they all have a unique playstyle, and it doesn't really feel like any one character completely outclasses another one in every aspect. Yes, some are obviously better than others, but IMO the difficulty, items, and characters are very well-balanced. 

One thing that I can see being an issue for some players is the amount of time you have to commit to just one single run. If you aren't playing fast, a normal run can take upwards of an hour, and if you go for some achievements, some can take even close to 2 hours. Some people just don't have that kind of time, and there is no way to pause your run, close the game, and resume it later. If you run out of time, you're forced to abandon the run, unless you want to leave the game open on the pause menu for hours until you get back.

I bought this game completely on impulse, and I can say with 100% certainty that I do not regret it, and I will probably continue to play this game for quite a long time.

Also worth noting: the DLC is 100% worth it, but if you only play with friends, only 1 person needs to have the DLC and can enable it for everyone in the room."

15694,"Risk of Rain 2 does everything a rouge-like should do and even more. It fits the frame perfectly with super fun, intense gameplay. The greatest bullet-hell you'll ever see. it has you coming back for more, more, and more with something new to offer each time. it could be a New survivor one time and another item another. With the recent release of it's DLC, I hope this game will have something very special to offer among the rest. #1 Recommended game of all time (in my opinion). Oh yeah, you can also hop in with some friends to have an absolute BLAST."

Damage over time? Covered, Crit ass? Covered. You can go full thorns damage and it WORKS. Each planet (except the shitty acid pools) makes you feel immersed in a sprawling ecosystem. Beetles, Bison, Jellyfish. KILL EM ALL. If it isn't enough this game is getting continuous content updates at ALL TIMES. PAID DLC AND FREE DLC. If that still isn't enough for your sassy ass.

If it were just that, it would just be a good game, but then when you add all the unlockables and achievements, it ends up in a game you fall in love with and can't stop playing. Would 10/10 recommend this to honestly anybody really, the only thing is that they should be prepared to sink hours on end into this awesome game. Can't wait for more updates!"

15718,"The story of lives. Lives ruined and lost due to the actions of two men, who did not understand the responsibility or gravity of godhood. The seeds of betrayal, unjust justice, and wicked plots. A story of normal people, thrown into the most unknown forces of gods and deities. Men, women, creatures, heretics, and glass frogs. A planet of forced creation, and wretched design. A place unmarked by space, and unheard by sentient life. A savior that imprisons, and a master of bombastic ambition. Blueprinted evil, and incomprehensible danger. Gods entwined with mortal men and women. All under the gauze of rain. The somber tone of the pitter patter of rain. A drizzle. A soft and forgiving storm, calming and welcoming. A rainstorm. A harsh, but manageable barrage of water. A monsoon. The true test of rain, powerful and unforgiving. As those immature gods danced their dance of spite, and tested each other's patience, mortals intervened. They flew their curiosity too close, and paid a gruesome price. As the soul-full savior ran ruin upon the mortal vessel, the humans lost all they had brought. Their tomes and ammo, their goat hooves and teddy bears, all lost to the great false planet. Parasitic tar, flame powered masks, beetle empires, and crabs from another plane. No one was safe, very little survived. And once that vessel fell to the earth below, there happened to be a chance of a storm. A storm of unparalleled strength and fear. A storm brewing, since the betrayal of a brother. A storm of blood, and of pain. There happened to be a risk of rain."

15735,"This is an amazing game that did the roguelike aspects just right. It has a lot of diversity in items and they did a perfect job at making it so the legendary items are good but not overpowered. If you want to, you can always get and enable certain pre-game objects if you're up for the challenge of getting them if you want a new experience or if you're just having some trouble. The game has enough characters, new abilities, items, and builds/synergies that most games feel like a new experience making restarting when dying or quitting still feel fun to go through it again. Amazing game, if you get it I hope you enjoy it as much as I am. Great job Hopoo Games and also the composer for the music Chris for the amazing music."

The level after that I opened one of the chests in front of my group and was instakilled by the box (or an unseen enemy that never spawned in completely).

15786,This game rocks.
15787,"Such an excellent game. Every character needs a different set of items to really shine, and each character has several different builds to explore. I really enjoyed going after achievements, but just playing for the sake of it is equally fun. Both solo play and playing with friends is fun. Multiplayer lobbies are meh because people immediately quit if they die, and people die all the time lol. The void expansion isn't necessary but it adds very engaging mechanics that open up whole new possibilities for builds, so I recommend it heartily."

15796,"I have not played Risk of Rain, but since I have started Risk of Rain 2, I knew that it has a big improvement in gameplsy mechanics and the variety of characters you can use to beay the game. I feel like the game has its potential to continue improving by adding more content and keep us busy.

A roguelike is nothing without content, and I can’t wait to see where Hopoo Games takes this game moving forward, because what they’ve created with the jump from 2D to 3D has been great.


The game runs smoothly on my PC and I have a great time while playing the game. Most of the time, I play with other people online, because I am not that good to play alone or even enjoy the gameplay experience lonely.

I have strongly considered to pick the game when I saw it on sale weeks ago, I bought it with the DLC expansion and I already know that I did not make any mistake by buying it.

I would highly recommend this game to roguelike fans. I would give 9/10."
15797,"You most definitely play this game to transcend into a a perfect being. Regardless of how godlike you become however, you're always reminded that gods can certainly be killed. Tons of fun, if you are on the fence, just do it."

15806,Yes.
15807,The best roguelike ever
15808,"One of my favourite games. Super fun, great with friends, and good content to make you feel overly powerful or screw up your entire run (gotta love lunar and void items). I’m excited to see more. If you haven’t already, check out the first Risk of Rain, as it is also incredible. My rating? Bungus/10"
15809,"This game has caused me more sleepless nights out of pure anger than any I've ever played. Losing a run to an unseen foe or an oversight on your part, like thinking that the halcyon seed instakills the third phase of the final boss after 20 stages (I cried real tears). This game has never made me rage quit, it makes me mad to have been killed by an overloading brass contraption, but never enough to really stop playing the game. This is something that has never really been achieved by other rogue-lites I've played, this game is fun enough to make you forget, even for a couple moments, that you're trying your hardest not to die."

15819,The game original had a base plate of pre-formulated Amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with a panometric fan. The line up consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzel veins so fitted to the ambofacent lunar wane shaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.

15838,Yes
15839,gup <333333333
15840,The best rogue-like game you could purchase right now.
15841,Risk of Rain is fantastic.  Risk of Rain 2 is fantastic in 3D.  Once you've mastered Risk of Rain 2 the DLC is there to reinvigorate the game and give you renewed fun.  Definitely worth your time to the tune of a few... hundred hours.
15842,"As a single player game, it's a pretty fun time. As a multiplayer game, it's awesome. I've played this a ton with my siblings as a way to keep in touch when we're several hundred miles away. Would definitely recommend if you have some time and some friends to play with. It's very fun to get a bunch of items that synergize with each other and your character. Expect to fail even on the easy mode for a little, especially if you're not used to this style of game. The DLC is also a great time! If you're playing multiplayer and one person has the DLC, everyone will be able to play with the items, so that's a nice plus.

I do have some gripes though...
- Dying to a void reaver explosion feels pretty dumb. One second you're doing just fine and then all of a sudden you're dead.
- When playing multiplayer, dying feels REALLY bad. Everyone else keeps playing the stage while you go get a coffee, and then when you move on to the next stage you're super underleveled and everyone else on your team is a little overleveled, so you usually end up just dying again. I wish there was something you could do after you died to contribute or keep leveling up, even if it was just a little thing.
- Lunar coins are an alright idea, but are a little off. I don't use them in my bad runs because I want to save them all up for when I get a really good run, but when I get a really good run I don't actually need them and so I save them for next time.

Gripes aside, I've played this game a bunch and had a great time. I definitely would buy it again."
15843,gud
15844,"Properly optimized. Graphically simple, but equally gorgeous. Gameplay is delicious. Replayability is endless. You'll never have the exact same playthrough twice in a row. Fun solo and fun with friends AND fun with randoms. A decent roster of playable characters and the roster has been growing gradually since release. I recommend to everyone who enjoys a good rogue-like/looter."

first DLC doesn't have that much content for 15$

Wish the game was more modable - seems like there should be TONS of mod content like maps and enemies, but is mostly just characters and skins
Favorite mod added rouglite mechanics but has since been abandoned...

15870,"Even if you don't care for roguelites, this'll be a fun experience."
15871,"Spaceship crash survivors scrounge local countryside for random junk and cover themselves in a bunch of goofy shit. Proceed to go on a murderous rampage, committing mass genocide and killing God in the process."
15872,"This is one of those games I always come back to. (especially when there is new content.)

I highly recommend it, it seriously has endless replay value and is amazing with friends. 

One last thing I hear there is mods. Haven't personally messed with them but saw a stone titan get body slammed so I mean... might wanna check it out."
15873,"Easily one of the best games on Steam. This game is the EPITOME of Roguelike with mountains of content including a good selection of playable characters that all have very unique play styles and abilities (With alternate abilities you can unlock), an astronomical amount of items that have a very wide range of effects some of which will completely change the way you play a certain character, and tons of different enemies that keep you on your toes. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who might be interested in it. 

On top of all of this, the new DLC that just dropped expands on what this game already brings to the table by increasing items, playable characters, maps, enemies, and a boss fight. It's completely optional and if you're unsure then start with the base game. Of the 229 hours I currently have clocked only a fraction of it has been with the DLC. The replay-ability of this title, even at it's base, is far superior to anything I've come across which is something I value highly in a game.

All in all it's hard to pick anything in particular that I had issue with in this game. After the hours I've put in I never had any game breaking issues (If I did it was my own fault running swarms, sacrifice, and command loading up on 64 energy drinks) and It wasn't ever a dull moment. When you start to feel like you truly understand a character, the game throws a new random set of items your way that shows you a whole different pathway you never took that particular character down before or a new way to get completely cracked one shotting bosses with what might have previously been a mediocre ability.

I know this review was just fan girling, but I genuinely believe this game has a lot to offer and it's worth the $24.99 price tag, especially when you compare that tag to new releases such as BF2042 that released at a full AAA price. Give it shot!

Very easy to pour a lot of time into, but deaths often feel very cheap -- unavoidable one-shots, ignition ticks going on longer than intended, more than a single stack of collapse, etc... these are annoyances that definitely feel like balance issues on the part of the developers, but the game is still great.

16021,"The best rogue-like I've ever played, hands down. Easy to pick up, hard to master, nearly infinite replay value. It also has a very active and high-quality modding scene.

16031,Incredibly fun game. Worth every penny.
16032,"i really like how the game has artifacts and multiple ways of playing and testing fun ways to bend the rules in your way, my favorite gamemode is the simulacron because of the artifact of sacrifice combined with the artifact of command with the artifact of swarms"

16041,"nice game, many options"
16042,while tricky it's certainly complex and challenging . you never know if your gonna be lucky or if the game will slaughter you without mercy over and over. gameplay is fluid and nice do to the way it works. lunar coins are stored forever unless you use them a nice perk and occasionally you start with money other times you don't. many of the bosses are hard too but doable and beatable even on normal difficulty XD
16043,"this game really good, would not recommened playing on windows bootcamp though, you get 5 frames at a time :D"

16085,"makes you feel like a god after being in a run for 4h and then dying to a random elder lemurian, good game 👌"
16086,"This is my favorite rogue-lite of all time. It is the only game that I can think of that maintains its challenge whilst also becoming a god of absolute destruction. The excellent soundtrack also helps to egg you on during runs. All of the characters feel distinct and offer different gameplay experiences. Also, Risk of Rain 2 has a very robust modding scene which helps when things start to get stale."
16087,you died

Not to mention its really nice how the lore to this game finally ties everything up."
16101,better than hentai
16102,awesome
16103,"TL;DR Good game, fun quick experience, very nice devs. Try it if you want, I'm not your parent XD 

Amazing game. I absolutely love the music, and for a 3d rougelite, it is very well made. I definitely recommend you check it out and give it a try. The developers have been really nice and generous with their updates, both in price and in content. They have not disappointed. Even the music creator, Chris Christodolou (I hope I spelled it right) interacts so nicely with his community and sounds like a really nice person."
16104,this game will consume your soul and traumatize you
16105,"Each game is different than the last, one of the best roguelike games"
16106,"I don't usually like single player games, but this is so damn stimulating, I love it, and am very addicted"
16107,the game was too easy got all acheivements in 10 minutes
16108,"Its a good game, if you like rougelikes youll probably like this."
16109,i approve
16110,game
16111,This game is dog water if you want to rage play this game with friends they will just take all of your items and then flame you when you do no dmg this game is just the same thing over and over and over dont download dont recommend waste of money just but league skins.
16112,"Rest in peace commando, you will be missed...."
16113,"Used to be fun a year or two ago but now its completely different. One of the best item combinations is completely ruined and is still making the game less fun than when they were put in. Dont believe the reviews stating its amazing. It has serious issues that will never be fixed because the devs got their money and their praise and they cannot be wrong. And after all this time I still never do the final boss because its meaningless and the worst fight in the game by far. Seems like the game went downhill after the offical release.

Look at how much time ive put in, half of it was running around doing nothing, 25 percent was fun, thats it. And RNG with artifacts WILL RUIN your fun no matter what, very sad to see one of my favorite games go the route of no fun but that seems common for games today."
16114,10/10

16125,One of my all-time favourites. Endlessly replayable.
16126,is ver gud and fun
16127,you've never truly experienced this game until your frames drop below 20.

16135,if you like rogue-like games you'll definently enjoy this game. Its got a great community there's a bunch of characters u can choose from and unique items u can find its definitely worth the money
16136,one of the best games i ever played
16137,is cool
16138,"You oneshot everything untill something oneshots you

16139,This game is really fun and traverse but the one thing that i'm not a huge fan of is the new void bubbles and the constant repetitive maps.
16140,"Infinitely re-playable, immensely fun, and every detail is well thought out. Couldn't recommend it more"
16141,"I am clay weapons templar, and THIS is my weapon. She weighs 150 kg and fires 200 lunar coin, custom dual clay pellets at 10,000 rounds per minute.

It costs 400,000 lunar coins to fire this weapon for twelve seconds.

Oh my god, who touched Sasha?! Alright, who touched my clay cannon!?

Some people think they can outsmart me...Maybe....*sniff*...Maybe.....

16143,Was unsure to get it or not until a friend got it for me and holy shit is this game worth it!! Very fun game
16144,CAUSE ITS SUCH A GREAT ROGUELITE BROOOOO
16145,"excellent
"
16146,"This game is pretty fun, especially with a lot of rouge style games appearing these days; it still holds up. I do not have the DLC. 
The only major complaint i have with this game is balancing. You can have a ton of damage, a ton of healing, or a ton of defence while still being able to be randomly ONE shoted. You can be easily running through a level, being hit by all kinds of things, then out of nowhere BAM. There are situations where you could be taking on a boss, not taking much damage then the attack you have taken 5 times gets ya from full health. Otherwise very enjoyable."
16147,"The base game is difficult, but fair. The game play is very unique, and the graphics look stunning. You can tell the artists put alot of thought and care into this game."
16148,"This game is fun, replayable and chaotic. Good to play by yourself and with friends. 10/10 would recommend."
16149,"Get some friends together, you'll have a great time with this game."
16150,hours of fun destroyed by standing still for one second
16151,"Its just... Its just good. Absolutely worth the price, no doubt. If you like rogue-likes, this is a must have."
16152,Yes.
16153,Low cost but extremely fun and repayable
16154,"Fun, chaotic and replayable. As long as you don't mind there being no ""save&quit"" feature, this game will suck away hours of your time on end. Also, you can play with friends!"
16155,best :)
16156,"wow
its a good game lol"
16157,fucking almost perfect rouge like game 9.5/10
16158,"I love this game, but there are some issues I don't understand gameplay wise:

Why are half of the green items so useless? Sometimes I will play a run and end up with 7 pieces of green scrap, or even worse.....get a bandolier after a boss fight. War horn gives you a speed boost when you use your equipment........ paul's goat hoof gives you a speed boost at all times, like who designed this? The porcupine gives an attack speed boost with a critical hit up to 3..........the syringe gives you a permanent attack speed boost, and this item is supposed to be lower on the hierarchy. Honestly there are so many more, Ghor's tome, lepton daisy, wax quail, rose buckler, red whip, will o wisp. Compare these to Infusion, Ukelele, missile launcher, fire/ice bands and leeching seed and they are not even close.  

Speaking of the green scrap, there are almost never any green scrap machines, I can tell because they added a regenerating green scrap as an item and I have used it three times out of twenty runs where I got it. Also when they added the new update, they didn't add any healing items. This has thrown the item balance tremendously off, where you will have almost no healing items and tons of damage items.

Otherwise, they really just need to fix the item balancing, because there will also be many runs where you don't even get a single red or yellow item. The yellow items really don't make sense, why do we not automatically receive these after every boss fight? There might be some condition to meet to get one after a boss fight, but if so that is so dumb, because it is like ""Hey, you couldn't beat the boss quick enough because your items are trash, here have a war horn, that should help"".

Otherwise, this game is pretty epic. They nailed the transition from 2D to 3D, and the gameplay always leaves me coming back for more which is why I have noticed these problems. For the price of the game, it is definitely worth it and the dlc. They put a lot of effort into this game and it shows, because there is a ton of content in this game. I am going to try and just create a mod honestly where I adjust the item settings, there may be one already out there. 

Overall, great game."
16159,Best soundtrack and the best game play a game can offer
16160,worth it just to make up new names for the items with your friends and then repeating the new name every run
16161,"If you want to escape reality, play this game."
16162,shits bussin' respectfully
16163,did 31 trillion damage in one hit and still got 1-shot by a low tier mob
16164,pc go boom boom
16165,"um so how do I say this?

YOU PLAY AS A LEAN FIEND"
16166,"It's difficult for a new game to catch my interest, let alone keep it. My roommate told me I had to try it and just went and bought it for me. I'm so glad he did. I cannot wait to play it again after each session."
16167,cause why not

great game"
16175,"Overall Rating: [b]9.5/10[/b]
Gameplay: 10/10
Story: 9/10 -There's no campaign but the world setting and lore is great

[b]Notable Features[/b]
1) [b]Survival based Horde shooter[/b] like no other. Mobility and target prioritisation are key to winning. Like Hades, you [b]start each run from scratch and dying ends your run, forcing you to start from scratch[/b] which makes finishing the game at a high difficulty extremely satisfying.
2) [b]High difficulty[/b], Would not recommend playing on normal difficulty for newbies
3) A [b]variety characters and builds[/b] mean everyone can find their own play style

[b]Pros: [/b]
1) You can a choose from large number of build combinations of builds
2) Multiplayer w friends is the bomb
2) Drizzle/Easy difficulty makes learning the game more fun
3) Modding compatibility

[b]Cons:[/b]
1) The game does a bad job at explaining its mechanics.
2) Randomised item drops in normal mode are a bitch to deal with. However, that can be changed by acquiring and equipping an ""Artifact of command"".
3) You have to install a mod if you want to test out characters/items. A practice tool would've been great for those of us that are too lazy to install mods"
16176,gummy equipment drone
16177,become god at 10 fps
16178,"Fantastic gameplay that feels smooth and fun. amazing level design thats fun with every single surviver (except scorched) and the music just slaps. The sound design makes most abilities and items feel satisfying to use. and every single survivor is unique with their own playstyle and are great despite what people say
9/10 could use more artificer"
16179,"This is a great game. Running around, fighting aliens, unlocking new items and characters all contribute to the fun of this game. However, I will say, there is a steep learning curve. If you have never watched someone else play the game or watched a lot of item and character guides, you may struggle at first. In the beginning, you don't even know why you died half the time. But after getting over that curve, It becomes really enjoyable. Not bloody or gory, easy to play casually, and much more fun with friends.

16199,"This game blows. Level design is so annoying. Finding stuff is annoying. The fact you need to have dodge constantly, but it is limited by a timer makes the game garbage. You can make this playable with mods, I am sure. Most people probably do that. The game alone is garbage. Muck is actually a better game as far as stuff to do. Obviously the combat in this is much better. That's about it. If you can't juggle the difficulty timer with gaining good loot, you might as well quit playing. Everything becomes overpowered. RNG loot luck is everything. You will need a ton of patience to continuously restart till you get a good run. Each levels limited by loot, which makes the game even my crap. You lose all your money in the end of the round, so the time you spend in one level is meaningless. You are in a stupid race. It makes it very tedious.."

Played commando, another godrun, had about 50 Lost Seer's Lenses, 20 polylutes, 4 red items that made my character a god of destruction, made it 18 levels in, got 1 shotted in the secret world, wasn't even mad.

16261,"So after putting almost 600 hrs on pc and 300 hrs on the switch, I just have one thing to say:

Don't ever let the crack that is ror2 stop with content. I have never played a rouge-like/rouge-lite game in my life. Never touched the genre. But after a combined 900 hrs experience, a team of 3-now 4-devs have managed to steal so much time away from me. And I loved every milisecond of it. Highly, highly recommended, 10/10, 5 stars, etc.

Praise be Hopoo"

16281,"I've played this game to 100% completion (achievement wise, not all logs/E8) on every patch since release and can safely say that it is worth the purchase, even without the DLC. 
"
16282,"Great rogue-like. Like most of these games, there is a learning curve at the beginning. But once you start playing, things will begin to fall into place. Different playable characters with varying and unique abilities. Lots of secrets to unlock. Overall, it kept me wanting ""just one more run"" and if a rogue-like does that then it's doing it's job in my book."
16283,Just one more run.... 20 runs later.
16284,verwy good goodie game

16287,"Como persona que tiene mucho sexo a toda hora, puedo decir que este juego es 100% parecido a tener sexo con una mujer, como yo siempre hago. Obviamente este juego no me puso caliente. no soy gay, yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres reales como para gastar más de 15 minutos en este juego. Por otro lado me gustaría recomendar este juego a la gente que no tiene sexo (no como yo porque yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres, mucho) como si ahí hubiese una mujer desnuda y está desnuda. Ella también se ve como una de mis varias novias con la que tuve mucho sexo. He tenido mucho sexo. También soy muy guapo y las mujeres SIEMPRE quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy musculoso y guapo y muy bueno en los videojuegos. Todas mis novias dicen que soy muy bueno en el sexo y jugando videojuegos y siendo guapo. Una de mis enamoradas me pidió tener sexo con ella pero le dije que estaba jugando un juego de sexo y empezó a llorar y se hizo lesbiana y se suicidó porque no tuve sexo con ella. Tengo sexo con mujeres, no con hombres, no soy gay. Soy muy cool y guapo así que las chichas siempre quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy cool y sexy. Mi pene es muy grande. A todas mis novias les gusta mi pene porque es muy grande y soy muy bueno en el sexo y lo soy, tengo mucho sexo. También soy muy guapo y sexy y tengo mucho sexo."

They also have alternate abilities where you have to do,  sometimes challenging, requirements to unlock these abilities. But overall the game is very fun and very relatable. At least a good 9/10 would reccomend."

16314,This game is tight. A must have. Spent countless hours in vanilla and then the mods are amazing as well

One of the things I've noticed in this game is that I never got bored, whether I was struggling on Monsoon, or was playing God with a bjillion items on stage 50 in Drizzle it was hella fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone."
16375,"[h1] Risk of Rain 2 reviewed by soar [/h1] 

Risk of Rain 2 (ROR2, ROR) is a is a top-of-the-line roguelike that provides great replay-ability due to its randomly generated loot, enemy's, and map order. ROR provides a great balance of fun and challenge as you need to collect power-ups / perks to keep with the scaling difficulty. The difficulty scales as the more time is spent on each level so it keeps the player with the objective to beat the game before the difficulty gets too high while collecting perks and killing enemies. ROR is fun to play co-op and singleplayer. You unlock different characters with different attacks and movement types as you play the game.

16388,"I love this game I try to recommend it to everyone that was a mistake.

My gf fully taking advantage of how items infinitely stack is a movement speed crack addict. Ive tried to lure her away with damage and healing items. Turrets even. But no. 

She wants the fast.

So now every run she plays ends with her consistently flying off the map at a sheer uncontrollable speed until death is all but inevitable.

10/10 Fantastic experience..

16423,"the replayability aspect of a roguelike is what makes it what it is, and ror2 has it in spades. The vast amount of characters, items, unlocks, stages, bosses, and overall fun that you have every run is only enhanced by the fact that it's fully multiplayer. Going from default to overpowered in the span of 20 minutes will never get old, whether on drizzle or monsoon. pick it up."

16426,"Class/character based co-op shooter where you and up to three friends battle hordes of aliens/ghosts/demons with the help of rogue-like randomly generated loot. These items provide bonuses of all sorts (and the items show up on your character's model too, which is cool) and multiple of the same type stack, so you could end up super op or gimped based on rng. 
But you'll need these items as the game has a constantly up-ticking difficulty timer, so the longer you spend on each level, the harder the rest of the run'll be, so you have to strike a balance between looting and scooting."
16427,nut worthy

16437,"very good very nice

hello sexy banana"
16438,"I got this game close to release, when there was a BOGO sale going on. A friend gifted it to me. Back then? It was an absolutely fine game. Good for some hours, and some good fun, but not a lot of content. I come to you now, 3 years later, to happily testify that after the 1.0 patch, and now this AMAZING DLC, Risk of Rain 2 is the best roguelike I've ever played, and it's still not done getting content.

RoR 2 finds a beautiful balance between mind-numbing, ""big numbers go BRRRR"" game play and that stressful, high-stakes roguelike adrenaline that us masochists like. This game is HARD. I personally like to play Monsoon the most, and I am dipping my toes into the hardest challenges, Eclipse difficulty. But the beauty of Risk of Rain 2 is that you don't *have* to do that. Want to just have an arcadey monster killing, power fantasy party with your buddies? Turn on some alternate rules (Artifacts), go on an easier difficulty, and go to town. The game is a BLAST whether you are challenging yourself to git gud, or just taking a retina-destroying, explosive, flashy trip across Petrichor V, melting every enemy in sight with 30 procs on every action you take. 

Cons? There ARE a few:
- game EATS RAM for breakfast. once you get late game and there are 10 magma worms and 30 explosions a second, your processor is gonna be going to work. I'd say don't try this game without at LEAST 12 gigs, and really more like 16 if you want to do long runs. 
- multiplayer scaling is a little bad. It's perfectly fine on the easier difficulties, but if you play Monsoon or Eclipse with 3-4 people, the enemies will VASTLY outnumber and outscale you if you and your boys aren't absolutely CRACKED. 
- takes a LONG time to get all the unlocks, you'll often find yourself doing runs with the specific goal in mind of getting a really weird, niche unlock (10 crowbars? really, huntress?)

But really, that's all the cons I can think of. Seriously, just buy this game. It has something for you, whether you're a die-hard roguelike chad or a very casual player, Risk of Rain 2 has got what you're looking for.

Oh, and buy the DLC. It's the best DLC I have seen in a long time, in any genre, full stop."

16447,guuten gammen
16448,"I really enjoy this game. Its a lot of fun to sit down and play whenever I'm bored, and it has so much replayability that I don't think I'm ever going to grow too tired of it. The characters are very dynamic, no one character feeling too much like the other. The items synergize and work together better than any other rough like I've played. The items don't feel like just an upgrade to your character, but and upgrade to your other items. There are of course a few exeptions to this, but seemingly useless items are a part of the meta too, with the system of scrapping and printing. Over all I would suggest this game to anyone who is wanting a game that they can play as long as they want, without really ever growing tired."

16455,"One of the best roguelikes out there. It's fun whether you win or lose. It just gets annoying to unlock the alternate abilities of some characters, which are sometimes direct upgrades."
16456,"The enemies, the items, the abilities, THE POWER FANTASY!!! It's all so well made and so much fun. Some could say it has low replay value, but its the type of game to hone your skills at, because it can always get more difficult. And, if you run out of things in the base game, the modding community is such a lovely place to find ways to change things up. Honestly, when I played the game for the first time, I was shocked by how smooth the gameplay was and how fun the movement and shooting is. Would very much recommend, especially to those who have no idea what to expect!"
16457,Hecking amazing.
16458,"If you like roguelikes, you will like this game. 

Buy it."
16459,
16460,"A stupidly fun game, the latest DLC was awesome and a ton of fun, but it's clear that some bugs and balancing issues need to be addressed. Even with all of that, this game never fails to be fun and has a ludicrous amount of replayability, it's a challenging game on your own and an absolute hell of a time with friends!

I'd recommend this to basically anyone, I think the number of people who would genuinely dislike this game is close to none!"
16461,very good man
16462,"game rocks, chris rocks, chris rock? zee bruh"

16474,"very impressive game, at first I had doubts but shortly after starting it enchanted me with simplicity, after first three runs it got boring but then i unlocked more survivors and game felt very fair and rewarding, the mechanics are stunning, i was craving for this type of experience. Level and sound design is very good, in other games i prefer my own playlist, but this makes me turn volume on max. Its brutal yet simple and deep enough to spend here bunch of time. hugs to the devs, I'm happy to support you, thank you for emotions."

16498,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been said by someone else? The game can be a massive power trip simulator one run, and another you die to lesser wisps and lemurians two minutes into playing. Both of those examples are still fun because you're always learning something, learning what items go well together, or learning to pick your fights and what skills are best for certain situations. There's always something you can learn on each run, not just limited to player experience either. Logbook entries, new items unlocked from achievements, new survivors, new skills for survivors, new ways to alter your runs, rewards for beating the hardest difficulty, there's always something new to do. When you think that is no longer the case, the modding scene is massive for this game with even more difficulties, more survivors, more items, more stages, the list goes on. Solo is great on its own but playing with friends is the most fun and chaotic experience of the game.

tldr; just get the game. DLC as well. Highly excited to see what more Hopoo and the modders can add to this already amazing game!"
16499,"Before this game I had no experience with the roguelike genre, and this has been a fantastic first experience. Every character is interesting and has a unique style of gameplay. I find myself playing all of them, I can't say I have a least-favorite. This along with the alternate skills adds tons of replayability to the game, even after 600 hours I still find the game fun and interesting, finding new ways to synergise specific items and characters. All of the enemies and bosses have fantastic designs, both from a creative and gameplay standpoint. The music is outstanding, while surprisingly calm for a run and gun, it sets the mood very well for all the environments. Unlocking all the achievements and filling out the logbook while reading the lore spread out through the game has got to be my favorite part of playing. And that's all just the singleplayer content, playing co-op with friends is great, the way the game scales with more players makes it exponentially more fun without just spamming enemies.

I started playing around late 2021 and it's since become my most favorite game. I recommend it to anyone willing to check it out!"

16516,"Just accomplished ""Mercenary: Ethereal"" - now I could die in peace!
Easily one of the best games I ever played!
- Gameplay is smooth as sh*t!
- Enemie-Types are interesting, unique (in terms of attacks/sounds) and well designed!
- Every playable survivor feels unique and it's always fun and competition to unlock them!
- Music (by Chris Christodulu <3) is massively well done and atmospheric to the fullest!

If you are interested in any kind of shounen Anime:
You can play a Mercenary, wielding a light-saber-katana! Dash like Zenitsu, and perform hits like Tanjiro while lookin' like a Oni (if you unlocked his MASTERY!) *.*

Just too GOOD!
10/10 in my opinion!
Edit: Make it 11/10!"
16517,"It is one of the best roguelike game of the last 10 years. Even if you are not interested with roguelike games you should give it a try because no matter how long you played the game it gives you a wonderful experience that you wont regret. Also, It has wonderful atmospheres, very banger musics and sweet graphics that does not requires a powerful system. Actually, only parts that i can break some points are bugs. Those bugs are rare but when you run up against them it might bothers your experience.

16544,"This is honestly my perfect game. Great to play either alone or with friends. Time just melts away when you're in the middle of a run. Progression feels amazing, and it's insanely rewarding to dig into each character and discover what they need to become as broken as possible. Not to mention that this game with no dialogue and all of two cutscenes has one of the best video game stories I've ever seen. If you're the kind of gamer who enjoys piecing things together as you go to find something mindblowing at the end, you NEED to get this game and experience it for yourself."

16552,"idk wat to say but buy, buy buy"
16553,"Roguelites are something of a comfort to me I've found as of late: Hades, Slay the Spire, Into the Breach, Dicey Dungeons, Don't Starve, Minecraft, all impressive in their own way. It's not so hard to impress within the framework either when it's mostly about finding a hook and giving you randomized powerups as the difficulty ramps up. Past that, there needs to be a goal. That goal can be ""get to the end"" or ""just be alive"" or anything in between, but you always need a reason to do either of those things.

I'd say that's where Risk of Rain kinda fails me. There are like 10 characters to unlock, and for the most part they are just shooty shooty. That means there should be something else that provides engagement.....and there isn't. Very few maps with enemies that just kinda spawn and then you shoot them as you look for some items scattered across the map. There are lots of items....but as you unlock items you are saturating the list that can randomly spawn, decreasing the likelihood that you'll get what you want. There are secrets as well, but they're extremely annoying in design to be frank. 

None of this is a dealbreaker in any way though! It's light and breezy and I feel like I'm playing one of those old flash games with my friends. It can be great fun! Absolutely. But I wouldn't pay full price, and I wouldn't expect that you're getting a game to sink your teeth into. Borderlands is a better option if you're looking for longform progression. But I'd play this multiplayer over Borderlands multiplayer."
16554,railgunner makes you feel like you're a mlg trickshotter but instead of shooting players it's against little creatures that can't do anything but watch as your 1 million damage bullet eviscerates the boss in one hit and wonder if they're going to be next
16555,"Rogue-lite done right!
Good movement feel, generally not taxing on lower-end PCs, nice combat, unique items, and cool cast of characters. Also has a nice graphics style that doesn't feel too dated, and a banger of a soundtrack.
To top it all off, it's also very easy to get mods going!
A solid game overall with amazing replayability. Even better with friends."
16556,Fun game. Still don't have the harvesting scythe
16557,"Even though I'm absolute trash at this game, I still have an absolute blast every run.  I am encouraged to improve and complete seemingly impossible challenges by the game's entertaining gameplay loop.  You shoot things until you get an item that lets you shoot thing better or different.  By the third stage you could have a portable black hole you use to consolidate all your enemies into one place in order for you to cause each of them to detonate 27 times.  If that makes no sense, good.  The only way it could make sense is for you to have said build; so go play it. 

 Overall I already love this game, only having played it for 8 hours.  Only real thing I'd advise to watch out for is losing your temper.  I haven't had much of a problem with it so far, but I can clearly see how horribly that anger would spiral.  This game is not forgiving, at all.  Don't get too attached to your runs, just look forward to the next."
16558,"Really good rogue-lite, plenty of secrets and different classes with unlockable abilities.  Good with friends. Try to make a crazy build."

16605,"Not bad, but also not really at its best as as single player game. Recommended to play co-op."
16606,This Shit BUUUUUUUSSSin
16607,"This game is very pretty, it has some of the best music of any roguelite i've ever played, and it was fun for about the first 20 or something hours i played it. I suppose if you value those first experiences and aren't much for unlocking everything, beating the game in all its different ways etc you would find this game worth your time, but this game mechanically is one of the worst roguelites i've ever played

To start, the game is not satisfying to begin. Beginning any match on any difficulty with any of the modifiers you can add to the game is either boring or too risky/janky (i.e the artifact of glass) and rely a lot on either luck or time consuming running around an oversized map for items. You move too slow, every character besides Loader makes me feel like im forced to collect speed items first just so i can benefit from the advantages of being able to collect things fast, except i can't simply build for speed at the start as CC items and damage items are both necessary during those first few stages. None of this, however, would be that much of an issue if it weren't for one of the other largest issues with this game as a whole: the difficulty system.

The difficulty system is not well thought out. Being based on time is not a bad concept but does not work in the slow and oftentimes boring environments the game forces you to stay in, be it standing in a red bubble for a minute or so after killing the boss in a few seconds or running around aimlessly in the pregenerated over-sized maps for little chests, or enemies if you're on artifact of sacrifice. Its based a lot on luck, as no matter how much you master the maps and memorize their layouts, the chest spawns are so random its not rewarding to even learn. And if you don't pay attention at the start, you may not even know that the teleporter is found via its large red particles that surround it, causing even more slow and droning gameplay that is to your disadvantage as every single second that ticks on the timer means more pressure to become stronger or simply die.

The character balance is very poor. While its true all characters can be OP with the right items, getting to that point is based on how good your character is to begin with. Characters like Loader seem to be balanced well, they have excellent movement balanced by being forced to melee, but does high damage and has high survivability as a result. The same cannot be said for every other character. Some characters do too little damage to begin, such as engineer and Rex, some characters have very poor options for mobility, such as artificer and bandit, and some characters, like captain, have virtually nothing, and sometimes even cannot use their abilities at all in specific environments. No mobility, poor damage, and terrible, terrible alternate abilities like the abysmal ""Diablo Strike"" which seems more like a joke. And this poor balance persists through almost every single character. What makes this even worse is the poorly designed item system that oftentimes doesn't benefit a character for its abilites and rather just for hitting your enemy once.

The item system get very boring after the first few times you're overpowered. Items are very simple, even the more rare items can do things as simple as 100%+ crit damage or debuff resistance, and this simplicity limits creativity. After my vast hours in this game i found that more often than not what mattered wasn't building around my abilities, but rather just building specific items that allow me to eventually one shot anything regardless of class. Some characters benefit from certain items more than others of course, but in the long run of the game and for later difficulties all the characters bleed together into a mess of just one-shotting everything with stupid items that do all the work for you. Satisfying, but disappointingly limiting and boring after a while. 

In addition, i do not enjoy the system for unlocking items. I enjoy hunting for achievements, but some of the achievements are simply too based on pure luck in a game with sometimes multiple hour long sessions that it becomes very, very boring and unfun to simply get a single item or character ability. Take for instance the achievement to unlock one of the better lunar items, where you're supposed to chase a specific enemy off the ledge of a map 20 times. However, this specific enemy type does not spawn on maps with ledges until you loop once, which means you not only have to get far to start, but also have to get a map with a ledge, the enemy in question, and not TOO far or else you'll accidentally one shot the poor thing. Another example is the ability unlock achievement for Rex, in which you have to push a specific boss into a hole on a specific map. Which means you not only have to find the map, but also get the specific boss in 2 completely random out of your control scenarios, with a small asterisk on the map as there is a chance you can find it in the lunar shop area. (but again, its also out of your control if it will be there too.) I could go on about some of the stupider achievements, such as the one to kill a scavenger as acrid being unforgiving on multiplayer, or the terrible mercenary achievement to take zero damage.

Another issue i found with the game is how enemies work. Most enemies are fine, they serve as specific roles such as rank and file enemies like wisps, or more tough miniboss like enemies that provide more coins such as Parents and Elder lumerians. Where all this falls apart is in the elite system, and how damage scales as the game progresses. Its common to see people mention how even just one hit in the later stages of the game can spell complete death for your long run, and to me thats not a fun or well designed aspect of the game. I don't mind one shot mechanics in most roguelites, my favorite roguelite, synthetik, is notoriously highly difficult with powerful enemies who can kill you very quickly, but where that game succeeds and this game fails is in the amount of control you have over evading attacks and strategy. Other roguelikes, such as gungeon and synthetik, both have burst movement options and linear attacks that are simple to dodge but find their fair difficulty in forcing you to dance while also fighting the enemy, its satisfying and fun to play in this way. Risk of rain, however, has absolutely zero concept of ""dodging"" attacks. Yes, you can build to run fast, and yes, you can use your movement abilities (based on class. some classes simply don't have movement abilities.) to try and evade attacks. However, some attacks, such as the wisp blast or the stone golem laser blast have unnecessarily unforgiving speed and tracking, causing you to sometimes build around getting hit to begin with. Instead of using your skill to weave through the enemies, or using movement abilities that may give you immunity frames (with a single exception), the game opts for items such as Tougher Times which give you a random chance to resist attacks, which essentially forces a boring campy playstyle to avoid getting completely one shot in later stages or even early stages against specific bosses elite enemies. And to elaborate on elite enemies, you can oftentimes find yourself in later stages getting killed in an instant by malachite enemies or freezing enemies. None of this is skill based design, its almost completely random and out of your control which makes this game feel like a roulette wheel oftentimes, even WITH items such as the 57 leaf clover.

All in all, risk of rain 2 captivated me enough to get almost all of the achievements, but after the first magical 20-30 hours i found nothing but a boring game loop with unfun mechanics out of your control. And yes, this is all AFTER the dlc, which has fixed none of my issues. I want this game to succeed, its probably the first 3D roguelite this big with this much potential, but all i can see in this game is limiting gameplay and poor mechanics.

This game makes you either feel like a god or the worst gamer to ever exist. And I am here for it. No matter how powerful you are, there’s always something on the stage that can kick your teeth in. At a certain point it becomes a battle not between player and game, but hardware and game and lemme tell you, this games built like a Mac truck. Absolutely recommend, it’s only 15$. Oh and get the dlc 100% worth."

You're friends can't revive you if you get jumped by spawning enemies and you don't get revived until the next zone and you've missed out on all the loot after you die (you keep what you've collected) leaving you at an immediate disadvantage if your team gets to the next zone. Certain enemies will instantly kill you if you are not geared.

Over 13 years of personal experience with games in various genres and sizes, this is the best game I have ever experienced. 

[b] What is this game all about? [/b]

Risk of Rain 2 boils down to a simple system, spawn, kill various monsters, acquire loot and survive as long as you can. While having cartoony graphics, the game still manages to revel in it, making use of every last mesh. However, due to the game being endless, scaling with stages and time, it can be easy or a full sweat to survive if the RNG is not in your favour. The game also gives the player a choice on the difficulty of the run, like drizzle (the easiest), rainstorm (normal) and monsoon (the hardest, if not including eclipse, which I will bring up later).  Furthermore, it is one of the most replayable games released to date, giving the player many possibilities with customizing your survivor in different means, learning about the lore and reasoning behind the events of the game. Additionally, you can try other gamemodes, like Prismatic Trials - pretty much the speedrun mode of ROR2, where players compete in a specific seed, which will be set for a specific amount of time. There is also Eclipse, the hardest version of the game, where after every successful run the game gets progressively harder from the first stage to the eighth. It is also possible to unlock artifacts, which can spice the game up quite a lot, for example, you can add an artifact to the run, which allows you to control the items that the player most desires (god run simulator) or make the enemies spawn with half the HP, but double the spawn-rate. Personally, I enjoy the main gamemode with Monsoon difficulty and 0 modifiers.

[b] The survivors, items, events and more. [/b]

Risk of Rain 2 has a total of 12 survivors or playable characters and one of them being a secret one. In my opinion, the amount and specialties of these survivors are quite extensive, covering many playstyles and possibilities for every player. For example, you can play the huntress, an agile marks(wo)man, whose kit makes her almost impossible to catch off-guard while blowing out huge DPS. In the beginning, the player has only one of the survivors – commando. He is easy to play and suitable for the first run. Other survivors can be unlocked by just playing the game. The items of this game have been divided between 6 categories – common (white/gray), uncommon (green), legendary (red), lunar (blue), equipment (orange) and boss (yellow). All of those items can be acquired from chests, item printers, item stores, shrines or the „mystery box“. However, equipment and lunar items can be acquired only from respective containers or and shrines. Furthermore, items are pretty much the only powerspikes the player can get and almost all of them STACK, making some combinations above OP. But if the items can turn you into a god, then how can you die? In the later stages it is possible, to get one-shot from certain enemies. Yes you read that right, your 30min run can end with a ONESHOT. In total, there are 55 different enemies in ROR2 – WOW. Additionally, some of them spawn with buffs, ranging from a basic shield to walking flamethrowers or invisibilty fields. Oh yeah, bosses, right...eeeeeh. In the first stages of the run, it is quite rare to meet a „boss monster“ even on monsoon. Usually the player has to defeat the enemy when initiating the teleporter event, which will spawn the boss or bosses of the stage. After the event, the player can advance to the next stage and all of the excess gold will be consumed and turned into XP.  There are also 4 extra events/portals/stages, which can be activated in different means.

[b] THE AUDIO AND SOUNDTRACK [/b]

Yes, they do deserve a whole article. The audio design and soundtrack are a masterpiece, I would have never thought that it would stick with me this hard. The soundtrack was composed by Chris Christodoulou an [i] „award-pending composer from Greece“ (Spotify) [/i]. The soundtrack includes 24 tracks, four of them being bonus content for supporters, who buy the actual soundtrack. I highly suggest playing this game and taking a moment to truly experience the audio. Last bit on the audio – the best feeling in this game can be experienced when killing a horde of enemies in quick succession.

[b] Final word [/b]

I highly suggest playing this game, it is an experience that everyone should be able to enjoy. The concept, gameplay and audio put together is phenomenal and, when I said that it is the best game I have ever played, I truly mean it. The game was developed BY AN INDIE STUDIO FOR GOODNESS SAKE, even outdoing massive AAA studios. 10/10


[b] The DLC [/b]

If you liked the base game, then definitely check out the SOTV DLC, it adds so many things to the game, while costing almost nothing compared to other big company DLC’s or other additions.

16685,"I loved it at first but as I got to the end of unlocking everything (it takes like 50 hours) I started realising something. The game feels like it's in 0.8 early alpha
   Survivors of the void takes it to 0.9, but the fact that it is a paid DLC is god damn atrocious. They should've made it into an update and made a few more like it because the game is really lacking. It should've had like 500 items and 10 different bosses until they start adding DLCS. And if they did that I would've happily paid 15 euros for every DLC they would make but they ruined it for me at this point.
    Make the base game 30-35-40 euros but god I hate this. Basically all they will do now is add more DLCs."

16695,"My legs went numb cause of how long I stayed seated due to a god. Game is fun until you basically try out all the characters and unlock all the game changing play styles. Until then every hour of game play feels fresh and never repetitive. I would recommend you don't cheat in lunar coins cause it will ruin the experience at least until you unlock everything. Play on Monsoon (Hard difficulty) thats the real gameplay imo. Game will reach its peak on your first god run. The numbers on the screen will induce a new form of addiction for the next couple of hours. Also play with friends, I found it best with just one more person."

16738,"A unique experience and breath of fresh air in the stale, boring game meta. Very rarely does a game just decide to let you become an arbiter of death, much less break every conventional function of the core game design. A choose your own adventure game disguised as a roguelike shooter. An episode of Hoarders where storing gasoline strapped to your thigh lets you instantly kill entire swarms of enemies. A game where the high of an invincible build is crushed by the low of an enemy you thought you were ready for. I could (and might) type more into this later.

Buy this game if you enjoy gamey games, or freebase jumping while holding silly string."

16752,Amazing 9.5/10. By far one of the most replayable and enjoyable  games there is to play with friends and especially with this new updat
16753,"Yeah this is a good game,

Even with 4 hours under my belt, I can confidently reccomend Risk of Rain 2 to people who like First person shooters, roguelikes, challenging games and games that push you to experiment and break the game itself.

Risk of rain 2 has a simple, but addictive gameplay loop that I want to experience more and more and I cannot wait to do that, but for now, absolutely buy this game."
16754,garbage
16755,"One of my favorite rogue-like games. The base game has already lots of items and characters, so your runs should rarely be the very same as before. The DLC, i don't have it but if a friend owns it you can still play it, brings in again a lot of new items,  some new item-types and 2 more characters, so i think its really worth it! The scenery of the stages is abstract, but in a good way :d The normal runs you can modify with artifacts, which can be obtained inside the dungeon. Those modify the game already in various styles, but the game offers also other game modes and challenges, so you should actually never be bored when playing this :)

16762,game is hard but slaps
16763,nice
16764,A good roguelike fps. Lots of replayability and new builds to do.
16765,Grandparents on this game are fucking stupid
16766,"This game is very fun.
Not too many items to learn, a decent amount of maps and the characters are all varied in gameplay style.
Every character feels and plays differently which is interesting.
I think the enemies are the weak part since they all just blend in together for me.
The wave based mode in the DLC is super fun too. Much more mutiplayer friendly since you respawn faster.

- Edit -
So recently I have felt that the game has gotten... stale? I have learned what the items do, I have played the different modes, different characters, defeated the final boss etc etc and now I feel like the game just does not offer that much of an pull for me to return to it. Like I could unlock some artifacts or new character abilities I guess but that is not the kind content of I am looking for.
Where Binding of Isaac Rebirth, Spelunky and Spelunky 2 pulled me in for many hours over long periods, Risk of Rain 2 has been forgotten only being played when asked by a friend for some Co-Op."
16767,shoot things

16770,"If you've ever played Nuclear Throne, this is basically that in 3D. Yes, there was a Risk of Rain 1, but that's a side-scroller and way more of an... acquired taste. All you need to know is the final boss of that game is the older brother of the final boss of this game, and you're pretty much caught up.

Over all I give Amazon Delivery Person Simulator a five out of four lost packages recovered. We're not sure what's in that fifth one, please don't open it."

 Of all my time in game, personalty, I have little to nothing as far as issues with game play, optimization, or over all design.
 
The game has quite a few items, abilities and characters to permanently unlock as you play, none of which require unreasonable amounts of grinding or luck, but are challenging all the same. 98% of unlockables in game can be done just by playing solo, any difficulty.

The ability to stack items infinitely is fantastic because is gives to so many synergy's and strategy's to try and make the perfect build each run. Between the items, the enemies and the area's to explore, there is a lot of substance to this game, without having an overwhelming amount of mechanics and things to learn like some MMOs.

The devs are supporting the game well with fixes when needed. For an inde dev, Hopoo Games have a good grasp of how to keep in touch with the community and improve the game all together.

Having the option of multiple profiles in the menu meant my nephew could have his own game to play through. That way he could start with 0 unlocks and work his way up from the start. I Appreciate that as an option Hopoo games!"
16830,This game hurts me more than life I LOVE IT so far

16847,"Been playing arcade/pc/console games since the 1970's.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  Look at my playtime, over 1,000 hours.
Risk of Rain 2 hits many things I like right on the head.  It's an action roguelike, but is non-action player friendly.  Control is easy to learn, tight and lag free on modest PC's.  Once you become familiar with the zones, the game becomes challenging since you are trying to get randomly placed powerups in the most time efficient way while the mobs are getting more powerful.  Selecting those powerups to figure out the most powerful combination for the current playthrough is a blast.  Graphics and music fit the dark sf mood perfectly.  The story is vague in a fun way.  I enjoy reading the descriptions of the zones and items.

My thanks to the Devs for the many hours of fun I have had playing this game.  Can't recommend highly enough."
16848,My brother got it for me and now I can't stop playing
16849,"7/10 
Solid little game with some nice music. Rogue-ish in nature with an addictive loop. 

Downsides would be that it is a little slow to start with a bit of an RNG curve that can make it feel punishing at times. Often it will feel like you've wasted to much time just running around looking for items and not doing the far more enjoyable task of killing mobs. Also it seems that depending on what you are trying to achieve there are only a handful of really decent items and combinations in the game and if you go outside of those combos you are basically wasting your time. This is unfortunate given the large variety of items in the game. 

That being said I would 100% recommend the game. Easy to get into harder to master. you'll definitely find yourself sitting down for a single play through and instead burn 5 hours."

16871,"Liste, I'm an atheist and this game had me looking into the Bible for help. Joke aside. A shooter with a roguelike’s soul, Risk of Rain 2 is pretty much devoid of any deeper meaning, but at the same time perfectly executed and brilliant in its simplicity and addiction levels. Simple, impressive and tough adventure for solo or friend play Deff. grab it."

So I decided to get it and [b] WOW [/b] am I glad I did... this game is incredibly fun and addictive.[u] The progression feels so nice, unlocking new Survivors, Artifacts, completing Challenges and unlocking new Loadouts for the Survivors [/u] . The gameplay is very smooth and fluid and there are basically no [b] Loading Screens!!! [/b] Besides the one you have to go through when you start the game, after that you can do one run after another and there has been no loading screens. I appreciate that so much."

16901,"It's a good game, nothing else to say. Here is a recipe for Serbian meat jelly as a bonus, in Serbian of course.

Добро опрати, ноге месо и коленицу, поређати у експрес лонац, додати ловор и зрна бибера, налити водом до црте и кувати нешто више од 2 сата, док све добро не омекша, распада се и одваја од костију.
2.
Када је све довољно кувано, прохладити, затим процедити кроз цедиљку.
3.
Течност процеђену ставити у дубљи суд да проври.
4.
У међувремену, одвојити коленицу од коже и костију, месо од коленице и ситно исецкати и распоредити по дну посуде где ћете улити пихтије.
5.
Када је течност проврила, размажите је мало по длану проверите да ли се добро лепи, ако волите мекше пихтије додајте још воде, сачекајте да проври.
6.
Када сте додали довољну количину воде, и проверили да ли се лепи, до жељене мекоће сачекали да проври, склоните са ватре додајте сецкани бели лук и першун и соли по укусу, промешајте и улијте у посуду преко меса.

16912,"It's fun but it lacks a lot of build variety, basically the same items are good on every character more or less.

What does get really fun is how broken things can get, and on that front it really does deliver."
16913,"This game is one of my favorite roguelikes. Playing monsoon feels like you are playing a competitive game against the game itself. There aren't as many item combinations or secret stages or whatever else as other roguelikes, but it honestly doesn't matter because the game is just damn fun. The mastery mechanic is the perfect addition to this game and reaching mastery on every character is an accomplishment that takes hundreds of hours to achieve while not feeling dull or grindy in the slightest."
16914,A lot of fun

There are so many characters, achievements, and items to unlock that you could probably spend hours in this game to unlock something else that makes you spend even more time playing. The most worth game I have bought in a very long time, and I recommend it 10/10. (also, if you are struggling to beat the higher difficulties or unlock other things I suggest doing the highest difficulty you can do until it becomes easy then switch to one higher and repeat.

Well, yesterday I was bored and decided to finally grab this game and give it a chance. The videos made this game look terrible. Playing is completely different and a ton of fun! I have been trying to find a Rogue Lite/Like game to really invest my time in. I tried Hades, Rogue Legacy, but I just couldn't waste my time (in a good way) on them. This however, I definitely plan to waste my life on it! I played 4 hours yesterday, and after each run I wanted to go back in. I felt myself actually progressing, which many of these types of games miss the mark on. So yes! Get it! If the price is a bit much, wait for a sale, it usually has a good sale price."

8.5/10"
16962,This game really FEELS like you're risking your rain
16963,"This is the best roguelike game on the market, in my opinion. The atmosphere this game projects is 100%. The first thing you'll really notice about Risk of Rain 2 is that you have no idea what the heck you're doing. There's no tutorial, and very few choices you can make at first launch. Gradually you start to learn this world and unlock new faceless survivors and items - as well as getting further and further each run, and that's when you think... 'Wait, is someone talking to me or is that the music?'  Then you spend the next 5 minutes completely zoned out and trying to decipher the lyrics to a song that might not even have any; dodging feral beasts and blasting them with a sliding shot combo. You realize just how well this game was constructed and admire how far you're getting even though it's only your second run. You come across a giant jellyfish and tackle it head on with the utmost confidence that he will fall like the remains of those before him. The music is crazy right now. There's screeching noises and explosions everywhere! You almost have him defeated, just a couple more shots! Then, 'Wait... what? How did I die?'

Back to the drawing board, only this time with someone else. Hours of fun to be had with this game. When you start getting bored there's also a multiplayer mode. Friends make this game way more fun. There's also a massive modding community with easy instructions and hours of additional content to mess around with. Completely recommend to any roguelike bullet hell fan."
16964,Played since release and highly recommend it. Great with friends or solo
16965,"I love this game, it's really fun to play alone or with friends, always a good time. Also, the whole soundtrack is a BANGER!

16998,"This game.
What is this game?

It is a piece of art with a clear philosophy in mind. 
Ignore its core idea and it will be a terrible slog. Frustrating, enraging, demoralising.

Embrace it and it suddenly turns into the ultimate power fantasy, become Death incarnate and cut through hordes of enemies like a hot knife on butter, until you get to defeat God himself (sort of).

I hardly write any reviews at all, but I HAD to after getting the expansion.

PRO:
+ Music rocks. Chris keeps making a wonderful job at portraying a coherent picture of an alien world
+ Extremely intuitive game design
+ Goofy. This game doesn't take itself too seriously
+ Surprisingly deep lore, but only if you choose to look for it
+ Creative items system
+ Rich modding community

CON:
- Some mods could easily have been in-game options (BetterUI)
- Not so easy to get up to speed with how the game wants to be played, hints are there but they're subtle and you may learn to read them after a few hours of gameplay
- Core loop can get a bit repetitive if you're not the type of player who's in it for wild experimentation via weird items combinations
- I liked the first game's way of unlocking artefacts slightly more, although having to find clues in different maps is without a doubt a brilliant touch and really helps with world building

tl;dr
Get this piece of art and give some love to Hopoo. You're in for a great time!"
16999,risky
17000,just buy it already jesus stop stalking the reviews page
17001,Bungus
17002,"Get some friends, go kill that Mithrix. Or you can be betrayed and play alone like me xD"
17003,"Truly a game really fun.

The game really managed to transfer the core idea of the first game into the 3D world really well, it built upon the idea and improved it, the game feels more lively in many ways, the characters have more emotion, the graphics look vibrant and lively as well, the gameplay feels just right, both in Keyboard+Mouse and Controller. 

Yes, the game is hard at first, because, as the first game, it involves a lot of trial and error if you are new. However, once you get the hang of it, you start to realize what characters you actually prefer, what items are best suited for the character you chosed, what's the best way to go through this map, or the most preferable way to defeat certain monsters, and yet, even if you managed to beat the game, you still want to come back, because there's still a lot to explore, even for a 1-hour adventure.

And, from the new features of this game, we can say that it also now officially features 16-player coop, dedicated servers, new gamemodes, new characters, even more items, and even more. Not to mention that this game is still being updated. This might sound like a bold claim, but i really think this game has surpassed the first game, by a lot. 

So yeah, i really had a lot of fun with this game, i really enjoyed every second of it, so if you really are into 3d roguelikes, either to play it by yourself or with friends, you should definitely try this one, you'll love it."
17004,i dont know how i got here
17005,asdasdasdw
17006, It really fun highly recamend
17007,"This is a damn fun game; borderlands and destiny without the fluff - even it doesn’t have the greatest introduction for new players (the starting class is dull and getting new ones can be very grindy). 

It’s a solid action rouge light with a strong visual style; an engaging game-play loop and endlessly repayable. I love its vintage toy-like aesthetic; this lore light Saturday morning cartoon vibe works well in the games design. 

The co-op is a mixed bag, but not bad. When all 4 players are playing different classes; tearing through the hordes its fantastic; however, there are some mechanics that encourage bad behaviour, like the lack of player to player revives mid-level and the loot system allowing player to hog all the good loot. Also, the community has a consistent problem with rage quitters, so many full games empty out real fast.

Overall; A good time in solo, and a sometimes amazing time in co-op. 

7.5/10

17014,"Fantastic game. Lives up the enjoyment of risk of rain one. The characters are all unique and interesting, there's a wide range of creatures to fight, and while it's the same maps they're well designed and never get old. The item collection system in this game is what really sends it home, as there's a bunch of fun and exciting items that you keep collecting until you feel like an unbeatable god (which makes it even more insane when you do finally die). Would recommend this game to everyone, even those who don't think they're interested in a TPS."

17030,I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for something different. You get different enemies and many different items throughout each run through!
17031,"-I've been playing this game since day one of Early Access, going through all of the amazing content patches and now (At the writing of this review) the survivors of the void DLC. Everything in this package is extremely worth it. 

-The strive to complete the extremely hard challenges and doing fun impossible god builds is always fun and laid back. From simply getting to the 3rd stage to killing an overloading worm with the commando, it's always a thrill of a time.

-It's multiplayer as well, a big highlighted feature of this game. I have some problems with it, but it's a great time still with some funny moments bound to happen.

-There are some tiny gripes with solo play as well, like how for prismatic trials the text STILL hasn't updated to at least remove the ""no reward for now"" text, since that's been there from day one. Minor glitches that is bound to happen when the game edges you to break and crash it if you feel like it, and very tiny things that may be specific to certain users. But, their official discord is always an amazing help for any troubleshooting, and they constantly take feedback into patches as well as fun additions to maybe weak items, like bleed and burn.

-From the small lore, to the amazing music, to the pretty atmosphere, the game was an instant buy from me when I first saw that alpha trailer, and I'm happy to see how far it's come to be one of my all time favorite games, probably ever.

(Small potential buying tip: Buy the base game first, if you like it, buy the dlc after. Buying both the dlc and the base game might be overwhelming if you haven't poured as many hours as others have.)"

17037,"The game's got a lot of modes and a crapload of unlockables. Mod compatible and the mods are plentiful and awesome. New expansion adds a ton to the game and its complexity, along with a new final boss(that I haven't beaten yet). 

The main downside of the game is that the default game mode is FILLED TO THE BRIM with RNG, to the point where you could be playing damn near perfectly and just lose because you didn't get the correct items.

If you're good with tons of RNG, and you like hundreds of hours of lovingly made content, lore, and fanmade mods, you'll love Risk of Rain 2. I certainly do."

17049,"Risk of Rain 2 is a Sci-Fi Action Rogue-lite, with a side genre of 3rd-person shooter. This game had me confused, and almost made me give it a negative review. I'll get into why in just a bit, but I ultimately decided that my own feelings about the game were a little biased, and decided a positive recommendation was more fair to Hopoo Games.

I'll start by listing pros and cons (cons isn't a large list, but I feel pretty strongly about the major drawback of this game).

 [h1] [u] Pros: [/u] [/h1] 
+ Your choice of class, called a Survivor, determines how you play the game. All survivors are extremely unique, and there is a class for everyone. Each survivor also has customizable abilities, which you unlock by completing specific challenges with each survivor. Survivors also have excellent artistic design.

+ Enemies are well designed and their attacks are very clearly telegraphed. Once again, the quirky designs of enemies lends to the overall artistic design of RoR2 in a very positive way.

+ Levels are very well built, with plenty of secrets to help make consistent runs more possible. For example, [spoiler] in the fourth stage, there is always a legendary item available to collect. Look for the well-hidden legendary chest, or for a hidden boss fight [/spoiler].

+ Unlocking items is very rewarding, even if the items themselves have some pretty extreme power gaps. Challenge completion is handily listed in your logbook, so you always know the conditions for completing the challenge.

+ Pretty cool lore, which is uncovered by collecting logbook entries. Take your time uncovering the pieces, or just look up a lore video. Either way, I found the lore to be very interesting despite not finding sci-fi as immersive as fantasy. 

+ The soundtrack is absolutely GOD-TIER. Chris Christodoulou has poured his soul into the soundtrack, and it shows. ""The Rain Formerly Known as Purple"" has ruined several runs because of how much time I waste on stage 5 just to listen to that song on repeat.

[h1] [u] Middling: [/u] [/h1] 
+ Item power gaps leave a bad taste in your mouth if your RNG is bad. RNG is a basic part of Rogue-lites, sure, but finding 4 Bison steaks, 2 Bustling Fungus, and 3 medkits across the first three stages is pretty rough. This game could benefit from a quick restart option in the Esc. menu.
 
+ The way items interact is very convoluted, and results in only one kind of build being super viable. Look up explanations on Proc Chains for more information, but the basics are that items with on-hit effects can activate other items with different on-hit effects, and this activation can chain if you have multiple on hit effects. Items with on-hit damage effects are pretty much the only viable items for runs. Everything else is supposed to be icing on the cake. Just pray to not get screwed by RNG.

+ Artificial Time limits on stages. The timer counts up, rather than down, encouraging you to play fast since difficulty scales upwards with time. Some people enjoy having the pressure to play quickly and efficiently, but for others it could be a deal breaker. I don't like it or hate it, just part of the game.

[h1] [u] Cons: [/u] [/h1]
- Probably the biggest issue I have with this game is that it's not primarily a Rogue-lite. [b]This game is first and foremost a Bullet Hell with rogue-lite elements.[/b] It took me a lot of time and frustration to realize this, and this is the reason I almost gave this game a negative review. Bullet hells are not fun for me, and this almost ruined my experience. Taking damage is extremely punishing the longer you play, and it is VERY difficult to avoid taking damage. I kept getting more and more frustrated, without realizing why. Without the bullet hell realization, I most certainly would have given this game a negative review. No matter how much I played, I couldn't deal with certain enemies melting me due to how difficult they were to dodge. Optimizing my play by going through previous stages faster helped, but I can't beat the final boss on normal difficulty. It really frustrates me, because this game has so many strengths that I want to like it, but it's also extremely hard for me.

This game is great and I like it a lot, but you'll probably find yourself extremely frustrated if you don't like bullet hell as a genre. Solid 7/10 game."

This game is really fun with friends, since you can get really nuts builds and become overpowered. But the game still comes up with stuff to instantly kill you anyway. I'd recommend save-file editing to get the artifacts really really quickly then get some really absurd runs, but I can understand the appeal of having to work for it.

If you got some friends to play with, this is a blast. Def worth the money for it. Not sure about the DLC, but thats cool, too."

17107,"this is my favorite game. do not recommend >:(
all jokes aside i really do love this game a lot. its hopelessly addicting and its such a good feeling to get super busted and one shot anything in sight. however, this game is INSANELY challenging, but i love that about it. i have played nearly 800 hrs (pc and console combined) and i have just recently started playing on the hardest difficulty more regularly lol. its also fun to unlock all of the characters, items, monsters, etc, and if you really want to dig for it the lore is super interesting as well. the SotV dlc is also super super amazing and adds a fresh new twist to the base game as well. i could not recommend enough."
17108,"This game was gifted to me randomly by a friend, who I still thank inside constantly and simply can't believe the luck I had in being the one receiving it.
Risk of Rain 2 is a relatively simple game. You spawn. You loot. You die. Repeat. I would call it easy to learn, but hard to master, and let me tell you it's gameplay loop is one of the most chaotic things ever.
Enemies will constantly spawn, each kill granting you money. With that money you open crates/chests that give you items, which i'm pretty sure at this point you can get an infinite amount of in your ""inventory"", but I haven't gotten enough in my play time to actually discern that. They give you cool stats, and the instant you die, most times that death being your own fault, you lose all of them. You start over, and there ya go, you try to get as far as possible. 
There is a final boss, but you won't reach it very quickly. Not in your first runs that's for sure, you'll be too busy dying constantly... But reaching that final boss? And more importantly beating it? That will feel very very good. In fact, most of this game is incredibly rewarding. Everything is unlocked by playing the game and getting achievements, and the character selection is very diverse and with luck not a single one of them is useless. Though there are a few... Inherently bad characters, they quickly turn very useful if you can get the right items.
This game has never really felt unfair until the much later difficulties, which, the more you survive, the harder it gets, as it usually is in these games.
All in all, I think Risk of Rain 2 is a must play. It's a comprehensive chaos that's very very fun. And if you can get friends to join you? You might never leave.

... And his music was electric."

17114,"I've played this game for very few hours on Steam, but I'm over the 100 hour mark on Nintendo Switch. This game is incredibly fun, and I'll recommend it to anyone who doesn't hate 3rd-person shooters. 
This applies to very few games, but the more you play RoR2, the more fun it gets (as long as you enjoy it in the first place). You start off with an basic character and then Huntress too, and your first few runs will be you learning the controls and the enemy patterns of the ever-present life around you. Once you start getting farther and learning more and unlocking new items and characters, the game opens up to a massive scale. The fluidity of combat and the item scaling and interactions has great depth, and fine-tuning your game play is fun when the game around it is so blood-pumping and fun.
The entire asthetic is amazing too. The simple colors help to guide understanding, and under such a nice looking game is a mound of deep lore hidden in item descriptions and such. While it can be frustrating at times, RoR2 is a very fun game. It has a nice fanbase (though some characters are... valued more than others), great mechanics and lore, amazing multiplayer compatibility, and is one of the best and most replayable games I spend my time on."

But I blown away on how awesome this game really is, The gameplay is fun, the style looks simple but a shit ton of details in every nook and cranny.

Like fun secrets? Great! This game is pack with them as well

The newest SOTV DLC? Worth it

Are you a loot goblin? Well this is perfect for you my goblin friends



In general, Fun as hell, great with friends, something you can just zone out and vibe to if wanted

All I can say is get the game, get some friends or solo it, little bit of a curve to learn the little tricks but you can pick up quick.
See you out there survivors!"

17182,"Positives: Risk of rain is a great game. The style is on point, and its the best rougelike on the market. It's one of my favorite games to play with friends, because you can play it over and over again. Each run is different. Every time you have to think differently. It's a good game, an original concept and it's fun. 

Negatives: I still don't understand how to get to certain places or get certain characters. The game is sorta unclear about how to do certain stuff. The runs also take ages to run through. Like 60-80 mins, and no one can leave.

Final analysis: Ror is a great game to play with friends and I would recommend it."
17183,"I love spending like an hour or 2 becoming an absolute god in this game. I still need to get 2 characters as well as the rest of the artifacts so there's a lot more runs to enjoy, even after 34 hours of playing it. My GPU gets toasty when there's like 100 enemies on screen exploding and burning at the same time lmao.

Edit: 77 hours in and I got a good amount of Monsoon Mastery skins, like 6 of em, I also got a lot of the artifacts, I have 3 more left to get, Metamorphosis/Chaos/Vengeance. Metamorphosis will probably be somewhat easy, but Chaos and Vengeance are going to be hell to get, I tried Chaos and it went horribly lol."

17202,Enjoyable Time suck!
17203,"Risk of Rain 2 is a lot like Borderlands 2, minus the tedious dedication to grinding for the best loot possible in this game. I make this comparison in the most positive sense, as BL2 is one of my favorite games of all time for how different and wacky the game is.
RoR2 is the first I'm hearing about the series, and already this game is hard to drop when you get into it. It's a bit off-putting to die the first few times and feeling as if the game isn't meant for you, but give it time and practice and you'll soon want to put in three-hour Easy difficulty sessions for the fun of it. The other difficulties offer their own sense of challenge and accomplishment, though I'd rather not mentally tax myself from the higher difficulties as much. Easy mode is the most fun difficulty not just because it is the easiest difficulty and lowest learning curve to master, but due to the fact that new players can experience most of the gameplay and mechanics in a single Easy-difficulty session. A playground to try out new things, or just reuse the same options that are tried and true for you, it doesn't really matter.
Regarding RoR2's unlocks and achievements, there's quite a lot going for it. Unlocks can be as simple as a new weapon choice for your character to mix up the type of gameplay you might stick with, or a whole new character with a wholly-different approach to combat. There's a lot of experimenting to what you want to try in this game, and sometimes you're rewarded for it with an achievement. In your early hours of gameplay, you'll probably come across a lot of achievements for the more menial tasks in the game which serve as a goal post for your progression on improving yourself. I think the achievements are smart in a sense that it requires you to research and experiment new mechanics whenever you can, which is great for replay value (you don't have to experiment at all either; been a Commando player since hour 1 of gameplay and I simply cannot drop this character for anything else).
Back on the Borderlands 2 comparison; both RoR2 and BL2 heavily reward the player with severe rushes of dopamine when you simply haul ass and kick ass in the most satisfying ways possible. On a great equipment load out on BL2, you'll see yourself racking up kill counts that make you feel like an unstoppable killing machine. In RoR2, you'll eventually find yourself in a great position with a lot of overpowered items that greatly increase your odds of survival and heightened sense of God status in a world of oppressive enemies. Both games also have a distinct art style that plays to this style very well, and it makes spotting certain objects and enemies relatively easy given the right circumstances (low brightness monitor warriors will have a tough time with this game). And ultimately, both of these are similar for the fact that they cater to a player's desire to be the most efficient killing machine with a great reward at the end of the killing mayhem that ensued.
Regarding music and sound; I don't play this game with the music on as I simply wish to listen to my own choice of music (3 hr playlist of Gran Turismo music; highly inappropriate for a game as fast-paced and frenzied as this one). The sound design is very intuitive, however, and you'll eventually be relying on sound to figure out what exactly is around you. It's pretty addicting getting to hear the sound of your weapons, not sure how to put that into words however. You'll just have to experience it to believe it.
I've experienced the DLC through a friend, and it's very fun with the new additions of items and stages and bosses. Clearly there's more opportunities to completely overwhelm enemies in a much more unfair manner, which is awesome to see. And this game is so much more enjoyable with friends, given you have any on Steam (if you don't, sorry about that). If you have additional teammates to join forces with, you should definitely play together on the main game.
And all of this review is just from the main gamemode; there are alternative modes that I'm too lazy to try. For a $25 retail price and a $15 DLC add on, I definitely say this game is well worth the value proposition in comparison to the replay-value that comes from it. A solid game recommendation even at full price. Give it a go, if you have the money."
17204,very good

17207,i now have a crippling mocha addiction

17209,one of the best games ever
17210,"A fun fast-paced style that is rigorously challenging and therefore, immensely rewarding. Replayablity is OK, helped mostly by the fact that each character has its own set of skills that need to be mastered, but the patches will also help veterans to still find more fun to be had."
17211,No rain. Still good.
17212,M.ECANTO EL ITEN AMARILLO Y E LDE MATI
17213,ill keep this short becuase i dont feel like writing an essay on this game. once you hit the ten hour mark its likely youve experienced the full game. you truely dont unlock enough to keep you playing the game for long term. however the game is fun for a few hours. def get it for a cheaper price and play it with some friends.

This game is so fun, the amount of ways you can break this game is insane, and It's completely fine from the devs. The community in it (at least from what i've seen) is so friendly, and wholesome. The modding community is also the same way, although when it comes to modding this game, what you thought was breakable in base game, with enough mods you absolutely destroy this game (in a good way).

17260,Fun
17261,"Very addicting and very challenging.
The focus on certain item synergies make it a lot of fun to experiment with different combinations of items and trying them on dirrerent Survirors (playable characters)
I played it for quite some time but still feel like I should get better after every run.
Be prepared for a learning curve but once you understand the game it's very fun to puzzle your build into a being that basically deletes everything on screen with a single click.
Very satisfying and very diverse game.
Be prepared for some frustrating defeats by monsters that behave in ways that you did not anticipate.
While the game is sometimes frustrating, it never feels unfair. A seemingly unfair death can be prevented once you learn the dynamics. (Looking at you Glacial Jellyfish / Void Jailer 😡😡😡)"
17262,"just awesome, insane art style, great design, awesome gameplay"
17263,"poop on a stick guys
"
17264,"live, love, laugh

"
17265,I like it hate sniper but the game in guud
17266,A friend of mine always plays this game.
17267,"Risk of Fun 2,
Better than 1 by a long shot, it is such a solid game that doesn't get repetitive! Even better with friends.
Designed to be fun with so many ways to play with quite a lot of characters, items, enemies/bosses, stages, artifacts, challenges, gamemodes and more- Its a rouge like so you get the deal.
Banger soundtrack, and an awesome dlc as well just toppings on this already amazing cake. Its worth the money but if you arent certain, wait for a sale, reasonably priced either way imo."
17268,m
17269,I'm sad that there's no umbrella item yet.
17270,very epic
17271,"There's nothing to not like about this game. The graphics are simple yet surprisingly pleasing. You feel the challenge increase with time; you can't just sit around and enjoy (unless you have some powered up drones). The power-ups are so much fun, but if you spend too much time collecting them... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
17272,"Turn Brain off shoot enemys, Also Item building is fun"

17293,"I lost my my girlfriend due to this game, fuck that bitch I didn't need her anyways, fuck you tabatha. 


10/10 would dump that broad again!"
17294,"I have 1500 HOURS played. I know this game. 

Before the ""Survivors of the Void"" DLC/Game Update, this game was fun.  Now, it's super-lagged.

Honest Performance Review :

I have a I7-11 with a 3090 RTX , my multiplayer partner has a I7-11 with a 3080.  We play across the internet, both in Texas, USA.  32 MB RAM each.

For the longest time, my buddy and I have played this game to the extreme, on voice, with Engi and Huntress.  We coordinate items to maximize and we use a mod that expands level cap. We've gotten as high as level 40,000.

In the past, before the DLC, we would scrap MASKS to cut down on possible lag issues. but really that was all we had to cut down on.  Lag was an issue until both of us had 3xxx series cards - and made sure that his 3080 had a motherboard with the full PCI v4 capacity (his 3080 with v3 lagged)

With the DLC, we're experiencing HUGE lag now, mostly once we get to the ""160-ish"" levels.  The main issue (besides code) seems to be all the flying projectiles added to the game, with the biggest offender being the ""ICBM"" missles.   With the turrents, I fire out hundreds of missles constantly and they hang in air and seek - that's a huge massive lagfest.  We scrap them to try to help.

Lots of people say the game is 'harder', but actually, with coordinated play it's much, much easier.  You ramped up the enemies, but you also really ramped up the total number of items, making us super-beast.  This exponential increase also massively creates far more game calculating/processing and thus, ""lag"", even with ""beast PC's"" like ours.  

Some of the new monsters, when they spawn in, are creating far more lag - one being XI Construct, whom is the KING of the lag-creating.  

I don't know how you fix all this, unless but you have to find a way to 'simplify' or dumb-down the math calculating. If you don't have a crazy-good PC like I do, and aren't blessed with a buddy on voice comms that's dedicated to working with you on item pickups for builds - I don't know how you play this game enjoyable with all the chaos and new lag.

The green scrap cube (a green scrap that re-generates each level) is super OP, but the executive card, which allows us to buy ALL the items from multi-shops *and* allows us to get 4-items per level from the drop-ships (2+2) as there are 2 of us playing - and we get a ton of reds this way - is super over-powered.  It's now a total item-fiesta of epic proportions.

This game could be fun in 10 years maybe when GPU/CPU hardware increases enough - but as of today, you've really over-done it code-wise."
17295,one time when i was supper obsessed with this game i went on a trip and saw a big vertical pile of stone and thought it was a stone golem
17296,"If I could, I'd like this game as many times as there are leaves on a clover"
17297,eh it's ok i guess
17298,Masterpiece.
17299,"incredible amounts of fun that genuinely made me want to continue playing, there was much needed quality of life changes that came with the DLC and I sincerely hope the devs continue to make content like this at the very least. 
"
17300,"i can't find the tc-280 until now, god bless the rng of this game"
17301,very fun game
17302,very good but motaliot is nghiện as fuck
17303,good game must buy it wastes a lot of your time thumbs up from me
17304,ITS FREAKING SICK BOY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17305,One of my favourite games of all times would recommend
17306,"Absolutely astounding game, the original RoR was honestly not appealing to me at all, but this legendary sequel really hits the spot with it's amazing gameplay and style, not to mention the SOUNDTRACK. Good god, do yourself a favor and buy the music for this game, incredible work by Chris.

Only critique I can really make is the multiplayer, it needs a serious rebalance with players dying. Once you die on normal and up, you're essentially permanently stuck behind everyone else and a consistent burden to the team unless you get lucky with item drops."
17307,Just play jacked Wall-E and u win
17308,oo aa
17309,Lots of chaotic fighting
17310,"Highly replayable, killer soundtracks, easy to get in but hard to master gameplay and charming art style. This is the first game that I really want to buy the OST."
17311,This game is a lot of fun and is a gold standard for rougelikes. Glad my friend put me up to this.
17312,THIS GAME. it only has 1.5 gb download requirement and it has a lotta content in that tiny storage consumption . 10/10 absolutely. its very fun to play and it has a ton of  ways to play. you'll enjoy it
17313,huntress go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
17314,"Fun game

17317,FUNNY NUMBERS FUNNY NUMBERS GET ONE HIT KILLED FUNNY GAME HAHAHA
17318,Great Game! You think it's get boring but it just gets better and better! Would definitely recommend!
17319,come on brain produce that happy chemical like you used to do
17320,"If you are reading this you are debating on buying this game. Do yourself a favor, buy it. DLC is 100% worth it as well."
17321,you like looting? you like shooting? you like tooting? legendary game 10/10
17322,NICER
17323,"yes, good, very good
"
17324,where is the risk of the rain
17325,"I remember playing the first Risk of Rain when I was 13, right around when it first came out, and having it become one of my favorite games. Now I'm 22 and I've been playing Risk of Rain 2 since it first launched into early access and It's easily one of my favorite games of all time. It's incredible seeing Hopoo come this far and I look forward to Risk of Rain's future and whatever else Hopoo decides to do afterwards."
17326,B U N G U S
17327,Try finger but hole
17328,f u m
17329,"game hard, buy now"
17330,Great game but the only issue I ever had was how annoying shared loot is in coop and it honestly pushed my friends and I to prefer solo runs
17331,really fun game even without people to play with
17332,worth the money i love playing it. its alot of fun with or without friends the constant grind you never know what you are gonna get on a run if its gonna be a god run or a shit run and grinding to unlock everyone is just fun in my opinion
17333,best game ever
17334,"Really good game if you're into rogue-like, 10/10

Please put a playable character of the same race of the Scavenger's in the next dlc PLEASE I BEG OF YOU PLEASE (favorite enemy and design) (and i know that in terms of lore having a scavenger as a playable character doesn't make any sense but my love for them surpasses the logic behind that, just make him be part of the gang)     ╯︿╰"
17335,This is game.  This game make me smile.  Face smile.

17341,love the arcade feeling and all the ways you can build to kill stuff
17342,"It's fun, a lot better with a lot of people playing. Worth $10 maybe, nothing more after a little bit of playing. Will likely not return until next DLC, it gets very boring very fast and achievements couldn't be further than fun to achieve."
17343,yep
17344,"It's Ok, for a muliplayer friend ender, I mean roguelike."

17361,"Good game if you have no value in yourself and want to just spend hours of you life just wasting time to get instant killed by some bullshit while the only thing you achieved is some data cell in mushroom world.

If you are like, yeah I'm a loser and I need to spend 400 hours of my life eating popcorn and potato chips and being proud about it then this is the perfect game for you."

17406,"The game is designed for the developers to laugh at you getting gang-banged by 7 beetle guards 11 times for the next 6 hours because you want a cool skin for the cool new character they added in.

17415,good game
17416,"Game is great would definitely grab ASAP. Graphics while not HD or realisitic are solid and convey enough detail for great performance even when your screen if absolutely full of enemies. Items are unique and can make or break your ""runs"". Each survivor is unique as well with differing gimmicks and traits that force different ways of playing the game. Monsters and bosses are challenging in all of there own ways while easy starting off eventually the game can get as hard as darksouls (say what you will this is for new players). Lastly mods just get it a simple search for Risk of Rain 2 Mods will take you right to the mod assistant for instant modding. The process is braindead and tutorials are there for assistance if need be."

17452,risk of deez of nuts
17453,Never boring and always new run type of game! Loads or replayability!

17484,its a good game :)
17485,"The base game is very fun with tons of replay-ability and there is a really good modding scene imo if you don't want to buy the dlc but also want more in the game. The DLC is well done, and I think it is well worth the price. I hope to see more dlc in the futre if it continues to be this good."
17486,"This is a life changing experience. If you buy this game, you will turn into a god. A god more powerful than 30,00 goats and cows combined!

17515,This game is one of the best Rouge-Like game I have plaid and continue to play. The only nit pick I have about it is there could be more Chrs on it (to many females I don't really play them much but railgunner is cool not a problem just a preference) I think it could use more beat like survivors or more magic casting but all in all the best part of this game is how well it pairs with Death-Drink when you play with friends. I rate it 10/10
17516,Currency
17517,The new void DLC is amazing! Makes this game have even more fun gameplay options!!

17527,"So I played a lot of this game and after doing most of the content, I feel like I can finally review this monster of a game.

First off, let's adress the elephant in the room. 

[h1] Yeah, you should buy this game IF YOU ENJOY ROGUE-LIKES. [/h1]

This game offers so much for so little.  The content is amazing and the recent DLC added even [b] MORE [/b] of the good stuff. So yeah, go ahead.

But if you want to know [b] WHY [/b] I think you should buy it, here are the talking points.

[h1] THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY ROGUE-LIKE, REPLAYABILITY. [/h1]

This game has one of the most satisfying run/loop systems I have seen. Basically, when you complete a certain action [i] (an achievement, if you will) [/i] you will unlock some kind of new content. This is literally anything, ranging from new items available in the next run, a new modifier that can be aplied to the next run (drastically changing the game), a new character or a new alternative ability for a character. This makes every run feel very rewarding, regardles how you play at the start, you will always feel like you achieved something new and are learning. This is really hard to pull of in a game where you play from the scratch every time you start over, but it just works.

[h1] NEXT, THE CORE, THE JUICE, THE GAMEPLAY [/h1]

It never got stale. After around 150 hours, all I can say is I keep getting amazed by certain interactions with items and abilities. There are certain synergies that works extremely well with certain characters, and not so much with others, making itemization very important and makes you think on the move. Ofcourse, there are some items and equipments that are good for every occasion [i] (I'm looking at you, 57 leaf clover) [/i] these are usually pretty rare and hard to get on demand, making you think and create your strategy on the go. Each survivor has a unique playstyle and/or a mechanic that makes him stand out. But most importantly, it is just so fun to play. On the later stages, the game pretty much turns into a bullethell of doom, making you eighter the boss of this stage, or a poor critter that is about to get stepped on by an [b] Overloading Scavanger [/b]. No matter how you like to play, there is a playstyle for you that you can use and character to play that you will enjoy.

[h1] THE VISUALS [/h1]

Risk of Rain 2 is a nice game with a nice stylistic choice. That being said, this game is not made to make you awe at the sight of a stage [i] (don't get me wrong, it could, and probably will at certain maps) [/i] but to make you shit your pants from the sight of the challenge ahead. So it is pretty, but don't expect anything game changing. By the way, the simple art style is really great, because it helps the game run smoothly for as long as possible. 

[h1] DA MUSIC [/h1]

I [i] really [/i] like the music. Each map has it's special theme and I have to say, the first time I got to the final stage, I had to stop to listen to the whole song. There are tones for every situation and they change often. Are you just arriving to a stage? Most of the time, the music is slower and more relaxed. Charging a teleporter? Prepear for brutal version of the theme you listened to before, cranked into [u] overdrive [/u]. I feel as all of the tracks on the soundtrack hit the mark, because I can't think of a theme I didn't like. 

[h1] FINAL VERDICT [/h1]

I fell in love with this game. I really loved playing it before, after doing enough playing the base game, I played modded [i] (which I highly recommend, the modding community is really amazing and talented) [/i] and when that wasn't enough, a new DLC dropped and changed the whole game for me once again. It's a gift that keeps on giving no matter if you played 15 hours or 150. You always find new and interesting things, you can always try a new combinations and with challenges and modifiers, you are encouraged to play differently each time to get the most out of your time. It feels extremely fresh to find a rogue-like that doesn't feel repetetive for me, even after so much time played. 

I am looking forward to many more hours that I will spend playing the game and enjoying my time with it, as should you.

[i] ""...and so he left, satisfied with his review."" [/i]"

The redesign of SFX, VFX and the overall visuals of the game have made this a must play for me. It feels like it got the needed polish and rework to make it truly one of the best roguelites."

17590,Game just got boring fast is all.
17591,Awesome game! Super addictive and perfect roguelike experience.
17592,It good.
17593,"The game is good. But it absolutely needs work.

I think enemies would benefit from some changes, especially fire-elites. 
They are far too powerful and absolutely annihilate you. 

I also don't agree that the game is ""immensely replayable."" Initially, finding items and learning how to combine them is very interesting and fun. It was very cool to discover their effects, and not simply how they function in combat but how they alter the run. Much to my disappointment however, I found that items are ... surprisingly very little. Perhaps because of how many you can acquire in a single run. I noticed that the game actually has you UNLOCK new items instead, which in my opinion is not really a good idea. I genuinely grew bored and did not feel motivated at all to unlock new items per run, after beating the game once. On that subject, I also do not like the requirements for unlocking new characters. This is more than likely personal nitpicking, but I'm still going to say it - unlocking new characters is EXTREMELY boring after you get the ones that are a bit easier to get. I'm not saying make them all available immediately, of course. I just think some of their requirements are a CHORE. 

(Reach level 50 in Simulacrum just to die from existing and not even knowing how I died. I know WHAT killed me, but the game makes it extremely hard to figure out HOW AND WHY.) 

In addition, it often feels very cheaply designed with gimmicky and unfun boss mechanics. You can do everything right, but due to the character you picked (i.e. Engineer) you'll get absolutely obliterated later on in Sky Meadows when you have to fight a Grandparent boss and their shitty nova ability, which for a character like engineer is often impossible to dodge. I've heard arguments that the game emphasizes movement in order to stay alive, but I'd honestly say it emphasizes being incredibly lucky more than anything. One could argue the fault lies in myself, but I'm of strong opinion that the game can just do much better. 

As of right now, dying is -extremely- dissatisfying in this game. I know that TIME is important, because the more of it you waste, the more powerful the enemies become, but I think enemies and boss encounters can be deadly not because they suddenly instantly kill you <REGARDLESS> of your build and even response time, but perhaps because new mechanics are introduced. Another problem I have is that sometimes it's not even the timer of the difficulty. It's just, again, very cheap gimmicks from enemies or bosses. I know balancing and game-design is complicated, but this is currently my opinion on the matter. I find it really disheartening to get instagibbed out of nowhere despite staying on my toes, being focused and having done relatively well up until That One Mob reaches enlightenment and kills my stupid ass through what I can only assume is sudden nuclear fusion.

The characters and their designs are nice and interesting, however. A very sci-fi look. The designs themselves aren't grandstanding in anyway, but they are good enough to be memorable. I think it would be cool for the characters to have access to more abilities, rather than simply four. It would spice things up. I also admit that I very much enjoyed getting new characters because it FINALLY broke up the moldy, stale feeling of dying on Commando or Huntress for the millionth time despite doing as well as I could (though I could always do better) and having nothing to show for it.  

I will revisit this review in the future, but for now I think I'll leave it as this.

The music is beautiful. There's passion in it. I also revisited Risk of Rain 1's soundtrack, which is just as good. Check it out. 

I want to see more of this universe and its characters. It's oddly simply but very chill ... despite apparently having a very depressing story. 

Also there's some funny memes on the game. Check em out."

Edit: there are 2 people upset I have a differing opinions than them. Reviews are meant to be personal opinions people. This isn't reddit."
17603,"This games has a bit of everything to keep fans of the genre happy. If you like using what is essentially cheats for easy wins, just chuck on artifact of command. You want a true challenge, say no more, eclipse has got you covered on that. The multiplayer is fun and the game is seemingly endlessly replay-able, with alternative game modes if you become bored of the base gameplay, as well as a rewarding progression system with skins for mastery of characters and new abilities to allow for each survivor to meet your own playstyle.
Overall i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a difficult challenge, and the rogue-lite genre!"

Then the full release came around. Then it came out on Switch.

I... have a lot more hours on Switch for this than I do here. I think it adds up to around 500 at this point.

Needless to say, I think this game is a masterpiece. A brilliant followup to one of my favorite games of all time. I promise I'll buy the first game when I have the cash, Hopoo, only now do I have disposable income."

Love how the dungeons randomize each round, with different equipments and items collected. Making each gameplay a unique experience. If you like FPS / 3rd person shooter / dungeon crawler. This game is for you. Better still if you have mates together to unlock all the secret hidden portals. 

The latest DLC for the game is spectacular as well, love the new items and gamemodes. 

Can't wait for the developers to continue releasing new content for the game."

17726,"this studio have made their original 2013 game to the next stage. From 2D to 3D and with a flawless execution ! it is now a masterpice. mark my words !
FIGHT ! LOOT ! RUN ! JUMP ! they are all coming for you !!! keep on moving along with this uniques and inspiring yet stranges soundtracks.
if you doesn't keep up the game will DESTROY YOU ! BREAK the game before it happen !!!

a shooting game ... it's beter when you shot ! just like that game called DOOM (which i love) Risk of rain 2 know that all too well and i love it : there is no manual reload and you have infinite ammo ! you are always in control !
and there is no loading screen in the game except at launch :D !!! you can start a game in 4 clic BAM ! PLAY NOW have fun that's what you wanted !

many ennemy types works like chess pieces they are all differents, have differents abilities and you will have to prioritize your target with your smart and quick decisions. You think while you fight and so you are engaged in the loop from start to finish.

almost every item looted have passive effects leaving you focus on the movement or the fight wile still feeling your power increasing with various effects. You can become a godlike killing machine and yet somehow the game will find a way to kill you at a moment. It would be your fault ! you were in control and you made a bad decision at some point leaving you to your death.

this game is not bound by logic or realism ! it's a barrier to the fun stuff.

go for it !

17731,I got addicted to Spinal tonic 27 times in one run. Fun!
17732,A killer soundtrack. Mod support. Thrilling gameplay. This is a certified Hopoo classic.
17733,It is immensely fun and a great game with or without the dlc i have it on multiple devices

Update: This void God has hands"
17741,ive played this game like 50 hours this week so far and if you like dungeon crawlers and rogue likes youll like this
17742,"Great gameplay, terrible netcode."
17743,"Strongly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, open-ended challenge. While this game is light on story, it's infinitely re-playable and hides LOTS of secrets. If you want to feel like a god, play this.

Developers truly understand how to scale difficulty with reward and ramping player skill. From a development perspective, this game is wonderfully conceived. It's light on graphics preventing crashing under heavy load (trust me, there will be lost of baddies!). The state of flow you achieve while playing this game is remarkable.

This game offers so many features it's hard to break them all down:
- great, varied roster of characters/survivors
- tons of unlockables (survivors, items, artefacts, log entries, etc.)
- various modes to match your skill level or desired run-time
- customizable gameplay via unlockable artefacts and alternate survivor loadouts (skills and abilities)
- concise campaign with adjustable difficulty
- space newt (you'll have to play to find out)
- IT'S COOP MULTIPLAYER!"
17744,Just sheer stupid fun. If you like not stop enemies and insane boss fights then this game ticks all those boxes.
17745,Run over and over again. Enjoyable
17746,if you were to get a Rogue-Like game this or Binding of Isaac are the best contenders
17747,i like this game
17748,A nice game to play with friends! =)

17755,This is literally the best game I've ever fucking played
17756,"pew pew bang bang boss one shots you
"
17757,"If you are an adult with a life, a game that 1) eats CPU like pringles when paused 2) takes a few hours for a run and 3) has 0 way to save a run and come back is going to be a problem. If you are a child or a child-like adult with no responsibilities you will get in discussion board arguments about how this is the point. Dunno what the developer excuse is.

Otherwise fun game."

17786,"Was pretty hesitant on buying this game at first, but after a few hours I haven't wanted to play anything else. I've never felt like I've truly been 'addicted' to a game before, but with Risk of Rain 2 it seems quite obvious that this game has me hooked."
17787,"shoot stand still die repeat
hint keep moving"
17788,meh
17789,Risk of Rain 2 has to be hands down one of the best rogue-likes I've ever played with a wide diversity of characters each with there own unique play styles. Every time I get bored of this game all I have to do is change characters and suddenly it feels like more life has been breathed into this game. On top of that with the new update that was released there feels like there so much more to do now. I this game only continues to find ways the player can continue playing even if content updates aren't too often. A solid 9/10 game in my book.

The two I had trouble with were the grind and the story. It's a rogue like with randomness out the ass so you're supposed to play forever and never have the exact same experience twice. More so if you're going for challenges. The story isn't straight up told to you as much as it's hidden in the log book section of the main menu. You piece it together yourself to figure it out.

17857,"Sometimes I forget just how long a run has gotten. It does take a few runs to finally understand what object does what thing and how to use them properly.... even if that means to avoid them. This game is not easy. This game will steal the day from you. This game will have you enthralled and searching for new ends. This is an amazing game with lots to work towards, and plenty of challenges along the way. Even after acquiring everything there is to acquire and doing all the things to do, there is still a game to play and enjoy. You can make a run as easy or as challenging as you want, and that alone makes this game amazing. If you are looking for a new game that you want to put your money's worth into, this is a game you should bookmark for sure. The new DLC has a lot to offer and COMPLETELY changes some of the things that were originally lacking. Gotta love RoR2."

17977,"Having many different characters to choose from gives you a wide range of possibilities. Some characters are really fun long range shooters while others are melee, tank style, or others. Anyone could find a good choice. Would recommend playing with someone when you have the chance, because it makes it much more fun and prolongs the actual runs you're doing. So many items. So so many items to collect, and you'll probably go a while without seeing some items you were hoping for. Overall really fun, great for friends and a good challenge with three different starting difficulties."
17978,"buy this game, and the DLC"
17979,"I would give it a middle choice if one available.  I love me some first person shooters.  red dead, gto, borderlands....played them all all the way thru,  This one just didn't grab me.  I don't like being rushed thru a level or monsters get harder.   I don't like never clearing a level so I can explore.  You have to jump and jump and jump and race thru to finish as fast as possible or it just keeps leveling up on you.   Not my thing.  But if you like this sorta of chaos you will love this game.  I salute the developers for trying something new."

17989,"Deals 20 Mill. dmg to boss, doesn't elaborate and leaves through the portal."
17990,"15 dollar dlc ruined the game. Now instead of dying to malachites in the first maybe second loop if your rng is poor, you get to die in stage 4 with a good run due to newly buffed burn mechanics and a horrifically balanced Collapse debuff that can be inflicted by any void mob, with the only counter to it being either a legendary item that protects you from debuffs or an active item that only has use if you want to clear debuffs. Thanks Hopoo! 

All in all, Risk of Rain 2 is a phenomenal game with very very little problems. But the fact of the matter is that Survivors of The Void is a paid expansion that makes the game significantly less fun to play, even with all the super cool items. Despite my praise and unconditional love for Risk of Rain 2, i wouldn't recommend it in it's current state. Hopefully they fix a lot of the awful, awful content in this DLC."

The game play loop is very enjoyable and I adore everything about this game to the characters, the stages, the enemy's, the vast range of items to collect, and the lore that ties this game all together. 10/10"

The replayability is off the charts"
18026,"This was a disappointing co-op fail from Gearbox. Really unexpected fail from the makers of what is considered by many to be a co-op benchmark, Borderlands. No co-op players want to sit around twiddling their thumbs watching their co-op partner play the game without them once their character has died. Game also suffers from serious lack of tutorial to explain character and weapon upgrades, leaving the player running around aimlessly while dying trying to figure out the structure. Real disappointment."
18027,Хуйс
18028,YES !
18029,"Disappointing co-op fail from Gearbox. Who wants to sit around waiting, watching their co-op partner play without them after character death? Game also suffers from zero instructions on how to develop your character or upgrade weapons. Do not recommend."

18072,"I've played RoR 2 for almost two years. It's always been stable. With SotV, bugs abounded, which was a huge disappointment, but at least it ran. With v1.2.3, now I get random disconnects when I'm 50 mins into a run, with Mythrix just about to die. Super frustrating. Please fix the disconnect issues!"
18073,"Awesome roguelike! This game feels great to play and retains the atmosphere and feel of the original Risk of Rain. The developers translated the game to 3D so well it's crazy. Endless replay-ability, crazy builds, item combos, and insane monsters. No run is ever the same. Multiplayer works super well and is crazy fun. 10/10"
18074,Just try it and you'll see
18075,no idea why people like this game at all. its terrible. boring. repetitive. im running out of bad words to say cause im dizzy from playing it.

18086,yes
18087,"Risk of Rain 2 manages to be really fun without sacrificing the true Roguelike ideal. 

The formula here is very different from any game ever played. It is better experienced than explained. There are a lot of hidden secrets in this game. Better avoid online guides, everything will eventually be revealed in-game.

There are tons of unique characters who all play very differently. There are varied build options for each character. This game has several different systems to circumvent possibly bad RNG runs. 

This game implements a unique idea of increasing difficulty as one plays. However it does offer a easy start for new players. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for good multiplayer vibes and adrenaline rushing combat."

18100,"Such a bangin' game.

Good soundtrack.  Great sense of thrill, achievement, awe , hope and failure in every session.

New content and multiplayer boosts replay-ability.

Emphasises the same feelings and atmosphere experienced in the first game, while bringing the game to a new depth and literal dimension. Great sequel."
18101,"Fun, died 7 times to the final boss. Cant complain"
18102,"Learn the game and it's fun
"
18103,"First time playing it not like it that much, but when I spend more time into it damn this game really hit the spot.
- ""The more you spend time in it, the harder it gets."" This is how level scaling in this game works.
- Many characters to pick but you have to unlock them first.
- If you love 3rd person shooter game or other shooter game and wanted to play some roguelike games. This game is for you
.
.
Overall - Great and fun game."
18104,"I usually hate (not dislike, *hate*) roguelike as a genre. Esp those that require good timing and cat-like reflexes (neither of which I possess).

That said, with this game - even though I am constantly getting my shit pushed in run after run, I am loving it!"
18105,this games replayability is insane and with the amount of items you can really break the game. also Goobo Jr.
18106,"another game that i got all the way back in early EA but couldn't really get into, despite being a fan of the first game. i figure i should give it a shot (ha) again with the new dlc coming out. let's get right into it.

yays:
+ banger ost (on spotify too) 
+ great artstyle, it's not like it's in 4k ultra HD or something but it 'gets the point across' if you catch my drift. bright colors to compliment the distinct environments in the game
+ characters (13+1 hidden as of writing) are all very visually appealing and each have their own style. each of them have their own unique kits as well that changes the way you play
+ there are a few alternate game modes as well: prismatic trials (seeded stage every 3 days), eclipse (harder base game) and simulacrum (wave defense) to spice it up should you get tired of the regular game
+ good multiplayer experience too. i personally play this game solo, but in multiplayer, you will have to communicate and distribute the items accordingly, which creates another layer of depth to the gameplay

do note though:
- im not sure how they manage it but 2 years later and the UI still doesn't tell you the values that some items have lol. it got better with this dlc (energy drink finally tells you how much faster you are going instead of just saying ""sprint faster""), but a lot of them items still gives very vague descriptions, not to mention the fact that when you hover over an item, it simply tells you the name of it, and you HAVE to pick it up to find out what they do. yeah you could say ""just remember what they do lol"" but new players don't have that luxury yeah? 
- on the topic of items, i know i said each playable characters have unique kits that separates them from each other, but the fact is once you learn what items are good, you tend to lean towards picking them up during your runs. and the items that are good are pretty much universally good on everyone (crits and bleeds, for example), this combines with players subconsciously picking up 'good items' leads to most runs feeling same-y, and the character you are currently playing are just bearers of all the goodies you pick up, so who you're playing kinda doesn't matter
- items again! a huge amount of your mid-late game damage are carried by your items, which means that the only time you actually would be utilizing your character's kit is during the early game grind, especially on monsoon
- final bosses (both main and alt) are absolutely tedious to get to. commencement and void locus are just unfun and worst of all you do the same thing on both maps, it's just such a chore and kills any motivation to go to those maps ever, and i find myself choosing to rather loop and then obliterate to end the run
- this isn't gameplay related, but devs decided that for their big dlc launch they will... not give us a patch note? ""its too big to have a patch note"" ??? brotherman that's precisely why you SHOULD have a patch note? 

i still had a great time, and it is still an amazing game despite my gripes. however, the flaws are very glaring and once i noticed them it does diminish my enjoyment ever so little. i would recommened it, because the time you spend on this game is most likely going to be very enjoyable. experiment with builds, die some times (it's fine) and maybe do it with some homies too."

Incredible game."
18110,yes
18111,GO AND PLAY
18112,"Risk of Rain 2 is an amazing experience for players who like games such as: Binding of Isaac, Minecraft, and the newly created hit Steam game, Muck!

RoR2 is a perfect roguelike game with stunning combat and lore that runs deep into the iceberg. Risk of Rain 2 uses classes and items, similar to League of Legends in which there are many possible combinations for when your fighting black goo encased in ceramic, holding your own against crab space police, crushing the attackers that rise from the earth itself, or triumphing over a literal god as the final boss (a recurring theme in the Risk of Rain series).

Although this game is a masterpiece, like other games it has its flaws. Some people may want a story mode rather than the main roguelike aspect, others seek extra customisation for the limited designs we have now, and some may wish for more content overall.

Whatever you see Risk of Rain 2 as, there is always something available for every type of player, speedrunner, completionist, and just general people looking for something fun. And with the recent release of the Survivors of the Void DLC, who knows what the future of this game will hold."

18148,Fix your controls. I do not have to use a game controller but my headphones use a xbox adapter. If i cant play the game cause you haven't figured out game pad don't make it a option. I looked it up its a old glitch. so either dont bother or fix it.
18149,
18150,There is in fact rain
18151,"Amazing game. Feels like player has really good control over level of difficulty too so whatever sort of experience you want, you can have."
18152,"I loved this game a lot. The challenge it gave me made me want to get the mastery skin for every class, so I did, and I'm proud of myself for getting them.
I recommend playing Risk of Rain 2 Vanilla, but I also recommend not bothering with the DLC.
As if the game wasn't challenging enough, the void stacking damage from monsters is absolutely soul-crushing to the point of where I wish I could ask for my money back.
I get a deep itch to play one of my favorite games of all time, boot up the game, choose a character, and when I get to the 3-4th level, I bump into void monster that, if I'm not butt-clenchingly focused and avoid every single attack, I get one shot and my run is over, and all of that time is wasted.
The DLC character's have to be played in the DLC. You can't even bring them to vanilla to just enjoy them without the excessive ass-reaming.
And finally, the DLC character you have to unlock has poor character design. There were so many times on so many runs where the character turned red and got all angry, and it actually did less damage with the items I was running with. That kamahamaha beam isn't very long, so it's either run for my life and wait until the character cools off, or risk getting one shot and waste the limited time I have to enjoy games period.
The DLC left me so disappointed. I guess I'll just pretend the DLC doesn't exist when I get a craving to play it."

18163,"barely even had the chance to fully explore this game and I'm hooked! Take the physics of Halo/Destiny, mash it up with the sleek, almost minimalist style of Star Fox, or Portal (for you young'uns); mix in some of the coolest-ass sci fi ambiance and concept art, from say the comic book series PROPHET, as well as creature features from Starship Troopers, Aliens, for that matter MUTANT (an 80's B movie gem, ripping off the Aliens franchise), and the near bullet-hell of a title like ENTER THE GUNGEON or NUCLEAR THRONE; yet keeping the hack n' slash dynamics of Path of Exile or Hades, and you've got Risk of Rain 2!!! This game puts every ounce of meaning into the idiom 'run and gun' as you'll be running, jumping, and dodging A LOT, whilst going gangbusters on your guns, regardless of class; ie more long range or melee. It's not easy at first; but after two or three runs, you'll have the hang of it. And then you won't be able to stop!"

18205,i guess its ok
18206,"Chance of Showers Two

gud game"
18207,"The developers actually seem to care. Extremely fun game with an awesome community and endless replay-ability, especially with friends! Highly recommend"
18208,Always a good game to get lost in for hours
18209,"Disappointed, I'd rather play Muck."
18210,good game beat the game in 3 hoours. play with friends to make ezer
18211,i fucking love huntress she goes zoom zoom zip wooo!!!!!!!
18212,"I purchased this game at roughly 3 pm on Sat and by Sun afternoon I had over 16 hours played. This game is extremely entertaining; simply game to play, NOT an easy game. 
Fun, frustratingly exciting... As soon as you die, you've started the next game and are adapting the strategy."
18213,you shoot things then you die
18214,good
18215,its pretty alright
18216,11/10
18217,"Core combat just isn't all that interesting. And the ultimate goal of the game seems to be ""make the rest of the game a cake walk"" by ""abusing"" designed systems. Not really my jam.

Balance felt non-existent. Either I was stomping or I was getting stomped. Very little in-between (where I find Fun). Even within the co-op group, keeping things relatively equal is left up to you and your cohort. In one of the few runs I did, one player did 80x the damage of the other players. It felt like I wasn't accomplishing much throughout the run, which the final screen confirmed in spades. I may as well have not even been there. Extremely unsatisfying.

AFAICT, the fun of the game is in trying out new whack builds that let you just melt everything (until something one-shots you in a fashion you did not know was possible. Which is SUPER fun...). But the game does very little to ensure this ends up being a fun or equal experience for everyone in the party. Instead it is a continuous mad-dash to loot for the loot goblins, and an utterly underwhelming experience if you aren't doing that (or can't, because you ended up under-powered earlier in the run, while trying to figure out what the blazes was going on).

Oh and once you're out of a round, you're just out of that round. You get to sit there and, idk, do dishes or something. While the rest of your cohort finishes the round and you fall further behind on the power curve.

I'm sure this could be fun under the right conditions, and when we stumbled into a relatively-balanced run, it was halfway enjoyable (though I still did not much enjoy the combat). But the ease with which you fall into wild co-op imbalance, or the Alpha Gamer Problem, (and about half the other design choices) make this game firmly in the Not For Me category."
18218,Getting to funny mode and being strong enough to survive makes you feel like you own all the pizza chains in the world.
18219,"Extremely fun third person game. From a wide variety of different play styles across multiple heroes, to multiple maps, items, and challenges, this game keeps you engaged and entertained for hours at a time! Each run you start will be different from the last, giving you multiple different outcomes by the end which helps keep the game interesting and exciting. A highly recommendable game! 10/10"
18220,go pew. many times over.
18221,"one of my all time favorite games. Plated the game on my playstation, bought on PC to support devs and get access to the new DLC incredible."

18228,Bleed is cool.
18229,"Playing against a timer makes the game interesting and challenging. You have to know the maps, you have to take your chances. It works against you if you just sit in place and idly farm exp and items. That is refreshing to see in a game like this."
18230,risk of rain 2 is one of the best games I've ever played and it got me into rogue likes. its also very fun with frens.

18247,This game is really fun to play. But it's usually only fun to play with friends so if you are an outcast (L LOSER L BOZO) then I don't suggest buying it.
18248,.
18249,"One of the best combat systems of any video game I have played. Strategic and thoughtful enemy design combines with fast paced and dynamic game play with  a good amount of RNG rogue-like elements. This game is worth much more than it costs, its basically a steal."

18254,"Very fun to unlock everything, if your the kind of person who likes visible improvement in skill and quick gameplay this is for you. Found myself bored after I beat the game/dlc and unlocked all characters but thats still 30 hours of gameplay!"

With a whole load of characters to try out, AND even more content with the new void dlc? seriously? This game is a masterpiece, and I hope more people enjoy rouge-likes from this game! :D"

It will piss you off when you're learning how to get through the stages, but once you do you will be able to reach stage 20 something and just run around the map at full speed not having to shoot anything to clean the whole stage. 

The game gives you a sense of perfect progression, you feel like you worked for it, like you did your job and got this build together. A garantee 10/10 gameplay.

Most of my frustration comes from 'cheap feeling' deaths. What's that, you needed to get super far away but 
your character has no mobility and you have no movement items? Guess I'll die. Going from cutting down swaths of enemies to unceremoniously dying to something that doesn't feel 'skill based' is a lot of whiplash. I'm sure it's 'cuz I'm still new at the game, gitgood and whatnot, but it still feels 'cheap'.

I am not really into rouge-likes or rouge-lites because I am just not usually interested in losing the items I gain along the way, which is obviously the whole point to rouge-likes. But this one is a rouge-lite, meaning it's a little more forgiving with things and allows you to discover tons of items. I would say it is good overall for an introduction to rouge-lites, and also has incredible difficulty. That is why I play on easy mode, at least until I am used to it and then I will try a higher difficulty."

18439,"I do not only ""like"" this game but i feel as if this game is the only thing keeping me from ending it all. The ever growing pain that resides in my heart has been fixed due to this master piece (jokes but yesh dis gam fun)"

18447,fun
18448,ohhh yeah oohhhhhh yea hhhh
18449,"The greatest soundtrack for a game ever. Every song that Chris Christodoulou makes for this game is a bop. Even the newest release. Gameplay is fun as well especially with friends.
"
18450,reinvigorated my love of video games 10/10
18451,fun game. makes long nights epic asf.
18452,Love this game! This game is always a challenge and the replay value is unlimited. This game is a lot of fun with friends and collecting all the items in the game is a lot of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge and a game to play with friends.

18455,Great game!
18456,"This game is fun, but holy heck some of the update/dlc made it work wack as hell. Can't wait for the patch fingers crossed at the fire tick and momentum fixes. Overall very fun, multiplayer scaling works well and single player works great (minus the bugs from update) still would recommend, just hoping for the mods to come back up. Some shits busted as hell and its funny gotta game."
18457,Super fun to play alone or with friends!
18458,Pretty fun
18459,"Good game

18460,"I have been through 8 breakups, 52 hangovers, 3 credit card declines, 29 squishmallow purchases, and a pack of gum, but yet this game has stuck with me like the bro it is. 10/10, but would not purchase again cause I am broke."
18461,this game helped me recover my broken marriage and 8 children. thank you minecraft.
18462,"The greatest game ever, if you enjoy chaotic endless games where you become overpowered. I know there's a lot of people that hate using artifacts but the ones that let you choose items and drop from enemies are my favorite. You can make a custom build that way and you can get really powerful. I will say that the new DLC is quite challenging, the new enemies and maps make it a lot more interesting. Before, you could become god in like 30 minutes, but now it takes a bit longer and some of the enemies can still one-shot you if you're not careful. Not a bad thing, creates more incentive to keep powering up.

I love love love this game, I highly recommend it. 

The game music is wonderful, but personally I like to put on my own beats to kill stuff to. 

Tbh I legit can't think of any cons. The new DLC released very recently, so there's a bit of a learning curve right now for existing players as well as new. Some key farming techniques no longer work as well, but there's always a way."
18463,Too much fun and solid replay value.  Props to the Dev Team for making such a fantastic game.
18464,hmm. yessir.
18465,"its good, loader is best base character imo"
18466,this game will get u hot alt girls.
18467,was good
18468,love da game
18469,This game is a great experience and very fun to play. All the characters feel different and the artifact switches up the gameplay alot. There is lots to do and explore making the game worth the money. The multiplayer is also great and I had tons of fun playing with friends.
18470,gun go pew
18471,Just buy it
18472,New update and DLC is cool
18473,i died at the final boss an hour in
18474,Good game
18475,"Everything about the game: the gameplay, the artstyle, the music in the background; it is all exquisite! This game keeps you hook in and never lets you go creating an addiction in which you never want to break out of. Amazing game and would definitely recommend to anyone!"
18476,based
18477,It's not a bad game mechanically or graphically but for me it just ends up being a mindnumbing session of spamming/holding left click endlessly at an annoying bullet hell moshposh of exploding enemies hitting you from every direction and random colors and effects that gets old extremely fast without even an rush of fun when you first start. It's just not fun or exciting or satisfying in any regard in my experience.
18478,im addicted help
18479,One of the most ambitious and polished roguelikes ever. 10/10
18480,nights of sleep wasted. I dont regret a thing
18481,this game is pretty cool i think
18482,very fun
18483,This game (along with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic) has completely revitalized my love of video games. Just unabashed fun...what a wonderful game! Great work guys!
18484,fun game
18485,This is fun.
18486,"Great game, fun to play with friends."
18487,"Risk of Rain is one of the few rogue likes that I really enjoy. Risk of Rain 2 somehow improved on the original game 10 fold while going from 2d game to a 3d game in a shift that somehow just works so well and feels so natural. There are so many options and play styles per character, and unlocking certain runes which changes the random item drops to a selection whenever you get a new one makes for a game that instead of random runs you can make specific builds. It's a pretty easy learning curve and even if you die a lot before reaching the boss, it's still a fun game. The music is amazing, the atmospheres are incredible, and multiplayer is a chaotic blast on later stages. Wonderful game that I will surely be coming back to for a long time."
18488,yes
18489,game very gud
18490,shits lit
18491,If you liked ROR1 hit this up.  It's amazing.
18492,still dont know if this is a good game or not
18493,Not until the death screen tells you how you died. Vague nonsense is funny and cool and indie but holy shit I just want to see numbers please I beg you.
18494,I've never been so hooked to a game.

18520,"Hey look buddy, I'm an Engineer. Which means I use fungus. Not fungus like weeping fungus, because that would mean I would have to get off my lazy ass to get healed. I use bustling fungus. For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean brass contraption from tearin' me a structually superflous new behind? The answer? Use a shield. And if that don't work, use your turrets. Like this, heavy-caliber tripod-mounted little-old-number designed by me. Built, by me. And I best hope... I don't run outta fungus."

Also it's got bad UX, glitchy UI, and is even uglier in person than in videos."
18535,good

18540,"Since I came to this game from Hades and at first, I didn't really like that you didn't gain something every run, but OH MY GOD IT'S AMAZING! Please give this game your time. There are so many secrets to find and the gameplay is absolutely amazing. The fact that they switched this to 3D from a 2D game is incredible. There are about 137 items and 37 equipment items that they manage to fit on each of the 14 survivors. 

Overall, Risk of Rain 2 is an amazing game with a lot of passion behind it. Gameplay is great, art style is great, it's addicting, and there's so much to it. I can't recommend it enough."
18541,"Yes unless you DONT want to spend 40 hours of your life in the 1st 5 days of owning the game doing nothing but experiencing ubsurd velocities, damage highs and getting oneshot by durians, then play it"

Great game to play solo and with friends. No experience or information required in order to start playing. The randomization of each round presents uniqueness in each gameplay session."
18566,Just buy it its a a ridiculously fun and challenging game. The character options are all fun and varied. Even the DLC characters are awesome. Just make sure to keep the music on since the soundtrack is also pretty sweet. So yea just buy it already and stop reading reviews.

18628,"At first, it felt kinda boring. But as I kept playing and discovered more, the game became pretty fun and addictive. Definitely one of my favorite games to play. It is very satisfying to see angry mobs get 1 shot throughout the map from chain reaction. I love seeing the money flowing.

Solo isn't so bad but playing with a friend doubles the fun."
18629,It's better.
18630,Have you ever played a game so good that you want to give yourself brain damage just so you can forget and replay the game again? this is that game.

18662,surprisingly a very good and addictive game
18663,pp good
18664,lit
18665,"It's really fun and I love the difficulty scaling because it gets you to memorize maps what items and objects do and you can tell that they don't want you to spend too long on certain areas. I also like how many challenges and secrets there are, overall this is a amazing game and I highly recommend it"
18666,Nice
18667,very epic
18668,"It's very fun, almost everything is balanced and fair. The best thing I think there is available, are the devs, they listen to the community and changes what isn't right. This game also has a great community, content creators make this game so much more entertaining by finding new ways to play the game, whether that is using mods, or playing vanilla. So in conclusion, yes good game. :D"
18669,Just don't get hit :)
18670,fun
18671,"oh mama i both love this game and hate it!

sidenote: i broke my chair because of this game 10/10"
18672,"Ok, i like it, Picasso"
18673,"I thinks we win on Monsoon difficulty, 50 minutes in, stage 5, lvl 99, enemies while we are lvl 15"
18674,"I saw this game played by Markiplier a few days ago and saw that there's a deal- score! It seems pretty fun multiplayer but I haven't tried it yet with my friends (they don't have this game yet) so I played it solo. I never really enjoyed solo games but this game changed that. I enjoyed it very much! It's so fun as you slowly explore the mechanics, items and maps whilst the difficulty gets harder and harder. 3 hours was enough to say that the money I spent was worth it. Really recommend this to people who doesn't even play shooting games! Take it slow and who knows- you might even be able to oneshot enemies!"
18675,nice game
18676,"This game is so fun! Don't mind the seemingly shitty graphics, in game you get used to them and they have a sort of style, overall pleasing visuals.

Game is really fun though and I feel like there's a lot to discover."
18677,Yes
18678,Gun go brrr
18679,"High learning curve at the start even on lowest difficulty, especially with the RNG nature of the game, however once you learn the basics the game gets really fun, and keeps calling you back for more once you get your first god RNG run. Think a MOBA but actually enjoyable. Get ready to play for 10 minutes only to realize 2 hours have passed already!"
18680,"Wonderful Rogue-like with fun mechanics, difficult and engaging challenges, an unique characters and enemies.  Great with up to 3 other players and tons of easily used mods to change up the gameplay or add features."

18853,i highly recommend this game for those who likes playing casual/survivor shooter game. its relaxing you acquire lots of upgrades and then an enemy attack or push you off a cliff :(
18854,"very fun and cool
"
18855,If you want a game that no matter how many hours you have and still dont know what the hell is going on then this game is for you. what the fuck is an artifact
18856,"With so many different characters to play, and so many randomized builds, this game gets crazy very quickly, and stays that way. It's alright when played alone, but friends make this game so much more."
18857,so good i put a bullet in the kings head
18858,nice
18859,Rain
18860,This is a good game it will take you a bit to get the hang of it but when you do its a lot of fun and playing with your friends is also better but i do also wish that there would be a tutorial for the new players due to all of the items in game but besides that its a good game its a 8/10 for me
18861,"Tons of lore, lots to discover and see, always fun to rise to the challenge. a great roguelike, but I reccomend a solid pc to play multiplayer."

18865,Ricky Rain
18866,this game is bad lol kekw
18867,"To be honest. I love the game and ill keep playing it from  time to time. But some of the hard caps they have put on items while adding three new enemies with instant kill abilities is rediculous. Corruption should have a direct downside instead of just throwing hard limits on the player.

Got these new enemies? INCORPORATE THEM INTO A BALANCE SYSTEM. Instead of putting fucking seatbelts on your RNG based rouglike, make it so the more corrupted items you have the more likely it is that a new enemy may spawn with the waves of regular monsters.I can move so fast that i cant see sometimes but you are gonna cap my deployables or make it so i cant have more allies because i happened to have a good rng roll once every 10 runs.

Put a limit on printers maybe. Make a punishment system for corruption using the new enemies. Make it so being corrupted maybe conflicts with lunar items. Make corruption raise the difficulty scaling. JUST DONT FUCKING HARD CAP ME WHEN YOU DONT REALLY HARD CAP THE ENEMY.

Tougher times is a fantastic example of good balancing. The more you get, the less effective they are individually. Thats good balancing in this kind of game. Like god damn Captain cant even use the corrupted fusion cells! And when i get the overgrown item for that new pylon enemy, or the queens gland. They just stop functioning if i have enough bots.

My pc should be the limiter there, computer cant handle it? Well that lag will get me murdered, shoulda ended the run while you could! I choose to take on all those items and ive never been angry when dying to the lag of the game because every single time i cause the lag by pushing well balanced items and mechanics to their limits for a god run. And even when im godlike, ill accidentally run into a void bubble on occasion cause im moving so fast. Or my framerate drops and one of the new enemies manages to snipe me while im stuck because I CHOSE to keep the run going even though i knew my pc would stutter. Oh well start a new run!

Dont hold me back. It's a rouglike. If the next update also has these hard restraints on items because they dont want to do smarter balancing like they do for the happiest mask or tougher times, im just gonna stop playing and paying.

Edit: I have uninstalled the game. I know i talked about having the lag of too many enemies is a balancer. But when five guppis dying simultaneously is enough to start making a new computer with a 30 series card amonst other things chug, you know its abysmal. 
New blind pests hit way too hard, while shooting very fast and having more health and speed than wisps.
I didn't catch the name of them, but the sheep things that hop around are also insanely fast. Making it a frustrating experience at the very least to play as many characters.
No patch notes on how they have changed existing gameplay elements, leading to unknown changes in burn duration. Fire takes roughly 30 seconds to go out at the minimum. Also Days after release and still no patch for the guarenteed legendary items ""glitch"" from rusty chests. The reasons i put glitch in quotations is that with how blind pests and the Xi defense systems function, its almost a necessity to cheese this ""broken mechanic"" to actually have a run that doesnt make you angry.
Corrupted parasites are incredibly small, fairly tanky considering their size and speed, and they glitch into terrain making them impossible to kill to remove the corruption seed.
I paid for this and now i wish i didn't. Not until they fix issues, make corruption items ALL functional and viable to at least a minimal extent on ALL characters, and rebalance the new enemies so they arent hitting harder than half of the bosses do at much faster firing and movement speeds."
18868,Amazing game to play with friends or alone
18869,One of my favorite games of all time :)
18870,"Love it, can't stop playing it"
18871,digital sources of dopamine straight into my veins
18872,"There are only two kinds of Risk of Rain 2 players: those who win on Monsoon difficulty with Command cheese builds, and those who die on rainstorm when they don't get the right items. Either way, you'll have a good time."
18873,(Insert comment of hating to need comments to rate games here) 10/10 rouge like.
18874,"Let me tell you about a recent run I had

-got a red item on my first chest somehow (brilliant behemoth)
-Kept getting good items
-Go to lunar shop
-Get 4 gestures of the drowned (I have the zappy zap thing that turns you into zues)
-Proceed to kill things so fast that I cannot charge desperado because nothing stays on-screen enough for it to matter"
18875,smooth brain thing good
18876,Fun Game!
18877,"Absolutely obsessed with ROR2. 

Fight through hordes of monsters alone or with friends.

Each item is so unique makes the game 10X more fun. 
The art style is one of my fav things. the enemies are cute and creepy which I love. 
Music is astonishing.
you can choose to beat the game or continue on forever. 

Their is also the hoard mode i believe. waves and waves of monsters, great way to test a character out. 
More than 110 items (The more items you collect, the more their effects combine)

best game for killing time and playing with friends.

18889,"Risk of Rain 2 is a fun bullet hell with baubles that can make you OP or trash, luck of the draw I guess. It's a game where you need to sit down and concentrate for at least an hour. I find myself enjoying the game with friends but it's way easier to become OP with items in single player. 

Overall it's a fun game to sit down and play for a few hours while figuring things out for yourself. Shoot stuff. Pickup items. Kills stuff. Repeat."
18890,RISK OF RAIN GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
18891,"Presentation 4.5/5: It doesn't have high production values or the most creative artwork, but the game is visually pleasing, colorful, fluid, and appropriate for the fast pace of the game as well as its genre. What makes it stand out however is the outstanding prog-rock style background music that is just so so fitting to the game aesthetic and I can't explain why. Just listen in spotify or youtube the progression of the song  'The Raindrop that Fell to the Sky'.

Story N/A? 1/2? It has some readable lore but just like many games of this genre, there is not much of a story and it is hardly needed. The game makes no sense if you attempt to understand it.

Gameplay 4.5/5: This game is extremely satisfying to play with fast character progression, short game length, but high randomness in aforementioned character progression (not to mention various characters with different playstyles to choose from). You build your character through items you receive and each game session is different. The gameplay is also of a very fast pace and the sensory input can get a bit overwhelming after half an hour or so just to warn you. It doesn't help that the game doesn't have a saving feature (baffling!) but a mod 'propersave' fixes that without removing the perma-death necessity of the genre. I'll take a half point off for the game having some serious balancing issues like bullet sponges that just won't die, being one-shot, being absolutely overpowered sometimes as well. That imbalance can be part of the fun, but I think they went waaay too far,"
18892,8
18893,"Good game, a lot of replayability and lots of ways to play where it can fit what you like"
18894,Not sure why this game absolutely craps the bed when you try to play with a controller or have a joystick plugged in. I tried to play with MnK while I had my Logitech X52 flightstick plugged in and it wouldn't let me input anything into the main menu. After figuring that out I tried to play it with an Xbox controller and it won't let me move the camera even though my right stick is working just fine and there are no settings to remap it.

18908,"The key is incredibly simple. A stone crescent, with little discernable detail to the naked eye. But if one looks closer, with a sight beyond sight, they may notice the patterns inscribed on the key’s being. The patterns tell many things:

The key’s function: to unlock a lost trove of abandoned treasure.

The key’s creators: two brothers, one composed of ambition and the other compassion.

The key’s hopes: infused into the key, deep within its core, is a memory of better times, and the hope that one day, perhaps things could be better again.

The key’s reality: the bitter realization that such a reality exists only in the past."

18951,"Please God, I want to impregnate Huntress so bad. I want her to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of is beyond divine. I can’t help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see her beautiful figure even though it's behind those massive Huntress Milkers . I yearn for her in a way both primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from her smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to her moans as my manhood throbs within her, I want to hear her heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.

I want to suckle at her motherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from her teat as she gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir her velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. Her cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to her until my body gave out, and then some. I would let her break my rib cage with any part of her body. I would let her hit me with her car just to be near her for a brief moment.

She’s so perfect it hurts. Every moment without her I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want her, I need her. I want to desecrate her crisp general suit. I want to start a family with her and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while she slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.

I want to fuck her like she owes me money. I would let her step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of her feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under her just to catch her drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from her shower drain just to smell her alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep her with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please her more.

God please, I would do anything for her. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on her feet so that I may warm her mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that she may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become her doorstep, so that she may wipe her heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don’t know what I’d do after that, or why she might want my limbs. But I would do it.

My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have her. I want her to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from her fingers and fill her belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give her a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve her breakfast in bed. I would let her eat her eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased her, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.

I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of her car but once. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for her, nothing I wouldn’t say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Huntress' shining face. I wouldn’t even let myself cum until she gave me permission.

I love you, Huntress. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Huntress. I’m waiting for you.

I’ll always be waiting for you."

+ Best with friends but not bad alone either
+ Fun unlockables that give goals to strive for
- Playing with high disparity skill levels is unfun for noobs who get overwhelmed and fall behind on item drops + Pass most of the game dead (Fixed with DLC's wave defense mode)

Co-op with your friends is where it really shines, but solo is a joy too. You're a God one second and you get killed by some obscure nonsense the next. The joy is in its volatility!

The music is also one of the best game OSTs I've ever heard. This game is a delight- please play it if you like hero shooters but don't want to talk to people."

19102,"Super fun rouge-like game. If you want something to get into the rouge-like genre, I would definitely choose this one. It is super quick, super simple fun. With friends especially, this game turns into a great cooperative play, and something you can unwind to, at least in the earlier stages. The music is phenomenal, and the unlocks, achievements, hundreds of different items, and the multitude of different playable characters adds something you can keep coming back to. A solid game, and absolutely one of the best games of its kind."

19117,"Very Challenging but Fun Game, Lots of characters to play and master, lots of items to experiment on and build to plan on as well as the randomizer giving every run unique. Has lots of replayability. Some of the loadouts and items are locked behind a challenge, theses challenges are very hard to achieve but sometimes they make you change your playstyle"
19118,"Amazing game. Since most of the positive things have been already said about risk of rain 2 i want to note on something i have about this game for being quite unfriendly to newer players.

I think the game could use [b] at least[/b] a tutorial of some sort for newer players. When i told my friends to buy this game and in their first run I wanted to test how much would they know on what to do and they were really clueless other than the 'Charge the teleporter"" objective at the top right. No indication on how to buy items or if they even need to buy items at all. 

Secondly is proper item descriptions. Im surprised this one hasn't been implemented into the game (or at least, properly). New players kind of just have to look at an item and guess if its good or not. While i get the whole concept of having new players be curious on what an item does, it would be a lot better for them to see when they hover over an item, a short sentence with a few words explaining the item. It would be a lot more user friendly. 

Also having the option to see what is the current percentage value from your stacked item. An example is the tougher times. It would be nice to have the in-game itself tell you how much block chance you have from getting a tougher time and when you get 5 or 6 more, the value updates and tells you your block chance for having multiple tougher times since its a hyperbolic type stack. (Meaning that the more you stack it, the less the items pickup value becomes less so lets say at first its 13% chance to block, then the next stack pickup is 10.1% chance to block, leading to a 23.1% chance to block instead of 26% chance). 

 But even the linear type stacked items could use it as well like sticky bombs. Sure you can count how much 7 stacks of stickies do since its linear but its a lot more user friendly to have the game to tell you automatically. 

These issues can be solved by reading the logbooks or wiki, searching up youtube guides, overtime experience, or downloading the mod that does all this UI stuff already but for new players im pretty sure they would want to play the game and not go through all this.

The game is great the steam reviews says itself. But the new player experience is terrible

19123,"This game is amazing! I love every moment of playing this game. Between fighting waves of enemies, or finding new and powerful weapons and upgrades. 

This game is a true blessing, if you are a fan of rogue-likes, or shooters you'll like this game.
Every time I die on a run, all I want to do is try again and become even more powerful.
The Survivors in this game vary from nail shooting robots, to Mages. This game has everything you could want in a rogue-like.

Again, I cant stress this enough, if you like rogue-likes, this is a must buy. If you don't have the money WISHLIST IT. This is one of my favourite games, and I've only sunk 20 hours into it. I haven't done this game justice in this post, but this is a masterpiece of a game, it was worth every penny and then some.

19130,"How this this game reviewed so high? I don't get it.  I bought this game on steam sale and tried to give in an honest try.  Here is my ordeal so far:

Play solo for 2-3 hours.  No idea what im doing, run around a shoot stuff.  6 hours later, no runs complete.

Go to multiplayer, try to find a game.  Try to join a game, and 10x times it said 'bad password'. 'bad password'. 'bad password'. 'bad password'. 'bad password'. 'bad password'. 'bad password'.

Couldn't join any game.  try to pick public games only.  Get thrown into spectator mode.  watch some guy kill stuff for 5 mins... how do I join this game?  no indication that i can.  ok, exit out to main menu.  

Try to host game myself.  wander around killing mobs.  after 30 mins... what am i supposed to do?  no indication of that.  eventually i am level 20+.  killing stuff still but its getting harder.  2 hours after killing stuff... what am I supposed to do? how am I supposed to progress? who knows.  No help on what to do.  No one joins my game (wait, am I solo? am I multi? who the fuck knows cause there is no indication what mode I'm in).

19137,"Risk of Rain 2 is a fantastic game. The gameplay loop keeps things interesting with each run being different in that you will find different items and on subsequent levels past the first may be sent to different areas. Additionally, there are plenty of things to unlock and you can play at different difficulties to keep things challenging as you get better at the game. Overall a very fun and interesting game that I would highly recommend.

My favourite item is the Bustling Fungus, Bungus.



A funny story about the game. I bought the game for 2 reasons. It reminded me, and still reminds me of the webtoon Room of Swords. And a former friend played it.
Funilly enough, buying this game sort of directly led to me losing the vast majority of my friends. My former friend who convinced me to buy it invited me into his group of friends who played it and it was fun playing it with them at first. Eventually I invited them all into my group of friends and not everyone got along. Another person joined the first group then into the second. This new person started doing things. 8 months later they reveal they had been lying about a key piece of information the entire time which really creeped me and many other people out. a month later they were banned from my group and things spiraled. Most of my friends didn't see any issues with things they did and they left but others were grateful that she was gone having been very uncomfortable with what she was doing.
Life goes on, people come and go, if someone does something that makes you uncomfortable you don't have to let them be around you. Sometimes other people won't see issue and won't respect what makes you uncomfortable, Sometimes people won't like or respect you, but you get to choose if they get to be directly around you.

Anyway, Risk of Rain 2 is a pretty cool game and I recommend you check it out! It's highly unlikely it will lead to you losing any friends!"

19163,very fun game
19164,one word: addiction
19165,"I don't think I could recommend this game enough to equate the amount it truly deserves. A friend of mine got me into this game and It's absolutely addicting, probably within my top 5 favorite games at this time. It has several qualities that a great roguelite game has:

 - Solid controls
 - Versatile difficulties to tailor to a multitude of players
 - Large selection of items to make every run unique and enable various strategies
 - Modifiers to affect the runs in crazy ways
 - Unlockables to entice multiple playthroughs and find every secret or complete each achievement
 - Diverse characters to play as that each have their own playstyle
 - Absolute replayability; it never feels like a run gets old.
 - Killer soundtrack
 - Stability; I've never had this game crash on vanilla, no matter how much crazy stuff I do.
 - Solid multiplayer experience; easy to set up, easy to join, and is reliable. I've never had any major MP issues thus far.
 - Modding capabilities, already full of amazing stuff on the workshop.

There's not really anything I can say bad about this game. The only minor quirks I have with it already have mods that address those concerns. The new DLC that came out just adds even more to the game, expanding the gaming experience so much more.

11/10, absolutely recommend. Even if you aren't big on roguelites, I would still recommend it."

19172,i see your also a man of culture.
19173,"Fun mindless pew pew with friends.  Good music, variety of characters and unique enemies.  

But remember droning away to relax is good once in a while but don't drone away your entire life away my fellow gamers."
19174,"Good things:
Near endless replayability with procedurally generated maps, unique enemies, and a banger soundtrack.  Game devs knew what they were doing when they made this game a multiplayer experience and the new dlc is shared with the lobby(new expansion characters excluded). This game goes on sale relatively often and there is a modding community as well for that huntress booty.

Bad things: 
The matchmaking online is a little funky with a few random lag spikes here and there(not sure if this is still the same after the new update). Private matches have yet to have this problem for me. People tend to leave a lot mid run since games can average around a few hours if you're good at the game. The other mode is pretty meh but no one really plays them too much so it kinda is there for a bonus. The most fun is when you're playing with friends. I think 2 is the best number to have in a lobby but that is just my opinion. Now this isn't a bad thing necessarily but you're limited to having the ""maximum amount of fun"" when playing alone. If you don't have many friends who have gaming computers it will be tough to play past a few stages. This segways into the last problem, relatively hard game to run. It isn't the hardest but the game is loaded with enemies, especially when you get farther into a run with more effects coming off of elite enemies and your items. 

Don't let this large negative section convince you of not buying this game. It is mostly small issues and rants about minor gamemodes that don't affect this experience much. The main negative is not being able to play with friends with bad computers and many games have this roadblock. This game is definitely at least a 9/10 roguelike for me.

Your first few hours will be spent on a forest cliffside fighting to open a teleporter. The game forcefeeds you the concept of breathing but nothing actually useful like every tutorial post 2013 and certainly punishes you for exploring and taking your time by spamming ever increasing numbers of bullet sponges within the first 5-10 minutes of any run. There's also no indication of said teleporter and you have to figure it out since it spawns in a random location every time.

Timers are not fun and You will fall off cliffs and die a lot early on trying to get to the teleporter and should you manage to locate and pay the fee for the teleporter, you will have to survive a timer countdown. There's no indication of this, but if you step far enough away, you will have to do the timer countdown to turn the teleporter on all over again while being swarmed with bullet sponge OP enemies that make COD exo-zombies look like slugs.

Did I mention that timers are not fun?

Absolutely love the contrast of relaxing tunes against the absolute chaos of later waves. While the level is full of every possible monster with 10 million animations searing into my eyeballs, along with my poor old GPU struggling, screaming out for mercy, my ears are in a state of tranquillity being blanketed by the calming hypnotic ROR2 soundtrack.
The game is very addictive and very fun to play - stacking certain items (Paul's Goat Hoof, I'm looking at u) and using certain item combos keeps every run fresh - along with all the artifacts you can use to spice things up.

[b]RE: The Survivors of the Void Update[/b]
In my opinion the new update is [i]perfect[/i]. As a casual player it introduces just enough new items/enemies/bosses etc without it being too much and overwhelming. It definitely compliments the main game and I can see myself spending a lot more hours messing around with this game ːcozybethesdaː

Getting one of those god runs where you have gotten a great build is one of the most fun things I have experienced in a game. Can't recommend the game itself more.

Hopoo Games are continually updating and improving the gameplay experience. The developers have an awesome relationship with the community and will ask the community to vote on which survivors they want added to the game. I would define it as the gold standard for a game companies' relationship their fanbase. Each of the characters in the game have a unique feel, and there are a wide range to fill out many different playstyles.

19299,very risky game good
19300,First game was insane this improved even more. Each update is better
19301,no rain :( but fun in an infuriating way
19302,"Absolutely brilliant game. Got this game earlier today, and have been playing it for 8 hours straight with a friend. 100% recommend this!"
19303,"This game is my absolute favorite. The skill ceiling is absolutely enormous. I have over 100 hours in this game and while yes, I do have all of the achievements, that's purely because I spent most of them specifically completing the requirements for each and every one of them. This leads me into one of the most important parts if this game, it's fun no matter what. Relaxing with friends playing on Drizzle, FUN! Going hard on a Monsoon run solo, trying your best to get those mastery skins, FUN! There is no part of this game that isn't wonderfully spectacular. I know people who have over a thousand hours on this game, and are STILL playing daily, enjoying this game. Even once you get all the base challenges done, there is still the entire logbook to fill out. Every time you kill an enemy there is a chance that it will drop a logbook entry. There are also entries hidden on every map for that map, and if you get an item that you haven't gotten yet, you get an entry as well. Even just grinding entries is fun. This is honestly the best game I've ever played, and I think everyone should try it, no matter what types of games they enjoy."
19304,Very rng based tho
19305,yes
19306,"fun, especially with friends. 

TLDR: 
Base game: 8/10. Priced well. Definitely buy if its on sale.
DLC: Tad unbalanced and overpriced. 6.5/10. Wait for sale, or buy if you really like the base game. 

Lots of good. Music, character design, level design, and player freedom are where this game shines best. You can play this game in many ways, from god-mode where the game looks more like a powerpoint presentation, to a troll your friends with friendly-fire, to an extreme challenge. 

I have a few complaints. My biggest is that I can't see how item stacking effects each item during a run, without opening the wiki and looking. A smaller complaint is a lack of pausing in multiplayer matches. After an hour and a half of a run, my fingers start to get sore and I need to stand and stretch. I can pause in a single-player run, so why not a multiplayer run?

Overall 8/10. Priced fairly well. 

DLC

As of today March 5th, the DLC is a bit unbalanced and a tad overpriced considering the amount of content you get. I imagine that the devs will sort that out with time however. The DLC itself is overall well done. It expands upon some features in the base game and creates entirely new ways to play the game."

19324,"Game is amaizing and I loved it, however through some optimalization errors, it can be down-right unplayable on certain devices. I have done everything in my power in order to fix potential driver issues or hardware malfunctions, but the game just keeps blue-screening my computer. Thus I cannot really recommend it, since the game might not even work on your computer, and there is no way to know that, hope they fix it :)"

19368,yeah
19369,"*Rushed out a console port during early access, putting an end to hotfixes and smaller patches between large ones
*Incredibly shitty item pool with way more bad items than good
*Scrappers are just a bandaid fix to the shitty item pool
*All survivors play and build the same mid-late game, there is no unique identity between characters past the beginning of a run
*Every single main boss follows the same formula of powering up at low health
*Mithrix is an awfully designed final boss that punishes the player(s) for playing the game well, with Hopoo doubling down on its design in the face of criticism
*Unique artifact unlock requirements replaced with the same generic challenge for all of them, AKA more laziness
*Half of the artifacts aren't fun or engaging to use anyway
*Game is play-tested on Drizzle
*One-Shot Protection is another bandaid fix that doesn't even work most of the time
*Elite enemies, particularly malachites and celestines, eventually turn into damage sponges regardless of how built you are
*Locales in general feel empty and featureless when compared to the first game
*Randomly nerfing survivors and items unnecessarily
*Putting a pricetag on future content updates, despite the game still looking and feeling like an Early Access game
*Void field has become nothing more than an afterthought, it's only use is for acrid, going there for items is never worth it due to how difficulty scaling works
*Eclipse is a waste, modifiers aren't fun, not even seeded
*Some survivors STILL missing alt ability unlocks that were planned since the start
*Good chunk of the items in the PAID DLC are lifted from mods, Railgunner is basically the Sniper mod under a different coat of paint
*Fire and new collapse debuff were made OP against players to promote a self-insert red item
*Devs too lazy and incompetent to keep up with patch notes so they just stopped

Just buy Deep Rock Galactic instead"

19401,is pretty cool i like shoot dudes and get items
19402,"yeah sex is good
but have you ever stacked 20 bustling fungi on the engineer ?"
19403,"This was gifted to me. I've played some rogue-likes and rogue-lites; I do find them fun, overall. But this one? There are countless questionable design choices that all work together to give the impression that the devs do not want their game to be fun at all.

First, communication; there is minimal. Almost all important statistics are obscured, items are not given names or descriptions in places it would actually be nice to read them. Mechanics have no explanations or indications, and must be discovered only through trial, error, and chance.

Visual clarity is also lacking, with barely an indication of when damage is taken, and no indication at all from the direction of its source. Enemy projectiles have small models but large hitboxes and move at speeds too high to dodge or maneuver around. On top of all that, unless you make the decision to remove the (useless) damage numbers, your screen quickly becomes obscured by a sea of pointless digits.

Continuing from note about enemy projectiles, some attacks are effectively hitscan, leaving one to wonder what the purpose of playing a squishy character would even be, when mobility is clearly not an effective defense. And offense proves dismal as well, with enemies all being overloaded health-sponges. There is no sense of any attempt at balance whatsoever. 

When every single enemy hits harder than you, moves faster than you, is guaranteed to hit you, and is a chore to take down; when the game refuses to tell you what anything is or does until after the fact and it's too late; when you can't even tell what is happening for all the clutter in your face; when amidst all that is the fun supposed to happen?"

19415,"3 hours in and I'm already hooked. Definitely a good sign for a great game. Why I never tried this game before is beyond me. The game doesn't hold your hand one bit, just throws you right into the action. Can be overwhelming, but easy to start figuring out what to do and how the mechanics work. Well worth giving it a try if you're on the fence about buying it like I was."
19416,An absolute fucking banger.
19417,"If you are looking for a game to play alone or with 3 other friends.  Hoopoo games has done a great job of taking their original game concept and making it 3D. For those unfamiliar with the series ( or rogue likes), this game has a lot of replay value. For example, There are multiple survivors to play as, and as you continue to play, you unlock different load outs that allow for new ways to experience the game. 

Risk of Rain does a great job of allowing the player work towards something, whether it be a new survivors, load outs, or items.For those looking for a rouge like to ""sink their teeth into"" but also may or may not play long sessions , this game provides a lot of content."

19430,Just have bigger fungus and you are gucci
19431,"How do I even start?... 

Risk Of Rain 2 is a odd game for me. I never liked Third-Person games nor Multiplayer. I never liked games were you have to loot constantly to be powerful or games were its soundtracks weren't incredibly fast-paced either, but this game... this game caught my attention. 
When I first saw the gameplay, I thought the game was bad because of all the reasons above. One day, however, an old friend started playing it and I had money to spare, so I thought ""Why not? I have a couple bucks to spare, so why not give it a try?"" and bought it on 2020's Winter Sale, where I played for a bit, gave up, played a bit more, had my first ""godrun"" on Drizzle [a.k.a. Easy] difficulty, played about 20 minutes when I was bored during all this time and that was it. Fast forward almost 2 years, I was bored and alone at home, a bit stressed and anxious and, ironically, it was raining outside. I was scrolling towards my library until I stared a couple seconds the icon of Risk Of Rain 2. I installed it once again and I said ""Fuck it."" and started playing. I loved every second of it. The soundtrack was amazing, every time i looted a chest i felt powerful and it was so amazing see the boss' HP bar melt...
This game is truly a masterpiece, and if you're willing to buy it, go ahead and give it a try. The devs did an amazing job and so did Chris Christodoulou with the soundtrack. This game is challenging yet fun; repetitive, but each run has a new surprise, a new enjoyment, a new frustration and, most importantly, each run has the amazing feeling of success once you either kill the final boss or get to the next stage during a loop.
If you enjoy this amazing game just like I did, give the DLC a try. It's as amazing as the base game."

19446,"I simply can't all the hype about this game. There are couple reasons, why I gave it a  thumb-down rating.

1. I've only played this game for 15 minutes out of total 20, because the first 5 was looking at  loading screen. :( Seriously? Much 'bigger' games loads more quickly.
2. Gameplay in SP is too boring and to tedious for me. Maybe, because I am not a fan of rogue like or survival type games.Maybe it has more fun in MP or co=op, but not in SP, for sure."

19555,"Great game, great soundtrack"
19556,greatest roguelike
19557,very fun rogue-like
19558,What a lot of games are missing these days...FUN!
19559,"fantastic game, tons of hours of play on it, and when you finish everything, the dlc is a must."
19560,perfect
19561,yes
19562,"Like zoinks Scoob, that's a lot of enemies!"
19563,"Runs go on for hours. You can turn into a literal god. 1 million dps without touching a single button. Then one enemy can show up and oneshot you. Lovely game.
"
19564,is gud
19565,"This game is very poggers
"
19566,love it ! Even got the gf to play thanks to the auto aim aspects.
19567,"So I got this game as someone who loves rainy weather
After 180 hours there was no rain
(10)0/100 
no real risk of rain"
19568,so good
19569,yep good
19570,I AM YOUR GOD NOW
19571,"Yeah, there's a Risk of Pain, too. Mostly emotional. You will die."
19572,"It's good! Only downside is that some aspects aren't very polished, but hopefully the developers can patch it."
19573,"I was playing engineer and was doing a void field and I could not have done anything else in order to make it to the second point. Why would you establish such a poor game mechanic in your game. I swear to god, I don't want to be a braindead monkey that sppams rail gunner every run. GGWP other than that good game."
19574,"Played the first one extensively. Took me forever to find the teleporter. Was killed almost instantly by the boss. 10/10.

Seriously super fun combat. They obviously put a ton of thought and work into this game. Truly enjoyable to play."

19582,"This game is super fun if you want to play with friends or even alone, just be prepared to put in a bunch of time towards it. This game has so much variety between the different survivors and no run is ever the same. I love it!"

Sure, it's a bit hard at times- maybe even unfair occasionally, However. Still 10000/10 on the fun factor scale. I don't know if I've had a better multiplayer experience on a game, (With friends, that is.) Long story short, There's a reason I decided to 100% this game. Would not recommend any game more, please buy it."

19609,"Ror2, ah yes, the game you play until everything on screen blows up at the same time and crashes the game.. Super fun especially when you start off and don't have much of an idea what items do.. Rogue like game where you run around killing things, get items then become stronger. Game on its' own is fun especially with friends to chillax and goof around without taking anything seriously! Game on its' own is fantastic, now the DLC I have a few problems with but still overall good stuff.

Now the DLC introduces 2 new survivors and a good amount of maps/items. The items seem nice but nothing insanely crazy (I was personally expecting a ton of new items with new mechanisms and was somewhat dissapointed).. Now the characters are cool, the railgunner class seems to be a class that isn't for everyone but if you enjoy snipping and doing heavy boss damage then it's very fun to play.. the void fiend dissapointed me as I feel it has some rather annoying mechanics.. For instance the meter for your corruption goes down as you heal which I heavily think is dumb as you try to make yourself Not die you kind of negate the entire point of his character.. this seems to be a problem and for one I personally hope to see changed.. also another thing worth mentioning is I wish it also was toggle to change into corrupted mode rather than automatic because this seems to be very lethal most of the time which is horrible..

Otherwise, for all those who read through my long review, in conclusion to this:

The game itself is fantastic, very fun, and super enjoyable/replay-able as you can create many diverse builds to destroy all those enemies, but the DLC seems to need a little improvement!"
19610,Its a direct upgrade from Risk of Rain.
19611,"Fun, it is on par with the hit game Among Us"
19612,good
19613,good game. play. now. if you don't ill find you.
19614,
19615,Very good. Very very good. Very very very good.
19616,"its a simple goal with a lot of different ways to play it, AND its randomized so it doesnt really get boring. not to mention how its really well designed characters so theyre all fun in their own way. (i havent unlocked all of them yet though).

but most of all, i fell in love with the soundtrack. chris christodoulou is an outstanding artist who deserves recognition. who knew i could be both running for my life from hordes of enemies while also vibing to ""the rain formerly known as purple?"" 

yall did so well with this game."
19617,my shitty laptop can run it
19618,"Do you have an addictive personality? Do you like fungi? Do you want to be an hour into a run and turn a corner to see 50,000,000 wisp? If your answer is no, I can't blame you. If you answer is yes, try Risk of Rain today!
Side effect include but are not limited to: Addiction to bungus, Addiction to the tonic, being a heretic, wisp ptsd, death, wanting to pet the acid doggo, being sad because you can't pet the acid doggo, and a general mentality of ""one more couldn't hurt, right?'"

19645,yes

19648,"I love this game with all my heart. I played league of legends religiously for almost a decade. This is the very first game that has made me want to play something different. Its crazy I use to pick up games and never be satisfied. I could play a game of league and be emotionally and physically satisfied. Risk of Rain 2 items are possibly the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in a video game. The colors pop, animations sparkle, champs are refined and balanced it makes for a perfect gaming experience. I love this game with all my heart I will continue to game ROR2!"
19649,true
19650,"would stack more alien heads even though I'm already capped for cooldown reduction; again
would get a purity thinking it rolls for favorable rolls when stacking corrupted lenses; agian
would get crit items prior to corrupting my lens only for them not to work after corrupting the lens (corrupted lens doesn't crit at all); AGAIN

arbitrary number out of arbitrary number, would loop again."
19651,great game  great mechanics easy to pickup and play but not as simple as other roguelikes i highly recomend this game and its coop modes
19652,"Game good, buy it."
19653,"Not much rain but still a great shooter. Yes, I know this joke is overused."

19656,"If you've ever wanted to Become God by injecting 15 syringes of questionable content into your head and then immediately die to a flaming flying rat, this game is for you. I love this game with all my heart. Is it balanced? No. Can you beat the game? No. Am I going to stop playing it ever? Absolutely fucking not. This game is great, the DLC is great, and the developers care about the game (I think) so if you've got 10 dollars this game is perfect for you."
19657,"This game is phenomenal, but does have a pretty big learning curve. The recent DLC has just served to add some new spice for old players and I just can't really express how much i love this game.
"
19658,"It is a very fun game that I heavily recommend to anybody, especially rogue-lite fans. You can become glued to the screen even after hours of gameplay. RoR2 offers an assortment of different playable characters, and all of them have a unique, fun playstyle. It becomes an even more astral experience to play with friends. With what little issues you may have, the player base has many mods to improve upon mistakes and ripen the experience. In conclusion, RoR2 offers an experience with few complaints that any rogue-lite fans and newcomers would enjoy."

But I've seen it.
Perhaps they just haven't played it long enough, but after 300+ hours, I now realise something.

I've seen lightning fall from a storm cloud of missiles,
I've seen monsters wither under a hail of bullets and my screen flooded with enemies,
I've seen giants frozen by arctic blasts and shatter into a million pieces,
I bring the storm.
I am the rain."

The good parts:
Its insanly fun and has no limit but the lag.
Its also very funny with other people.
The Items were you can build your run how you want.

Bad things:
Not real problem but i had a problem with getting the achievment from the DLC"

19805,"Extremely challenging with tons of replayablity. Get ready to have your butt kicked in every way possible and do it all over again until you've carved your path through the odds.

I love the variety of characters to choose from the unique customization each one has available. Not to mention the absurd amount of items you can collect to transform and augment how you play.

I've been playing since launch and it's a game I return to often. It's fun alone and even more so with a buddy or two.

One of the best games I've played honestly, it really scratches an itch I didn't know I had."

The devs have been refusing to implement a simple 1-slot save feature for 3 years now.
There was a mod called Propersave that does just this, but it's been broken for a long time.

I wouldn't actually recommend getting this game until they implement a save feature since I cannot even dare boot up this game, but it's a good product other than that."

19853,"Great gameplay, artstyle, and soundtrack, runs very well and has great replayability. Not a fan of this type of game but I grew to like it. It is definitely frustrating as a new player, there is pretty much no tutorial or guide, everything needs to be found on your own. However, persisting past that point it becomes much more enjoyable. Would highly recommend playing with friends because its alot more fun, and less lonely. All in all, get this game if you like this kind of game."

The combat makes you feel powerful when you get set up and the movement is beautiful. It does still have some bugs like being unable to exit your capsule at the start of a run, suddenly giving you 99 of every item you have on you and being randomly gift 10k shields in exchange for no more healing.

19899,"TL;DR: It's a good game, just buy it.

As you can see, I've put 13 hours into this rogue-lite indie title. There are many like it in the genre, but none of them do it as well as Risk of Rain 2 does it. And to be honest, I think that's the average time that your typical casual gamer will put into this game. And you know what? I'm gonna say it.

That's perfectly okay.

This game doesn't demand you to commit 20 hours a week just to keep up with all of its content on top of your overly filled 40 hour work week. Imagine going to college, taking care of kids/pets/family, hanging out with friends, going shopping, or just spending time doing things that come up in every day life, and then needing to dump 20 hours a week into a video game just to consume all of its content.

Yes, I love playing video games. I've dumped 1,300 hours into Final Fantasy XIV. I've played the Destiny franchise for over 2,200 hours because I'm a Bungie fanboy. Halo 3 was my first online gaming experience and it was awesome. I've loved Call of Duty since CoD 3 and I actually thought CoD: Ghosts was pretty good and didn't deserve all the hate it got, but we can all agree Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare were trash.

But sometimes... I just don't want to spend 60-80 hours playing ONE video game in an age where there are just so many good ones that deserve my time. 

Risk of Rain 2 is not only something that deserves your time, it earns it by being a complete package at an incredible price especially when it's on sale. It doesn't even require 30 hours to unlock all of the characters, and it takes you about 5-8 hours to get through the final stage (there are 5 of them) and choose the option to defeat the main boss.

...or die trying (I did, many times).

Alternatively, you can choose to keep going. You can say to yourself, just a few more runs. I think I can get even stronger. I think that if I can find just a few more items, I can make a truly unique build. And then you find yourself putting 60 hours into Risk of Rain 2 because you just want to have that perfect run one more time. 

Just take a look at the reviews. Overwhelmingly positive and they have been for quite a while. 

It's a game that can be beaten in 1-2 sittings over a weekend, or you can spend a whole 2 week vacation playing it every day in 10 hour sittings, and you wouldn't even come close to all the game has to offer. It's up to you and how you want to play it. 

It's a good game, and you've spent more money on a Friday night out. 

Just buy it.

(P.S. the game just came out with a new expansion a few days ago and it's currently on sale. Definitely pick it up if you bought the main game already. Otherwise, just get the bundle which has the main game and the expansion. Totally worth it.)

(P.S.S. I'm not being paid to say any of this whatsoever, I'm just your average gamer.)"
19900,"It's fun. There are plenty of long reviews out there so I'll just share what I like:

1) Lots of characters and they all feel really unique (the melee characters play differently, the long ranged ones do, etc) This adds a lot of replayability and ties in well with my 2nd point...

2) Lots of crazy builds. The items in this game are quite fun and can be combined in really diverse and fun ways. I think one great example I can think of is the fun that occurs with gas cans, wisps, knives, and lightning where one kill just starts this unstoppable chain reaction. The game has a great way of making you feel powerful while simultaneously pitting you against powerful enemies."
19901,"10/10 a shit load better then battlefeild 2042.

19927,"This game, does not give a shit how over powered you get. This game isn't scared you'll get bored of it for being too strong. This game will still happily send your ass back to the start if you become complacent or oblivious for a second. 
Very skill intensive but also a little RNG influenced. (that kinda come with the genre tho) However there are 100% ways to push your build in the direction you want to go.
Also the DLC is strait up RoR2.5 
Risk of Rain 2 is a great video game.

(Actually that's a good way to put it, when you just hear the phrase ""video game"" with no actual context behind it. Stuff like this is probably what you imagine. This is the most ""video gamiest"" video game I've seen in years. I've played it for 500 hours and am not bored yet)"

19937,"Risk of Rain 2 is one of the best choices in rogue-like games ever, but without a larger objective the fun may be limited by a players ability to entertain themselves. The general play style of the game revolves around spawning into a zone killing enemies while searching for the teleporter. Once the teleporter is found a player may activate it which spawns a boss. After the boss is defeated and a certain amount of time has passed, the teleporter is then activated and the player may then move on to the next zone. Perform this sequence a few times and the player will reach the final boss and a unique event which leads to the end of the game. With the general progression of the game being relatively simple. There are several elements that make the game massively more enjoyable.

The first is how difficulty is handled in the game. From the moment you start until the end of the game the difficulty is getting harder. The only way to combat this is for the players themselves to collect power-ups to constantly make themselves more powerful. This is easily the greatest element of the system which unlike many other rogue-likes in the genre, Risk of Rain 2 showers the players in power-ups frequently and each of them, especially early on, has impactful feeling on the players performance. This is where much of the fun is to be had by allowing for an endlessly stacking series of power-ups which is only matched by the games always looming difficulty timer which ensures that the player never feels too powerful for too long. 

To further enhance this experience. The player is given the opportunity to select from a reasonable number of unlock-able characters. Each of these characters has it’s own play style and attacks. What’s more is that many of these characters abilities can be changed out for alternative unlock-able attacks which adds to customization and play style opportunities. At the games price point this is a completely wonderful and worthwhile experience both as a rogue-like and as an action/shooter game. The only point where trouble may be seen is in the overall objective and longevity of the game. 

With the games direct and simple progress path. Beating the game on the normal difficulties is not hard. Increasing the difficulty often feels like it takes away from the fun by making the player feel less powerful. There are a good number of things to unlock to including a great many things not mentioned in this review. The problems are this. Characters have unlock-able abilities but if a player isn’t all that interested in the character then there is little value for the player to do the challenges to unlock them. Because of this, only part of the unlock-able content has much value to the player. Without larger and more generalized goals to strive for, regardless of the play-style, it quickly becomes up to the player to create their own goals. Because of this, the games playtime before a player gets bored feels like it is shorter than it should be but still sufficiently long. The game is still an amazing game and I highly suggest anyone remotely interested to check it out. Oh and the whole thing has four player coop so that’s also amazing."

There's not a lot in this game that prevents you from just jumping into one of the most engaging rogue-like gameplay loops ever created. It's easy to pick up, hard to master, with a surprisingly high margin for improvement from the player for how easy the game is to understand. Not much of a story, just a game with an awesome soundtrack that you'll constantly come back to for its intense but satisfying runs."

Unlike other games in that genre, you get a LOT of items to enhance your kit, instead of like, 1 or 2 per level which is really fun.

19997,Fun :)
19998,I wish the content in this game would scale with how much you pay for it.
19999,"A good game that takes all of the fun out of it due to RNG. 

I personally don't find the fun in completely ruining progression because something can spawn behind you, or completely change it's behavior at random to kill you out of nowhere. It takes what could be a consistent gameplay experience into a coin flip simulator. 

The dependence on items feels lackluster. Dodging enemies doesn't always work the same way, even after learning how each on attacks. Sometimes you'll be standing around for a minute at the beginning of the game waiting for something to spawn, other times you're constantly getting things thrown at you. 

Even when it felt like I was on a ""God Run"" and couldn't be touched, as I said before, an enemy changes it's behavior or I do the same things I've been doing for the past hour, then my run is entirely over with no explanation or reason other than RNG. 

I want to recommend the game, I just can't. Far too RNG dependent. I don't feel like I've gotten any better in the last 50+ hours of gameplay because of RNG. 

There simply isn't a satisfying progression system here."
20000,Fun for hours no matter how you love to play

20016,almost had it 100%ed and then they added DLC that added more. Stupid as shit
20017,"I love the variety of characters and their different play styles, it was always exciting unlocking them and their alternate abilities throughout my runs, as well as completing challenges to get new items! Multiplayer is pretty fun, and depending on the difficulty it can be very chill or very chaotic."

20028,200 hours of strapping random junk drawer items and drinking 50 energy drinks to run faster than any mere mortal should be permitted to move and ascending to figurative godhood only to still get killed by some random lizard and do it all over again. 6/6 would recommend

20031,the new railgunner has massive feet. like really huge god dang clompers. also huntress has a fat ass.
20032,good 10/10
20033,"An easy game to learn (somewhat), but a hard game to master. Many different play styles of many different characters exist, if you like going around the map at mach 10 play loader, if you like soaking up damage play MUL-T, if you like the melee aspect play mercenary. Expect to die a lot as that's the only way of learning and getting to the point of beating monsoon. Honestly, a good game and I would recommend it for anyone with extra steam money to spare."

20057,"Quite fun, quite difficult too, enemies leveling up with time is an interesting concept in general means they will outscale you eventually, rate of increase is selectable from the start though as well as modifiers you unlock in previous runs"
20058,"Looking for Roguelike -Check
Looking for Chaos - Check
Looking for a fun game where you and your friends can just vibe and cause chaos - Triple Check
"
20059,"As of writing this review, I've put 442 hours into it, and unlocked 111/112 achievements. [b]Damn you Prismatic Trials![/b] 

There is a massive amount of gameplay content. If you're looking for something to sink your time into, this is definitely one place to turn to, as to unlock [i]more content[/i] you have to complete challenges, which are just that; challenging. All of the challenges are in some way related to the content they unlock. Healing an exceptional amount with an item, for instance, unlocks a more rare one that improves healing. 

Secrets! Secrets galore! Theres quite a few secrets in RoR2, and its well worth it to explore and find them. Some aren't just cool and neat to find, they are just as rewarding as completing challenges; they grant you new items or new game mechanics. 

There are 13 or so characters you can play as; which means 13 vastly different playstyles. Get bored of the one you've been playing? Thats okay. [b]There is more than one way to play any given character[/b]. Each character has a specific loadout custom made for them, but you can complete challenges with that character to unlock [b]alternate skills[/b] to use with them. ""On average"", each character's skill has 1 counterpart that it can be swapped with. Thats a lot of ways to play the game.

Oh yeah, and its just fun. The gameplay itself is fun and satisfying. And multiplayer is pretty great, because most things are better with friends. This included. Just try not to shatter your relationships by hogging all the items."
20060,Best game ever
20061,"OwO, Game is gud for the fembois and bois alike"

20065,cool
20066,"Good, but not great rogue like. Base mechanics are fun, simple, and interesting enough for me to play as long as I have so far. I think the characters' tool sets are somewhat limiting when playing solo (i.e. some being god awful against airborne opponents), but when playing with a squad where you can cover each other's weaknesses, they shine. I do have a few significantly glaring issues with the game, however. 1.) In rogue likes, I think some items should be able to drastically change your playstyle when picked up, which i think is the appeal of rogue likes, making each run feel unique (i.e. binding of isaac's tear replacement effects or hades' varying God/Goddess rewards). I think all of the items in risk of rain (save for the lunar ones) have no drawbacks for picking them up nor do they drastically change the way you play, they just make what you're already doing better. Even with the lunar ones, the ones that make you play a different way (i.e. the one that cuts your HP in half and doubles damage) are generally just worse overall given my next point. One hit KOs/Combos. So many times in this game can you feel untouchable for the first few levels and then immediately die without even knowing what hit you. It's not like Spelunky where your deaths are usually attributable to foolishness or carelessness, rather simple sensory overload to the point where it's near impossible to keep track of all the things going on around you. And again, unlike Spelunky for example, these deaths can happen hours into a run, seemingly out of nowhere. At least in Spelunky, you've likely only been playing for a few minutes. It's very frustrating. So, with those two negatives in mind I think it's fair to recommend this game, but not glowingly."
20067,game good
20068,"""one more game before bed""
biggest mistake of my life"
20069,it is very good rain
20070,"I 100%d the first game with my sister back in the day, and we got this game on release as a combo pack when it hit early access. This is THE game if you want to 'one more game' your way to 4 AM a day later. I 100%d this one hours of playtime ago, and I keep coming back. Modding scene is pretty great, highly recommend ItemStatsMod and BetterUI for a vanilla experience with more stat clarity. 

tl:dr:
10/10 best junk food game ever"

20076,good game if you want to have hours of run and gun.

20122,It's one of the greatest roguelike games in my opinion. Different ways to play the game and NUMEROUS challenges so it's kind of hard to get bored of it. I have over 1300 hours on the game so i know lol. But 10/10 recommend
20123,I've only gotten into this game because of the porn in E621 but I've also had fun playing this.
20124,"Very cool, amazing game"
20125,one of the only sequels that surpasses the original

20127,It's quite good
20128,"honestly, i know its has been said a lot, but risk of rain, really has no risk of rain"
20129,"As someone who played the first Risk of Rain and bounced off, I was hesitant when I had this game recommended to me by a friend. After a bit more peer pressure, I bought in and immediately got hooked. There's something about the Risk of Rain formula in a 3D space that makes this game infinitely more enjoyable than the first installment (to me). Roguelike games are common these days, but only a few are able to capture what makes the genre so appealing - Risk of Rain 2 is no exception. Like Binding of Isaac before it, RoR2 doesn't limit the player in what item combinations they can create, allowing for insanely game-breaking synergies that can steamroll anything that stands in the way. This game is well worth it, even at full price. 

***GET STYLED UPON***"

"
20139,"Balancing is absolutely trash. 100% depends on luck wether or not you get any good items and even then you just get oneshot in a 10 min run by some enemy that spawned inside of you, These kinds of games that are supposed to be ""difficult"" only rely on rng and insanely stupid dmg output. No skill needed whatsoever."

20219,yes
20220,"Love the new DLC, the void is actually hard now and expanded upon, the new corrupted items and are a great twist, and the new items are cool too. The new characters are also so cool and fun to play! The new bosses, void and deep void stages are so nice and its good to have some more stages and enemies to face and the voidling boss is actually scary and fun to play against. But the sword guy honestly needs a buff, when you can literally die in 1 hit after 30 mins on a monsoon run his kit doesn't really fit the the super late game having to launch yourself into the hoards of enemies that 1 shot, hes such a cool character though I love playing him, and the oni skin is awesome! Amazing game in general as well though so fun to play, characters are great, stages are really cool and the soundtrack and sound design are just so badass, hats off to the devs for consistently coming out with amazing patches and new content, the replayability is so good in this game its wildy addicting, and hats off to the composers for this awesome music. 10/10 one of the best dungeon crawler platformers!"

You can easily end up for for 2-3 hours if you are having a good run. You can end a run wherever you want seeing as it is a ""survive the onslaught"" kinda game. That being said there are two other ways to end your run without having to ""die."" You just have to be at the right places for those to be and option. The developers are awesome and keep updating the game and adding new things. They also like to keep in touch with the community with cool dev thought videos and stuff. The music is also amazing!"

20235,"Risk of Rain 2 is an extremely fun third-person rogue-like with excellent game play, vibrant areas and a great soundtrack. The only draw back to it is there is no meta-progression beyond unlocking some characters, where is many other rogue-likes are offering some form of permanent progression which acts as a way to keep you engaged and thinking ""I'll go for just one more run"". But the game on it's own stands, it's really fun aside from a few issues with balance here and there that I wish they'd address. Beyond that, I can easily recommend this game."

(On Nintendo Switch) I often play it on flights back and forth from New York to Ireland. And I'm an awful flyer. This game helps distract me from the long flight and sometimes saves me from the not so great selection of movies too.

(On Xbox) I once sat up until 5am trying to get Commando challenges while my husband was asleep next to me (sorry hun).

(On PC) Only platform I have the first DLC on. Thoroughly enjoying this game when all I wanna do is shoot shoot, bang bang, pew pew. (Void Friend [fiend my ass] is super cool and also adorable, he's replaced my favy!!)"

20268,I've been playing since release and every update just makes it better. 10/10.
20269,"This game is just kinda fun? I mean, need I say more? Believe me when I say you will have a blast playing this game either by yourself, or with some friends."
20270,"Give it a try, what else you got going on?"
20271,good
20272,funni items go burr
20273,"This game is addictive 

bungus"
20274,I used to hate my life but then I played Risk of Rain 2. Now at least I can restart my life. Solid 7/10
20275,your pc gonna do BRRRRRRRRR
20276,You will have no idea what you are doing at first but you will enjoy every minute of the chaos
20277,Just get it you'll see.
20278,if you want a game where you can stack as many items as you want this is it
20279,"hahaha, this one makes brain go brrrrrr"
20280,"I usually don't like games like this. Fast paced, high action shoot 'em ups have never been my thing. this one, however, is the exception. I love this game. Beautiful artwork, great music, and lots of lore to read up on every time you make progress. Each of the characters are fun to try out and play around with. The game a has a wonderful sense of humor, too! All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a group of friends looking for something to play together, or if you are just in the mood to sink a few hours into a run-through. It's worth your time!"
20281,i like rougelikes
20282,"its a roguelike game, its good play it now"
20283,"The Survivors of the Void DLC has breathed new life into an already wonderful game. Monsoon is brutally hard, and Drizzle is a power trip. A very fun game."
20284,"This seems to be an issue thats yet to be solved for some people; i have tried reinstalling, verifying, my friennds have done the same but it ALWAYS comes down to me not being able to connect to their games whereas if i join any other server i can play no issue, the first three hours of my playtime i maybe spent an hour actually playing and the rest being booted back to the menu. for the love of god PLEASE fix this, its clear im not the only one with this issue and i made 100% sure it wasn't my own connection or any of my friend's connections."
20285,LEAN FEIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20286,best dungeon crawler
20287,gud gaem
20288,Ok this game is pretty awesome yeah
20289,"Great gunplay, bangin' soundtrack, gets a tiny bit monotonous in single player but multiplayer is great fun. As far as roguelike games go, this one is pretty special."
20290,This game is an insane amount of fun and is great to jump into with friends and mess around in!
20291,Buy. Have good time.
20292,dlc neat
20293,game good
20294,"This game is super fun even on the lowest difficulty, which I personally find the most fun. I play it with my boyfriend a lot, and it's super fun to play with friends too! You can go over 90 minutes for one round and it's just a blast! A great way to pass lots of time while having fun! Even playing solo it can be very entertaining. There's lots of characters to choose from, and they are all very unique and fun to play! There a mass variety of times to collect as you play, and it's quite easy to discover your favorite items after playing for a few hours. You eventually discover some cool team combos for who you and your friends play too to help balance each other out! I definitely recommend this game, for it is just an absolutely wonderful game that's tons of fun!"
20295,AMAZING
20296,Engi OP
20297,yes
20298,"Really fun, and challenging if you wanted it to be. Lots of hours spent having a good time with friends!"
20299,Give your Equipment Drones your consumed Trophy Hunter's Tricorns
20300,"Careful, this is definitely one of those ""It's 3 am already?"" games.
Great fun. Better with friends. Devs are worth supporting."
20301,The soundtrack itself would be enough of a factor for me to buy this game.
20302,good
20303,"Risk of rain 2: come for the third person shooter roguelike gameplay, stay for the sweet sweet music"
20304,good gaem
20305,"Absolutely fun. Will find yourself sinking hours upon hours into it. Can have a bit of a learning curve, but there is a play style here for most people."
20306,Pick up da game
20307,everything
20308,one of the best game i have played! way better then all of those 100$ game
20309,69/10
20310,"Best value for your dollar, infinite replayability, amazing modding community, amazing devs, 10/10 game would buy again"
20311,"yes
"
20312,Bad game
20313,"i like the story concept,u crash land on an alien planet,u fight through stages,the game gets harder as u progress and the monsters get more and more op.I like the co-op (i would recommend playing monsoon with friends because its realy fun/funny)I like the rogue-like aspects.I like how the game is so cheap and devs are constantly working hard to make this game best as possible.i like the different characters,achievments,different abilities,and different skins.I like the difficulty of the game,it being hard makes it more fun and challenging.i would rate this game 4.8/5. The only reason i wouldnt give it a 5 is beacuse u cant random que with people in multiplayer and there be a mic system for it or chat system.And sometimes theres glitches that make u get one tapped against bosses if u get slammed into them or something.Other than that the game is realy good and there is rarely any time i encounter any bugs anyway.I would recommend but not for people with anger issues,(for it is a hard game).Keep up the good work devs!"
20314,best game i have
20315,"vai loz ;-;
"
20316,"game was already fun and then i got the dlc and it was the best 10$ speant of my life
10/10 would recommend"
20317,cool
20318,"Fast paced rougelite third person shooter/slasher/whacker with a varied cast of survivors, each with a pretty unique style of play. Odds are there's going to be at least one you like to play, if not multiple, and the 3 difficulty modes(plus the special harder mode) means most people should be able to find fun.

Unlocks are rewarding and incentivize playing and experimenting. Plenty will come naturally, and some even become mainstays, and even more require a deeper understanding of the mechanics and careful play."
20319,"Great game with tons of replayability. Core game loop is hectic and fun to play solo or with friends
"
20320,"Playing this game is like slamming your privates in a scolding hot waffle iron while the game developers tell you to ""get good"", and then proceed to defecate in your mouth that is wide open from disbelief of how an Elder Lemurian one-shot you with 10,000 hp.

"
20321,good game
20322,"I loved this game for some many reasons, but the main one is being a god in bullet hell. No matter how crazy the game seemed to be i always felt overpowered and strong. the gameplay and lore in this game are immaculate and i highly recommend it to anyone."
20323,One hit protection makes this game a must play
20324,"10/10 game, negative review because it has consumed my existence"
20325,he
20326,"A lot of fun either by yourself or with others. Can either sink a little time into it, or a looot."
20327,Extremely good
20328,good soup
20329,no
20330,this game is actually poggers definitely better than destiny 2
20331,Very good yes play it

20334,pog
20335,im going to be honest here. this game is great i love so much. but this last update messed up alot of enemy damage to the point of being hit by 1 fire elite early is a death sentence. flying pests are nightmares to even be around. ill change my review once they fix it but right now its not fun to play edit- things got fixed now is good again
20336,"It is like a sandbox roguelike game. The main issue is that there is no improvements to aim, your projectiles on certain characters spread a lot. This is a game where you need the wiki to be able to learn to play the game well."
20337,very good game
20338,"10/5
Funny game with funny moon man"
20339,"gaming
"
20340,"ben, do you love god... no"
20341,Penis
20342,"Great game, I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to see how far they can go in a game.

I play with a friend but I've had to ban him from doing certain things because he has an exasperating habit of breaking the game. So here's my warning - be very careful with the AOE items in the game. Building too many or the wrong combinations can cause the game to crash. 

Hopoo Games, I have a detailed list of every time he broke the game if you're interested."
20343,very nice
20344,very risky very rainy would recommend if vageta in rain or love getting 2 shot after getting a bad item
20345,
20346,Very good
20347,:)
20348,Fun and fast pace
20349,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I LOVE SYRINGES"
20350,"The new maps are so huge that it is impossible to find the exit. Never understood why they kept it so the exit is halfway submerged in between two rocks on the corner of the map where it;ll take you 7 min to find.

The new endless mode will have the beacon just go to places you can't and just kill you."
20351,wow thats crazy i managed to unlcock all achivements in under 3 hours hahahahahah wowo so mcu h fucn game !!!!!!!
20352,super fun
20353,Risk of Pain 2 makes you feel like god or that doge thing that looks deformed
20354,10/10 only game I've ever left a review for
20355,It's a solid rogue-like swarm experience.
20356,pretty cool
20357,get ready play for hours with your best group of friends. sometimes you will get to the point and wish for death but it is to late you are a god now and suicied is the only option but obliterating yourself or fall from a great hight
20358,Pretty good game to relax and play to. Until you get to high stages then it gets stressful but still really fun to see how fast you can kill bosses
20359,very fun bye it
20360,10/10
20361,Its a very good game! the devs love the game too as this update/dlc clearly suggests. Its a fun game to just play casually or to take on harder modes either alone or with friends (its wayyyy more fun with friends but what game isnt yanno). i hope to be clocking over 200hrs total with this update!
20362,is fun
20363,Very very fun game :D
20364,Good Game
20365,dfgcfjhcguvcjvyhk
20366,Great game to grind and play with friends.
20367,"Just payed 12 dollars to not play the game. It was working fine before i installed the DLC but now I cant even get to survivor select without it crashing. I'v tried updating my drivers, reinstalling, and verifying files but none of them worked. More compatibility for lower end graphics cards would be much appreciated."
20368,"I sincerely love everything about this game. Graphic style, music, different play styles from the characters and loadouts, it's second to none."
20369,better than sex
20370,"Fantastic rogue like ""dungeon"" crawler. I have gotten a few friends to buy and play it and now they cant stop playing it. I cant recommend this game enough. After every run you just want to go back in and play another."
20371,did you say addicted?
20372,"Too good of a game, we as humans don't deserve this much fun. Would rate 10/10 in every aspect of it."
20373,"This game is fun, and with the survivors of the void just coming out, it leaves a lot more to be explored, which is wonderful. I highly recommend this game to everyone who reads this, and i wish you all a good day."
20374,"I keep dying because I'm awful at this game, but I don't know that I've ever played a better game in either the roguelike or bullethell genres. If only I could get a god run on monsoon like the good ol' days."
20375,GUD GAME DOWNLOAD NOW
20376,ye
20377,got me and my homies creaming hard
20378,yes
20379,my friends wont stop making fun of me for being shit at it
20380,"I like the characters and style, the items are interesting and the way they stick to your character, but I can't recommend the game because of the RNG.
I have won on harder difficulties and have no problem winning with the items I have been given and have unlocked everything, just in the end it is not fun! Other games have made RNG more fun. (Gunfire Reborn, Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, Immortal Redneck and probably more!) I would actually recommend Gunfire Reborn for a similar experience that lets you actually have fun!
"
20381,Brainstalks burns holes into my skull
20382,More content for an already amazing game!
20383,This is the only game ever.
20384,"Great game, but I cant launch the game right now so its an L atm. 

I have the game on console and I have to say its a very fun and unique game. Friends make it better."
20385,"I find that the replay value is unparalleled when compared to any game. It's extremely challenging and can even be made more challenging depending on the players choice. This game is filled with many characters who play differently. Which allows the player the choice in play-style. There are in-game mods that can change/enhance the game-play per choice, as well as difficulty. I thoroughly enjoy this game, and will for many hours to come. I think many people who give it a chance will enjoy it too."
20386,good
20387,Kinda good
20388,Best Co-op game I have played so far in 2022
20389,Big Chungus
20390,This game is like enter the gungeon but less cool
20391,Pray To Allah
20392,"Among Us with a Bungus, he trade it for a Wungus."
20393,One of the best games I ever bought on steam.
20394,"cool
"
20395,"Great Dungeon-like game! The classes all have their different perks and advantadges which allow for a large variety of gameplay style, not to mention that each class also has multiple abilities that can be swapped in and out to further customise your playstyle. Multiplayer connection is great if you play in closer servers and the concept is original and unique!

The way items work is great too, even without the artifact of command, getting randomised items can either ensure saftey or total chaos. And even with artifacts, the game still requires you to be able to use your class well on the harder difficulties. You'll never know what you're getting, so you have to adapt to what you have and work well with it if you want to live

As for the Survivours of the void DLC (Gifted to me by a friend, thank you!), i'm also finding that extremley fun! the new boss is very challenging, I love the railgunner class already and i can see that this game has a lot of potential

When starting the game, it may look very difficult (try playing on drizzle first) but you'll slowly get the hang of how it works and soon you'll be able to easily solo the game yourself!

It's a nice game to play with friends, it's unpredictable and You'll always experience something different.

One of my favourite games on my steam libary, I highly reccomend this!"
20396,good game
20397,I want to fuck Huntress
20398,"Get items, become god, die by greater god, restart, get more and better times, become god but better and die by beings that even gods fear....and then have your game crash because you are too op, love this game can only recommend!"
20399,its good

20415,GOOD ASS GAME. LOVE THE ART AND CO-OP IN THIS GAME. THE  ATMOSPHERE IS SO GOOD. GREAT TO PLAY AT HOME DURING COVID. I CANT GO OUT SO I AM GRINDING  RISK OF RAIN BRUHRHRHRHRHRHR BREUH BRUH
20416,Unstoppable force to dead within 1 second simulator
20417,"This game somehow manages to be casual and completely engrossing. Fun solo or with friends, easy to run, and overall fun to experiment with; Risk of Rain 2 is one game you need in your library."
20418,This is epic
20419,very enjoyable. Grab a drink and the bois and beat the game
20420,Game good
20421,This game is crack
20422,"I've wasted much time on this game, and I will continue to do so. It's brilliant."
20423,"currently getting fucked in the ass in sky meadow because i'm a slow lil' fella
10/10 good game
(fr tho this game is amazing, buy it)"
20424,Shovel
20425,"""if everything is busted, nothing is""

-Sun Tzu while making Risk of Rain 2"
20426,So like basically I enjoy this game
20427,New void update very hard
20428,amazing
20429,Very addicting and very fun. Fast paced and tons of builds to try out. Best one is stacking speed items and flying across the maps in 2 seconds. Great fun
20430,Is good
20431,"Dope art, dope replayability, incredible vibes, smooth as butter"
20432,Good soup
20433,10/10 game made 11/10 with new DLC.
20434,"Like everything
Hate nothing
Would like to see more variety in character cosmetics"
20435,"RoR2 is a seriously addicting and fast-paced third person shooter with a wonderful graphic art style and presentation. The gameplay here is sick to boot! It starts off slowly as you build your character's strength through collecting power-ups from killing enemies, all the while searching for the boss encounter on a timer that counts down to your doom by raising the game's difficulty. 

Each character type has different inherent functions and abilities as well so there's tons of replayability in picking new faces to see who does what and how and if they suit your play-style the best.

I've only put a couple of hours into the game so far but I'm expecting to extend those hours soon. I always come back just now and then to push myself a little further, while also having turns with friends and roommates."
20436,gg
20437,wax quail SUCKS. buff artificer
20438,great replayability

20442,"A fun roguelike that just got a new DLC, it focuses on a 3d-roguelike gameplay loop, where items enhance your offensive, defensive, or utility power"
20443,It's pretty fun
20444,bread 👍
20445,"The randomized nature makes it quite addictive and entertaining, heaps of fun."
20446,"good game
"
20447,fun
20448,Best Game Ever! You will 100% get your money's worth of playtime even if you don't traditionally like rouge lites. This takes the gaming format and seemlessly transitions it into a 3D shooter with perfect execution. This game will have you playing it again and again making you want to learn everything about the unlimited ways to build your character!
20449,ahaha
20450,"good game much play
"
20451,Maybe the real rain was the friends we made along the way
20452,I'm addicted to this game now
20453,good stuff

Best feeling in the world along with the amazing rogue like experience"
20455,this game is great
20456,game that i like to game
20457,bungus
20458,the game hates me but i love it anyway
20459,Really worth checking. but it wasn't made for me who have no friend. solid 9/10
20460,Jesus Christ himself made this game
20461,"This is one of the very few games that manages to do better than its prequel.

When I first heard Risk of Rain 2 was going to be 3D I was dubious. So many games fall flat in their sequels and being 2D is what helped the original keep it's fast pace and chaos. Risk of Rain 2 adds more chaos and mayhem than ever before at an equally fast paced. It's a Rogue Like in it's own league and instead of nerfing the most OP builds the devs decided to unleash enemies and bosses that will still challenge you when you become godlike! And I'm not talking bullet sponges (looking at you borderlands!!!) I'm talking enemies that will actually force you to pay attention and keep you on your toes.

Despite being a Rogue Like you'll find the game has a depth of hidden secrets that you'd expect from a Metroidvania. It's not a game you play for the story, it's the kind of game that has a beautifully crafted gameplay loop which you can lose yourself in for hours. It also offers mechanics to make the game more deterministic and the devs don't care which path you choose. If you want to turn on a bunch of stuff to help nail a specific challenge then the game will allow it. There's no right or wrong with RoR, play it your way and hey, if you find yourself wanting more after you 100% it... Then hit up the modding scene!"
20462,This game is the best game i have ever played
20463,"hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh rain
"
20464,Top game
20465,veryfuan
20466,yeah this shit good yea

20472,It's installed on the good harddrive.
20473,Would heavily recommend. A game with one of the greatest replayabilities.
20474,great game with friends
20475,Apparently the risk of raining in this game is quite low.
20476,Probably the best coop game I've played by far.
20477,You're telling me a plasma shrimp fried this rice?
20478,"Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg… and my arm… even my fingers. The body I’ve lost… the comrades I’ve lost… won’t stop hurting… It’s like they’re all still there. You feel it, too, don’t you?"
20479,A very neat 3rd person shooter roguelike... Best in coop!
20480,"monsoon aint easy

20488,"Enjoyed what I've played in the first 3 hours but have a major concern about visual clarity. I am completely unable to figure out what is happening at a given moment in a match unless I've already encountered it at least 5 times. The visual indicators as to 'this is dangerous' or 'this will be dangerous in a moment' or 'don't stand there' all wash together into a mess of flashing lights and pixels. I guess it goes away with time and memorization of what effects come from which enemies and so on, but it made every moment of the first 3 hours either 'this is tediously easy' or 'I am going to die and I don't know why'


At 20ish hrs: As expected, I've acclimated to the visual mess through exposure, but I still find it a negative. The gameplay loop is compelling and as I've started to become familiar with the equipment I find myself thinking a bit ahead in terms of possible combinations that could match well with what I have. I've tried the commando, the huntress, the engineer, and the railgunner, and while all feel unique in playstyle, they do not feel even in terms of efficacy. A 'bad' railgunner run is always better than the best of the best huntress runs I've managed, for example. Maybe that has more to do with me than with the game, but I feel that the unique strengths of each class are not always comparable. Huntress is sold as the 'fragile but fast and deadly' character, but her ability to sprint while firing is mostly nullified by the fact that sprint can only be applied in a forward direction, and her shots lack punch, leaving her as the 'fragile, weak, and also gravimetrically drawn to her death' class unless certain items are found. Railgunner is sold as the 'long range single target killer with limited mobility' but in reality is the 'all range damage dealer with crowd control ability instead of dodge who can shoot around corners and oneshot bosses with a short cooldown' character. Commando is sold as the 'reliable all arounder' but is really the 'inaccurate at long range without enough damage potential to compensate but at least you get a stun attack without needing to find stun items' character As you can see, the reality rarely matches the sales pitch. No character (except huntress) feels 100% bad to me so far, just uneven.

Since there are few tools available to eliminate randomness, this makes every run a complete crapshoot (not good, not bad, just the way it is) though having now looked at the wiki extensively to try to combat the lack of information about enemies and item specifics, there is apparently an unlockable that allows item selection. 
Level design is good, but the visual clarity rears its head again because it's often impossible to determine at a glance whether a slope is traversible or not. My character can sometimes walk up near vertical cliffs and other times cannot walk over small bumps in the terrain. Eventually, I'm sure I will memorize which paths work and which ones don't and won't notice this issue anymore, but it further exascerbates the already punishing early game arbitrariness. If I sprint past a boss towards a slope that has cover at the top, only to find the slope is impassable, that's GG for that run."

Its a complete dopamine overload and at the same time makes me want to force feed myself a double barrel shotgun. utter perfection 10/10 worth more than i payed for it. Rex can kiss my nuts"
20491,"Get so strong nearly godlike but got 1 shot from the boss when he is 1%hp, really good game"

I don't know what's going on, but it's fun to shoot things with this sick bow

2nd week playing:
This is a lil cosmic horrory, but still fun

300 hours in:
The crabs will detain me. Parents and Grandparents will crush and hurl me. I must avoid the reavers to atone for my sins."
20495,cool game
20496,Fun with Friends and single player isn't bad either.
20497,it good
20498,"One of the absolute most enjoyable games I have every played. You can play however you want to play, plenty of different character options, also plenty of different options for builds. The DLC is also worth it too, adds plenty of extra content too. Something else thats a bonus too is there is a huge modding community for the game, so if you do get sick of the base content pumped out by the devs, then while your waiting for the next update, you can download some mods to add new monsters, stages, characters, and etc. 100% worth it if you like rogue likes, or if you have never played them before. Also extra fun with friends."
20499,"ROR has been an amazingly satisfying (and frustrating in equal amounts) experience, but Risk of Rain 2 along with the new DLC is simply very very good entertainment, especially with good teammates to multiplay with. The whole reason I even came to write this was because I'm in a new map/stage and the visual scene, the art is astounding. I could get high just watching this."
20500,Quite fun game with lots of replayability. Combat is fast paced and fun
20501,"Super fun, great way to spend time

20502,It's like cocaine but kids can have it.

20504,"The first game was amazing! I literally logged into my PC for the first time in months and steam pops up with Risk Of Rain 2 ?!?!?!?! I've truly been living under a rock (Queue the I'm not worthy bow from Wayne's World) I've got about 4-5 hours in already and it's just everything you could imagine. This game brings all of the mechanics and love of the first one, rendered in 3D! Whew, I'm going to need rehab after this one.. Great work! Will be checking out the new DLC as well!"

20507,10/10 wasted hours of my life just to die from a stupid lizard over and over
20508,"I want to start this review with a response to a review I saw a while back about this game in comparison to Binding of Isaac. The complaint was that Binding of Isaac's items change the way you play the game with new abilities, while RoR2 only changes your stats. While that's mostly true, the person reviewing forgot to mention the characters. In Isaac, you are the same dude, all the time. That's why the items inside the runs change your playstyle. In RoR2, you have an abundance of vasty different characters, all of which play the game in a completely different way. The game solves the ""items don't change much"" problem with the playstyle of the characters, and the different abilities to unlock. Overall after 200 hours in the game, I can say that I'll be playing even more with this new expansion coming out, and it's worth every penny!"
20509,So fun to play. Just be prepared to f*ck up your sleeping schedule.
20510,its like the first game but 3d and curvy
20511,Yes.
20512,Cool beans.
20513,"Great game, cant recommend due to the DLC CHEESE. For day 1 owners this game will now cost a total of 45$ After DLC 1. Thats right DLC 1! This shit gonna be like every other game now, infinite DLCS, season passes. Its a damn shame. Devs got too greedy,"

20526,lean update has been great so far i can almost see the enemies in the simulacrum
20527,One of the best games I have played in years. Highly recommend to anyone.
20528,I love this game. Simple mechanics with complex mastery skill levels. Its a roguelike looter shooter that allows for almost infinite customization of the characters.
20529,"
Just! It's a 'good game' but I wish they told you where the teleporters are, or some mild kind of visual indication. It's that irritating I'm still in two minds as whether or not it's a thumbs up or down. 

I'm not even sure why the mechanic is there. The game is basically run around shooting enough things to get money to buy items from random drops ready for the final boss at the teleport. You have to move around to explore anyway and it's a GREAT fun formula.. but then if you can't find the end of level boss at the teleporter it just becomes this endless trail of mobs following you while you circuit the same maps. 

It's more fun to give up and restart the run than it is to keep doing laps. Good game but god I wish that part wasn't in it."
20530,Only game where you can get scammed by a massive blue newt. 10/10.

20537,"hectic game, love stealing others items :D
great time pass or just to mess around w friends
"
20538,"Easily, one of my top 10 games of all time. 
Risk of rain offers a very versatile and fulfilling gameplay that I can almost assure everyone will enjoy it a lot. 
Not only the gameplay is smooth and balanced, the soundtrack surrounds you with depth and immersion.
And if you add a really good expansion so good performance and content wise, it makes me note that we have just get used to receiving half baked games, with hotfixes on launch, and poorly executed mechanics for as much as the game itself.
Risk of rain 2 is a gem. I totally recommend it, especially if you play with friends."
20539,game is fun playing solo and even more fun just playing in a discord server with friends
20540,juice
20541,"Fantastic game with lots of replayability.  Play alone or play with friends it does not matter, go shoot and kill your way through the levels and have a blast.  The game is cheap for what it gives you in fun and i would also recommend the DLC."
20542,very good game with purple dog

Compare to [spoiler]Deep Rock Galactic[/spoiler], Risk of Rain 2 gameplay is much more fun.

What this game lack is the map is not  procedurally generated map, when lose, have to start from the very same map even though drop at different place.

Otherwise, thanks for develop this game, i having good gameplay :D."

20570,"Major improvement on Risk of Rain 1, super fun with friends."
20571,awesome game
20572,"Loved the game, especially when i had a friend or 2. But there are some bugs in the dlc that just came out. I tried to new game mode. and made it to wave 15 no issue. But i guess there is a bug where enemies spawn but u cant find, see, or shoot them. So when the void started to close I looked for the dmg that the void does. There was no dmg so i lost a run because a bug made invincible units. Other then this bug i love the game and want more people to play with."
20573,Yes
20574,"THEY ADDED GUP. BEST BUDDY 

Disclaimer : You need DLC to give GUP a kiss."

1 content update in 2 years.

The content update is god awful.

Where's the balancing? Fu**ing flying green things kill you in like 5 hits and shoot fast asf and spawn a ridiculous amount on monsoon."
20589,"Ok, 56 minutes in a run, on monsoon, zone 8, last zone before i can obliterate and get my mastery skin...
Fly hits me in the face, i blink, die in 1 hit. I cry. I go again!

Best game ever!"
20590,loved it
20591,its good
20592,good game many fun
20593,"I would recommend it with friends, or even alone, if you like shooting at random monsters that eventually lead to chaos. Just don't play with friends who rage"
20594,"Still screwed in the end if you've been unlucky and haven't gotten any movement speed upgrades to beat the detonation timer. -rep. 
Waste of an hour of my time. 45 minute monsoon run to mastery only to be screwed by how slow your new useless survivor is."

20614,The best
20615,"Fun and overall pretty polished game, but if you don't like high score/arcade-y type games then you won't like this game. For me, I need progression and I can't just keep playing the same game over and over.

20616,i am in love with this game i will marry it according to bensjamminwithu i will marry it thank you
20617,"So i've played Risk Of Rain 2 now for about 162 hours in total. I play almost exclusively with my GF. We have so much fun playing the base/vanilla game and even more with mods. Especially the Dragonball Mods.

The void expansion gave so much more to the game whilst keeping the same formula and thats why I love it. I've had more fun 1 shotting bosses on monsoon with the Railgunner than I have throwing fully charged Kamehameha's at them. Something uber satisfying about just drilling a boss in one shot."
20618,good game people say its to hard to go to the next level but thats what it needs to happen it needs to be hard really fun game 10 out of 10 10/10.                                                                                                                                                      play it evrey day.

20629,"Its fun for the first 20-40 hours, they ruined the game by removing endless runs by default and making it end boss oriented and now you wana fucking sell DLC's? Fucking joke, doesn't support cloud saves, or atleast they dont fucking work, and everything is local saves with host based matchmaking, this was a passion project who got money hungry, buy it, play 2 hours, refund. NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE. Went down the drain just like the developers common sense

PS: early beta tester here, this game went from legendary to being worse than a shield gen pickup while holding 5 shards... I'f a developer ever sees this, you fuckin fucked it up you greedy mf'ers, from passion to being pissed on with systems straight up not being developed, LIKE A FUCKING WORKING SAVE FILE"

with dlc is great game"
20640,"Risk of Rain 2 is probably the best Roguelike I've ever played, it sits besides Hades in my ranking of the best games in the genre. After the first game, I didn't think it would be possible to reinvent the formula the developers created in such a way that the spirit would remain basically intact, but they did it. The game stands out mostly because it's not afraid to be a videogame, and it is a mix of tight gameplay, nice (yet simple) art design, utterly bonkers progression, and amazing music. The only bad thing I can say is that when things get really crazy on a play session, the game might stutter a bit, what with the enormous amount of enemies, projectiles, and effects on screen, but it is by no means unplayable, just a little annoying (Until it isn't I guess).
Anyone with a passing interest should buy this game, it is well worth the (frankly small amount of) money, and it comes with multiplayer too, for those who want to play with friends.  And now with the new expansion, there's even more content to enjoy. 
"
20641,"An excellent 3D iteration on one of my favorite 2D indie games! It's a worthy successor in nearly all aspects to the first. I only wish the final boss stage here was as fun and more similar to the first game's. But, I can always loop instead."
20642,God I love this game.
20643,bungus amongus
20644,Amazing 3rd person rogue like that just keeps me coming back time and time again. New expansion is amazing value for money as well.
20645,"One of my favorite games to kill time with. Whether you're in the mood to play a rage game or even just to relax, this game will sate that hunger"
20646,"Game insanely fun with friends, and with the DLC recently released, there's even more dumb fun to be had.
It's a good game when I can stack 50 mushrooms on my engineer turret and have the healing radius cover the entire stage.

20652,LAB KO
20653,"This game is wonderful. Hours upon hours of reckless fun, combined with strategic item-building and run-crafting. While RNG is a big part in how your run will go, the game gives you many options of changing how your run will go. The game can be a laid-back experience, or an intense fight for your life - difficulty is serious. The hardest difficulties will see you suffer and the easiest will let you go for stupid ideas or use it as a background game,

The newest DLC adds in an incredible amount of new synergies and run ideas, while adding in two very fun characters and many new stages. From the amount I've played of it (about 10 hours) the DLC is definitely worth it. Heavily recommend both the game and dlc!"
20654,its cool
20655,"Music goes hard, Gameplay is chaotic and incredibly fun and only gets more wacky as the game drags on

11/10 would fly back and forth the entirety of each map as mercenary again"

Outstanding game I would recommend this to anyone and everyone that has friends to play with"

20658,fun game. PLAY THIS
20659,Great game can spend several hours just messing around killing things with friends if you have any if not still fun as heck mang. Great replay ability with the different items you can get and with how hard the enemies get later in the runs.

20673,"It's hard in the beginning, and they don't explain much; after each run you'll unlock weapons, characters, and other secrets depending on what/how you did. So it becomes 'easier' once you have a few more weapons unlocked. I'd recommend play it on 'easy' until you unlock most of the weapons (probably like 5 to 10 runs depending on how good/lucky you get). Also, try all the characters; All of them have a unique play-style and most likely you'll find one that suits yours. With all that being said... At the time I've played 49 hours and I've only 'won' 4 times (although I've gotten very greedy one strong runs). Fun game!"

20720,"This was literally my FAVORITE game.. until they decided the clock should continue to run in the void. Genuinely, I need an answer, WHAT THE FUCK. WHY.

Fantastic game, (theoretically) exciting new DLC, and yet they completely ruined the void. Unless they fix this please, DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME! Don't buy it. Please don't. This was so unnecessary"
20721,very fun to go brainless on
20722,"Game is very fun and with high replay-ability. I will say though that when your character does have incredibly high movement speed there can be a motion sickness aspect to it. But this has only happened 2 times,  and this is only personal experience, this can be different for everyone."

20845,"(I only have 135h on this game according to steam, but adding in what i played on console and on my brother's account, I have a bit over 700h. So... Yeah.)

The base-game itself is amazing. Learning the rules, what works and what doesn't, and defeating the bosses for the first time is difficult, but very rewarding. 
After the first few hours, the initial excitment fades, but the fun doesn't. In it's place is exploring all the potential synergies items can have, and where they can be used. The many more challanging unlockables and game modifiers slowly become more appealing and completing the game with insane rules in place (both limiting you, but also opening up the way to otherwise unplayed strategies). 
And when all that is done; when you have completed all the achivements, used all the artifacts, there is one more aspect of the game left to play...

Mods. Oh lord, the mods.

Through use of Overwolf and over similar Mod Managers, you get access to well over a thousand different mods. Some are down right bad, or just not worth it, but others add fun new elements to the game that can make you play for far longer than you originally thought you would. 

Oh, and the dlc just launched. Time to play that too~~"

20887,i made myself god
20888,hum yes
20889,this is one of the best video games ever. stop looking at reviews get some freinds if you have any and play the game
20890,"Fun game when RNG doesn't ruin your runs. One of those games where 'difficulty' means the devs put more and more enemies on the screen, and 90% of items are worthless until you get 3, or more, of that same item. Nothing beats the feeling of playing 20, or so, minutes in a single run, just to have it end because the game decided your efforts are in vain. Not because you played poorly, but because you weren't given good items to buy. 

When everything goes your way, the game is a blast. When it doesn't, it's usually a miserable time where even the tiniest mistake is punished. If you play video games to compensate for something in life, or to get upset over something, this is your game."

I enjoy this game and I hope this reaches people who use Geforce now so they don't accidentally waste the money and time"

20910,"As we all know Contingency regarding Precipitation 2 has outperformed its prospects as a game itself. Now with the DLC conclusively arriving the time has come for me to isolate myself in my habitable room for the next decade in order to consummate all imaginable goals within this game. According to a mythological prophecy, this game contains life's mysteries and wonders that cannot be explicated by homo sapiens; but, thanks to the Hopoo game developers' incredible dedication to research, they have determinately cracked the code and gave us a cryptic language that I will someday master and translate to our modern language. From this day on, the understandable cosmos will fear a great chance of hazardous and illogical events. Due to the unstable and limited knowledge, a life form should only obtain that can disrupt the workings of God himself. However, this is a risk that I will take to finally understand the knowledge we have prolonged since the dawn of time."
20911,this game is cracked
20912,"I'm lazy so here is a short review. Was stoked on launch, artifacts came was satisfied and new DLC rocks hard except consumable items which stop working on specific conditions which don't have their own category."
20913,"It ruined many nights of sleep, 9 out of 10 dentists would not recommend for people who need sleep.

ps it's a fun game"
20914,Not sure where the rain is but its fun as hell.
20915,"It isn't often I write a review but with the most recent expansion finally dropped I felt it be a great time to do so. My conclusion best summarises my feelings about this game if you only care for opinions, with that being said this is all my opinion.

The positives:

With a heavy emphasis on the rouge-lite genre of ""every runs unique"", you can truly make that happen with the number of survivors now at 13, each having its own changable loadout, and the artifacts. There were many times I would wonder where all the enemies had gone during an hour long run, only to remember that they die automatically due to the abhorrent number of things going on at any one moment. However I also found myself properly struggling sometimes, especially on the harder difficulty of monsoon hiding from enemies until my life or abilities recharge, and its not often I find such a parallel in gaming unless you make it yourself.


The negative:

There are some things I can play over and over again without any true objective in mind, however Risk of Rain 2 struggles to be one, sure its fun to play and get strong much like any game, however without something to drive it forwards, the game can start to make death and victory feel all the same. Lunar coins don't truly assist that fact either, as beating the final boss doesn't sprinkle them on you, and the only way to increase them at any substantial manner is to use the prayer beads, that you have to buy with lunar coins, in a shop that unless you get extremely lucky also costs lunar coins to open, and then it doesn't even have a chance to show up initially, causing you to either spend an exponential number of lunar coins on re-rolling, or hope for next level to offer you better odds.

Conclusion:

With all said and done, I'm never going to recommend this game to everyone and that's a good thing, let this game be a masterpiece for those who enjoy it, and for the rest the perfect game exists elsewhere, but if you don't give it a go you will never find out. With all that said and done I would like to add one last thing.

 - Risk of Rain 2 is what I would consider a centre of a 'Venn diagram', with the game itself being fun to play, the company behind it offers transparency and constant updates, and lastly the community surrounding this game truly wants it to shine -"
20916,"A fantastic and in depth game with just enough story to keep you intrigued. Anyway, my life's purpose is now unlocking everything"
20917,This game is amazing

20921,"Great game, first time I played it was with friends, my internet connection was awful and laggy, my laptop was garbage and would have constant issues with fps and dying, and my friends hoarded all items and refused to teach me anything ""Lol git gud, we're not holding your hand.""

Despite all that, I still thought of the  game as very good, and coming back years later to play singleplayer with a good PC, I see my first impression was definitely right, and the updates have made it even better, I rec this for anyone that likes roguelike style system, fighting mobs of enemies, 3D combat and maneuverability, or just interesting lore and a simple but neat art style."

20931,"Phenomenal, the greatest roguelike I've ever played. Not without it's flaws, however minor, but almost perfect."
20932,"gooooooooood goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood game
"
20933,"Absolutely recommend it, great vibe, if you dont like it at first(in my case) just watch some videos and try to understand the game, it is awesome"
20934,sniproni
20935,This is addicting as fuck
20936,Oh hey it's 6AM
20937,"With over 200 hours in this game and most of those on Acrid, I can confidently say that every other character in the game is completely unplayable. Fuck Commando, fuck Huntress, fuck Bandit, fuck Mul-T, fuck Engineer, Fuck Artificer.
i'm so sick of seeing everyone shit on acrid, calling him trash and saying he can't melee like merc and loader If you advocate for using a visions of heresy on acrid I will fight you; acrid is the best melee character in the game and here's why: Most people use TERRIBLE abilities on him. My Acrid loadout is: Blight, Ravenous Bite, Caustic Leap. First off, Poison VS Blight. In order to understand why Blight is better, you need to understand how Acrid compares to Loader and Merc, the other melee characters. Loader specializes in dealing high damage in large punches, and mercenary specializes in invulnerability and mobility. Using poison (🤢🤢🤢) might seem better on Acrid since it just does more damage, but don't be fooled. More damage on the debuff is not as beneficial as Blight's ability to kill enemies. blight makes Acrid the best crowd control character in the game. Literally just press R with blight active and PSH PSH PSH PSH PSH! suddenly every single bitch ass wisp and beetle on the whole fucking stage is dead. Next, Neorotoxin vs Ravenous bite. People pick neurotoxin to give Acrid some range to deal with wisps and other threats because it's his only ranged ability other than Epidemic. but if you're using Blight, suddenly Epidemic (and jumping on to wisps if you have half a braincell) is enough to deal with those flying threats! Now you can use ravenous bite and FUCKING DECIMATE every single boss with ease. Pick up a backup mag and suddenly you're biting all the time, healing yourself, and dealing 240% + SLAYER + more damage to lower health enemies (HIDDEN ABILITY THAT ISNT EVEN WRITTEN ON THE ABILITY GRRRRRRR) over and over and over and over. You can literally eat grandparents for lunch. Lastly, Caustic Leap vs Frenzied Leap. Caustic is definitely better than frenzied just because frenzied's base cooldown is way too long, even though it decreases if you're hitting enemies, its not very good for looting and moving around the stage. Just use caustic and apply easy debuffs and extra crowd control. All of this and acrid is fucking fantastic, also if you pick up a single gasoline or will-o'-the-wisp or ukelele and you can just kill everything. Acrid has an extremely good base damage stat so just eat all the bosses. I normally hate dogs but Acrid is just a perfect acid dog boy who is criminally underappreciated. He's so cute and he deserves to chomp every beetle. Fuck merc, fuck rex, fuck loader, fuck captain, fuck railgunner, who tf even is void fiend. 

repost if you would let acrid maul you"
20938,i still dont know what the hell im doing
20939,its a good game with friends and for good game for shooting
20940,loader go brrrrrrrrr
20941,Better than sex.
20942,Run and gun wet dream. Challenging but rewarding.
20943,"They added Gup, this game is now perfect.

But to be real this game is hella fun and addicting, you got great artwork and design, a BOPPING soundtrack (if you still don't the game I highly suggest that you listen), and a really fun and addicting game play loop. It is really easy to mod if like that I just add some ease of life mods. The characters are great some are easy to pick up but hard to master, others are just hard taking a lot of time and practice to master. I have not played all of them but the ones I can give a good opinion on are Captain, Commando, Bandit, Mul-t, and Loader. Captain has to be my favorite you get a shotgun for groups of targets or you can charge it to get what is almost like a slug shot. You get beacons to help you some heal you, open chest for free, shock enemies and keep them in place, and a supply one that fills you equipment the only caveat is you can only take two, but you can have two of the same one.  You cannot forget the two best parts about him his Orbital Probe/DIABLO Strike and his defensive Microbots. The microbots delete projects and you more the drones you have more microbots. The two strikes the probe and Diablo, the probe one does good chunk of damage in good amount of time about 2-3 seconds. But the Diablo strike oh boy, you see something you don't like? NUKE IT! It is basically a nuke, mark a target wait 20 seconds AND BOOM 40,000% damage. what every you just his not long exist. Oh yeah he has a taser but it isn't that great but it has it uses like stunning an enemy before it attacks or stalling them so they get hit by your strikes. Damn this a long review I need to rap this thing up a TL:DR should work.

TL:DR Game good I like to nuke things from orbit, to be real if you like rouge likes you will love this good game play, good artwork, BOPPING soundtrack so buy the game now or I will DIABLO strike your house."
20944,it might be worth
20945,good game
20946,"paid dlc, is this a joke?
great hopoo games, great
refunded that dlc, you dont deserve that"
20947,"Great time, especially with friends. It's easy to get lost in a match for hours if you're having a good run and enjoying the game. Has good amounts of things to unlock and a lot of challenges that will push you to achieve them."
20948,"Simply one of the best games that is offered on Steam. The variety in characters, items, enemies and bosses is staggering and the gameplay is so satisfying when everything is going right. Experimenting with items and different characters and finding out what works great and what sucks is perhaps the greatest strength of ROR2. Strongly recommend playing it with friends though, it is alright in singleplayer but it feels like it was made with co-op in mind."
20949,Would give acrid a poke
20950,Yes
20951,absolute banger
20952,JUST DO IT

If you get bored of vanilla content, there is a massive modding community that adds anything from QoL changes to game-breaking items, modes, and characters. There is always something new to play with, and the developers bring consistent updates that never fail to impress me."

"
20997,Play it
20998,"One of the best games I've ever played.
My only complaint is that there isn't more. Once i beat the game with everyone and tried every game mode, I found myself craving a new Risk of Rain 2 experience that wasn't available without it becoming repetitive.

That being said, for a game I caught on sale for less than $20 and being able to put close to 200 hours in before feeling like it 'got old,' this game provided me more entertainment per penny than most any game I've ever purchased.
This game is so good you'll crave more game after you've gamed all there is to game."
20999,"Game is very fun, if you liked the first one you'll like this one as well."

Let that speak for itself. I even play on monsoon which I'm very proud of tehe ^.^ Seriously, for the price, just take a chance and you could have an endlessly giving game.

21026,shits fire dawg
21027,"Although this game is really repetitive, its not so redundant to the extent that I can enjoy it each run and each run isn't the same as the one before. Overall its got a good set of mechanics and the map structuring is really good in my opinion. It is definitely worth the amount of money and its a lot better played with your friends."
21028,"Is good, hurts nice."
21029,good
21030,It has very nice gameplay and can make you feel like a god.
21031,"Great Game, good for all people"
21032,"Long story short, the game is amazing. Being a roguelike game, it is not very complicated, meaning its new player friendly. It does not require much introduction, you are introduced into a grassy plain and you have to kill swarming enemies to acquire items from locked chests in a literal race against the clock. What is meant by this is the mechanic which causes the game's difficulty to slowly rise not only as levels are completed but simply as time passes within the levels themselves! This successfully adds to the urgency of the game, forcing you to balance time and item farming for maximum efficiency. There is also an absolute abundance of unique items to collect in the game, with many unique rarities such as legendary items which are found very scarcely but give strong effects even on their own which can tip the game's balance in your favour, boss items which also give very strong effects which are different depending on which boss you defeated to gain the item, and even the risky lunar items which give a strong effect in return for a handicap of some sort. Despite the previously mentioned inevitable ever rising difficulty, the game offers lots of pre-run customisation such as which character you'll play, which abilities you'll be using for the character, which difficulty you'll play the game on and even the artifacts you'll use, which are custom settings which can be activated to add an extra effect to the game, either benefiting the player, giving an extra handicap or even both! There are many secrets to be found throughout the level, leaving not even the most veteran players without content to explore. 9/10"
21033,this game is amazing an hopoo continue to impress
21034,"Not my kind of solo experience.

Good fun with friends.

DLC costs money and thats dumb. Hopefully modders make all this content they wanna sell me, free."

21207,"Precipitation Warning 2: Electric Boogaloo is a video game made for people with ADHD by people with ADHD. 
In this game you follow the protagonist, Jon Risk the 2nd in his eternal struggle against the local Australian wildlife. The virtual intercourse simulator will take you on a journey of self discovery and environmental desecration, and before you ask, yes. 

Yes.

The game is a rogue-lite which means just like the local catholic Facebook group, every time you experience this agony your gameplay and situation will differ. You acquire random items throughout unthoughtfully placed boxes and guaranteed waste of money 3D Printers which will not I guarantee you let your precious bungus fall off the stage. Outside of the funny backstage robot deciding what colour of trinket to give you, the game also constantly varies in its replay-ability with every individual survivor. Survivors are  your canvas, the blood of the innocent your paint. Survivors are crew (or purple dogs) of the UES Safe Travels, the ship's denizens definitely very concerned and mindful of the consequences of launching missile strikes at sentient beings. Being the good guys of the story, you are tasked with the herculean mission of locating and rescuing the crew of the UES Contact Grass- I mean Contact Light, whom went missing some time before you arrived. 

The playable survivors range in strengths, weaknesses and abilities with not a single character playing the same as the one you just died on Monsoon on 30 seconds ago. Want to fulfil your dreams of taking over the body of a transgender woman? Go ahead. Want to morph into an AC-130 and revoke respiratory privileges of anything that is underneath you? Be my guest. Become a plant. Become a plant I double dog goddamn dare you. 
Whichever survivor you pick delegates the flavour of terror you bring upon the civilised populous of Petrichor V. Speaking of Petrichor V, the areas you find yourself in and the untold culture of the sex, party and drugs lifestyle of fire-breathing salamanders is easily accessible to read via way too many paragraphs of  l o r e  hidden from you. Its a good thing you only learn about the complex brains and emotions these creatures feel after you slaughter them for defending their currently invaded territory. 

The standard run consists of 6 stages, or 100 if you're mentally ill. With many variants to the locales you visit you'll never be left bored unless you run out of lunar coins and can't get the fuel array to REX please just let me unlock REX please I cant dream to get abyssal depths hopoo please i just wanted rex oh my god why did you do this to me this is my 12th drizzle loader run where i dont get enough coins to get abyssal depths i just want to see how rex plays i want the plant hopoo why why did you do this to me please please please please please

After you reach stage 5 you have the option of experiencing all 5 stages again from the beginning with more tougher enemies or you can take one small step for Lumeriankind and journey to the moon where an actual blue goblin is waiting with a hammer and a lust for geometric shapes. But don't count that as the end of the game, by the time you finish it the first time you still have roughly 60 items and 4-5 characters to unlock and all of their secondary abilities. The sense of progression looms over you holding you in some sick S&M chokehold you can't get out of until you find every individual stack of pebbles that lets you wear a goats skin to run faster. Never will there not be something to do in Non-Guaranteed Downpour II. 

The most prominent feature that makes it most similar to your local catholic Facebook group is that every waking second you spend on Petrichor V means that every enemy and encounter adapts and strengthens with or without you. Survival is a race and you're amputated. If you do not kill enough enemies before the clock strikes twelve every single enemy will level up without you, meaning prioritising not spending six hours in one stage grinding and instead: running fast is your only option for keeping your own respiratory privileges intact. Ride or die, kid. 

In conclusion, this game is a fun 3rd-person shooter rogue-lite adventure for the mentally deranged, socially inept and attention deficit audience that is definitely worth your 10 fortnite vbucks you planned to purchase virtual ice-cream in the metaverse with. If you can manage to talk to another human being and convince them to play this game with you, it may just provide an unforgettable experience.

But that's just a theory. A game theory."

21276,"I've put a lot of hours into this game, and it's high time to get my review in.  

Risk of Rain 2 is an enigma for me.  It drew me in as a curiosity, but at a certain point, I was trapped.  

The lore, the style, the music, the environments -- they pull you in so deeply.  But it's by your own will -- see, some games will hold your hand, and you're tethered to it in the way that the developer intended you to be.  Here, I honestly have no clue where the developers even wanted me to start.  I loaded into the game, knowing nothing about anything, and the developers basically said ""go figure it out"".  

So you explore.  You explore the game, the menus, the logs, the music...it all just draws you in.  You are pulled into this alien world, and before you know it, you're invested.  You want to know more -- why are you here?  What are you fighting?  What does it all mean?

It's a story that many will eventually unfold, but everyone's individual journey will differ.  If you just want an exciting 3rd person rougelike shooter, you've got it in spades.  But there is also so much more to discover  and love about the game.

21321,"Summary
The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.
The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.
His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.
Strategy
Offensive
He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them.
Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels.
At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air.
At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage.
They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together.
A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.
Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast.
The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons.
Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.
Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps.
Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.
Defensive
Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.
Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses.
You can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.
Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time.
Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.
In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.
Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.
Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.
Upgrade Differences
The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

21331,The best game to drink a little and run around blasting stuff hehehe
21332,the amount of times i replayed the game makes it worth every penny
21333,"Quick Overview:

 The graphics are somewhat simplistic, but look very good. The controls are good. Music is great. Very fast paced combat and exploration. Replayability is basically infinite. The difficulty is mostly up to you to decide, from moderately easy to completely absurd. You can also play alone or with friends. The game is played in individual runs, with each run being varying in length depending on your playstyle. If you just want to know how long it takes to rush to the final boss, a run straight for them takes between 30 and 45 minutes.  Your goal in the game is to escape the planet by finding the teleporter in each stage until you reach the final boss. You have control over the rules you give yourself in the form of sixteen artifacts and three difficulties. Artifacts allow you to add certain rules such as choosing your items or doubling enemy spawns while halving their health.

 The biggest problem I have with this game is also what I see as its biggest strength: the abundance of stuff determined by RNG (stands for random number generator, basically luck). Enemy spawns, teleporter locations, chest locations, items you get, and the levels you go to are all examples of stuff that is determined by RNG.  This gives the game its almost infinite replayability, as it will be different every time you play.  However, the abundance of RNG also means that your run can either be far more difficult or far easier than it should be.

Extra Stuff:

 As far as the items go, some are certainly better than others. Nonetheless, few, if any, are entirely useless. Depending on your situation, an item you see as a meme could either be a run saver or exactly what you expected from it. There are quite a few items that are good in any situation, but those are still better in certain situations than others. Every item has at least one strategy it fits in.

 Enemies and bosses have a lot of different variety when you aren't just one-shotting everything. Some fly, some charge at you, some shoot fireballs, some tower above you while charging at you while spitting fire. Some are slow, some are fast. Some sneak up behind you and others attack from so far away you might not be able to see them. Same as the items, you have to adapt to the enemies and bosses that are thrown at you. You have to prioritize enemies, damage them, and dodge their attacks all at the same time. This game can become extremely chaotic.

 I just realized that I've done four paragraphs and not mentioned the different characters you can play as. There are several different characters you can play as, each with a different moveset and stats. Certain enemies are easier to deal with as one character than another, and certain items work better with one character than another. It's another way that this game has so much replayability. I'm not going to say anything more about the different characters because it's best for you to figure out on your own.

 Overall, probably one my favorite games.  10/10 from me"

DOWNLOAD IT NOW. but seriously if your tired of games that are good but end too fast, or games that feel long, boring, and unintresting like me this game is for u(as well as just being a really proc-ing good game). its a rougelike so if you dont for some reason enjoy the gameplay it wont be fun, but you always have the steam refund policy so you have 2 hours to try it out and see how you enjoy it. the game is skill focused but not how you'd expect. you of course learn all the mechanics of the game through playing like all other rougelites/likes. but the items all have different uses and effectivness + all of them bring some new mechanic into play, and learning to master them all is how you git gud. i would say 3 or 4 items in the game provide just plain stat boosts. the rest do things like, 10%chance to bleed. which pairs very well with high attack speed survivors, or soldier syringes. admittedly slower survivors have lots of trouble in this game, with many fewer useful items + all high atkspd survivors can do all the things a slower one can do except with more proc-ing. fight me >:("
21370,"At first, I was hesitated on buying this game. However, after playing it for a while, I gradually fell in love with the game mechanics and the fun of it. I would gladly give this game a 9.5/10 and totally recommended for those who have not bought this game. It will totally worth your mula."

21425,"after more than 100 hours I think I'm gonna write a review the game

Gameplay
Risk of Rain 2, abbreviated ror2, is a 3D roguelike, bullet hell game that may be played multiplayer or solo. It's impossible to explain this game into words since it's so unique, but that's what makes it so good. You start with only one character unlocked, but by playing the game properly, you rapidly unlock the rest of the cast.
The game has three levels of difficulty: Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon.
The difficulties, in my opinion, are perfectly balanced. Rainstorm provides a pleasant ""normal"" experience that is neither too simple nor too difficult. Drizzle is ideal for those who wish to unwind and unwind. And, if you're looking for a true challenge, Monsoon is the place to go.
The mechanics are easy to grasp, and learning the game is a breeze. That was something that stood out to me when I first started playing this game. I had no prior experience playing the first game, yet it seemed like I already understood enough to succeed after 10 minutes. The game's playability is nearly excellent for being in early access. The only thing I can think of that would immediately improve the game's experience is to solve the problems, which I'll get to later.

Multiplayer
The multiplayer impressed me with how effectively it was done. It's quite easy to jump into a game with others, and I felt that the challenge scaled very nicely. The only issue I had was one of my buddies disconnecting in the middle of the game, and they were unable to rejoin until their internet was resolved. They do, however, allow you to play with each other through mods, which I'll discuss later.

Design
Currently, there are 17 stages that can emerge during playing. Each is nicely designed and simple to navigate and understand the layout of. The design of adversaries allows you to instantly know how dangerous they are by by looking at them, while still being unique enough to understand what it is. They performed an excellent job in this regard. When things get busy, you need to be able to tell what's what, and they did just that.

Soundtrack
The current soundtrack of ror2 is around 20 or more soundtrack,However, all of the songs presently in the game match the spirit of ror2 so perfectly, and always feel like they're the right music for whatever situation I'm in. I'm excited to hear what new music they'll be introducing in the future.

Mods
While it is still small, the mod community is growing. The developers officially support game modding and actually divide people based on whether their game is modified or not, which helps to prevent anyone modding from appearing in your quickplay lobbies."

21453,"This game isn't just any Rougelike, oh no. There is so much more to this game than play as same character on same path over and over and over again. With the many characters, each with their own playstyle, and the artifacts you can get that spice up each run, this game has so much more to it. While I do wish there was just a little bit more stage variety, it's not enough of an issue to be a significant downside to this game. Being able to repeat and go back to stage one is also pretty fun, and it's something I do quite frequently. Overall, this game is a blast to play, even if you aren't a fan of the Rougelike genre."

21466,"Risk of Rain 2 is an absolutely fantastic game that I'd recommend to anybody who enjoys shooters, collecting achievements, or being challenged. 

The game has a rather charming art style and music is widely regarded as very well made although some songs do get a little pitchy or repetitive. I also really like that killing specific monsters or collecting specific items will allow you to inspect them in a logbook so you can truly admire the monster's design without them brutally axe-murdering you. There's a somewhat large amount of biomes that exist in the game and most have unique enemies that spawn exclusively to that area. Achievements are also fantastic (although some are ridiculous) and are very rewarding because they will always give you a new toy to play with. 

First off, I really like that achievements give you new content to mess with. It feels very rewarding to actually do them because the rewards usually involve items, alternate skills for your character, or even just a new character altogether! You're rewarded very heavily for chasing achievements and completing special tasks or wandering around and discovering cute little secrets by yourself.

Combat feels fantastic. There's a VERY large selection of enemies to vaporize and all of them need to be treated differently to be avoided. This game can get insanely crazy cus the floor will be so very littered with monsters, but if you play correctly  you'll never get hit! I really enjoy that this game rewards your personal skills at dodging and it's not always going to a dps deathmatch between every little enemy. (That being said, wisps are almost impossible to dodge but also have the lowest health pool in the game so I think it's fair considering they don't even hurt that much) Furthermore, there's tons of characters to unlock and all have special abilities you can unlock and earn through playing them. None of the characters feel recycled and all of them are interesting or have a neat gimmick. (Commando is probably the most boring in everyone else's opinion and also mine, but even he gets cool dual pistols and Dashes)

Despite this being somewhat of a luck based game, items exist in such a way that even if you don't get an item that's good for your character, you can still use your raw skill and the items you've managed to collect to dominate your games. I also really like the difficulty system in this game. It's done in such a way that you don't even need to feel bad about doing the easiest difficulty because eventually Drizzle will fuck you just about as hard as Monsoon would anyway. It tells you exactly what changes in the game from difficulty settings instead of making you play guessing games so you can decide what difficulty is most comfortable for you right out the gates.

This game has an incredible modding community and there's some funny things you can get away with in public lobbies. I have been able to join modded hosts while vanilla whom have a character that lets you play as an overloading worm which is absolutely hilarious. Do keep in mind there probably won't be completely unique characters if you join a modded lobby successfully without mods. Some mods are just able to be run with vanilla players and the game will not automatically download the mods being run if your game won't operate without them. That being said, I urge you to try mods! This game has been receiving an ever increasing amount of modders and you will be able to select between a lot of things to choose from!

There's a lot of ways to spice up your game without mods, though. Artifacts are capable of changing the rules of the game to make it more chaotic or assist you with becoming God. Just as an example, my favorite artifact is the one where an evil clone of you with your same character and items tries to kill you every ten minutes! The more popular one is the one where items can be chosen rather than randomly generated if you're just looking for a quick game and want to enjoy playing God. 

For a pretty cheap price tag, I think this game is worth trying out! If you're on the fence you can still wait for a sale, but I don't imagine anyone who likes shooters won't at least enjoy this game for a few days!"

21473,"So i picked up RIsk of Rain 2 about a year or  2 ago on ps4 and really liked it. But i felt it was really small and a bit boring. Like you do the same thing over and over and you beat the game in like 30 mins and then do it again. It didnt really make sense to be but the gameplay was fun and so i played for a while.
Then i got my hands on it again on PC and WOW was i wrong. i found out about looping and artifacts and different builds. The game suddenly became so much larger and richer. This game has inspired me to try to get all the achievements just because it is so much fun to play.
I 100% reccomend this to anyone who likes to have fun.

ps: FUCK Elder Lemurians"
21474,"OHHHHH, I freaking love this game. Got it on ps4 when it was still in beta, switched to PC, and for some reason I can't describe, it feels and plays SOO much better on PC with a mouse. That's coming from a console gamer. This is my second time purchasing the game. It is worth every penny. Lol if I get another console with it I might buy it again just to support Hopoo. This is just such a quality product that is so well designed and thought out for an indie studio. I can't recommend it enough. There are a lot of different games I like to play, and this is one of the very few that I can pick up, play, and enjoy nearly every time. Great game to end the work day with, so many dang build options, and just so fun, period."

Let's start with the gameplay, it's fenomenal. The best gameplay loop i have ever seen in a rogue game.
Addictive and extremely fun to play.
Multiplayer is plain amazing.
Graphics are fenomenal.

This game is worth twice the developers charge you to buy it!"
21480,"Bought it on launch because I'd played the first game while in university and loved it. Even though its usually good to let some time pass after launch to see the community's opinions on the game, this time in particular, I simply knew Hopoo would deliver. And BOY DID THEY DELIVER!

Amazing game! Still has the soul of the first Risk of Rain, but in a 3D context, and new gameplay mechanics. Its just a lot of fun.

Buy the game. You will not regret it!

Looking forward to the Survivors of the Void Update!

21481,"based game, highly reccomend- IGN"
21482,"Great Game for its price. There is so much to do in this game, the music is also SO GOOD!!!!"
21483,"This is Risk of Rain with a 2 at the end of the title. An amazing game, even for non roguelike fans. 10/10"
21484,"ive been playing this game since release it pog anyway this is the recipe for cupcakes

STEP 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and fill a 12 cupcake tray with cases.

STEP 2
Using an electric whisk beat 110g softened butter and 110g golden caster sugar together until pale and fluffy then whisk in 2 large eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.

STEP 3
Add ½ tsp vanilla extract, 110g self-raising flour and a pinch of salt, whisk until just combined then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases.

STEP 4
Bake for 15 mins until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.

STEP 5
To make the buttercream, whisk 150g softened butter until super soft then add 300g icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.

STEP 6
Whisk together until smooth (start off slowly to avoid an icing sugar cloud) then beat in 3 tbsp milk.

STEP 7
If wanting to colour, stir in the food colouring now. Spoon or pipe onto the cooled cupcakes."
21485,I have an addiction to this game :D
21486,This is a game where you can send a god to god with a modded space forklift.
21487,"It's like a White Boi with swag bussing it down sexual style, but the question is... is it goaded with the sauce? yes, yes it is"
21488,solid game
21489,Play this god damn game right now or i'll send Acid Dog to your domicile immediately.
21490,"Strong points:
- Supports creativity and build crafting
- Surprisingly optimized for most pc's
- Unique designs and artistic style
- a fast paced roguelike with enough structure to plan builds in advance
- different experience between switch and pc
- every character is good at something and plays very differently 
- you can get good with any character even those with high skill ceilings
- some of the best mod support ive seen in years

Weak points
- Spectator simulator 9If you die in a run with a friend you'll be stuck watching them play for the entire stage which can take 5 - 20 mins)
- Endgame is almost always the same (The longer a run lasts the more you start to gravitate to a really op build just to survive)
- Requires a lot of looking up (some items are poorly explained so it will require you to visit the wiki a couple of times)
- Not endless (eventually the game gets so ridiculous that either you have to kill bosses in seconds or your game will crash trying to keep up with the ridiculous amount of enemies)

This game is a mix between a singleplayer rogue like but in a 3d world and an mmo with different roles and strength.
The graphics are a little minimalistic but have a defined art style that you don't really get tired of quickly. It's performance is surprisingly good on most computers since i can even play it with friends that play on laptops from work. 

I made a lot of friends through this game and some wonderful moments and runs that are perfect memories.
Overall this game combines the perfect balance between every item has it's use and build crafting.
The stages go in a rotation of 5 and so you can always plan if something is worth scraping or keeping a hold of.

But where this game truly shines is how good it feels both on switch and pc. They felt different and sort of have different meta's and items that are better. It gives the game a refreshing feeling. Overall there is nothing better then spending 7 hours on a run with a friend so drunk that we die to the most random stuff ever and backseat game eachother.

One of my most loved games ever."
21491,This game makes you feel like a god then punishes you for getting cocky. 10/10
21492,"Risk of Rain 2     One of the best roguelikes ive ever played, one of the few 3D roguelikes i own, other one being Post void, Everything about this game is perfect and addictive. right as you begin your first run you are told nothing and forced to wonder through the first level and kill monsters that spawn out of nowhere and open a few strange chests buried into the ground that give you items you barely know the purpose of, you see a black platform with horns so you approach it and use it, it spawns a large and powerful creature that kills you almost instantly. you begin another run and this time you kill more monsters and collect more chests and finally finish the first boss, Now next level, rinse and repeat, become stronger, become deadlier... and still die to stage 3 or 4 boss. learning curve in this game is insanely fun and rewarding, Everytime you reach a level you havent been to before you feel like you are exploring uncharted territory and its such an awesome feeling, the base game has so much content in it and dlcs add so much more, Lots of characters to unlock, more than 100 items that can drop and the collection grows as you play, in runs, if you get lucky it gets to a point where you become unstoppable, but that takes alot of work and scavenging which the game punishes by making the world grow stronger the more time you spend in it. 

The aesthetics of the game are one of a kind, the graphics style is very interesting blend of simple textures with beautiful effects. The OST in this game is Probably one of the best OST's ive ever heard in a roguelike, or in a game in general, the soundtracks really capture the feeling of each level, it really makes you feel like you are on a planet infested with powerful aliens, not many game ost's ive heard do that kind of stuff

if you see this review, buy this game if you love collecting alot of things and seeing yourself get stronger, if the price tag is not so pretty to you then consider going on CDkeys.com or G2A and buying the game from there, this one is a must have for all steam players"

21516,"The only roguelike that has really had me come back again and again. A great selection of characters to pick from to customize your playstyle, great replayability. I love how you see your character change as you stack on more and more items. My biggest critique is that you do spend a lot of time running around and even on high difficulty it can take quite a bit of time (10-15mins) to start ramping up. The levels are also identical in each play through (with random loot spawns), which can feel a little repetitive. Would play more if my friends would play it with me me :("

21526,best roguelike ever im my opinion!
21527,Like Risk of Rain 1
21528,:)))))))))))
21529,Pretty fun game to play around with. Some of the difficulty seems to either be overly easy or overly hard. Either way it's more fun with mods and hope the devs intrroduce a steam workshop at some point
21530,The game is simply fantastic and will drag you in for hours on end.
21531,"Very good, very fun, Im not being held at gun point :)"
21532,This is the best worst game I've ever played
21533,"-Start game
-Get loot
-Become god
-DIe because i stop for 0,0001 second
-Live again
-Die again. Killed by void corrupted overloading worm

Conclusion : Good game"
21534,It's good I guess.
21535,"The rain isn't very risky so that knocks it down some points. But other than that, fun game"
21536,Best with friends
21537,I hit the final boss for -Infinity damage. There is a screenshot of this on my profile.
21538,"bubuhoonda 

pretty fun game ngl"
21539,"The first few times you play this it'll probably not be all that fun if you've play something like the binding of Isaac too much and are tired of rouge-likes.
Unlock some actually useful items and experience the later stages however, the game can open up and begin showing plentiful fun characters and item combinations, it's as casual or hard-core as you want to make it.

Just be warned, it sucks when you first start, so start with a friend, preferably one who's played this game before."
21540,i enjoy :)

21554,Hopoo games my beloved
21555,e
21556,"Quite possibly my favorite roguelike. The action is fast and fun, each run feels distinct from the last, and the artstyle is great. If you played the original Risk of Rain, you'll be surprised how familiar this game feels, despite being a 3d game instead of a 2d one. One thing that this game doesn't get enough credit for is how well optimized it is. Even if your computer is fairly old, or low-powered, you'll still be able to play this game smoothly. It's nowhere near as demanding as it looks."
21557,Really like that the achievements actually unlock stuff in the game
21558,"Good game, very risky and quite rainy too"

21578,GIB TO ME THE BUNGUS
21579,"I can't even begin to describe the love I have for this game. I walked into this game almost a month ago, and it already feels like I've played it since launch (which I very much haven't).
Risk of Rain 2 is a fucking masterpiece. Every part of this game- every sound, every enemy, every song, every item, just reflects how much love the devs poured into it. It truly embodies the definition of a passion project, built from the ground up by 2 dudes who love what they do.

The art style is very unique in the best way possible, and when I learned that Duncan Drummond, the person who directed ALL OF THE ART, learned 3D modeling specifically for ROR2, I just fell in love with it more. Chris Christodoulou, the music director, had no business making the soundtrack like he did. The emotion put into every single track is incredible; the music for Commencement, ""...con lentitud poderosa"" genuinely almost had me in tears after piecing together the lore for the first time. It's unbelievable the amount of emotion that piece conveys.
Of course, the ENTIRE team over at Hopoo Games (4 people, by the way) all deserve equal credit for this stunning experience, the art and musical direction is just what immediately jumps out at the player.

The skill ceiling is incredibly high, but it never truly feels like it, as the game is just that intuitive. It really is a ""get good lmao"" style game, but the brutal way it teaches you its ins-and-outs is, in my opinion, the farthest thing from rage-inducing. Every death has only you to blame, and every success has only you to credit. This is one of the only games I think I have ever taken seriously and 100%'ed. Every achievement has a purpose, whether silly, lore-heavy, or useful. The unlocks and item descriptions genuinely made me care for the characters, whether I liked them or not. I was actually invested in the lore without reading someone's summary, and for a roguelike, that's really cool to me. The world you've created, Hopoo, is, for lack of better words, really fucking cool, dude.

At the time of writing, the 'Survivors Of The Void' DLC is days away from launch, and I have nothing but extremely high hopes for what's to come. I genuinely don't care how much content is in it, because I have faith that the developers put genuine love and care into their game, just as they have in the past.

Overall, 10/10 game. Hands down. That's so rare for me to type out, but DAMN does this game check every single box for me. What can I say? I fell in love with the story behind (and of) Risk of Rain 2. This is one of the only games I genuinely have nothing negative to say about, as crazy as that sounds. I am extremely excited for the direction this game, and any other Hopoo Games project, takes in the future. There's still many more hours of gameplay that I need to dump into this, there's no way in hell I can drop this game even after 100% completion.

tldr: cool game i think rex mains rise up
also this community is great love you goofy ass hoes"
21580,Amazing game. Very fun and it has a lot of replayability. I also love the artstyle.
21581,amazing replayability
21582,Honestly one of my favorite games.
21583,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."

21589,"RoR2 is not only one of the most fun and involved games I'e ever played, but is filled to the brim with content, secrets and tons of ways to change gameplay drastically between runs (plus its multiplayer). This makes it infinitely replayable even for someone who doesn't love rouguelikes.
I give it a Bungus/10"
21590,"To me, it became boring after a while.

A roguelike where you shoot things to progress through each stage with many items and dangerous enemies to face.

I felt that each run took too long, and the game has a very odd feeling about it when you play.

If you know for sure you love roguelikes though, and you like what you see in the trailers and images, then this is definetly for you."

21655,very addictive. that's it
21656,"Everything about this game is great. It's rare to have a rogue-like game where after meeting an unfortunate fate on a run you immediately want to start a new one. The one game that's given me that sort of replay value is The Binding of Isaac. All the different character load outs force you to play in different ways. You'll end up discovering certain item combinations that are absolutely busted on certain characters and absolutely horrible on others. Though your first couple of runs you'll end up dying before getting past the first stage, it won't matter, you'll try again to get further. The gameplay is fluid as can be. The art style is endearing in its own way. The music is also amazing. The community has very welcoming members, giving advice on how to get better or helping you cope after a heartbreaking defeat at a possible E8 win with Commando after realizing elite Clay Templars do way too much damage. The devs have put in a great deal of effort into this game and community and it shows. This is one the best games I've played in years, seriously. New DLC will be coming out March 1st and I'll be more than happy to buy it. These devs deserve every penny. Can't wait to see what Survivors of the Void brings to the table. Here's to another couple hundred hours on this game!"

21675,"it is in my own personal opinions one of the best fucking games I've played in a long time, the feeling of running a god run in monsoon for 7 and a half hours is so goddamn fucking good, its medium paced, action packed, and in my opinion not praised enough, there's some memey shit with bustling fungus, spinel tonik, and a few of the characters but its great.

tl;dr: a fast paced level based 3rd pov with separate endings modes and playable characters with their own metas, imo a great game"
21676,"Fun Factor: 10/10, worth the full price

Gameplay: 
Amongst the greatest arcade shooters
Delivers one of the most consistently excellent power fantasies
Great diversity of characters allows you to engage with the systems in meaningfully different ways
Reliably makes me cackle like a madman ~ ""I aM YoUr GOD nOw!""
4 player co-op is excellently implemented

Difficulty:
Scales excellently depending on your appetite for masochism
Players can experience the full wealth of content on any difficulty
Players eager for a challenge are rewarded with increasingly bombastic power trips

Graphics: 
Stylish
Thoughtfully scaled down so the engine can dedicate resources to more bombastic gameplay

Music and Sound: 
A great soundtrack I listen to outside of the game
With a good pair of headphones, directional audio assists in knowing where the danger is coming from

Story:
Takes a back seat to the arcade gameplay
It's there in encyclopedia entries for those who want it"

21680,Music: incredible. Graphics: incredible. Gameplay: incredible. This is one of my favorite games of all time and for good reason. It's great.
21681,"It's like if a bunch of pals made a home movie, it turned out really good, they upgraded video equipment for the sequel, and it wins an Oscar."
21682,I love the abundant amount of happy chemicals this game gives me :)
21683, BUY IT
21684,it is good.
21685,great game lots of replayability... F**k those bosses... in the nicest way
21686,Great game!
21687,"Great game; enough variation in enemies and items.

Also, artifact of command runs always become proc builds.

ATG-1 Missile."
21688,"Was gifted to me by a friend that loved the game and wanted me to try it.

Fell in love with the game after the first run, and the more I kept going the better it was.

In short, absolutely great rogue-like filled with action and satisfying gameplay that will blow you away, the same can be said for the music and the various levels.

Doesn't matter if you play with friends or not, this game is great for the people who want to just relax while killing things and running through stages, or the hardcore player who wants to challenge themselves by rushing through everything in the most efficient way possible, figuring out combos with items and characters, and melting all the bosses."
21689,might be the best shooter rogue RPG out there

21694,"This game is fun and all but, you gotta communicate with your homies otherwise your blood pressure will go waaay up."
21695,yes
21696,"RoR2 has a phenomenal way of making you feel overpowered then robbing you of that feeling in less than a second when an elite Elder Lemurian appears in front of you and rocks your shit.
RoR2 boasts a simplistic yet highly pleasing artstyle as you traverse the many areas of Petrichor V in a frenzied fight for survival. This game is a kind of a dungeon crawler like Isaac or Gungeon, but as a third person shooter and in premade areas instead of randomly generated rooms, though loot and enemy placements are random. In fact, an AI controls enemy placements during play, meaning the game is literally trying to kill you. RoR2 has an engaging level of strategy alongside the randomness, however, as you attempt to figure out what items are worth the risk and which items you should take or share with your friends to increase your odds. And all of this is on a timer, as the game gets harder with each second you waste. Great alone and with friends, though it can get a little frustrating with randos, plus it's still being supported with updates and DLCs. 9 bustling fungi out of 10."
21697,"Simply put, a good time of chaos."
21698,except for when you get one shoted by the fucking fire units it do be a cool game tho

21710,"Super well designed roguelike. A stand-out in the genre. The characters are diverse and fun, the items are all interesting, and the level design is great. This game simply plays better with friends, but is possible alone. You'll probably find yourself overwhelmed initially, especially if you didn't play the first game, but you'll learn very quickly that this is a game about kiting enemies and managing time and your own power scaling. Eventually you'll be feeling invulnerable like the rest of us."

21720,"Great roguelite/like (bit tricky, you do keep shop currency) third person action shooter. Especially good when playing with friends and having voice coms on. Single player is fun and challenging but never as good as the multiplayer where the different classes enhance each other.

The only downside I can mention is that your wrist might hurt after 2 games because this game gets VERY intense (in a good way, it never feels super unfair)."

21731,"I honestly just don't enjoy the game, I personally find it boring and wish it had more elements of progression to it other then hopefully getting the items I need or putting on artifacts just so I can have the same run that actually works over and over. I have tried multiple characters and unlocked what I consider a decent chunk of items and abilities in the game and I just still can't seem to enjoy this game. Wish I could but this rouguelike just doesn't do it for me personally."

My friend kept bugging me about Risk of Rain 1 in the past and I thought he was nuts, but then when I gave this one a try, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's great alone, but when you play it with friends is where it really shines. Definitely get it if you're on the fence about playing it with friends."
21743,"really fun game loop, gotta put time into it to learn maps, items. survivors, teleporter spawns but the payoff is worth it, lots of fun to be had"
21744,"Do not start playing this game. You will not be able to stop. I can't stop, my wife now plays cause I couldn't stop. Now she can't stop. We looked forward to getting covid so we could play for 2 weeks, and we did."

Also one of the few rouge-lites I've played that not only has multiplayer, but really good multiplayer. Really sucked me in and still does whenever I decided to play the game. Can't wait for the DLC, really amazing game."

21863,"Bungus
"
21864,"This is probably the most I've played a game in such a condensed time frame. Concept is simple enough - a roguelike shooter where you choose a class and pick up powerups and the enemies get increasingly harder over time with boss fights at the end of each stage. It's kind of like TF meets Dead Cells except if Dead Cells offered powerups. 

I was hooked almost immediately. I love roguelikes so it's no surprise there. The variety of classes (at least the 7 or so I have access to now) provide a decent amount of variety, though I personally think the Captain is a bit OP. I was getting frustrated with the final boss as he seemed nearly impossible to beat as a solo player - then I discovered how many areas I either missed or ignored by not exploring enough and found a few classes and the ultimate savior - Artifacts. Once I got my hands on the artifact that allows you to choose your powerups rather than getting random ones I could build my survivor the way I wanted - to the point they were ridiculously powerful enough to take down bosses in a matter of seconds. Weapons, powerups, and enemy variety and environments are well varied.

I definitely recommend this, even at full price."

21875,"[u] [b]I'm going to play Devil's Advocate for this game[/b] [/u]
However I'm not saying that it's bad. It's enjoyable as a casual experience, heightened by co-op if that's accessible to you.
I merely want to remind others how Hopoo mishandled the launch, and throw in some personal takes about the new mechanics.

[u] [b]Where Hopoo disappointed[/b] [/u]

[b] Unfinished Final Level [/b]

Risk of Rain 2 released in an unfinished state. The final level was quite possibly the biggest showcase of this: there was an entire section of the level that would softlock your run if you went to it, there was little to no point in not rushing to the boss; making the entire level feel like one giant linear path with nothing worthwhile in it, enemies be damned.

The softlock was fixed a few days after, it's still unacceptable it was released in that state at all. It was simply unfinished even after the fact. And it took them half a year to rework it all.

[b] Item Logs & Skills [/b]

Many item logs didn't exist during launch. Item logs are a huge part of Risk of Rains' identity, every item had a story behind it; and it was a lot fun sitting down to read them all, especially when you wanted to see how the lore escalated from the previous game.

Skills were another thing: quite a few survivors had locked skills that were promised when they were shown to be locked in-game. Showing that, eventually, it would be added. Guess what?
Hopoo removed those skills, and anything that implied they existed.
Not even a mention about how they didn't go through with them, just gone. Content promised, removed.

[u] [b] New Mechanics: Lunar Items & Skills (Again) [/b] [/u]

Lunar Items & Coins. Cross-run progression doesn't work for this game. Coins aren't fun to obtain since they're obtained by playing the game normally as anyone would. 
Lunar Items are not fun to obtain, because there's no challenge in obtaining them outside of activating shrines; which may or may not be accessible depending on if you have mobility items in your run, what stage it is, where the shrine on the stage spawned.

Portals appearing randomly after looping to take you to the store also. Lunar buds being a rare spawn. It all feels too random.

It's awful not being able to buy a lunar item, or even access the store because you don't have enough coins. Missing out on an item pool that could improve your run sucks. All because it was out of your control to have enough coins, or even be able to go to the Lunar Bazaar.

[b] Skills [/b]

This is the worst offender. Alternate skills should have been sidegrades; but they're not. Many of them are objectively better than each other. Most of the alternate skills are better, making it feel like you're missing out on a better run since you don't have them unlocked.

Take for example: Bandit's Serrated Dagger, a melee skill on a squishy ranged unit being replaced by Serrated Shiv. A ranged attack that does the exact same thing, except with the benefit of attacking at range, out of harm's way.

[u] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/u]

There is a lot in ROR2 that misses the mark that I've come to realize after putting in the hours I did to 100% it.
I mostly wrote this to get it off my chest, and remind some people how Hopoo mishandled its launch.
If the new DLC somehow improves upon the game, or the base game receives updates, I might change this review to reflect that.

Oh and don't forget Hopoo signed a deal for a timed Stadia exclusive stage. Content exclusive to a single platform is scummy, even if it is timed. (Though I would preferred if it stayed that way since the stage is awful all around. But my point still stands)"

ps- dlc is sooooo close and i cant wait to play it, thank you so much hopoo for making such an amazing game."
21919,"This game is brilliant. very fun and entertaining even in the lower starting levels i found myself having a blast. I think this is a great game and anyone should pick it up just to mess around.
( difficulty is quite annoying though.)"
21920,"The graphics and art direction are cohesive and pretty, the lead-up to fighting the final boss was awe-inspiring, Huntress and Bandit have fun base skill kits, the secrets are impressive and there's some enemy types I really liked going up against.

Besides that? I was waffling on whether or not to refund once I hit the 1 hour mark because I had a pretty strong idea of why I could regret purchasing Risk of Rain 2. I think the title is reasonably-priced but I'm kicking myself for not trusting my gut instinct about its initial feel.

My biggest gripe with ROR2 is repetition. Unlike other games in the genre, there's no procedural level generation, so as captivating and fun to explore as the locations can be on your first few runs, they wore out for me fast. Even with extreme grinding each class has limited kit choices compared to other ARPGs, so my potential excitement for unlocking things was low to begin with and even lower when I found out how hard I would have to try just to unlock a handful of different abilities. The multitude of ways you could build a Barbarian alone in a classic like Diablo 2 puts this title to shame. The dizzying array of loot soon switched from interesting to annoying for me as I figured out which ones I didn't want and which items I was hungry for but was denied due to RNG. I was especially bored when I didn't unlock movement speed items as I didn't want to run at a realistic pace through large levels that I was tired of traversing. The enemy variety is decent but with only so many ways to fight, even their great silhouettes and gimmicks quickly become shallow. Unlike other incredibly-repetitive games like Deep Rock Galactic, there aren't a host of different game modes or activities to do - you loot, you fight a handful of bosses, ad nauseam. I ended up just wanting to fight the final boss hundreds of times until I finally figured him out but that would have meant slogging through the rest of the game each time, which I didn't want to touch any more. 

My other key gripe is the classes. Bandit and Huntress were the only ones I liked of the ones I unlocked as the kits and base weapons of the others were boring. Even then, holding down primary fire with Huntress' bow became a slog as it deals relatively little damage without sufficient power-ups. While the rush of shotgunning things from behind, going invisible, slashing close enemies and all as Bandit felt great, the repetition of the rest of the game eventually ruined even that for me. I usually love grenade launchers like with Demoman of TF2 or Junkrat of Overwatch, but Engineer's was underwhelming. The same went for the robot's gun options, people are still making slow-travel bullets in games? On a machinegun no less? The reptile was interesting but since he was weak against fliers I didn't want to use him. The final nail in the coffin was how floaty and devoid of impact Loader felt. She was the one I was looking forward to the most as Brick was the entire reason I played Borderlands, so being stuck with stupid Skyrim-eqsue haymaker punches as primaries when I wanted rapid jabs was deeply disappointing.

Overall a mixed bag that relies too heavily on RNG to make up for mostly-shallow waters."

21935,I just love the variety in items and game strategies.  I will say though that some of them are boring and a little too powerful.  All in all though this is a great game.

21944,"100% recommend, very fun game overall with many unique rogue-like and different genre aspects all combined into an extremely fun game.

"
21945,goo gam
21946,Really fun game can't wait for the DLC :)
21947,1/10 not enough bungus
21948,Meh. It's okay I guess.
21949,"Really fun and challenging.
That kind of game where dying for the 1949th time doesn't make it less fun"
21950,"Pretty fun game, music is amazing, atmosphere even better. 
It feels... odd. This isn't the first rogue-like/high learning curve game i've played, in fact its not even close to the first. It is, however, the first game i think that ive ever played that punishes you for taking your time and being thorough. I absolutely hate the moving difficulty slider. It feels so incredibly unfair that difficulty scales rather quickly just because you want to enjoy the game. There would be nothing wrong if the difficulty was raised every level, or even as time passes within a level, but then move to a hardcoded difficulty once you go to the next level. Easily the worst problem i have with the game.
Still worth the money though its very enjoyable.

Edit at 217 hours played: Has now become one of my favorite games. My previous complaint about the time moving the difficulty is now something I'm fine with, it felt out of my element at first but it pushes the player and still causes the game to be very difficult to beat on harder difficulties and impossible to perfect."
21951,"This is a fantastic game, with almost infinite replayablity. While you can go it alone, and munchkin along with the items you get, I highly recommend getting some friends and running a few rounds. The game is a roguelite, where there are set maps you get generated on each stage. You collect funds and open item boxes per level, and build your character with what you find.  With multiple characters, tons of enemies and bosses, and fun items to create your build, this game is addictive. 

Highly recommend if you love roguelikes, roguelites, and games with friends."
21952,this game is amazing. I can not wait for the dlc to come out because the content is big and give me so much more content to play. BUT seriously once you get the hang of this game you are going to hooked.
21953,10/10 best game
21954,This game > your favorite game
21955,probably the best roguelike.
21956,"Blazing Elder Lemurian

21963,huntress go brrr
21964,"Great with friends (who, of course, constantly steal items for your character)"
21965,i think im developing an addiction
21966,"At the time of writing this, the large-scale DLC for this game is only about a week and a half away, and I wanted to post this in order to convince people I know to buy this thing, because I'll tell you, it's worth it. This is the highly-acclaimed sequel to hit indie game Risk of Rain, which has improved over the original in almost every aspect. I'm going to start off by saying that this is likely my most favorite game on Steam right now, so expect about 0% bias in this review.

If you're unaware as to what the gameplay of this game is like, it's essentially a multiplayer 3D survival 3rd-person shooter (or melee even) rougelike game and, yeah, that's a beautiful mouthful of words right there. Upon picking a class to play as (more on that later), you crash onto an alien planet and it's up to you and your friends to stay alive from there while every creature in sight tries to kill you. The more you kill, the more money you get, and you use that to open loot boxes scattered around the area which provide you with a random item. Items basically give you passive buffs or abilities which make your character stronger the more you have, so the goal is to get as many as you can before the timer at the top of the screen gradually increases the difficulty. There are several types of enemies and items, but, again, I'll touch on that later on. You'll spawn into a randomly picked stage and to get to the next one, you need to locate a teleporter, activate it, fight a boss, and then proceed. You do this until you get to stage 5, where you can either head to the final boss or choose to loop through another 5 stages to get even more buffs. There are currently 3 ways to end your run, those being death, defeating the final boss, or mysteriously vanishing in a way I won't spoil.

The first thing that really stood out to me about this game was the fact that you can stack any item in the game (save for special activation items) theoretically an infinite amount of times. Examples of such include having 100 double jumps or 100% critical strike chance. Not only that, but each item is pretty fun, unique, and game-changing in its own right. There's essentially an item for anything and countless amounts of character builds and synergies are possible. Plus, the developers are continuing to add more and more of them into the game. There are different tiers of items you can find, and they are ranked by rarity. Common items are pretty basic in effect and really just change one stat or effect one happenstance, while uncommon items focus more on synergy with other items and change your playstyle a little more. Then there are legendary items which are all just kind of broken and overpowered and will synergize strongly with other items. Other tiers exist as well, which include items from bosses that give you a bit of their power, equipment items which function as a 5th skill, lunar items which are weird because they are bought from a special shop with a special currency and provide both a strong buff and debuff so I don't wanna go into all that, and more to come.

Arguably the most exciting part of this game are the survivor classes. There are a total of eleven (soon to be thirteen) classes in this game and all of them play in their own way. Each one is so very different and can range from a spaceman with guns to a robot to a lightsaber ninja to a poisonous dog. It's good to set out with several different classes at once in multiplayer so that everyone can support each other in their own unique way. Every single character is fun to play and all of them are functionally and aesthetically cool (likely objectively). You can really pick anybody to find a style for you. Even more variety can be found in unlockable alternate skills (which you only have 4 types of) that change how you can play this game even more, as well as what item build you go with.

A few other things to touch on before I wrap things up. There are loads of enemy types and bosses, which I'd say are all never really redundant, along with the possibility for stronger versions to spawn. The stages are pretty nice, especially their individual vibes, although some are simpler to navigate and fight in than others. Several secrets and easter eggs are scattered throughout levels, items, or actions you take which can add a bit of spice to your runs. If you're into lore or story in any way, the game doesn't necessarily feed it to you, however you may find a good amount of that in log entries and such which you find across playing the game. Lastly, the OST in this game is absolutely S+++ tier, my man Chris Christodoulou is making music for the wrong evolutionary stage of humans on this planet.

There are some more features in this game, and even more coming in the future, but I don't really feel the need to touch on them here. Plus, there are just several factors and things that go into runs, which make each one stand out on its own from the rest of them. This game is so damn amazing. I only want to play it more and I'm never going to grow tired of it. It gives you that high-action, adrenaline-pumping, occasionally funny, absolutely absurd, groovy, and ingenious kind of gameplay you need to make you feel like a certified god gamer, if you're into that sort of thing. Please buy it and play it with your friends, you will all have so much fun."
21967,Very underrated game. Would recommend to anyone.
21968,Uklele go brbr
21969,"game fun
game fun with friends
game fun without friends
seriously just get the game don't even think"
21970,Cool game although very difficult. my only complaint is it gets (somewhat) repetitive. update: the blind vermin and pest are very unbalanced i had a captain god run on rainstorm and lodt it in actually less than a second to the blind vermin. also xi construct i have never beaten this boss except on drizzle the laser does all of its damage at the end so thay bit of laser ONE-SHOTS. I am looking forward to the patch so all of this can be fixed.
21971,"Risk of Rain 2 is quite possibly one of my greatest impulse buys of all time.

There is a reason why this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews, and that's simply because the game is a fantastic roguelike.

With the new expansion on the way very soon, I look forward to piling more hours into this beautifully crafted video game.

9/10"
21972,this game blows
21973,super addictive. an hour will feel like 10 minutes
21974,"This is a cheap and affordable game, and it is well worth the small price. In the game you can play solo or with friends. The objective of the game is either to complete a ""run"" or whatever you want to do, if it's collecting all the characters or unlocking all the items ect. there is a lot you can do in this game. It runs really well and can keep you captivated for hours on end."
21975,j
21976,i am acrid
21977,good game with or without friends
21978,"One of the best games i've played in years. I actually started playing it on ps4, but when i got a computer, i immediately bought it again, and i regret nothing. lol They've really expanded from the first RoR. The items are robust, the characters and lore is interesting, and every level inevitably turns into chaos. Not to mention, this game is lovingly supported and being expanded on by the devs. I can't wait to see where they go with this title, they definitely have a gem on their hands."
21979,"Risk of edgy don't play or your edgy person who no fun, no challenge you clicking mouse collecting toilet trash like playing league of legends and go take shower"
21980,"amazing game love the concept and incredibly fun to mess around with all of the different characters and item builds

21988,"Would drink acid in another universe from a plasma lake again, 10/10."
21989,Good game yes yes much good
21990,"Started playing a lot in 2022 and this game is so fun I must tell you!

I love to grind the masteries and all unlockables in it, I feel major improvement for my time invested.
I could not complete the first stage in the hardest difficulty when I first started playing, now I can grind to 5th stage almost every time, but it's still challanging to complete the game after all these hours.

Decision making and character knowledge is key according to my experience, if you like rouglike games I definitely recommend adding this masterpiece to your collection!"
21991,fun
21992,stinky
21993,The game itself is a straightforward game that really gives you an amazing experience. I love getting all the items and unlocking all the characters and the different challenges for each one. Can't wait to play the new DLC!!!!!!

Has half the amount of content that other roguelikes have that're half the price.








50+ hours?? i am a masochist"
22007,Really fun game. Wish it had split screen on pc currently have to use third party software to play split screen with my brother.
22008,very good
22009,"I legit believe that this is about as much fun as a video game can get. no waiting, no bullshit dialogue, just pure good old fashioned fun. This game is so refreshingly unapologetic about just making you completely overpowered while simultaneously keeping you on your toes the entire run. There is so much to learn and discover and you feel like you get a little better every time you play it. You start learning the maps, different survivors strengths and weaknesses, what items work together, target priority, time management. Couple this with the amazing music, atmosphere, monsters and bosses and by the time you master it all you`ll end up with an experience unlike any other. 
Truly a masterpiece 10/10

22069,"I wrote some long review about run-to-run diversity, enemy variety, item synergies, the satisfaction of exponentially scaling damage and the thrill of looming instant death as a consequence of a single mistake but it got deleted :( 
It might be frustrating to start of but once you have unlocked the large amounts of content unavailable initially (characters, alternative skills, items, artifacts) you have (hopefully) learned enough to fully enjoy the incredibly engaging core gameplay. There is also a lot of great QoL mods as well as modded characters, enemy types and items to try out. Special shout-out to the fantastic music by Chris Christodoulou."

Possibly my most loved game in the past 5 years. I'm so close to 100%-ing this game and THERE IS A NEW DLC ON MARCH 1ST. I love this game so much, it's insane that this masterpiece was made by just 2 people. I badly need the soundtrack on vinyl to add to my collection. 
Thank you Hopoo so much, great work!

10/10"
22089,Game is outstanding with lots of replayability! Combats fast and smooth and the chaos you experience as you progress is thrilling! Its a must for anyone who wants a challenging rouge-like game to play solo or with friends!

22101,"Nothing quite like hanging with the bois, accidentally taking too many items, becoming god, innocently committing genocide as to get off the moon, and then finding some dude with a hammer who just smacks your skull into next week at the speed of the 4th dimension. Likely one of the best games, hard to find something to match it in terms of replayability. Just to dang good."

22120,This game bangs
22121,👍
22122,iT'S GOOD
22123,"Very fun! While there aren't many kinds of enemies, or many unique maps, or even a massive range of characters to play as, the game has insane replayability! The RoR2 not only makes up for this, but incorperates it into the story and gameplay, making the parts that are a bit repetitive interesting. But the amazing thing is, the game doesn't even need to ""make up for"" repetitive bits too often. Each run is different and unique, the RNG can be frustrating but in the grand scheme of things is wonderfully well balanced, the characters don't overlap in practically any way, with each providing a different playstyle and experience, and probably the best feature: across almost every run you unlock something new or discover something new you can unlock. The game is beautifully balanced, fun to play, and will keep you engaged for a long time. I will say, each run takes a considerable amount of time once you get used to the game, with my current runs lasting anywhere from 90-270 minutes long. While the game does a wonderful job of keeping you engaged almost every second of the run, there is no way to save and quit in the middle of a run, meaning if you need to take a break beyond pausing, you're going to have to end your run. 
TL;DR: Great game that stays fun, but be prepared to pour considerable time into each sitting."

22129,"{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.""

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. ""Grab your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely be"

22131,"This game is awesome and I love it. I've discovered a ton of the secret stuff on my own and I love every second of this game. This is the only game where I can play for 2 hours straight and then die on the final boss without getting angry; I just jump into another match from the beginning. It's an amazing game that I recommend to anyone. I actually enjoyed it so much that the day I bought it and tried it out, I bought it for a friend of mine to try as well.

Edit: The DLC ""Survivors of the Void"" came out and it's a seamless, beautiful expansion to this game. I adore it even more and I can't wait to keep playing. I recommend the base game and the DLC wholeheartedly. I am getting my money's worth and more with this series."
22132,"Good freakin roguelike! It has a unique spin on the matter! Like being in a 3d space! I also like how this game handles dealing more damage! Where as instead of ""Deal more damage"" it's stuff  that if so then deal more damage! Like increased attack speed lieading to higher dps or missiles! Or bands that trigger when you hit hard! I like it! Very excited for the Expansion as well!"
22133,"Amazing, can't wait for the DLC"

As for me best roguelike ever"
22186,"game good, me explain

graphics: 
This game has some of the most well made design, animation and models i have ever seen in an indie game. The cell-shaded art style is amazing, the animations are really good, and the models have such a unique and fitting style for the game. 7 points for graphics.

music:
I am a massive fan of game OSTs and this one is the best ost i have ever heard since subnautica below zero's ""mirage machine"". This game features some absolute bangers such as ""the rain formerly known as purple"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGXPAoyP_cg) and has made its way into my playlist. Instant 9 points for the music fuckin slapping.

gameplay: 
This game is generally the most fun roguelike since i played noita. This game is honestly an amazing experience, alone or with friends. It has many different characters and maps, items and loadouts. It is honestly, in a way, beautiful how one person can combine all these different factors into the ultimate killing machine. This game is amazing, the movement is smooth and really good, the items are (sort of) fair and balanced, and later in the game it has a sort of chaotic feel to it. I rate this 9 points, because im not a masochist.

general vibe:
This game is fuckin awesome, mainly because the feel of being on an alien planet, destroying everything in your way while gradually becoming stronger gives such an amazing feeling, and a massive dopamine rush once you get that item you've just been looking for. The song changes along with the fight, similar to how Pikmin 3's music changes all the time. General vibe is id say 8 points.

issues:
Of course, with a game of this quality it's not going to be perfect. Its a great game, but it has it's flaws. The first (and most complained about flaw) is how it is on consoles but it does not have crossplay. This is very sad, as the multiplayer aspect of the game is extremely fun. Another issue is the balancing, the class Engineer is very helpful to the squad but not much fun to play, while the Captain is fuckin orgasmic to play and is super overpowered. This isnt really a big issue tho. I think a larger issue is the secrets. You have to unlock the characters, items and modifiers. This offers a lot to do in the games, but you have to end up scouring the entire map before giving up and turning to the wiki for help. The secrets in this game are not as hard as Noita's secrets, but are very similar. -3 points for all that.

all in all:
This game is fucking amazing and i have never felt as blessed since i got factorio. I play this with my friends, and its only fuckin 4 gigabytes somehow. solid 30 points. i would buy it no matter what games you like."

22189,"Even when there's 0 risk of rain, you can still get one shotted by big lizards and tiny mushrooms. best game ever"
22190,Not so fun with friends.
22191,Risk of Rain 2 is lo-fi beats to relax to with the bass boosted until the subwoofers catch fire. And explode. And bleed? What begins as a chill loot-shooty time quickly escalates to a frantic fight for your life where everything is burning and there's a big red target on your back. The lack of any strategic layer between the action did leave me feeling burned out.
22192,yes big fav
22193,Its a super chill game.
22194,"its okay i guess 
(send help i cant stop playing)"
22195,"I don't usually like games like this, but Risk of Rain 2 pleasantly surprised me. There is such a wide variation in playstyle and each run is so different from the last. It's a great game to sit and relax with"
22196,"Honestly look like a nice hard roguelike at first but... even after getting slapped and choosing easy mode first, the thing is after the few characters you can decently unlock there is nothing else to do. The normal mode is a big finger in your face, you get rolled with no chance of this getting easier as the roguelike aspect only stands for each run, meaning the only skill can get you past normal. I can't even think hard mode is doable without a stupid amount of tears and blood. In and all, good ideas, well executed, but terribly balanced."
22197,Yes

22226,"The Francesinha is a Portuguese sandwich that originates from Porto. The literal translation for its name is ‘Little French Girl’, however, the only thing little about it, is the name. It’s a rather large sandwich filled with layers of beef steak, cured meat, fresh sausages, topped with cheese, covered with a beer sauce, and surrounded by French fries. It’s a meat and carb heavy meal that is believed to be a Portuguese adaptation of the French classic, the Croque-Monsieur. Multiple cafés, restaurants, and bars claim the title of having the best francesinha in Porto and it’s a hotly contested title.

Ingredients:
For the Sauce:

1tsp olive oil
1tbsp lard
1 small onion – thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves – roughly chopped
1 bay leaf
1 tin of diced tomatoes
400ml beef stock
½ cup ruby port wine
500ml blonde beer
1 piri-piri seedless
2tbsp Worcester sauce
Salt
Black pepper
For the Francesinha

2 slices of soft bread
1 thin beef steak – tenderized
1 pork sausage
1 cured pork sausage – linguiça
2 slices of ham
5 slices of cheese
1 egg
Preparation
Place a medium saucepan over low to medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the lard, olive oil, garlic, and bay leaf. Let it cook for a minute before adding the onion. Let it simmer for about 8 minutes until the onion turns translucent.
Add the tinned tomatoes and the beef stock. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add the remaining sauce ingredients: port wine, beer, piri-piri and Worcestershire sauce, cook for another 10 minutes.
With a hand mixer, blend everything until smooth. Let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes. The texture should be similar to a gravy, but slightly more liquid.
If necessary, add some corn starch or other thickening to your taste. Make sure to dissolve it in cold water before adding to the mixture. Let it cook until it reaches your preferred texture.
Season it with salt and black pepper, set it aside.
Place a frying pan over high heat. Meanwhile, cut the sausages in half then butterfly-cut them.
Fry the sausages in their own fat, then use the remaining fat to fry the steak. Finally, lightly fry the ham slices.
Gently toast the bread slices. Start putting the Francesinha together: On a plate, place one bread slice, then a slice of cheese, ham, steak, the sausages, and the final bread slice.
Fry the egg, place it on top of the sandwich, cover it with the cheese slices, leaving the egg-yolk visible.
Bring the sauce to a boil, then spoon it on top of the sandwich. The hot sauce will melt the cheese. Serve it either with a side of French fries, or surrounded by fries if your plate is big enough!"

The game's soundtrack is also once again scored by Chris Christodolou and it's just as good, if not better, than the first game.

22297,good
22298,orgasm
22299,haha bungus
22300,Very fun and a good loop and I recommend playing with friends
22301,found this game on youtube and instantly fell in love with it. I would like to think im better than your avg player at games like this but i find myself struggling still. The maps are the same but playstyle always changes
22302,better than sex
22303,Risk of rain 2 sets the bar for what roguelikes should strive to achieve both in gameplay and in development. This is a fantastic game that still receives fantastic updates and dlc.
22304,"Great Game, Almost a bullet hell. It's a great challenge."
22305,epic
22306,good game
22307,bandit steals moni not pog
22308,My pc is not daijoubu

22310,Great and fun game. Absolutely incredible soundtrack.
22311,"good unless some idiot takes all artifacts so u wanna kill them (note: add X chromosome)
"
22312,void fiend rule 34
22313,yes
22314,It's an addiction so stay out of it!
22315,"One of the best games i have ever played, i haven't had this fun in ages!!!"
22316,"Very enjoyable roguelike, just as good (if not better) than it's predecessor.

Good variety of classes to choose from, all with unique / distinctive playstyles. Multiple artefacts to unlock that have the capacity to make your runs different / more interesting. Large variety of items to find and unlock, along with codex entries.

Risk of Rain, both the original and the sequel are top of the pack for me, mainly due to just how strong you can become. The game doesn't go out of it's way to limit your potential in a run, items can stack like crazy and you can become a death dealing god, dancing on the graves of your enemies as you rain down even more destruction.

It's a fun ride, and the inclusion of co-op in this sequel makes for an amplified experience the original couldn't provide despite just how fantastic of a game it is / was.

My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, is that I prefer the music of the first game more. Chris has nailed both OSTs, Risk of Rain 2 also has an amazing soundtrack, by my preference does lie with the first game as far as music goes.

Amazing game."
22317,Yes.
22318,music good combat good all good
22319,Fun with friends
22320,"this game is making me go insane. i cant play any other game now without being worried that if i stay in a single level for too long the difficulty will increase. i need psyschological help immediately. 

great game 10/10"
22321,"I feel it's too repetitive - enemies lack variety, not enough maps/alternative maps at the beginning. I'm not sure if they even exist later because game never felt ""pushed"" to play more. As much as decent as it is, probably even more fun in multi, it still feels very Early Access. Get it cheap or even """"CHEAPER"""" because you might play over those 2 hours... but then realize there's nothing for you in there. Very big let-down for me. Also who the hell choose first character to be a guy who synergize with more and later items. Bandit should've been first character instead. Buy with caution."
22322,Definitely recommend. One of the best roguelike games you can get.
22323,"I played nothing but Risk of Rain 2 for like, a month after I tried it the first time. Other games made me feel nothing in the wake of RoR2 and it wasn't until I had unlocked all the items, costumes and most of the abilities that I could enjoy other things again.

And that sounds like hyperbole but it isn't.

Nothing scratches the Loot-Goblin itch like Risk of Rain 2."
22324,"Okay so, I have spent 60 hours in this game and have just beaten the final boss.
This game is really hard, but its super rewarding whenever you actually manage to do anything."
22325,it's fun
22326,most fun ive had with friends since nekopara
22327,goodgame empire
22328,Nice game.
22329,"I love this game so much, so addicting, so fun, and is just repeatable. Defeating the final boss was also the most rewarding thing ever and it really was worth every penny."
22330,amazing game
22331,THIS GAME MADE MY DAD CREAM HIS PANTS OVER AND OVER AND OVER BECAUSE IT SO FUN. the gameplay loop is to die for and the replayability is immaculate! well done
22332,This game is great
22333,good
22334,"this game is HORRIBLE. 0/10. why? well, in risk of rain 2, you can pick up MANY items. like, 1 0000 0000 00 0000. though there are hundereds of items, you can NEVER get crushed by the weight!!!! not even missile launchers give you any slight back problems!!!!"
22335,"fun game
"
22336,so great I regret buying it on sale. buy it with the DLC. now.
22337,"Game is pretty shwanky, the only problem I have is that most of the survivors seem to be good in co-op and thats it. other than that it's a really good game with interesting mechanics and subtle lore, Contribute to capitalism and buy this wonderful game"
22338,"it has great combat and buetiful art style

22340,I loooove Jailers batChest
22341,its good
22342,I'M GONNA PUNCH EVERYTHING IN MY SIGHT
22343,"This game rewards carrying your team and punishes falling off mid or late game by making you watch your only teammate who knows what they're doing do better than you. The guns doesn't feel satisfying, the bosses will off screen you all the time, and random levels will make every stage feel utterly forgettable. This game is only enjoyable for those with Stockholm Syndrome."
22344,Fun. Lots of action. Die many times. Fun.
22345,"This game is genuinely so much fun, like sitting and struggling through the higher levels can be really challenging but i've never had so much fun just running around and shooting things looking for loot like you do in Risk of Rain 2. Definitely worth every cent that you pay for this game. 10/10 would recommend."
22346,"its a good game, lots of content and enjoyable gameplay loop. Very fun to play with friends or alone."
22347,W
22348,Very fun. Very Addicting. Tell your family that you love them.
22349,This game... THIS GAME!!! is good
22350,Such a fun and unique game!
22351,Amazing
22352,it is fun play it
22353,"I would highly recommend this game, the replay ability on it is incredible. Even though you play against the same set of enemies and bosses the variance in situations makes most experiences feel brand new.

The game is fairly difficult to learn and items are difficult to understand in the beginning (mostly because u don't know what an item does until you have bought it). Also believe it or not in the beginning finding the teleporter can be incredibly difficult and even after finding it knowing when to hit it is also difficult. But once learned the game is extremely rewarding yet still challenging. 

Items and their interactions with each other are amazing
Also if you arent trying to farm skins, don't play with artifact of command, it makes the game stale.

One of my problems with this game is the lack of the of customisation options for the visual of the characters. It would be cool for there to be more visual changes for characters beyond the mastery skins. Even if not a complete visual change maybe even colour changes for the characters. Although this doesnt change much about the game, it allows players to better express their identity within the character. (The same way smash allows you too)

Oh and the engineer is actually a complex survivor. BUNGUS BABY"
22354,gud game
22355,Addcting

22358,"Loader best character
"
22359,good game 10/10
22360,"One of the best shooter rouge likes in 3D out on steam, this is wonderful even for a solo player"
22361,"This game. It was probably one of the better games I have picked up in the past few years. 

The simple gameplay loop of hopping in a stage, get items, fight boss and repeat this is just great. The base game it fun enough to keep a few hours but need a bit of mods. But even so there is a lot to diverge with it. If you arent going to get the item cheats mod the challenge of playing through to get all of the achievements adds a tone of repeatability with their game. 

The characters are a lot of fun to play but without everything unlocked does limit your use of the characters but if you don't mind cheating it in it makes use of the characters feel refreshing. Even modded characters are great to play that well have quality. That is one of the main issues with modded characters but they are not obviously needed. Now with the two new characters coming out soon it will make it even more refreshing.

Now the items are really annoying. Some are great and useful to many characters or some items are just bad on some character or are just bad in general. Most of the greens are not useful for most situations, bandoleers, stealth kit, squid turrets, and tome are some items you want to avoid. I am glad printers and scrappers are a thing because I will never want to keep these items for long and will find a scrapper. Now whites vary from the only real bad items I would say is Bison Stake an Warbanner. Thats it but even then some items are only great of some characters and bad on others. But white items are more versatile. But my point is that i hate how there are bad items where I think there should be good items rather then conditional items. 

Now the DLC could help with some of the items can help the good items and make the bad ones irrelavent or really replace them but who knows. 

Mods all be it not needed but mods that add new items or characters can make it refreshing. Item mods can make builds cool and add verity to base game characters. Then the modded characters ad more verity to it and the ones that are actually good and not the anime ones or other game characters, the paladin, miner, and the two enforcers the normal and the nemesis enforcer both being unique. Here is to hope that older characters and new characters to the game in the future."
22362,good

22437,"uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, is a good game."
22438,"I loved learning and discovering places ! The Title RISK OF RAIN really relates to the game play becuase in order to move on you must risk items and stratagies ! You deeply learn from mistakes in a funny way . Its really challenging and fun in normal diffculty and hard . I do not sugest playing it in easy unless your a kid. I reccomend your goal to finish the game. The charcters do have uniqe play styles and builds keep that in mind. If you are playing with new friends please dont carry and do teamwork, it wins the game. dont be a item hog XD . every run you do is diffrent and not the same. i do wish once you finish the game there would be other game modes . Artifacts change the gameplay of the run but its not as rewarding. Overall if you are trying to ffinish the game your gonna have a blast! It took myself 45 hours of gameplay to finish it once XD! I cant wait for the new DLC thats gonna be a change . I am still continuing the game becasue i want the skin for my main and to do that you got to finish it on hard! Alone or with friends its fun. i do wish the while the boss is up you can loot, having to stand there and charge the tele is anoying but you can always loot after wards. Good luck and have fun . everything is trying to kill you XD"

22457,magnificent
22458,"Originally got this game through a gift and thought it was going to be one of those games we played once then stopped. In reality though we still play this game even though I have owned this since near launch. I dont have too many hours in total but I've played my share to leave a review over it. Every game is a different run and no run will be the same as your previous. When playing with friends it can lead to some hilarious moments where you holler with laughter or scream with anger at them cucking you by grabing the item you got from a chest. All round fun game, and cant wait to jump in when the void comes out"
22459,Great game if you like action roguelikes.

22474,this is the greatest game in the universe
22475,"Awesome roguelike looter shooter. Lots of characters and items and artifacts to unlock through unique circumstances. All the characters play differently and none feel bad, just less to your playstyle. You go through each level finding a teleporter than spawns the boss and lets you pass to the next level, at the 5th level you can loop back to the start or go to the final level. Enemies get stronger and more numerous with time. Absolutely enormous replayability with the possible builds, secrets, and it's one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had in years. All the unlocks are really challenging and yet not so challenging as to feel unobtainable without seriously grinding to get better. One thing I thought would take a long toime for me to do (get to a certain level at a certain speed) I ended up just getting by chance on my next run. Recommend at full price, if you see this on sale do not skip it."
22476,"there arent to many games that get me to hyperfixate. but i have been playing this game non stop for weeks, and i dont see myself stopping any time soon~

i have more and more hours of ideas to make runs, and that is all after i 100% this game, which besides from.... one that im not looking forward. the game has so much replay vaule, so if that i something you are looking for, then this game is perfect for you."

The game also doesn't show you how to find a lot of places, so it's up to you to find out how which is fun IMO. By default a lobby can have up to 4 players in it. But this can be changed by using the console and inputing specific commands. By doing this I believe you can play up to 16 players at the same time! 

Been enjoying this game a lot recently! 10/10 would recommend!"

22554,great game great fun
22555,Only good because modded.
22556,"The gameplay loop is amazing. If you're into lore like me, this game does so much with so little. Somehow this game pulls off insane amounts of depth with small bits and pieces of story scattered around here and there. Granted this game is not story based what so ever, or at least it can ignored entirely if that's what you're all about. Either way I would describe the atmosphere is ""Etheral"", and ""highly addicting"" is how I would describe the gameplay. Lastly, the audio track is so incredibly good. The game doesn't revolve around the soundtrack but when you do notice the songs in the background you can't help but admire the sound design. This game has given me so many memories and I suggest you definitely get this game if you are considering it or it goes on sale."

[i]I still don't get how you keep losing so many runs. I taught you well, and you're supposed to last. I ran the numbers on the last few runs, and I'm pretty sure you died to the most recent Vagrant less than two minutes after you died to the last one. 

If this keeps up, you're gonna punch a hole in your monitor. You've got a real good character, Jim, but this Loader ain't gonna do all the work for you. And you sure as heck ain't playing on Monsoon or even Rainstorm. So, I'm sending you a hack. One that's as good as I can make, and with a safety to keep you from overusing it - that I'm sure you'll bypass anyway. 

At least try not to blow this run to bits for the first level, alright? Make us Drizzlets look good. You're not gonna show up those fancy Eclipse 8's with a smoking scrap heap.[/i]

22611,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

22653,"Great roguelike! 

This review was written before the major update for 2022 has been released. 
Not that it is likely to change my opinion on the game; probably still great. 

I may just be bad, but I still have quite a lot of cosmetics and unlockables gated mostly by skill checks, even after 100+ hours. Somehow the game doesn't require a talent tree or any other incremental improvements to your character stats outside of a run to fuel a sense of progress. And compared to a lot of other roguelikes, I don't crave progress as much in this game. The gameplay itself feels rewarding enough."

Generally challenging if you aren't using the Artifacts and have to rely on the RNG of item chests and scrappers and traders, Bosses are quite...interesting...after the 60 minute mark. The vanilla play and modded play are both fantastic and I cannot wait for this new expansion.

22710,It's good
22711,"I like this game a lot so I'll just say what I don't like. Monsoon difficulty is not fun. The mastery skins suck, except for a few that look really nice. Trying to get all the monster and area logs is lame because of how rare they are, having them unlock after killing a certain amount of enemies or going to a map enough times would be better. One shot protection pretty much doesn't matter because a lot of enemies do multiple attacks at once or cause status effects that kill you over time. The game is very good except for those things."

PROS:

 * Variety of characters and playstyle. They play very differently compared to each other.
 * Kickass soundtrack.
 * Polished art-style.
 * Very fun combat system, especially when there are a number of enemies around. 
 * Is challenging.
 * Rewards you for some achievements.

22767,"The original Risk of Rain was one of my first experiences in PC Indie Gaming, and it left quite an impression on me. From its stylistic character design, to the 2d side-scrolling ability spam fest, and an ending with music so beautifully appropriate it ended up permanently etched into my mind. So, when Hopoo Games, a studio of 4!!!! Individuals announced they were making a 2nd game and it would be 3d, I was all for it. I haven't written a review for this game yet, but I've owned it since it was first available in early access and with its first DLC on the horizon I think its time. Theirs a lot of reasons why I think this game is one of my favorites, and why it succeeds so much over its predecessor, which in its own right is fantastic:

The transition from 2d to 3d while keeping its style is incredible. From the ability usage, to the items, it all feels amazing as your character transcends into a beast until you either beat the game or loop until you die.
With the items you can feel that rush of getting a red on stage 1, or simply feeling happy at finally getting those damn crit glasses for when you desperately need one. Every item serves a purpose that benefits you in a very direct, observable way.
Plenty of secrets to unlock and explore, from hidden stages, characters, and items, it can keep you busy for a long time.
A wide variety of characters that all allow for a distinct play-style while also having switchable abilities that changes elements of their kit. 
It is one of the best soundtracks that I've ever heard. From the active teleporter boss jams, to the quiet serenity of the earlier stages, to the absolutely fantastic finale of [i] ...con lentitud poderosa [/i] it's an incredible listening experience, every time.
Easily accessible coop through steam, alongside the new addition of challenge modes for people who want that extra difficulty or variety in their runs, 

So, should YOU buy this game? 100%. Play a few rounds on your own to get the hang of it, then once you inevitably get hooked, tell all your friends to buy it, and jam out with them. Your music will be electric."

This really adds the ""fun and fresh"" feeling you get at the beginning of the run as you prey to RNGesus for good items. 10/10 would recommend."

22854,Not a lot of rain.. Lot of risk tho. Good game.
22855,"TL:DR/ 
Risk of Rain 2 is an excellent 3rd person rogue-like game with immense amounts of replay value and overall variety, and I enjoy both solo and multiplayer experiences.  What sets it apart from other rogue-likes is the risk/reward of spending time gearing up; the clock is always running and the difficulty constantly increases.  When nearing endgame difficulty there is some chaos on-screen including drones, ally creatures, item effects, enemy mobs, and a lot of explosions.  Your Survivor will eventually amass item combos so busted that elite boss mobs vaporize when an effect procs just once.  Story takes a backseat to gameplay (the game's lore is tied to Logbook entries) with an interesting focus on player agency; if you don't die there are different ways to end a run, but you can also keep a run going potentially forever.  Create personalized runs with different modifiers and adjust your character ability loadouts.  This game has several secrets to discover as well.  

If you're looking for a curated, complete package of gameplay and story then I would recommend Hades first.  That being said, Risk of Rain 2 does so many things right.  Honestly even if story is an important feature this game is still a must-play.  Highly, highly recommended.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Premise and Overview/  

Pick a Survivor, set your ability loadout, and then start the run.  Your escape pod lands on a mysterious planet where everything wants to murder you.  You begin with only a base set of abilities that have cooldowns.  Each Survivor has unique abilities, passive perks, starting items, and different play styles.    Kill enemies to earn money and gain experience levels, open capsules to get cash, and use your accrued funds to open chests littered around each stage.  Each chest can drop an item of variable rarity that gives minor bonuses to movement/sprint speed, extra jumps, extra health, additional ability charges, extra boss damage, and lots more.  Legendary items grant unique effects such as: electrocuting any nearby enemies, reduce ability cooldowns by X%, revive your character on death, and many other benefits well worth chasing.  Almost every bonus/effect stacks and many items synergize extremely well.  There are also stations with 3 item choices and a 3D printer that produces item X if you feed it scrap or randomly sacrifice your own items.  
Move quickly to gear up and clear each stage by charging the local teleporter.  Kill the boss that appears, go through the portal, rinse and repeat.  As you spend time roaming around each stage you will notice an in-game timer with a difficulty slider that is constantly going higher (Easy >> Medium >> Hard >> .... ).  Clearing individual stages also advances the difficulty slider further.  Harder enemies have increased experience levels, higher damage and health, can become elites with additional elemental modifiers (think 'Cold-Enchanted' or 'Stone Skin' mobs in D2), and then they spawn almost constantly around you.  Spend too long in each stage without an equalizing set of items and you can die really fast.  

Each run is a shifting balance of your priorities and time management.  Should you spend the extra 5 minutes to farm enough money for a Legendary chest?  Legendary (red) items are very worthwhile but 5 minutes on Monsoon difficulty can make a big difference in the early game.  Keep in mind that money converts to XP when you go through a portal; there is no way to stockpile funds between stages.  There is no currency to spend outside a run, and there are no permanent leveling systems to grind through.  Collect logbooks from enemies, items, and from each stage.  There is one persistent currency you can use but only during an active run; Lunar Coins randomly drop from enemies and can be earned by clearing the game.  
Otherwise, everything resets at the next run.  Stage routes, chest/altar locations, teleporter bosses, and minor stage topography are randomized every time.  Several stages have a very consistent layout, though.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Points of Interest/ 

High]

- Insanely fun gameplay loop and core mechanics; most of my runs have been a blast even when I failed miserably.  Discovering new item and ability synergies is always fantastic.
- Stellar replay value; there are many in-game items and Survivor abilities which are locked behind challenges.  Unlocked Survivor abilities allow for alternate loadouts, and unlocked items will start appearing in the world drop pool.  The challenges are attainable and fun to pursue for the most part.  You can also end your run in specific ways aside from dying.  There are secret stages and Artifacts to collect if you want to modify the game in substantial ways (ex: making all enemies elite; fall damage becomes fatal).
- Good music overall (if you enjoy moody, dense synth).
- RoR2 runs don't have to be huge time investment; expect to spend at least 20 minutes for a successful run but it can extend way beyond that amount if you want.


Neutral]

- Multiplayer is very fun and easy to join, but if you die during a run then you have to wait until your group enters the next stage.  In the meantime you miss all XP and item drops because you are stuck in a spectator mode limbo.  It was common for me to revive on the next stage several levels behind my friends, and with only a fraction of their inventory.  I don't love it but I can understand why this mechanic is in place.
- Story is very minimal (whether this is a pro or con will depend on your preference).  As I stated before, there is a Logbook in the main menu where you can view any of the entries that you've collected throughout your runs.  The lore is interesting but limited if you're looking for extensive world-building.  I didn't play Risk of Rain 1 so I can't compare the two games here or judge how well they connect with each other.  Risk of Rain 2 sacrifices narrative for crazy action and a customized experience.  


Low]

- Fall damage; only one Survivor is immune to it otherwise you will need a specific Legendary item.  I don't have a problem with fall damage as a mechanic but some enemies have abilities that rocket you into the air with little time to react.  On several occasions I was knocked so high up that I popped up through the ground and I lost most of my health.  Nothing major just annoying.  The game's physics are bit wonky too; if you have heavily boosted movement and sprint speed then you might just bump into random level geometry and then careen into space.  (Can be exploited to traverse stages without stacking your jump count.)
- Insufficient character control while descending from a jump.  Jumping itself feels floaty, not always precise at times.  The total jump count and speed of forward motion are both boosted by items, as usual, but there's a point in-between jumps (and when you're launched into the air) where your character falls slowly.  Too slowly, in my opinion.  One boss will capitalize on this; you can get juggled if their Captain Corridors don't kill you instantly.  Another issue that's mostly countered with a Legendary item but I wish the fall speed was faster overall.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Bugs and game performance/


No bugs encountered so far.  Physics/collision can be goofy at times but nothing that completely negates a run.
The game has not crashed once in 150+ hours. 

I have a low-mid range PC that's several years old but it has no problems running this game at 1080p 60FPS.  When you ascend to nuking elite lv99 mobs there will be a lot of visual effects; I noted a few instances where my frame rates dropped below 5FPS because of that chaos.  Not frequent.

 I have to keep my graphic settings pretty low however that's not a deal-breaker for me because of the game's visual style.  Your mileage may vary.

"
22907,"I cant really recommend this game, its just a cluster of broken enemies. First level a jellyfish that has a map sized explosion sure you get lots of time to take cover but 90% of the time the teleporter is out in the open so yeah take 90% health for rng telporter location. Then i go to another level and theres a huge yellow enemy that also has the same map wide hitbox except his one lasts forever, does huge tick damage over time, and cover does nothing. Theres also 200 flying ranged laser acuracy enemies on level 1 that do around 20% of your health for each hit, and cover doesnt do much since they fly around to face you, the enemies in this game are just poorly designed with spam on level 1 to entice you to pick someone else or just quit.

I'm sorry but i just dont find stuff like this fun anymore and i dont know what they were thinking with these enemy designs. if they are gonna add more projectile and huge map explosions, at least make the player more tanky or give us more movement/evasiveness. All i get is dumb banner items and the healing fungus.

I spent 60 hours in it now and some may argue that it is repetitive,

Speaking of Achievements there are loooots of achievements.
The game is a fast-paced, third person shooter with lots of mods to expand. Its a rogue-lite and I really recommend it.
I am excited for the new Sniper DLC too!

22949,No other game compares to this. A whole new level of chaos and fun!
22950,"A pure masterpiece of rougelike games, if you like rougelikes/rougelites this game is a mustpick"
22951,very good. highly suggested
22952,Risk of [b]dying[/b] 2
22953,risk? a slight risk of rain?
22954,"Insanely good game. Logged almost 1000 hours at this point and i'm still coming back regularly for sessions with friends and solo. Variety is through the roof with the amount of items and characters and the way they combine seamlessly. Unlike alot of other roguelikes, items can stack infinitely which can lead to hilariously broken runs. The gameplay is very unique for a roguelike as it's an ability based 3rd person shooter which really makes it scratch alot of itches for me.

Can highly recommend both the base game and the fantastic DLC (hundreds of more hours added on after that was released)"
22955,
22956,yes
22957,game good
22958,Still playing it.
22959,Godlike
22960,"a funky fresh roguelike game, actually incredible. no explanation needed. just buy it its worth it"
22961,5 minutes per stage baybeeeeeee
22962,Gud gaem
22963,"ROR2 is a rouge-like movement shooter that combines elements of dungeon crawling games, item based combat games, light movement mechanics, and hero based games into a delightful experience that can be played a number of ways.

this results in challenging gameplay on monsoon and a fun relaxing shooter on drizzle.

though team oriented there is a degree of individual competition over items which when handled maturely (equitable distribution) is a non-issue but ive absolutely broken friendships over red item drops."
22964,"Very fun game! music is cool, fun game with friends"
22965,Hopoo make good game. Is fun
22966,roguelike go pew pew and pow pow. good
22967," I always thought that this game wasn't my cup-o-tea,
 
  I had thought that it was some kind of bullshit with weird unintuitive controls and shity mechanics leading to an unfun play through. Until it went on sale for a acceptable price for me to waste my money and I played it for a bit alone and then with a friend and it was a blast each time we started a new game after I fucked up XD."
22968,"extremely fun time waster you can go deep or finish in 15 minutes, it's got something for everyone"
22969,"It's good, posting this for a badge idek :/"

22973,"Very fun as well as very re-playable, also getting a DLC with 2 new playable characters on March 1st, 2022, so look forward to that if you are getting this game."
22974,"The best 3D rougelike easily, fantastic."
22975,My friend gave me this game. I did not have very high hopes but I played any way. Now this is one of my favorite games. Must Play 5 Stars
22976,"The final boss is extremly boring to fight and having to start over, losing around 1 hours progress, for one single misstake isn't a fun game to play. No matter how stacked you are on items, you are still gonna get 2 shotted by some random enemy. 

Also the game is timebased with the difficulty increasing as you play. So if you like to run around exploring everything, do it in another game instead!"
22977,"Amazing rogue light that goes great alone or with friends. be warned that some rounds can take a long time
"
22978,"The game is one of the best i have ever played everything about this is great the game play is addicting and every time you play it gets better and better. The co-op is very fun and a great game to play solo 

The beginning stages can be a bit tedious however the late game is extremely fun the game play keeps you hooked.                

Definitely recommend for friends and people new to these types of games 

10/10   100% goodness :)"

22991,"Risk of Rain 2 is video game crack. It is a slow start much like many roguelikes but you'll soon find yourself becoming a fiend finding out the tiniest details of how to optimize your run and making your character as broken as humanly possible. This game also has the most fun grappling hook character in any game, Loader. Who knew combining the mechanics of Doomfist and Wrecking Ball from Overwatch could result in something so fun. RoR2 just does not pull any punches both with the enemy's power as well as yours. You can infinitely stack almost any item in the game resulting in runs where your character can shoot across the entire map with a single press of the W key. This game is just pure fun and I love every decision made for RoR2. Very excited for the DLC."

23040,"pretty nice. from what i can tell the game is built around the phrase ""easy to learn hard to master"" which is actually a good thing cause when you die it usually feels fair (most of the time). though a funny quirk of that system is that it makes playing like a casual (like your's truly) seem almost harder to do then tryharding lol. excellent way to chill for the afternoon/evening. especially if you can get a buddy in on it every so often. i'd say a ""good"" outta 10"

23044,"3 games in a row, attempted runs of obtaining skins and last map to get celestial stage, the portal doesnt spawn on map. I like this game but pisses me off a bunch when runs like those get ruined cause no teleportal sqawn"
23045,"This game is really fun however it can be hard for new players to really understand what to do. It works off of trial and error, and those who enjoy the game are the ones who are curious about what is going on or are completely lost and just went for the ride."
23046,"Step one: Unlock the nuke for one of the characters

Step two: realize you can make a build to spam said nuke

Step three: get to final stage by spamming nukes

Step four: Die before boss fight because you nuked yourself

Step five: Profit(?)"
23047,"First things first this review is not all positive i'm gonna be listing pros and cons and then a conclusion, i hope this is helpful to newcomers and anyone else!

Pros:
Free to play
ASSets ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
good variety of weapons
fun melee combat
funny bugs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
beautiful graphics
AMAZING soundtrack
Fashion'n'stuff
tenno-gen (player made content put into the games market you can get)
2 open-worlds
Cinematic quests
nice community (except for a few...)



Cons:
GRIND
GRIND
GRIND
GRIND
BUILD TIMES
ANNOYING BUGS
getting banned from for saying things like Gay / Nezhas a trap and other stupid things
Nezha not being a grill ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Content droughts
basically no endgame
Hema research
nyx deluxe being on nyx
horrible chat moderation



Conclusion: Great game at first, the grind is bearable AT times, but it gets annoying for certain warframes and weapons.
but what lacks in is content and support for veteran players, i'm not that much of a vet but i'm close to it, and i also feel the lack of content for longer term players. Thats about it, its a good game but lack of content blah blah blah... just play the game slowly and dont rush through everything otherwise you will get bored, i hope DE will add actually good content fit for Veteran players in the future! have a nice day."
23048,Pew Pew
23049,Playing this game makes me feel like I have a girlfriend
23050,Just buy it buddy
23051,This game is incredibly addicting and fun but you really need to take breaks in-between long runs.
23052,i love this game its so addicting and you never know what will happen
23053,"Never bought it, sucks dick"
23054,This game makes me feel like a complete utter waste of human life and I love it

"
23059,"Fun game. Get items, get strong, die to brass contraption. Get items, get strong, die to elder lemurian. Repeat"
23060,yes
23061,"This game is great and fun together with friends buuuuut feels like it hasn't been playtested at all and is very unfriendly to new players.
- I wish items showed you what they did before picking it up. Rather than having to literally do homework trying to memorize them all. And you NEED to know what items do to get control of your runs. 
- Followers are awful- bumping into you and blocking your view/shots/abilities. Like I HATE followers in this game. Also you can't dismiss drones so that's cool, those will be in-the-way forever have fun thank you very cool. Luckily you can dump yellow summoning items into the trash. I always do that immediately. 
+/- You unlock new skills for classes by doing specific actions or creating specific scenarios and it totally takes away your freedom and is super tedious. I just wish I could like buy skills with the in-game currency lunar coins or somethin'
+ Feels good to shoot, zoom around and play like FR. It's a GREAT game with some significant tedious flaws.
+ Replay value ++++ a lot. Not that luck reliant so every run can be made into a success guaranteed. And a lot of fun things, items, classes, and skills to experiment with.
+ There's a lotta secrets to find and exploring is usually rewarded."
23062,"Came into the game knowing there might be a risk of rain, which gave me time to grab a umbrella.

23064,"it's a fun roguelike co-op shooter, with a lot of different characters and ways to play"

My friend had recommended playing this about 2 years ago and I said ""no thanks"" and he brought it up again last week and I've been playing it probably every day since. I currently have 26 hours played so there's not too much I can say but I'll probably be back here when I get some more hours. 

Also, DLC is literally being released next month which is FREAKING WILD BRO.

See you guys later!
-Engineer player"
23128,arti is fucking thicc i want her to smother me so fucking bad got i wish arti was real
23129,"very based :)
"
23130,"It's a really fun game. Depending on which survivor you choose, and many other things (such as if you use artifacts, what kind of items you get, how much time you spend collecting items), the style of gameplay can really vary and you can sink a lot of hours into the game just exploring the different possibilities. Around half of my playtime was spent trying to unlock various things and the other half was me just wanting to play the game and starting runs just for the fun of it. 

That being said, I would say that if I'm picking between this game and some other games with a similar idea, I often end up playing some other games just because in them, if I need to quit in the middle of the run, my ""current"" run gets saved and I can just get back into it whenever I find time. This is especially true for whenever I have a very limited time to play. Sadly there have been really epic runs that I had to end because I had other things to do and in Risk of Rain 2 leaving the run/going back to main menu means not being able to continue that run. The same has happened while playing with other people too. Usually we just wait to sacrifice ourselves as soon as possible, but one time we just tried to get ourselves killed by standing completely still because we were in a hurry (it did not work because we were too OP and we ended up just quitting instead)

But provided you have a few hours to play, and you want to have fun, this game is probably one of the best choices. It also has three difficulties to choose from, and as someone who's not very good at the game and who's stuck somewhere between easy and normal mode, I can say that no matter your skill level, you will be able to enjoy it.

Also the game having multiplayer is pretty cool and playing with friends can make it extra fun."
23131,yes
23132,"I'm still new to this game, but I have this much to say:
- Great Gameplay
- Great Graphics
- Great music
- Intuitive Design all around

I got this game when it was on sale, but say it's worth buying at full price too."
23133,yup
23134,I was able to survive the full brunt of 6 suns as a plant robot then die to a magic rock. 10/10 highly recommended!

It has one of the best modding communities I've seen, and it's filled with amazing mods like you can add a Stickman called Henry and trust me he got exactly what I've been missing in my life (and no I'm not dating henry you weirdo).

Can't wait for the DLC to release! So excited!"

23165,One of the best rogue-likes on the market right now. I've been playing this game since it launched as early-access and I always find myself coming back for more. Not many games really captivate the marvel of RoR2.

update: i have still not stoppped playing"
23177,:)
23178,"I think it's a rather slow rogue-like game. you hold down m1 most of the time for the first 3 initial basic classes and then click your other abilities a few times. not a particularly high skill ceiling given that you can't do headshots or little tricks like that. Most good runs heavily depend on RNG. It's not nearly as reactive as some other games that i've played.

Big cons for me: no story (which is common to this genre but doesn't help it), terrible difficulty curve (hard early and everything is super easy afterwards), and enemies are linear and boring/simplistic AI

However, the later classes do spice up the game a lot and make it more fun. The game developers also seem to be passionate and update the game quite a bit. 

I went into this hoping I would like it as much as RoR1 but I didn't after nearly 60 hours.

PS. multiplayer is awful. Played best at single player count"
23179,made me cum
23180,"This game is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played. I was obsessed with the first one came out when I was a kid, and when this one came out I made my friends buy it so we could play together. I play some many games and get bored of them quickly, but this one never seems to lose my interest. There is so much to unlock, explore, and experience that it really is just mind blowing. Not to mention that if you complete the game and want more content, you can download a modloader to add a bunch more variety to the game. It makes it fun while waiting for the devs to come up with new and exciting content. 10/10 is too low of a score for this absolute MASTERPIECE of a game."
23181,"Great game to play with friends. Each run can be meaningful when you set objectives before hand, but can be fun to just play with no objectives too. One of those rogue-lites that is more about learning the items and characters than unlocking new perks to improve."
23182,Fun with friends. If you and your friends beef over loot I highly recommend share loot mod. Cool characters. Cool enemies.

23229,"One of the rare games that actually feels like gamers made it. The game feels so good to play as any character and each ability suits a purpose without making it only useful in one situation. All unlocks are based on your skill to play the character so if you want to look snazzy, you're gonna need to put a few hours in. Addicting to get started with, but not so overwhelming to the point of the inability to turn it off. It's an amazing game and I could not recommend it more."

23233,"I love a game that isn't afraid to let you break it and this game not only allows it, but promotes.

If you like a game where no two runs really are the same, or just want a game to fool around in: you've found it.

I will say though, I dislike when a game doesn't tell you what the items actually do and just give you a ""funny"" description. Lucky for us this game has mod support, and oh boy do the mods enhance it ten fold. I mainly download QOL mods, but you can straight up add new unique characters and items with some of the mods available. 

In summary: great game, infinite replayability, mod support, and a wide selection of characters, abilities, and items to play around with."

23235,I think my hour count says everything.

23264,"It's easily become one of my favorite game. The learning curve is pretty steep in this game with so many items and variability in every running, but it's become very enjoyable after several running. They said there are 3 ways how you can beat this game:
1. Beat the final boss
2. Obliterating yourself at the moon
3. Looping too much while seriously questioning the purpose of your life and boom the game is crashing

The only regret I have is not getting this game before. Totally worth it."
23265,"Risk of Rain is an amazing game that combines all the aspects of a tricky 3rd person shooter/hack-n-slash game with resource and money management. Both of there pieces combined with amazing visuals, insane upgrades, a stellar soundtrack, and an awesome multiplayer community all combine to make this one of the most fun and addicting games I've ever played. Keep up the great work everyone!!!"

23279,"Very fun rouge like that I would suggest to anyone who is a fan of those types of games. It has a sort of gameplay loop that makes it very replayable, and there are so many rare items and secrets that you will be wanting to go back into runs to try and get them. Also, a wide range of classes to choose from, tons of ways to build them, and over all just so much more than what is on the surface of this game. If you are thinking about getting it, I would absolutely recommend you do so, you wont regret it!"

Only problem is that by default, RNG really dictates your loadout and you can get shafted if you dont get what you need for a specific character. However, there is an artifact/game modifier you can unlock which allows you to bypass this and choose exactly what items you want. Also another problem is the current final boss is super unfun to fight, but theres a second way to win each run so fighting him isn't necessary."

2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.

pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

23382,"Honestly, I'm going to cut the overly long review stuff I usually do and keep this one short and sweet, because whether or not I recommend you play Risk of Rain 2 heavily depends on if you enjoy roguelikes in the first place.

You do? Play it. It's my favorite roguelike.
You don't? Play it anyway.

You have a variety of difficulty options both for accessibility and a nice challenge, a solid foundation, developers that engage with the community shockingly often, a whole list of items, survivors, artifacts and skills to unlock to keep you playing, heaps of content on the horizon, and one hell of a soundtrack to boot.
Not to mention the fact that the game has a thriving modding community, adding anything from an implementation of expanded lobby numbers to a VR mod complete with implementation of motion controls. It ain't quite Skyrim, but I'm sure you've seen people joke about how Goku is a survivor in Risk of Rain 2. And... yeah, he is.

Risk of Rain was a little difficult for me to recommend to friends, but I have no problem at all telling people to play Risk of Rain 2."

23421,it good
23422,"FUCK YAHOLES

23426,"Great Game, Easy Moddability
"
23427,so good
23428,one of the best rouge like games ever made. An amazing race against the clock everyone should experience
23429,HATED THIS GAME...... until i found Loader.
23430,Definitely super fun! Its a good combination of RNG and skill that will give you hours of fun playing. Can't wait until the DLC is released!
23431,but seriously guys this game sucks
23432,Literally got me through COVID
23433,hate hate but then good good ASDD

23443,.
23444,I don't really know what I need to say. This game is simply great. Get that loop in.
23445,"Really god game. Alone or with friends, and it never gets old thanks to the randomnes."
23446,balls
23447,😐👍
23448,You play the game unlock an item play again
23449,"Bought this game less than two weeks ago and hit 100 hours in the game yesterday, I would 100% recommend that you download some mods, (from steam or otherwise, personally I use R2Modman) once you figure out the your playstyle, and the characters that you want to main as, this becomes one of the most fun games I have ever played. Although a quick warning, it is incredibly easy to lose many hours in your life incredibly quickly, over the weekend I mistakenly sink about 8 hours into this game and then on days where I have work or school I manage to but in about 4-5. 10/10 game, I would recommend whole-heartedly."
23450,"When I was thinking about getting Risk of Rain 2 I was not sure I would play it for long, however I'm sure many gamers know the feeling of when no game is fun to play anymore and simply wait at their PC for somthing to happen. I was fed up with this feeling and decided to give this game a go. I am very happy I did, at time of review I have had this game for 3 days and have put a total of 20 hours into it. Everything about this game is expertly done and I reccomend everyone to get this game if they can . Every charater feels unique, looks unique and plays derasticly diffrent. And the music is awsome aswell a genre i have never heard before and fits the game perfecly, 10/10"
23451,it is very epic 10/10 much poggers
23452,11/10 would get exploded again
23453,rain
23454,"No POC,LGBTQP+ sad how we have games coming out that don't include folx that are oppressed."
23455,great game
23456,wisps go haha
23457,good game
23458,"great game. great music, great combat, tons of replay ability, and its good with friends 9/10 would recommend to almost anyone"
23459,"gREAT GAME real fun. Love it,"
23460,my favorite game at the moment this game is a good time killer and overall fun to complete and discover mysteries
23461,I wish to fuck the artificer
23462,yes
23463,hhh
23464,☠You have shattered into innumerable pieces.☠
23465,.
23466,"Great game to chase goals or just kill some time.  Plenty of side and hidden things to find and do.  Challenges, hidden maps, artifacts, a little class customization.   The final boss is a really fun fight.  The whole final level for that matter. If you want a fun game to sink time into or just dabble with on the side look no further."
23467,10/10 cannot wait for the expansion
23468,"my game stopped working 















due to the risk of rain  :-)"
23469,Fun but very repetitive :(
23470,You become a God hell-bent on destruction and then get killed in half a second
23471,"Amazing game. Unique visuals/art style, fun gameplay loop, and a playstyle for everyone."
23472,good game
23473,"This game is absolutely brilliant, almost all of the items in this game (there is over 100) are useful in some way and never feels like its a bad idea to pick one up. RNG doesn't completely take over the game if you are good enough you can turn almost any run into a god run which makes it feel so rewarding to learn how to play.

every character has a distinct play style making sure anybody has a character they will enjoy playing, from Commando's simplicity to Loaders absolute chad kit to Engineer's do nothing and everything dies there is sure to be a character you will enjoy.

also this games sound track goes really hard
"
23474,great game. has been fantastic to play from the beginning and keeps getting better

23479,pew pew but super easy
23480,"This game has given me and some of my friends endless hours of entertainment, its also a good way to test the limits of your pc, plenty of oftions for mods as well and its always got the devs attention on updates with more playable characters and content. If your looking for a game thats fun to play or break, this is one of the top contenders on my list."
23481,yes
23482,"very fun game, didn't think I would love this so much!!!"
23483,A great game to play but I would recommend you have friends to play with so that they can endure the rain as well

With their easy level you will most likely die before the first stage boss appears. It's okay they have encouraging messages for you when you die ;) Always better with friends, but can be pretty fun solo. I enjoyed getting all the Acheviements and am excited for the DLC 03/01/2022"

this game is worth every penny"
23532,It's fun
23533,"Personal Thoughts/Experience:  I find that Risk of Rain is one of the best and challenging games I have, however the game is quite fun with friends, there will be some funny times, Some Challenging times,  And Oh boy is it chaotic but funny as hell!    I find it Hilarious with 4 people!  It was so fun, tuns of good moment with this game!

What I think:  I do suggest the game, if your looking for something that is fast, requires fast thinking time and almost perfect accuracy, Then this is the game to have!.....Overall it's a challenging and Fun game!

23540,this game is 100% cancer
23541,Good game
23542,It's fun! It's tense! Don't let your guard down! It's dangerous to go alone!
23543,very fun
23544,no i wont
23545,"Risk of Rain is a very fun game to play with friends or even alone. Had a bad day and just want to play braindead killing monsters? Perfect game. Want a game night with friends shooting monsters? Perfect game.
Every now and then, me and my mates play a run or two, changing difficulties and artifacts to make the runs different.

We already have all the character and the unlockables are really fun to do.

The replayability is very high, the mobs are very original and the gameplay is smooth.

is there a single bad thing to say about this game??? I can't think of any, play the game."
23546,"I love the game.  Sometimes I hate it but that's only due to it being a roguelike and you are meant to die and be swamped by enemies.  So if I am just playing single player normally I'll only have a couple games in me but if playing with friends, I can immediately play this all day because its a great game to play with friends.  The expansion is coming out in a few weeks and I plan to play that the day it comes out so I may update this review when that comes out if it adds anything to the game or if only the base game is necessary. They are adding new survivors for it which will probably make it worth it.  The only I guess downside to it is that it is from a kind of smaller developer which means that updates on the game due take more time; however, the update is normally very polished with little to no bugs unlike those triple a titles that are released with numerous bugs.  All in all, you will get mad at this game, but its the type of mad that makes you want to keep playing to get better so you can kick mithrix's butt."
23547,pew pew pew
23548,very good game the music is so good and the gameplay is also really good however there is one problem i have with the game and that problem is sometimes i would search every corner and i wouldnt be able to find the teleporter but this isnt really much of a issue for me because this problem would only happen at the start of my run
23549,Good Game
23550,YES
23551,Amazig
23552,"Yeah this game 
"
23553,"I gonna say it's about luck and try again every time ,so one more run for a better git gud."
23554,"A really great rogue-like that makes you say ""one more round"". The premise is simple enough, find the teleporter and advance the stages. The catch is there is a time-bound difficulty increase, the longer you spend in a stage, the harder it becomes. Spend your time wisely to loot and gear up, while advancing the stages as quickly as possible. There are 11 playable characters as of right now and they have different mechanics/playstyle. Having fun with friends is the way to go but you can still enjoy it solo. To enhance the replay value, the game has tons of mods that adds new content or tweak the mechanics. No wonder it's so highly praised."
23555,:)
23556,"So customizable it puts tears to my eyes sometimes. It was already an amazing fun game that is infinitely playable, meaning that every run is VERY different from any other run. Plus the base game ALSO has amazing levels of customization. Plus Hopoo actually cares about the game."

23561,"I haven't played this game in some time. Came back to it with some friends and it made me notice how well made this game is. This is an impressive presentation, the combat and abilities you progress in the game, are actually amazing. It shines far more in co-op than single player, but still that isn't a detraction in this instance. 

This game is so good you should play it with others. It's the only good thing Gear box has had a hand in, in years. 

Super recommended."
23562,is this game good? legit question i have 16 minutes
23563,Pretty addicting; the unlockables are cool and the lore looks interesting!
23564,In these 5 hours I've played I died. And then died some more. And after that died a little bit again. I love dying.
23565,borderline modern video game perfection
23566,"Fun, can be grindy if it goes long enough"
23567,Honestly one of the best rogue likes I've played in years. I started playing on console and moved to PC recently and I've been enjoying every second of it. If you're a fan of rogue likes give it a try.
23568,So Good
23569,god hates me
23570,
23571,los videojuegos de Risk of Rain es muy bueno
23572,"risk of rain two is like living in detriot, you're constant being attacked, everyone is holding cash, and you spawn with a weapon. 10/10, would jerk off to huntress again"

23575,Is good
23576,"safe from clouds
"
23577,fun
23578,"very neat and looks cool, cant wait for the new characters"
23579,"Surprisingly fun game.  Wouldn't recommend trying on controller, mouse and keyboard is much better.  The beginning is difficult because it just kinda throws you into the game without any tutorial.  If you stick it out for 2ish hours you should have the hang of it.  Keep moving AT ALL TIMES."
23580,"I can't do it justice with my reviewing time and skills. This game made me cry happy tears when I hit the last level and experienced the music, buy it"
23581,I found this by my friends and fell in love the play style is awesome!
23582,"The absolute layers to this game.

It's like a single player roguelike with DOTA or Overwatch skills and even the most useless looking skills can be extremely useful or powerful with the right usage, you constantly discover new ways to play, and I can't stop playing."
23583,very good and fun
23584,its cool and all but the multiplayer is a little glitchy :edit thanks for fixing multiplayer it made the game SO much better( tip if you cant get void fiend hop on with some randoms) i love ror2 cant wait to see whats next.
23585,"One of the Best Game Soundtracks Ever!!
Gameplay is the cherry on top."
23586,penis
23587,"yes
"
23588,"Just a solid action game with tons of secrets. If you die in multiplayer it sucks how you are just dead and that's it. Would be nice for the devs to throw in an item or something to let players revive dead comrades, or just have them respawn on every new round."
23589,"This is a really fun game and I don't generally even like the shooter games that much. The Artifact of Command makes it SO much better, so definitely unlock that ASAP! Have fun!"
23590,As difficult as the fisrt! As amazing as the first! ♥
23591,You know you've been playing for hours when you don't even know what the hell is happening on your screen.
23592,fuckin awesome
23593,sensory overload
23594,it was fun
23595,can say this is the first game where i have returned for every single update day one and always have a great session solo or with friends defiantly worth trying if you like rouge likes and playing with some friends and the mod community is insane!
23596,its good
23597,Big me kill big monster hehe

"
23621,"Amazing game. Tons of replayability. There's different challenges for each survivor, different loadouts, mastery skins, artifacts, and so much more that will keep you playing the game for hours.

10/10 would recommend."
23622,Contrary to the title it does not rain in this game! 2/10
23623,"good game, hard game , ruins friendships"
23624,shooty
23625,Its alright to put a couple hours into I guess.
23626,"Can't recommend, it runs so poorly late game. My specs are well above recommended with an intel i7 7th gen processor and a gtx 1660 super, by world 8 my fps cannot go above single digits for the life of me. Even when using mods to help the game run better it is not pleasant late game. Also there's a one-shot-protection mechanic but you have a whole map of enemies chasing you and it's just not fun to have hour long runs deleted just because you didn't get ""one shot"" you got hit by two shots that did 66% of your health and 34% of your health within single digit frames of eachother."

23642,fast and kill and destroy and fun and murder and zoom and critical hit and bonk!
23643,This game will put more hairs on your chest than straight black coffee and will give twice the rush that cocaine would. 10/10 recommend to crack addicts for breaking your crack addiction.
23644,"People who negatively rate this game only play COD. I said what I said, take it as you will."
23645,"this is just a generally good game, better with friends. only thing i'd change is the fact that sometimes i dont get the 'beat the game as this survivor' achievement when i do beat the game"
23646,"Honestly one of the funnest games ever, the character and build variety is off the charts and you can always mess up no matter how powerful you get if you're not careful. Great art style, there could be a hundred enemies on screen and there's still enough visual clarity to tell what's going on, and amazing music."
23647,9/10 great fun
23648,"If you want to have one of the best multiplayer experiences in any game, Risk of Rain 2 provides that easily and then some. It has great multiplayer and single player content to unlock, and it is very easy to get addicted to the gameplay with how many different stages, characters, items, and combinations there are to play with.

Easily one of the best games I've been playing since 2019, and even more so when we all had to go into lockdown."
23649,"fast paced, interesting action, quick to pick up but hard to master. Combat flows well, theres plenty of variety in both the character abilities and enemies that no two runs feel the same.
10/10, would highly recommend"
23650,meh

23657,The engineer is such a fun-gi 😎

23659,there's more to this game then you might think. also just a nice simple game to get lost in and grind out unlocks.

23661,"die a 100 times, win 1 time? nope... still playing."
23662,Addiction.
23663,Very good. Certified grug moment.
23664,"This game is fun period. Every run has me thinking on my feet. Whether Im trying to plow through monsoon for some skins, or if im laying back and playing with artifacts to get broken builds."
23665,Game fun jellyfish scary no let him touch or die.
23666,Do you even get styled upon?
23667,good game
23668,mmm yes the rain with come and you will die to a random wisp good game

23670,"This game is incredibly fun. Even more amazing with friends! 100% worth your money!
"
23671,"I know you're here, Mythrix. You big fucking nerd. Where' my goddamn Purity?"
23672,FUN
23673,"confusing at first, then strangely addictive."
23674,goated
23675,"amazing game with lots of cool mechanics and tons of things to do, every run u do something new"
23676,I like the pixels and three frames mashing into a piece of modern art on my screen.
23677,it rains sometimes ingame so its playable
23678,"There hasn't been a single game in my library that has made me so obsessed with than Risk of Rain 2. It's the only game I've actually been compelled to get all the achievements for. It's highly addicting and re-playable gameplay with a lot of possibilities for challenge always bring me back to it. Not only it's incredibly fun to play with friends, but also to play solo as well. And unlike other games, there's a lack of competitive sense to it, and I feel like that's what makes this game so great. Because it's community isn't about getting the highest rank or whatever but play together and see if together the best run can be achieved. It promotes teamwork and a sense of comradery not only with friends but with people online as well. Definitely recommending it if you want to play it with your friends."
23679,like doom x hades with coop
23680,Yeah it's fun
23681,pimps of pain
23682,"this is just like any other rogue-like, its fun, but multiplayer is the only issue i have. players do not share items. when playing with friends you can at least agree to split items as you come across them but if you play with random people then you are gonna be HURTING for items."
23683,soundtrack tho:)
23684,"This game is as follows. 
Its Dark souls, with FTL, and Borderlands, and A bullet hell game, all wrapped all into one! And the best part?
you can bring your friends!! Just... make sure you don't stare into the lights and explosions too much."
23685,pog
23686,good
23687,i guess its good
23688,"Very good game tons of replay-ability, no hold to sprint button available though, (if that matters to you.) Play it with your friends have a ton of fun."
23689,Absolutly Fire
23690,"wow, very cool"
23691,"First of all, I played Risk of Rain 1 before Risk of Rain 2 was even teased. I was huge into that game, it was so unique and interesting and I still don't think I've really played anything like that.

That being said, when Risk of Rain 2 was first released... I wasn't excited.
You see, I'm one of those weird hipsters that likes pixel indie games. I'm not very good at third or first-person shooters and (at the time, before I studied it in university) I didn't care for 3D graphics.

But Jesus, man. This game is just GOOD.

It's weird, it feels like it is simultaneously Risk of Rain 1 with just more content- but at the same time, it feels like it completely reinvented the idea.

This game has very charming graphics. It has a nice style that doesn't care about realism and instead leans into the cartoony feeling that gives it such a nice hold against many modern shooters. The lore of this game keeps you thinking and wanting to know more.

But ultimately, it's just fun. It's really, really fun. If you're a rogue-like fan like me consider putting down Binding of Isaac for just a bit and give this game one run.

You won't regret it."
23692,"If the difficulty multipiler timer hits ""HAHAHAHAHA"" and you're not the one laughing maniacally, something has gone very wrong in your run.

The first game was one of the best roguelike games ever.
Risk of Rain 2 said ""Let's do that again, but in 3D this time"".  And they did, making one of the best roguelike games ever.  Again."
23693,"This game good game, game good game this."
23694,My eyes rained after my first play through. Raining tears of joy because of how fun this game is.
23695,great time with friends
23696,pog
23697,"Dang, those tunes slap."

23713,Awesome best game i've played in years
23714,is fun
23715,nyoom
23716,"So this game essentially feels like that time in school where that one kid reminded the teacher that the homework was due that day riiiight before the bell rang, so you had the whole class chasing after you.

Except, you're that kid, and the critters that are after you are the rest of the class. As you traverse each level, you find yourself being chased by other classes, as the news starts spreading. Eventually, the seniors come after you too for being such a frickin nerd. Mithrix is basically that other buff kid that steals your lunch money, and he is NOT happy. In fact, he is asking you for an extra $1.55 to afford a delicious apple juice instead of those cruddy milk boxes that have those corny cow jokes on the side.

My point? This game is awesome, and you get to beat the heck out of that kid trying to steal your lunch money, or not (skill issue)."
23717,"Run away and shoot, run away and shoot, run away and shoot,.. zzzZzZzz"
23718,Way better than most recent triple A garbage out there.

imagine if doom eternal was a lil bit cartoony"
23723,good game
23724,"good game, would play for hours on end tbh even with the boys"
23725,Honestly one of the best roguelikes i have ever played they absolutely nailed every aspect of this game if your reading reviews for it just buy it its worth it and if you get your fill from the game theres a great modding community adding even more content
23726,Amazing character designs and fun gameplay
23727,"Roses are red
Take dio's friend, just in case
Let's find a place to rest
And play some ukulele... in their face"
23728,"Easily one of the best roguelikes out there right now with enough creative gimmicks and characters to keep anyone entertained. Well worth the price, secret hunting is where a lot of my enjoyment for the game comes from."
23729,"They weren't kidding with the rain thing, although it's a different kind of rain, but trust me, it's going to rain hell over you. Game is awesome, though, and the soundtrack is amazing, too bad they don't sell the soundtrack or have an option to listen to it in the game :("
23730,very nice
23731,very game. boww chick is hot
23732,Risk of Breaking youre Monitor 2
23733,its great
23734,you can weaponize the shrines of chance to kill your friends absolutely incredible game design
23735,It's pretty good.
23736,"This game is one of my all-time favorites! The art is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, and the music is beyond amazing. This is one of the only games out there that I could play for hours and hours and hours on end. I am so excited for more content and DLC. If you are looking for a really fun game to explore with your friends or solo I highly recommend this game. Again I will mention the music, because it's probably my favorite thing about this game, just beautiful."
23737,Fustling Bungus
23738,"mediocre game,for this price I would have expected more levels and enemies types,overall gets the game boring after getting to the end boss once.
"
23739,"Really fun, especially with friends. so far even with my lag it runs fine. I only die because of my terrible skills. I really recommend this game for who ever wants to give this game a shot. sure some parts are frustrating but you eventually get better over time."

23754,"Really fun!  I don't normal enjoy games that are based on surviving as long as you can and then dying and doing it all over again, but this game has such variety of items, builds, characters and enemies that it feels different every time.  The game also looks really good, and runs perfectly on my laptop.  I got it on sale, but after playing for a bit I would've been happy paying full price, if you're on the edge though maybe just wait for the next sale."
23755,"In this game you can become God (real)

23768,"Very fun, all survivors are fun to play and have different loadouts. You could play this game for years and it still be fun. So much variations in the way you play, you can use different artifacts with different survivors with different abilities and with different difficulties. If Monsoon isnt hard enough you can play eclipse mode. New DLC coming out in march so im happy."
23769,Yes very fun :)
23770,its to good
23771,"fun gameplay, cool abilities, distinctive item effects, beautiful art style, great world building, satisfying meta-progression between runs, highly customisable game modes.

This game is a grab your friends and get ready for all out non stop slaughter. The graphics may be simple but the game play and fun you will have is on point!
23786,"This game is very nice. The music, the worlds, the art style, it is all amazing. The game is challenging, yet fun. It is fun to play with friends, or solo! Highly recommend and I look forward to the upcoming DLC."

23799,Not my type of game but if you like repetitive gameplay loop with RNG then you'll like this one. I only play it with friends who want to play it.
23800,"Love this game, bought it on a whim and it's been really hard to put it down. Recently swapped to a new pc and now it runs like a charm. 100% recommend for roguelike fans."
23801,"Risk of Rain 2 is an incredible game, and I would highly, HIGHLY recommend it if you enjoy roguelike/lite games. The gameplay is fast-paced and extremely satisfying, the different characters and their playstyles are excellent, and each run is a wild ride to complete chaos and excitement. By collecting items you grow more and more powerful, but as you spend more time the enemies gradually get more powerful as well. Depending on how long you can survive, what items you get, etc, you can completely break the game in ridiculous and fun ways, or die trying."
23802,yes. good.

23843,"The first five hours are some of the LEAST enjoyable out of a LOT of different games I've played.

After those initial few milestones, this game just gives me an itch that cannot be scratched without a good Tri-Tipped Dagger.

I haven't even delved into the modding portion, and will probably update the review in post, but even now there's enough dopamine-fuelled, free-running, ability-mashing content to keep me coming back every time in the hopes that THIS time the Lenses printer is next to the Scrapper."

23850,"game's good. soundtrack is a banger and the gameplay loop is fun
i do recommend"
23851,Hot
23852,"This is one of the most fun games I have played in while. If you played risk of rain 1, this is pretty much the same game but as a 3rd person shooter and let me tell you it is only to the benefit of the series. The game offers a superb combination of casual and challenging runs (mostly challenging). And a very unique and fun way of powering up your character as you find more seemingly random items to affix to your character. 

Not necessarily a complaint with the game but there are a relatively small number of levels they have (currently), and they are not procedurally generated (but does randomly close off sections), this of course does reward players for exploring and memorizing where high value loot is hiding. Just unusual for a roguelike.  The price is on point, you get a very well made game for ~$20 and it supports a small developer that is set on making more content in the future. 
I cannot wait to see what this game and others Hopoo games plans to make in the future. (check out Deadbolt, by them as well)"

The graphics are excellent, the item potential is limitless, the character diversity is insane and if you really want you can play with up to 15 other people using console commands. This game is made for fun and it's still not even finished. They're continuing to add more, like the upcoming expansion. And if you can't afford the expansion you only need to play with a friend who has it and you'll be able to access everything but the new characters! 10/10"
23859,where enforcer :(
23860,Best roguelike i've ever played
23861,"This game is just flat out amazing. I honestly have a hard time finding a game i genuinely enjoy the same as this. several characters and unlocks and builds that you can try. the community is outstanding. and if you're like me and have done everything that you can possibly do in the game, then you can mod it to make it an entirely new one. 100% recommend!"
23862,wet

23872,yes
23873,good
23874,"Don't as questions, get in."
23875,the game is good if you have someone to play with
23876,"very fun game, scary how many hours go by without you realizing while playing this game, love looking completely decked out with all the items showing up on you, the possible combinations with all the items. Definitely one of my favorite games"

23881,"What a game, I was gifted this by a friend, but wasn't too sure id like it. I'm currently 184 hours in and still haven't unlocked everything, there's so much to do, so much to find and so much to piece together. If you like rogue-likes, (or don't, it doesn't really matter with this. everyone i know who has played it loves it) then it is definitely worth a go. the enemies are fantastic, the music is phenomenal and the gameplay loop is so incredibly good that i don't care i died 4 hours into a run, i'm pressing restart and going again. With the upcoming DLC due in a month i want to get every achievement before, and once I've done that, there's no way in bulwarks ambry that i'm going to stop playing. 10/10."
23882,10/10 would get 1 shot killed again
23883,"Very fun roguelike game. Takes a few runs to start actually being fun, it seems a little plain at first. The initial learning curve is kind of steep but once you catch on to the game a bit it gets much much better, and only continues to do so to the point where it's just an insane experience."
23884,"A surprisingly fun yet simple game, Risk of Rain 2 is an action-packed game that I can't stop coming back to. Risk of Rain 2 is a somewhat simple game with a short story, you play through the game on short ""runs"" that you can take on alone or with up to three friends. Gameplay involves fighting off hordes of enemies and bosses, and collecting items to help you survive. However, you are always on the clock though, literally, there is a timer on the screen at all times that is linked with the difficulty. The longer you play, the harder it gets. The game length on an average run is typically 30 minutes to an hour. Nevertheless, this game is surprisingly dense and packed with content and secrets to make it feel almost infinitely replayable. There are many ways to customize your gameplay, such as changing a few of the game's rules using ""Artifacts"", or with many unlockable items and characters / loadouts that you can unlock via progressing through the game and collecting achievements by completing challenges, you can utilize these to easily make an infinitely long run. There are plenty of things to keep you busy in this game. This game can be surprisingly unforgiving towards newer players, however this game made me feel strongly accomplished as I got better. 

Not for everyone, but definitely for me.

23892,RoR2 is brutally difficult but lots of fun with friends. Great mod support and additional content from Hopoo games. There is a lot to learn with this game to get good. I would highly recommend checking out Woolie as he has the best educational content!
23893,it fun
23894,"Absolutely amazing game, has so much replayability and content. With the void update coming I cant wait to add another couple hundred hours of time. But unfortunately, I can never play the game again. Hopoo I hope you can understand."

23899,"I typically wasn't a fan of these types of rogue-like games for whatever reason ( I know I'm crazy) until my friends made me give this a try. I liked it almost immediately and the addiction has grown ever since. I love the design and how you can keep learning different builds for each survivor. Looting is a bit too addicting, but I love the scaling and balance of it all. Incredibly fun, especially with friends."

23908,It's a good game.

23924,"It's like whenever you say ""Oh, last match."" You then proceed to play 30 more match.  

All in all, would recommend to people that want a challenge. It's a great way to pass time, great game."
23925,"it good, i like, you should play. that is all"
23926,"Shoutout to mithrix for making me lose any last trace of hope for completing this game . 
"
23927,"I absolutely adore this game, it's my favourite roguelike. The game already has heaps of content for the base price and it will only get better with the first DLC coming in a month.

This game really is the best possible sequel to the original and it's just superb."
23928,Very nice
23929,good

23936,"The base game was one of the most fun rogue likes I have ever played.
Was excited for the dlc.
Hate the game since then.
They introduced so much bullshit in this add-on that just insta-kills you in the most cheap ways possible.
Playing thru the game in monsoon was challenging BUT the fun kind of challenging pre-dlc.
Now, it just feels like a chronic chore without any kind of satisfaction to gain since you don't ""beat"" monsoon anymore, you just ""somehow survive it by finding S-tier items"".

PLEASE rebalance this dlc and bring back one of my fave games of all time."
23937,"Absolutely love this game, if you get it here, you can use it in offline mode and it kills the time until you get back online. I'd donate money if I could, unfortunately I'm not rich. Just you wait! <3"
23938,"lots of fun, replay-ability is amazing, specially if you use mods, cant wait for survivors of the void to come out, you will die allot, but that is part of the fun.

(it also never rains)"

23940,"You know when you find the perfect RPG, with all the bells and whisltes? And you can't stop playing it because of the in-game currency your grandmother keeps buying your for holidays comes in the mail on a Wednesday?

23956,"It's a very challenging and thrilling game to play either alone or with friends.  The characters are all diverse and unique with their own personal skill sets. Some of the bosses are rather difficult, but it's all very exciting and laughable when you get to the later stages and just kill everything instantly"
23957,"Very fun game, hours of fun and great with friends"

24004,"Incredible rogue-like shooter that is inherently replayable. There is some permanent progression with unlocking character abilities and items to drop, but there is no metagame with rankings or promoting classes. The game is replayable because it's just fun to play. 

Music is fantastic. Love the art style. Can't recommend this game enough."

great game to just waste time on when have nothing else to do

Cons:
I fell down the rabbit hole of nsfw mods, please help me"
24032,"I don't really know what to say. This game has blown me away. I expected to have some fun, not to find a beautiful, story rich, and addictive game with the most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard in a video game. This game and it's respective playerbase is fantastic. If I had any friends left, I'd force them to play this game with me."
24033,damage
24034,"game worth every money you spend, good graphic, good uh everything really"
24035,good game
24036,"I played the first game for a bit and it loved it. The sequel is just as strong and I have been both games a lot recently. I wouldnt say its a game where if your on fence I would say just take the plunge, but more than likley if you are on the fence you will like it. All the characters are unique and diverse so although the starting commando may not be your cup of tea, you will find someone in the roster that fits with you, mine is artificer.

Time does not seem to play as much of a role in 2 compared to the first, still very important, but does seem a little less important with side events and realms to explore that freeze time and drop loot. Not a bad thing, but something I noticed I will point out.

Both games are great and where most rougelikes can barely keep me playing after 10 or so hours, I still come back to the first and dont even feel close to done with the second as of rn."
24037,"Fine game. Many characters to choose from, amazing visual style, great soundtrack. BUT, despite having a lot of items most builds on every character end up being crit+speed+proc chains. Some enemies have ridiculous spawn rate and spawn in swarms making killing them a chore. Others (elite enemies) are just bullet sponges and force you to pick some particular items to make killing them less boring and tedious. At the very beggining of the game you are at mercy of RNG to give you items, yet you can do some unlocks to be able to pick whatever item you want for your build. Some characters are very underperforming on higher difficulties, it doesn't matter what items you pick, you can't counter balance all their flaws and it's not fun to play them. Game suffers from severe fps drops when you play longer than 1 hour because there is just so much happening on screen it turns game into a slideshow.  Otherwise, it's a great game to play coop with friends for a couple of times. Some might say gameplay gets boring and formulaic the more you play and I agree. But I just like to get numb and click on targets and watch fancy visuals."
24038,gud game
24039,"It started off as a relaxing, slow-paced dungeon crawl, but by the end it was hell. It took nearly 50 hours to beat. Despite each time I failed, and each run I lost, I knew I needed to go another round. 2 am? I can sleep at 3. Work starts in an hour? I can squeeze in one more game. The enemies scale rather well, and I never found an obstacle I could never overcome. The items are all fun, and unique, and you often won't have two runs that are the same. The combat is pretty fluid, and every enemy has it's own niche ability, that keeps things fair, but always makes you feel like you're fighting against overwhelming odds. The end boss is challenging, and if you can even make it there, you're either extremely lucky, or you have everything you need to beat it. And for me, I've finally beaten it, and without a doubt I feel like I know enough now to say that, you should buy it. Don't wait for a sale, don't wait for risk of rain 3. Buy it now, and at the very least try a few runs before you refund, and trust me you won't get far, but you'll have a blast."
24040,"Everyone I've talked to seems to love this game, it may very well be a good game.
However there is very little to no assistance for new players.
It is very beginner unfriendly.
Additionally, if motion sickness is a problem for you, beware.
Also if you're starting out, play solo."
24041,"So, you play for about the first two-three hours, not really sure of how you're gonna do it. You've seen how the difficulty can go, but also you've seen how fun it could be. Eventually, you get your friends in and you just vibe, and get exponentially better at the game. It's fun as hell, and both surprisingly immersive and lore-filled. Buy it, or nut in a sock; do what you want."
24042,Mercenary + 50 or more Soldiers Syringe + Eviscerate = That Anime move you've always dreamed of where your blade is too fast for the enemy to see.

You don't need a group to enjoy this game, I'm having a great time solo! Every round is chaotic and a blast."
24054,"Another game that is visually appeasing to look at, even with how simplistic it is. Can be rather repetitive, but the variety and diversity of the classes you can choose make for a nice change when you need it. I do recommend a group of friends when you're playing this as it's more fun."

24115,i love boby
24116,0/10 not enough precipitation so you never actually feel at risk of the rain
24117,yeh
24118,its super fun to play solo and verry fun to play with friends too. i would really recommend it.
24119,I bought for the VR mod and its awesome!
24120,"this is honestly the best game I've ever gotten. a friend recommended it to me and I don't regret a single penny spent. if you're looking for a game to play with your friends or on your own, this is the one. to quote that guy who made a video on this game, ""spend all your money. buy it twice."""
24121,"The combat is satisfying, the gameplay is fun and the final stage is amazing.

And then there is the awesome music. It perfectly compliments the action.

Definitely would recommend."
24122,Good game
24123,DAMN! Really good.
24124,Great game. Spent hours with friends enjoying this game. then we discovered glowing meteorite.
24125,"Play, get confused, die & play again."
24126,"every positive review is true
get this while on sale and you get the best deal in your life"
24127,☠That was absolutely your fault.☠
24128,The rain physics alone are a solid 10/10

24131,Fun
24132,"Game should be called ""Risk Of Addiction 2."""
24133,One of the best
24134,"Very good rouge-like thanks, good replay-ability and 3D fun."
24135,"Unplayable if you have extra controllers like a HOTAS, it will override mouse-keyboard, I will not unplug them just to be able to play this game. How hard is to at least add a command line flag to disable controllers? Not hard."
24136,"Fun game, even single player has great replay ability."
24137,"I would play this all day and all night if i could, its incredibly fun"
24138,It's a very interesting game. The game is the only 3D roguelike I have seen and it plays amazing. The game is really fun and still stays hard to play. 10/10 would recommend.
24139,"Easy to learn, fun and exciting game. I'm thankful that I got it as a gift."
24140,"got insta-gibbed by the final boss
10/10"
24141,you like shoot stuff at things and they die and its fun

24146,this game is crack cocaine
24147,very pog
24148,funny space game
24149,This meme is pretty good. At times it gets a bit too memey but there's always the promise of the next meme to keep you coming back for more.
24150,very fun

24158, fun
24159,Play it
24160,"play this, 10/10 banger game"
24161,"i love how this is just a 3D version of the original, such a good game"
24162,yummy
24163,Played for 8 hours and I've seen no rain. False advertising. 5/10 pretty mid. Gameplay is good though.
24164,No rain bad game
24165,goated
24166,The lack of rain is noticeable.
24167,"Nice combat builds, so much variation, smooth raise on difficulty, felt better in solo."
24168,One of my favorite games of all time
24169,"It reminds me of Nephilim Rifts from Diablo but done well as a third person shooter. Hopefully the devs add more heroes and maps but with mods you can add a few pretty well made heroes, some of which fit the theme well."
24170,die
24171,"You're op until you're dead in one shot. There's supposed to be a mechanic that prevents that, but I haven't seen it. Don't buy it unless you have friends who have it, single player gets stale fast."
24172,this game is horrible
24173,"Played it at a mates, yeah this is pretty good.
Brought it, plays for 7 hours the first time I boot it up. Fuck where has the day gone. Missed a date and didn't eat all day, twenty bucks well spent."
24174,"Very fun, every run is different, always more things to do. Muchos grande pog"
24175,It makes me mad 10/10
24176,really cool game for epic gamers
24177,"highly recommend this game for people who are debating it. Has it all; unique character classes, plenty of achievements to hunt, multiplayer modes for people who want to play together and amazing lore that you can read through. If you are debating getting this game just get it. 10/10"
24178,hi im son goku
24179,"lots of risk, not so much rain."
24180,I just got the game yesterday and already have 11 hours. Very Good. Such wow.
24181,"If you looking for challenges, great bosses , amazing skills and crazy combats  this game is what have you been looking for a hidden gem of 2020 , great to play with friends  but be careful this game is not for casuals it requires communication and skill.

"
24182,A high chance of moisture
24183,"very fun game, glad for it to be one of my first steam games"
24184,14 Crowbars + Glaive = Win
24185,"A very good game overall for a rogue like, I have done many different things and have found it mostly enjoyable with friends. And when the base game finally got a bit boring I went to modding which added a bunch of new characters. Although I must say it is hard to get bored of the base game for how well done it has been. I would recommend this game and say it is even worth it at full price if you love rogue likes."
24186,this game is fun but never look at or interact with anyone in the risk of rain 2 discord server ever
24187,I like it
24188,"Very entertaining game, a great follow up to the first game. I enjoy the way they tell the story through item descriptions, and the logbooks.

Some tips.

1. Run, never stop running, only stop when the Stone Titan is about to blast and get behind cover.

2. Try making a build you prefer after doing a few runs and familiarizing yourself with the items.

3. Lunar Coins.

That's about that it my guys."
24189,Very addiction spent a lot of time with my friends playing this
24190,"nearly as hard as dark souls, underwelming character diversity and too hard to unlock new characters, refunding this godawful excuse for a roguelike fighting game, not worth my time"
24191,"good game, please give captain other secondary skill"
24192,4/5 raindrop drop-tops
24193,FPS Roguelite = Good

Easy 10/10"
24205,gasoline
24206,"Fun to play, yet most annoying game I have ever played in my life.

Game starts pretty slow where it consumes your first 10-15 minutes. When you die all effort will be lost. While you try to survive the game becomes much difficult.

When you activate teleport to switch to next stage, you may still end up dead.

There is no save and load options. There is no proper guide related to how important time is. Which items are important for which characters."
24207,"Cool game
A bit boring imo"
24208,"ahhh good gamr
"
24209,"This game is quite literally perfect in every way. I could just leave it that but that would be just touching the surface of this games perfection, feeling around the labias if you will. In this review I wont just be corrosing the labia, I will be going full fist in. This video game has no flaws and you will never find another like it. Its unique game play and art style are just the first layer of its perfection. The deeper layers of this sacred onion are all the different game play techinques and strategies, the challenges you'll have to overcome. At some points of the game you will be completely overwhelmed with the variety of enemies and will just have to click keys and hope to not get beamed by a giant stone titan, but thats the beauty of it. This game will make you feel like you took 27 percs and decided to down a quart of lean. The vibrant colors and lightshows will provide you a euphoria that your discord kitten cant even provide you."

24234,20 fps never felt this exciting!
24235,Amazing
24236,Good with Friends!
24237,I have not played a game this much in a long time. Over the past 2 years I've been struggling to get into a new game and Risk of Rain 2 does just that for me. Its fun to play solo but its also really fun to play with friends. I really love the mysterious aesthetic where you don't completely know whats going on with the story but you go along with it and find out more. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. You can get a lot out of this game no matter what your preferences are. If you do struggle to get into playing it consistently it might be because you havent found your character yet. All the characters offer drastically different playstyles and finding the one you like is a fun journey.
24238,"At the start this game really struggled, the updates they put in fixed that. It's a very fun game to play with friends, hoping for more updates soon to add more content as i'm kind of maxed out."

24250,Really fun rougelike shooter. Lots of classes to pick from. Lots of abilities to help you out. Lots of items to learn and try to remember. Lots of secrets to find. LOTS of enemies to kill (or be killed by more likely). Every run is different.
24251,Pog

24253,"best game ever 10/10 i get lunar coins from nowhere great game :)
"
24254,"Nice very hard rogue game. With tons of fun mechanics with tons of different builds survivors, large mod comunity. waiting for dlc."
24255,"Finding the teleport gate can be hard sometimes.  Lots of items to unlock and enemies to kill, and giants at HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHA"
24256,"Great game to play with friends. A fun challenge with room for ridiculousness to happen causing hilarity amidst the challenge of pressing on to see how far you can go! You don't get the same items so you have to see what you can do on the fly. Ended up staying up too late with 6 hours of game play, but it was worth it."
24257,"Lot of confusing things, hidden items, and you can easily reach a point in a run where you just spam on ability (disposable rocket launcher w/fuel cells) to get upwards of 40+ Q abilities to just cheese the run.

Other than that, it is fun for a while until you get bored."
24258,"It's alright, makes my hand cramp"
24259,"Its great, love it to bits. This game takes the rouge-like category to a whole new level. only complaint is the sometimes monsoon is too easy."
24260,"played it for a bit, it's good i guess idk"
24261,very good gamae
24262,good with friends and good solo. lots of stuff to do.

24273,"As someone who has kinda had a bias against rougelite games, I was hesitant to give this game a try. But then my friend suggested it to me, and gifted me the game. I figured ""oh hell its a free game, if I don't like it I won't be getting mad over it.""

This is probably one of the most intense, action-packed, and skill-evolving games I've ever took the time to get good at, and I am glad that I have a different opinion towards this genre of videogame.

Thanks for making such a dope game. :3"
24274,"It good, make my brain go bzzzzz"
24275,"Addictive 3D rogue-like shooter with a huge amount of charisma and fun co-op play. There's a lot of lore to uncover if that's your thing too. The original 2D pixel art game was a blast, not expecting a second one to release when it did I was blown away by their transition into 3D and Hopoo games have done an amazing job!"
24276,"Great with friends, minimal hassle to play online even modded, tons of stuff to do, stunning visually. Exceptionally polished game, so even if rogue likes aren't my favorite, I really appreciate this one."
24277,Ruined my sleep schedule
24278,"So I don't normally play these kinds of games, but this one got its hooks into me really quick. A lot of fun to play with just one friend online. Smooth as silk, low loading times, lots of variation, good opportunities for teamwork. Easy to see this offering at least 20 hours of quality game time. Nice."

24313,Very fun game with lots of characters and items to make it fresh every time. Its also multiplayer which is probably the best feature. its fun even on your own but is best with a friend or two.
24314,Loader :)
24315,"I HATE THIS GAME
IN CONCLUSION. pretty good

24316,I'm too bad at the game to play on Monsoon. 10/10
24317,buy this game. its amazing and EXTREMELY addicting. there's only so much but still SO much replay ability that you can still enjoy the game even after playing through it. One of the best games of all time. and it's only 25$ like look over at worse games being 50$. Worth all the money and time
24318,fun gane

24346,"You will look at the time, think you have time for another run, and when you look back it will be 9am"
24347,brain rot
24348,"This game keeps me coming back for more when other games leave you with that feeling of ""That's It?"". Hands down one of the best games I have played in a long time. A few things to think about when going into this game, one your not going to own it the first time through. Second, you will find various visual and sound queues to help you. Lastly, you will need to play the game from start to finish to unlock a lot of the characters/additional special skills. If you can get more than one person to play in the same game, it is a boat load of fun to be had by all. Huge recommend to buy this game. Really well thought out characters/gameplay."
24349,"300 hours and many more to come. one of my all time favourite games, fun by yourself or with friends. all achievements unlocked so do yourself a favour, buy it. you won't regret it."
24350,Fun rogue game
24351,"one of the best roguelike games ever made, would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys those types of games."
24352,"My review of this game so far, just from one play with my friend, i love it, it's one of the coolest games i've ever played. 
out of 10, i would rate this a solid 9.5/10"
24353,"At first i was hesitant on getting the game mostly because i really liked the first one and i felt going 3d would be the series undoing, i couldn't have been more wrong.

Not only did it open up so much more value in every single way, it still managed to capture the essence of the first game.

for those not in the know, you kill monsters, you gain new abilities to the point you become a ultimate bad ass powerhouse right up till you die and you start all over again while unlocking things along the way.

it's a very delightful rush throughout the entire game.

in  terms of negative notes, the only issues sometimes (usually rarely) while playing multiplayer the lag  between players can make it difficult to play which may not the fault of the game.

Definitely worth checking out and it's got DLC on the way which i cannot wait for."
24354,Is good game. Would recommend.
24355,You won't last 5 minutes playing this game!
24356,don't fall off in void fields
24357,Fun Mayhem.
24358,"Sometimes you wanna methodically place your crosshair on enemies and left click to kill them. Sometimes you just wanna move your mouse around while hammering LMB. If you find yourself in the second scenario often, this is for you. Loads of fun. So much replay value even after completing it on various difficulties. Not too expensive. There's nothing to complain about. Go for it already"
24359,It hasn't even rained once for me
24360,One of  the best  rouge like out there. the repeatability of this game is amazing and I could spend countless hours playing it. and if you get bored of base game the modding community is so vast i doubt you would ever run out of content. 10/10
24361,"Absolutely beautiful game, fun and absolutely worth playing"
24362,i really enjoyed this game. To the point that I grinded for hours on end to get every single achievement. I would definitely recommend to play with your friends
24363,"Could not beat normal mode solo without the artifact of command, hardly ever play with command on.

9/10

Update: Beat it after 200 hours with engineer mobile turrets and 4 legendary items"

24369,This game is absolutely incredible and you should play it right now. I keep coming back to it after a few weeks and it is just so much fun. I never thought a 3rd person shooter rougelike would be good but this game is actually incredible.

24456,Would recommend Risk of Drain 2 too anyone
24457,"I'm really not sure what the devs did to this one, it was amazing when it released but has somehow gone backward in progress. For starters, spawn rates are really, really messed up. (waiting 3+ minutes for enemies to spawn, only 1 or 2 enemies spawning per wave, etc.) My last run I had killed less than 50 enemies by the 15 minute mark at stage 3 and was bored out of my mind literally standing around for 2-3 minutes after every few kills to wait for enemies to spawn. On top of that, there are game breaking bugs including your teleporter (the thing that allows you to progress further) spawning inside of objects. And don't even get me started on the waste of development resources that is Mithrix (the ""final boss""). Sadly at this late stage in the game's life I don't think we will see it ever returned to its former glory (it really was amazing in early access) so we are kind of stuck with what we've got which I would most definitely not recommend to anyone interested in this genre of game."
24458,yes
24459,mind-numbingly satisfying gameplay mechanics
24460,'sgood
24461,All you need is 12 Crowbars ;)

24466,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while. It's very addicting and honestly kind of hard to get mad at. I died on an almost 2 hour run and went right into another run. All the characters are diverse and fun to play, it's fun to witness your character power up the deeper you get into a run too."
24467,bruh this game is soooooooooooooooooo good when my pc broke and i was on my realy bad laptop i was not able to play any games on it i was like a meth addict who went over a week without meth when i got steam on my laptop fist thing i did was play this game.
24468,its very good buy it twice
24469,"Fantastic Game! If you like games where the devs encourage you to try your hardest to break it, then this is for you. However, if you're offered power on a silver plate, you'll likely need it..also the music absolutely slaps my cheeks, so that's cool too"
24470,good game
24471,So many things to unlock!
24472,"This will probably go down as one of my favourite games of all time. It's one of the few games that I find truly addicting. A perfect balance of luck and skill makes it consistently a blast to return to and anytime I have a spare hour it's the first thing I run to. If you remotely enjoy anything resembling a rogue-like, buy this game!"
24473,It's an awesome game with BEAUTIFUL graphics and art style. It's a new experience each time that you dive in.

Lunar items feel 100% detrimental, with the exception of: based Tonic, Broken Glass, Gesture of the Drowned, Glowing Meteorite

24537,"Risk of Rain 2 is an amazing game which is difficult to learn all of it's secrets. My friends introduced it to me not to long ago, and I'm hooked! Totally worth it's cost! I say, if you are a fan of rogue-like games, get it.
 I would say though if you do play make sure to play on your own a bit not just with friends. You don't want to just be carried bye other people the entire time. It's a challenging game, but very fun."
24538,"good game, make sure to play with ur friends. it's more better than solo"
24539,You can be spider-man
24540,easy for anyone to pick up and play. I got a bunch of my friends to play with me
24541,funny bungus man fucking dies
24542,good
24543,"Even after playing this game for 30+ hours both vanilla and modded, I don't think I'll stop any time soon. The game is insanely fun and difficult, with a welcoming community and amazing developers, a killer soundtrack and an upcoming dlc that's gonna add more to it. 
If you're having doubts as to if you should or shouldn't buy this game, please give it a try, even for $25 the game is 1000% worth it (and on sale that percentage sky rockets).

And with a modding community that keeps getting better as time goes on, making their own original characters, items and secrets, the content is endless. There's even a fan made VR Mod that works surprisingly extremely well. 10/10"

24547,fuckin goes alright ay
24548,hehe loader go bonk
24549,killing yourself is a legit way to 'win' the game
24550,"I gotta write another honest review and this one is high on that list so let's go.

This game is quite the statement, I enjoy games that don't have too big of an audience or a big enough audience to be enjoyable, and this is that middle ground that somehow works, not only is the game really fun but I also enjoy playing it solo AND with friends, which is rare, it is either one or the other.

The game is great, the progression is awesome and the story... it's interesting, I like the game as it is easy to come back to every once in a while. It is welcoming and isn't too hard to master, but fuck me do the achievements take a long ass fucking time to finish.

I am legit annoyed that I couldn't get the achievements legit due to a mistake where I wanted to unlock everything on a alt profile and then it just gave me all the achievements due to it, which I didn't expect, and I am fucking pissed off due to it.

Good game, but fuck the stupid fucking config files, they can suck my dick
8.5/10"

I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work...

24633,"The most fun you can have with friends in a shooter.

At first the environments seem like they would get boring since the areas are not procedurally generated. However, the game's replay value is extremely high (due to the distinct characters and interesting items) and it's easily worth the price."
24634,"Game is shit. You have to play multiple times to unlock all characters (after beating the boss once theres nothing to do may i add) So you beat the boss, get a character and you have to do that shit all over again.

Spawn, grind, kill repeat

The characters are a whole different topic, all of them (besides loader) are shit. So you have to grind with dumb characters just to get the one you might like.
No replay ability. After playing enough times with your friends you just play this game in auto pilot just spamming moves and not thinking about it
Dont waste your time and money on this shit."
24635,"What a thrill. This game is so much fun, recommend playing with friends on a higher difficulty. The music slaps, and the game play is addicting - what more do you need? Every play through feels fresh, especially getting a variety of different builds. I highly recommend, I cant believe it took me this long to pick it up!"
24636,the soundtrack alone is worth the price
24637,gud game
24638,"I highly recommend this game. Just keep that in mind when I say that it has one of the worst (no spoilers) final boss designs I have ever seen. Looks cool and sounds awesome, but drags on forever and kills you at pretty much the exact same point every time in the same way (in a rouge-like.) Other than that, I recommend the original RoR even more highly than 2."
24639,:D
24640,fun
24641,Great game. Each of the additional survivor load-outs provides a fresh way to enjoy different aspects of the game. The achievements are fun and challenging.
24642,I've become bungus
24643,"If you like roguelike games ----- buy it.

Done. There you go.

I dropped this because the game is confusing at first. I played maybe 3 runs and I was like ""bro what even am I doing"".
Big mistake. Play this game, and find out for yourself (because the game tells you jack) how great this game is. 

As soon as this game clicks for you... it clicks big time."
24644,"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE
Introduction

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.

5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM

6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.

7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)

8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.

FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY

10. By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.

11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped” or “chick” for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate.” They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)

12. Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families."

24735,"great game with a lot of replayability, the best roguelike I've played so far."
24736,"Fungus
"
24737,"gud game but where do I start
"
24738,"This game is really fun and well executed on very many levels

Combat: each character in this game feels totally unique and has a fun and devastating move set, and each boss and enemy in the game is equally as unique and fun to fight against, especially the final boss

Exploration: each stage is grand and epic to explore with beautiful scenery and graphics all around, even on low settings like mine. Finding every hidden thing is a super fun part of the game and will take dozens or hundreds of hours

Design: the whole design of the game encourages risk taking for reward. Go fast and have less items, of go slow and have more items, while the enemy's are getting stronger by time. It's a very fun mechanic that puts a ton of pressure on the player while still totally allowing for freedom to play how you want

Unlockables: this game has toooons of unlockables that will take many hours to unlock, but they are all fun and completing the challenges to unlock them is fun as well. Highly recommend for people who lov to unlock abilities and items

Music and sound: both the music and sound design in this game is phenomenal. Despite the variety of dozens of monsters, you will always know what monsters are near just by the sounds they make. And the music is outstanding. I have played the game for hundreds of hours without getting bored of the soundtrack. The ambience of each stage music, the intense battle music, and the beautiful guitar solos make this one of my favorite video game soundtracks

Fun with friends: this game is so much fun with friends. Obviously that's not for everyone, but if you have a group of friends you love to game with, introduce them to this. The games scales very well with groups of players and using your different members abilities to team up and survive is very fun

Variety: there is soo much variety in the gameplay. Not only do you have different classes, but each class has tons of unlockable abilities and powers to use. Additionally, with hundreds of items, you can make tons of different powerful and unique loadouts to wreak havoc and become an unstoppable killing force

In summary, this game is just very fun for people who love combat, abilities, unlockables, exploration, goofing off with friends, or even music. Even some interesting lore to boot, if you're into that, however it's not necessary to enjoy the gameplay. Overall it's just a very fun game and very much worth the price. I recommend just about everyone should give it a try! :steamthumbsup:"
24739,"Just a little mindless fun.  My gaming group friends talked me into buying this and I kept putting it off until it was on sale.  Now, 90 hours in, it would have easily been worth the full price of admission.  I'm not much for playing it alone, but with a group of several people in voice chat and some good mods, this game is an easy way to lose five hours without noticing."
24740,"Lots of fun as a casual game, esp with friends"
24741,"this game sucks, doesnt give you any point on where to go after killing the final boss and lost an hour of progress. great game(sarcasm, game is really fun, would recommend)
"
24742,"lots of fun , even more fun with friends"
24743,someone buy it and play with me

24760,"This game is amazing. It allowed me to move at light speed at the single tap of the W key. It allowed me to jump 57 times before inevitably dying to fall damage. It allowed me to play as doomfi- i mean loader. I even got to play genj- i mean mercenary, not to mention playing as torbj- i mean engineer. Sorry for the stutters, I'm tired. Anyway, this game is great, and was worth my wife leaving me because i went on a run and missed our daughter's wedding. Great use of 90 minutes though, I unlocked Mercenary."
24761,it's good

24766,"It was a little confusing what the appeal was for this game, but after playing it with friends it became clear that Risk of Rain 2 is a lot of fun. About 30 minutes in, it turns to absolute chaos where there is so much screen clutter from the bombs and exploding enemies you think you're going to have a seizure while 1 shotting bosses and running 50 mph around the map. Super fun and would recommend 10/10"

The modding scene is also very active, meaning even more way to create some bullshit ! :D

24836,"Ror2 isn't immersive, it doesn't have much of a story if you don't go out of your way to read logs and can be extremely unforgiving even when compared to games such as dead cells, hollow knight, Hades etc. But what it does do is provide very good graphics and art style paired with gameplay that just feels great from the time you get out of the escape pod to the time you stand as a god being barraged by 100 monsters attacking you all at once. I very rarely find any issue with framerate on my nividia 3060 and ryzen 3600 and only once has the game ever crashed in over 80 hours of gameplay. I recommend this game to anyone looking for an affordable game assembled by a crew that really put passion and effort into making a game with huge amounts of content that feels like is made for enjoyment and not a cash grab."

24848,"My friends played this game waaaay before I ever did, and I never really got the appeal of it. I tried to watch them play it and it looked like the most boring game of all time. I'm glad to say that I now realize the error of my ways. It's so much fun. I haven't played much of it, but it's easily one of the best games I've ever played. Plus, you never know which item you're gonna get, so you always have that sense of wonder about what you're gonna get from a crate. 10/10 game in my book."
24849,fun but when i got to the end and the moon was blowing up the invisible gate was still closed and i was stuck in the chamber after a whole hour i got so angry is this a bug or did i do something wrong as i watched people just walk out of there once the boss was defeated
24850,"Unique action roguelike with a large variety of characters and powerups. Customizable movesets and artifacts allow the player to control or further randomize gameplay aspects.
Runs can last until your computer explodes or you pick up a benthic bloom, with your strength being inversely correlated with your frames per second."
24851,It has great gameplay fun with friends and with mods it can make the game either 30 time more fun and easy or crazy and hard its a great game and I would recommended playing with friends
24852,game is pretty good
24853,yep yep
24854,"Risk of Rain 2 is a great game, enormously entertaining and with a great amount of content, in short, a good exponent of its genre.
Although I have played very little and I have discovered very little content with respect to all that the game can give I can say that the game surprises from the first moment with its artistic and musical section, which combines with a very entertaining gameplay that allows you to develop your own style of playing.

I have had really bad performance since day 1 of owning it. My computer is an asus gaming laptop with a GTX 1070. This should have been more than enough to play it but when things get hectic, the frame rate drops to less than 10 fps. I am very disappointed and wish I could play it."

24920,"Despite the look of the game, I found victory coming down a lot to luck, and less so with skill. Depending on how many items you find, and how quickly you find them. If you take too long, you've got no chance at the end of the game as enemies health, damage and numbers quickly outpace you and you find yourself swarmed without many tools to avoid damage. I did have some fun with this game, but after 25 hours, and unlocking most of the characters and some of the items I feel the desire to keep playing very quickly disappearing, as it feels as though my actions during the game have little to do with my success.

The game is a lot better in multiplayer, as then it can become more casual, and a decently fun romp with friends. But solo, aiming to beat the game and unlock everything feels like its up to the game as to how well you do, as long as you keep playing eventually you'll find success once the game decides to give you a decent run.

Good concept for a game, with a couple of contradictory game elements leading to a fun, but eventually hollow experience, at least in my opinion."
24921,Fun
24922,Amazing. This game has caused me to become a sleepless statistics nerd.
24923,game ver y cool and uh yeah play

24926,Good
24927,asd
24928,"This game is like everything I want Warframe to be, it's an Endless looter/shooter that starts off pretty slow, and before you know it, you've sunk in 2 hours and you're really done with your run but you decide to keep going because you just want to see just what limits you can push, how much faster you can zoom through the maps, if you can start one-shotting bosses, if you can beat your previously loop's time, if you can reach something absurd like 9999% attack speed. The plains that felt like they took forever to cross are now a cakewalk.

This game is for anyone who wants to turn their brain off while simultaneously keeping the difficulty up so that you have to pay attention, that's not to mention that you can add modifiers to your game to tailor it more to whatever difficulty you like. Personally, I enable enemy drops, choose the ability to pick your items,  double enemy spawn rates and then try to create the perfect Zenith Build/Run.

I recommend this game to anyone who wants a true Looter/shooter experience"

24957,This game slaps so hard
24958,THIS IS FREAKING DOPE PLAY IT.
24959,"I was a bit adverse to a third-person, rouge-like shooter, but the game grew on me (like the Bungus). 

First off, the game has tons of very completable achievements. If you like achievement hunting, this game is phenomenal for that, as every achievement also unlocks some bit of game content. 

Secondly, multiplayer? This game excels in that as well. It is just as easy to play alone as it is to play with your friends. Everything scales with your party, but it still feels great to play.

Third, tons of unique experiences. The distinct characters and their interactions with items and enemies provide so much variety to gameplay that I have come back to play this game for hundreds of hours, and I still want more. As of the writing of this, Hoopoo is planning on releasing an expansion. I will most certainly acquire this as it will absolutely add a multitude of quality new experiences which will be another bundle of hours from me.

I would absolutely recommend this to anyone."
24960,21 hours many mor to come
24961,"buy the game full price, and if u dont play this game anymore buy the dlc thats about to come without any reason. just buy it"
24962,One of the best games I've ever played. Tons of replayability and super fun.
24963,good
24964,"The good:
- Artistic style. This is subjective, but I think they've really pulled of a simple look as it's so clean, yet still provides enough interest.
- Challenge level. The fact that easy really trains you up well and then spanks you later on if you're foolish is great. This is influenced by drops somewhat however. Some runs you're so unlucky you can be dead by 4th boss.
- Sick guitar riffs in music \m/ Wandering around an alien landscape with prog rock solos ringing in your ears is bliss in the late hours.
- Unlockable classes to suit all playstyles

Bad:
- Not having the friends to play co-op with :( Some classes appear intended with co-op in mind, so you may never use them in a solo run.
- Replay value. Once you've completed it a few times solo, you might find yourself not wishing to sink another hour into a run on your own again.

On balance, I definitely would recommend this game."
24965,good
24966,I always end up coming back
24967,Good fun alone and with friends
24968,"Risk of Rain 2 is a gem of a game. If you are even remotely into roguelikes get this game you will not regret it. This is one of my favorite games of 2020 and 2021, maybe even 2022."

24973,"Been told to try ROR2 by many peoples, time and time again people would simply tell me ""It's just a good game"" and give me no real reason to play the game. This put me off initially.
However, bored a couple of days ago I couldn't find anything to play and decided to buy the game.
I went in with a negative mindset due to the reviews mostly being memes and ""Good game"" and nothing more, and initially I was ready to refund the game. HOWEVER, I decided to keep playing and give the game a proper chance, and my am I happy I did. 

This game ticks every single box for me personally when we're talking good game.

- Easy to get into.
- Tons of replayability.
- Co-op.
- Good filler game for when you have nothing else to do.
- Relaxing.
- Tons of modsupport.

Having played the game for a few days I can now see why many reviews are simply ""Good game, just play it"". But I will say this. 
If you are looking for a good and relaxing game to play with friends, then Risk Of Rain 2 has you and your friends covered. There is tons and tons of mods to make the game even better to top it.

TL;DR - Good game, just play it."

24988,"There is just something so satisfying about breaking this game with the insane item stack. 10/10 would play again. This game is breathtaking. 

Tip: If you wanna absolutely break this game select the Artifact of Command and the Artifact of Sacrifice. Then grind the void fields until you have all items max."
24989,"This game is absolutely incredible. You can replay it over and over and over again. You can start out with a fairly low difficulty, but if you activate the right artifacts or even just crank up the difficulty slider to Monsoon, the game becomes almost impossible. You can tune it however you'd like though, and it's super fun to play with your friends. Engi is the best for solo play though, if you can get the right items for his turrets."

Time is important early-game and you can't dilly-dally, but even so, a run can take upwards of an hour depending on how you play. There are a lot of classes to play that offer vastly different play styles (my favorite being Bandit) and you could spend hundreds of hours unlocking and playing each one. I would recommend the game."

25013,"Fun, but if only if you know what you're doing
+Difficult +Great Soundtrack -Doesn't teach you anything -Boring multiplayer if there's a skill gap

Fortunately for me I had the luxury of a friend who was willing to explain the ins and outs of the game as we played, which allowed me to find the fun in it. If I had just played by myself, I would've only spent a few hours trying to figure out what I can do, what I need to do to beat the game, what I need to do to unlock the content of the game, and then eventually get frustrated and stop playing. Sure, I could've spent time looking up guides, but it shouldn't be unreasonable to expect a game to be able to explain what the goals are and how to achieve them. There were so many times where my friend was like ""oh yeah there's no other way to get this achievement/character besides jumping off a random cliff and going through these hidden platforms to turn this dial and complete this secret level to unlock the switch that you can activate if you get to the last level"" and I'm wondering how the hell I would've figured this out on my own when the game doesn't tell me jack.

Multiplayer was fun, but it commonly created a situation where someone died early at the start of the level, and had to wait 10-20 minutes to get another chance to play. Plus, if you die early you miss out on loot, making it exponentially more like that you die early in the next level, snowballing until the game becomes impossible to play for more than a couple minutes in between periods of almost half an hour of waiting. I started having a second game open on my second monitor to play if I died early, which I dont think is ever a good thing to have happen for people playing your game. The soundtrack can alleviate some of the boredom, and during tense boss fights it can be fun to watch your friends, but there's only so much you can do to make waiting interesting."

Now, I've been on the same run ever since. I'm writing this while staring at the big lizard guy in the lunar coin shop. He won't tell me where the rain is. WHAT'S THE BIG RISK?! All I see are lizards, eyeballs, and jellyfish shooting shit at me. If I get to the end of this game without seeing rain, the blood vessels in my brain are going to rupture. I swear to God. If the ""rain"" is referring to the bullets and lasers constantly flying at me, I will implode. I'm going crazy in here. I must go now... in search of precipitation."

25048,This is the only game where I will lose a 2 hour run and then go right back into another run
25049,Truly excellent game. Fun solo and with friends!
25050,dudei  love htis
25051,absolute nice game
25052,It's alright
25053,"Grreeeaaattt game
SUPPORT MAC pls TvT"
25054,EY YO this shit slaps! Especially with friends. crazy fun builds and hours of fun... literally.
25055,Fucking Love this game!
25056,Phenomenal game
25057,Yes.
25058,"I wouldn't really call this a roguelite because it doesn't offer those hard CHOICES, that allow you to craft a vastly unique and different character build in each run.  What keeps the game feeling fresh is the different character choices you make at the starting screen.  Same choices at the starting screen, SAME RUN for the most part.  That said, it is a fun game and finding rare items to make your character OP is a blast.  Co-op mode is also fun when it works properly, which is about 50% of the time.  My tip to become OP 80% of the time is to complete ignore the difficulty timer in the corner of the screen and do a full clear of each biome."
25059,loader best character
25060,"HOLY SHIT THIS GAEM IS GOOD.
SOUNDTRACK EPIC AF.
GAMEPLAY ADDICTIVE AF.
Fair warning tho, not beginner friendly
Dont forget to install mods makes game easier to learn.
EDIT: I FUCKING HATE YOU MITHRIX"
25061,"An excellent, entertaining game, very challenging (if you want to be challenged)."
25062,"This game is insane, its like every rogue like but its 3d and it's characters are actually diverse and fun. you can play from a huntress with a homing attack to a lizard that deals heavy dps and jumps around. i would recommend for any person"
25063,Murder
25064,Good game! :)
25065,"It's no secret that I am a big fan of rougue-likes in my friend group. Yet when I finally started playing this game I enjoyed it that mutch that I bought two copies for my buds.

This game has an amazing soundtrack, good designed and unique characters that are unlocked by just playing the game. For those liking a challenge theres monsoon with its skin unlocks and for the casual enjoyers there are rainstorm and even drizzle to play and get a grasp of what a ""god run"" feels like.

This game apeals to the casuals and the tryhards and still manages to hook me in after 150 played hours."
25066,Meteors.
25067,"press q more, it'll help"
25068,Every time I come back to this game I have a great time. Feels like there are an endless amount of things to discover and special moments to be made! Can't recommend it enough.

Still good tho, feels like a rogue-like collect-athon for the achievements and skills/characters"
25076,It's fun
25077,yes
25078,Great game if you like utter chaos and getting one shot BY GODDAMN BRASS CONTRAPTIONS I SWEAR T-
25079,"This game is a triumph.  Ever since I played Hades, I've had a serious rogue-like/lite itch, and Risk of Rain 2 scratches it damn goodly.  Hopoo knows EXACTLY what they're doing.  I seriously can't think of a franchise that has made a better transition from 2D to 3D aside from maybe Mario games.  The character variety is broad and deep, and so the build variety is VAST, usually hilarious, and sometimes straight up broken.  The way that progress between runs is tied to achievements and secrets discovered in game which unlock new items, abilities, and modifiers that alter the rules of play is both charmingly retro and an innovative stroke of genius.  All of this combined with continuous developer support since launch and an active and talented mod community make this the game that just keeps on giving.  It is, without a doubt, unbalanced, but, where in most games this might come across as lazy, it is arguably one of the best parts of this gem.  The difficulty infinitely scales the longer your run lasts, challenging you to break the game before it breaks you. Every time you reach stage 5, you can choose to advance to the final boss, or loop back around to stage 1 to begin again, ratcheting up the insanity even further.  Being able to play with up to 3 friends at once has made it an infinitely amusing staple in me and friends weekend rotation when we want to play something with instead of against each other.  It is basically the only game that when somebody new to my discord says ""What is that?"" I say ""Here, I'll buy you a copy.""  I can't wait for the DLC!"
25080,"really fun and a ton of variation of items and builds, even better with friends"
25081,get it
25082,huntress booty=me likey
25083,A butt clenching game that makes you cry over and over again.
25084,yes
25085,Really good game (when modded it 2000000x better [Use R2modman])
25086,"Very Cool
10/10
Buy it now or I stab you"
25087,"I just can't get behind this game.  I've given it a fair chance and ever since early access I walk away from my runs frustrated, annoyed, and unsatisfied.  It has everything I would want from a game on a surface level:  Third person, action, roguelite, great flowing combat, and a decent soundtrack.  The issues for me, however, seem to be apparent once I play long enough and dig a bit deeper to its systems.

Here are my issues with the game:

Pretty lame powerups.  They're all mostly basic passive bonuses minus a few of the big powerups, overall they don't feel like they have much impact between them other than ""be stronger"" which feels boring.

Very little control over lame powerups.  I know there are ways to get items outside of just picking up what the game gives you, but it can be a risky strategy where you dump the powerup you wanted for one that isn't as good.

Too much running around scrambling to find lame powerups.  This is where the game gets frustrating for me, it's really hard to tell if you've missed items and where they are so you can waste a lot of time just running around helplessly looking for items only to walk away with nothing.  Add to this the maps are massive and this really becomes the main aspect of the game, which is not an aspect I'm particularly fond of.  I'd rather have solid reliable combat as the focus than running around playing map slot machine.

Fighting gets buried under a mountain of strobey effects and attack animations that make it pretty impossible to counter after a while.  Once the game picks up to the HAHAHA phase you're just mostly doing what you can to avoid damage but overall there's too many enemies and attacks to reliably avoid damage.  Most the time you're okay but every now and then the game cheap shot blasts you into the dirt.  Great, now the 50 minute run you did is over.  ""Start over"" says the game, ""no thanks"" says a burnt out me.

I was hopeful that the game would have cleaned up a lot of its messiness during its development through early access, but really it didn't.  I thought the game had potential, and I get that a lot of people like it, but this just is something I think is a pretty shallow experience in a very pretty and appealing shell."

25111,"It is so refreshing to play a game that relies heavily on earning everything instead of having pay to win mechanics. The gameplay is challenging, diverse, and rewarding. I am 70 hours in at this point and still have so much more to work toward and look forward to.

I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys a challenge, while also earning rewards based on their in game achievements."

25116,yes
25117,Yes
25118,one of the most fun games ive ever played. I discovered i like rogue likes because of this game. its so siple to understand but there is much more to it if you choose to get into it. 10/10 get this.
25119,Fantastic game! Even without mods this game has immense replay-ability. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes third person shooters with a high learning curve.
25120,bungus
25121,"Fun game. If you play, i recommend only touching the wiki or any spoilers after 10+ hours of gameplay at least. There is a real sense of satisfaction here when you find stuff that a lot of games (looking at you Bethesda) have departed from in recent years. 

One complaint though is the challenges are very poorly balanced in their difficulty. For example, it's very easy to unlock some hero's alternate abilities, while others it can be near impossible.... for example the alternate R ability for Mercenary is goddam near impossible, which sucks because it would be great to be able to enjoy the full kit of the character. 

Overall, solid game and easily worth the money."
25122,Fucking amazing
25123,how do you shoot
25124,"I can see why people prefer this over Hades, both are good but RoR2 is on another level of good"
25125,fun.
25126,"
Frenetic af, just play it, it's awesome
"
25127,good game yes
25128,"Overall, this game was really good, endless possibilities and challenges for you to complete and it feels like the game never truly gets boring. In the 5 hours I've played so far I've beaten the game on easy, unlocked a good majority of the characters, and gotten a solid number of achievements/challenges. I would recommend this game for anyone who likes to run and gun or anyone who enjoys aesthetically pleasing maps and art designs. One thing I found somewhat annoying is that there are no predetermined teleport spawn locations, so if you get a bad spawn, the level could end up taking 1-2 minutes longer than if you knew where it was.

Overall Score 9/10"
25129,Game makes my dick go wee wee

25136,poggg
25137,Just get it
25138,"Old and gold. 

The good but sad thing about this game is that so many quality mods were created, yet the developer don't have time to implement them into the game, which they should, like the multiplayer mod ShareSuite that let all players to receive same item instead of letting just one player hoarding all the items.

However, the strength lies within the framework this game provides, which allowed mod community to rise and improved the game. So, I guess I shouldn't take it for granted. 

Nevertheless, you really need to experience the game (and mod) in order to appreciate its uniqueness.

I'm still waiting for the upcoming DLC, but I think a more polished Risk of Rain 3 is what we needed."
25139,"TLDR: I bought this game Jan 1, it is Jan 18. and I have 249hrs on it. It's good.

Rogue-like game with High re-play ability. Content is unlocked from achieving things in game, not with your credit card; as games should be. 11/10, 6/5, this game is better with friends but is still insanely fun as a solo gamer.

Critics: Multiplayer pause should be a thing, or checkpoints to pick up or put the game down. Being able to save after looping would be great, just to be able to put the game down and play something else for a little bit. Notice none of these critics have to do with the game, the game is phenomenal. Just some quality of life stuff I wish we could have when gaming with friends."
25140,No words other than this game is PERFECT
25141,alright muss ill see u at the gym ?
25142,"100% the game, so that probably means I like it.

Great to play with a friend or 3, great solo, great value for your money.

ALL PRAISE THE ALMIGHTY BUNGUS! (buy the game and you'll get it)"
25143,I love dying in one hit from god knows where
25144,"This game is reallygood,the game has some very well made levels with boss fights at the end of each run witch are always my highlight of each levels. Also this game and multiplayer are a perfect combination, hop on with one of your mates and have a blast, most of the time I’m not focusing on beating the game because it’s so dam fun to play. The combat is very polished and fun and the items only expand on the amazing combat. Overall I rate the game a 9.9/10 a true successre to the first."
25145,My friends sit here and call me dogshit at this game but its not my fault its your guys fault fix your game im not bad you are make a tutorial mode or something to help people understand this horrific game please and thank you.
25146,"Really fun game with friends, but personally if you plan on playing solo or don't have any friends to play with I'd pass."
25147,It good
25148,Please help I cant stop playing this game
25149,"Risk of Rain 2 is the much-awaited sequel to Indie Dev Hopoo Games Risk of Rain. Returning with its signature Roguelite gameplay and Co-Op capability except now in 3D and more entertaining than ever.

The game has almost unlimited replayability with its multiplayer mode,  Roguelike features, expansive unlockable system, and in-game collectibles such as achievements. Risk of Rain 2 gives you plenty of reasons to keep playing.

The game also continues to get better as Hopoo games strives for excellence with major updates released in the past year and more set to come. 

Bottomline: The game is worth far more than its asking price. Pick it up and give it a try."
25150,Masterpiece of a game. Buy it!
25151,"I've been in a gaming drought for a really long time and no game has been able to peak my interest quite like this one, something about the massive simplicity this game provides is so different yet so original, I could go on and on but really you just have to try it for yourself."
25152,indeed
25153,I like roguelikes and I love well-balanced survival (endless or otherwise) games. I have zero idea of why RoR has such a high rating.
25154,"Tl;Dr Pretty good, really fun with co op and even more fun with co op and mods. Super fluid in game and tons of little things you can add to make every run drastically different than the last. Only downside is the stages are kinda stale and you may get sick of them pretty quick. If it is ever on sale pick it up if its not on sale just know you'll probably get 50-100 hours off rip.

Also the music is phenomenal it sets the mood like perfectly. 

The Real Review : 

You actually learn the game pretty quick. Like all the stages, mobs, bosses and what not. Your items are where the most time learning will be spent. In RoR2 there is a lot of items and a ton of synergies to go with those items. But for the most part you can pick up almost everything you see and be fine. Drizzle (Easy) is a nice entry difficulty to teach you fundamentals. When you jump up in difficulty the game gets exponentially harder. Just know that there becomes a time where Hard (Monsoon) is to hard and the Normal (Rainstorm, I think its called) is far to easy. and you'll kinda have to sit and learn a lot to do the harder runs but its all in good fun. The Content is at a drought currently, (Jan 2022) but a DLC is coming out so hopefully there are regular updates again. 

As for how it plays as a roguelike, I would personally say it is like 60% luck and 40% skill. This doesn't really matter on anything below Monsoon but if you want to do the Big Boy runs (Eclipse 1-8) your luck can actually screw you, and for the most part you can't comeback. Very Rarely you can recover from a horrible run but if you're reading this and you get bad runs a lot, just become the [spoiler] Heretic [/spoiler] and all your issues will probably be resolved. 

As for the characters. They are all super fun and all have a pretty different play-style than one another. Then you can also have modded characters too and those basically make monsoon drizzle mode.

Lastly, the music is really really good. Chris Christodoulou kileld this soundtrack. Every single time the last stage sends chills down my spine when the guitar riff hits. Every song is a banger but if you're not into long 80's styled guitar riffs then it may not be for you."

25166,"Its a ton of fun with friends and the soundtrack is just awesome. The early levels can get a bit repetitive, but the satisfaction of building specific items on your character adds a level of creativeness that is totally worth the buy."

25171,"Amazing game, whether you want to mess around in singleplayer or multiplayer, this game has endless content. Especially with the artifacts, this game has infinite ways to enjoy.

25173,gud
25174,"Very fun game! Especially fun with friends!

Also very mod friendly if you're into that"
25175,I have totaled roughly 24 hours on this game in the span of two days... I'm going insane
25176,"Very possible to spend 20 minutes trying to find a teleporter. I have gotten a giant headache by running through the whole map trying to find a portal hidden in the very corner of the map. Impossible to know what the item you have does before you pick it up. I understand binding of issac does this and it promotes more skillful players but it is seriously ridiculous when 30 minutes into a run you accidently pick up an item that completely breaks your playstyle.

No autosprint when most of your time is running around the whole map looking for said teleporter and you move way too slow ontop of that.

I have gotten one shoted at 70% health
I have spawned off the map in the void where you do not respawn and lost my run instantly..=

If you kill the boss very quickly you just have to sit and wait until the teleporter charges which may take more than a minute before you're allowed to move on."
25177,god gamea
25178,mmmmmmmmmmm
25179,"It's awesome. A fun ride all the way through with tons of unlockables.

Even better with friends!"
25180,"The first game is amazing, this is even better!
I must say that I was skeptical when I first saw it, since it would be hard to improve on something that was already great, specially when the first one was 2D and this is 3D. But boy, was I wrong. This game is definitely worth its price."
25181,"Best rogue like around, they just need to keep adding more
"
25182,"on my top 10 of all time, for sure"
25183,Music slaps as hard as the enemies.
25184,"It's very fun with friends... You have those, right?"

Its the same feeling I got from the Borderlands franchise and now I have 1000 hours on those games. Looking forward for all the stuff to still discover in this game and I hope my addiction grows stronger."
25198,Very Funnnnnn
25199,"Sometimes it can be pretty laggy, I suspect due to all of the particle effects from so many projectiles going off, but if you have a good computer that can handle all of the mayhem then I can easily recommend this."

25237,I played this for almost 7 hours straight
25238,"very good game, garbage community

its also a rng game where rng actually matters, you can be the most skillfull player but if you dont get enough good items you'll just get one-shot from behind because whoopies! you should've taken your eyes off the dangerous group of enemies to look behind! There are better ways to waste your time rolling a lottery ticket for 90 minutes before you're made to do everything again. 

EDIT: After playing another 113 hours i can comfirm what i said before even more since the new dlc dropped, at the time of writing the devs didn't bother to release the patch notes because they said ""too much was changed"" and now the game assumes you are playing with command on at all times."
25239,Good
25240,"Good game, I think the best part about it is the range in difficulty. You can play for hours and not notice that its been 3 hours. The more you play, the more you have to play with as you unlock new items. This gives you different builds to make and build as you go.

You have to play the game and collect the items as you play, so its easy to learn how to play. It also keeps it interesting as new items like artefacts change the and how you would play it. It also gives a layer of difficulty."
25241,"This game is seriously addicting with a great gameplay loop and fun, if not sometimes frustrating, gameplay. It has a great artstyle and good character design that you get to appreciate for about 2 stages before your characters starts looking like a sentient garage sale which I find pretty funny. My favorite thing is probably how different characters wear sunglasses which are an item in the game. Captain wears them on his hat, whereas commando literally wears them over his bubble helmet, and huntress wears them on their side because her helmet has 2 vertical lenses.

In general it's a great game that's a lot of fun to play with friends or alone. Very challenging and the achievements you earn actually feel like achievements because they unlock different items and character abilities. There are also artifacts to unlock which change game mechanics like making enemies drop items on death instead of chests, amplify damage to 500% but reduce health to 10%, make enemies only spawn as elites, or make all enemies spawn as the same type per stage.

I feel like I'm might be a little addicted to this game tbh. Hasn't even been two weeks since I got it and I've already logged 96 hours of game time."

25244,"There are very few games that I would actually rate on a critique level as a 10/10, and maybe plenty that I would rate on a personal level to me at a 10/10. What I mean is, if I had anything bad to technically say about the game, neither my personal opinion nor my critique would feel like it is necessary to rate this game any lower than a 10/10. This might quite frankly be the best roguelike title I've played to date, and has officially set the standards for all roguelike games to come after."

25257,"Amazing game, played for a while and have enjoyed unlocking characters and achievements, its a game that is easy but offers hard options, its really well designed and can really be fun for those who love going solo, i have no problem with this game and am really excited for the next update."
25258,"good game, just as good as the first - only real problem with it is the overpowered enemies that stop you from just playing and having fun forever. I don't want to run into anti-healing enemies, ever, they're not fun and seriously detract from the experience."
25259,"Obtuse challenges which you will have to look up to have any idea what to do, extremely repetitive gameplay, and the final level is very long and boring with a massive difficulty spike on the final boss. It was fun for a few hours but I'll probably never go back."
25260,"Interesting characters with unique kits that add a lot of variety to the game and plenty of interesting items, along with generally great third person shooter gameplay.

This game is a stand out in the rogue-like genre, and if you are a fan of the genre a must have."

25278,is good
25279,"It's just so good. Ridiculously charming yet clean visuals, awesome music, good sound design and functional audio cues.

Roguelike gameplay that strongly incentivizes fast play, but slow play is still satisfying and, from what I understand, viable enough depending on how far you want to go.

I love how it makes you actually care about achievements, with each achievement giving you a new item for your item pool,  a new game modifier, a new character, or character specific achievements for new loadout options (different abilities and a single unlockable skin for each character).

The items are awesome, and by far my favorite little detail in the game is how your character actually [i]wears each unique item you carry[/i]. It's so adorable.

Whether or not you have a group to play with, consider giving it a try. Come bustle with us."
25280,"this game is so good if you like rgp action this is the game for you this is a game where you chose a person and battle monsters you can also get new people by unlocking them through doing some things so pls play this game and devploers pls add new people

25332,"[b] Okay! with the Survivors of the Void out, it's time to give this game a proper review. [/b]
I don't think I can express my appreciation for this game the way it deserves it, but I will give it a shot. 

[i] ""Their Security Chests? Full of overrides and backdoors..."" [/i]

The clock has started and the stage is set. Your fate is in your hands. Why did the ship crash? What are you doing on Petrichor? All the things that do not matter right now. For now, you should survive the hoards of creatures and machines that come at you with no remorse. You're an outsider after all, an invader, a mere threat to the peace of all the creatures that The Hero saved and brought to Petrichor. Those shipments are property of UES...to hell with them, you need to survive first. You better fight back with everything you find; crowbars, bullets, heck even firecrackers. Two strange curved metal bars stand-out in the distance, almost like horns, around it full of fireflies. You touch the leaver and a signal comes from the sky and takes you with it. Are you still on the same planet? There are still boxes around, but how does it look so different? No matter, you must survive. Rinse and repeat [spoiler] until finally, you receive a message from Safe Travels. An escape pod is waiting for you at the moon. You can escape, but not before one last obstacle...[/spoiler]
[i] ""...A brief spark of hope – the survivor had some medical supplies in his shelter. If he could only make it back, he may be able to treat his leg and remove the tar…"" [/i]

Well, with my headcanon out of the way, let the actual review begin. To be honest, I found RoR2 overwhelming at first. So many things to take note of, so many mechanics and items to learn, and so little time to do so before you die. I was sure it was a bit more than luck of the draw, it had to be. After being carried to the end by a friend once or twice, I was sold on the game. I realized how much every item augmented the experienced massively, how every enemy was enjoyably annoying in its own way, and how intricately each map and track was made. I still don't get how every stage theme resonates with my heart while the sheer thought of dying is still lingering. After every run, you're always left with ""what if I did this instead?"" And if at any point your felt like you have done everything, pick one of the 16 Artifacts that overhauls the game. 

If I say this game has brought a smile to my face more than any other game I have played, it would hardly be an overstatement. 

[i] ""It looks like starseed, tanning in dirt.
It smells like hot stone, and tall grass.
It tastes like spiced fruit, sweet and hot.
It feels like solar winds, and solar chimes.
It sounds like two brothers, chasing glass frogs in the sun."" [/i]"
25333,Pretty cool. Plus it's really re-playable!
25334,good game yes yes
25335,This game is just awsome
25336,"I bought this game 4 times. 
There is mods it's good just buy it."
25337,"5 minutes will become a 6 hour run where you become a god like being searching for purpose in a meaningless world filled with monsters that fight you relentlessly on the same path as you kindred spirits in may ways. Your soul becomes an empty void where nothing can escape from it but pure joy as you stand still healing the entire map for 15k per second with 300 bungus knowing nothing will touch you and if does the 50 razor wires decimate city blocks leaving not even a ounce of living tissue. 

any way its pretty good, a lot to explore collect and kill time highly recommend it please leave a like cause i crave attention"

25393,"I 100% recommend this game. It is very fun and very strategic which makes the fun alot more, well, fun. It can be difficult at times but very great"
25394,"Amazingly great game. Highly addicting. Haven't really had any issues. I can't wait for the new dlc to come out. If you love games where you kill hordes of enemies and can even make the lobby your own with artifacts to make the game even harder or semi easier if you can unlock them all. Some people even have dedicated severs that are slightly modded that are really fun just to pick up and play. This game really has a wide range of ways to play with difficulty levels that will never leave you bored. Even playing as all survivors can switch the game play up. The severs are abundant enough you can play anytime of day with friends or without, even playing alone isn't bad. There is also plenty of goals to set to try and unlock each time you play the game."
25395,epic
25396,"Have you ever worked for a long time on a paper or project, but then something happens to it that forces you to start from the beginning all over again? 

Do you want that feeling via a video game?

You can spend like, over an hour on a single run, and still die before you reach the final boss.

10/10 Red whip my beloved"
25397,"This game is very good to play alone and is even better with friends. The base game is good on its own but when you add mods it takes a game i would spend months on to a game i would play for years. the only issue i found is that if you want every ability, item, and character you have to either get lucky or do something that could be hard to do. it is still fun to grind and get the achievements thought.  but other than that  10/10 would recommend. also for the most enjoyment try not to use the wiki."
25398,Super fun fast paced rouge-like. The game is designed in a way the relatively small number of areas continue to feel varied and unique even after dozens of runs. Every unlockable being tied to the achievements makes hunting for them feel more rewarding without being burdensome. The co-op is particularly fun if you have someone to play with. 10/10 a must play for any rouge-like fan.
25399,this game is actually a masterpiece

25402,"Where to start? This game is beyond fantastic from the music to the gameplay is so fast and fun! Speed is key with this game, but do not let that discourage you can play slow if you want too and when most games take you to the menu after you die this game takes you too the character select so you can start again. I've never had so much fun in a roguelike game so I highly recommened you play this game whether you pick it up on sale or full price its a fantastic game worth your time and patience!"

25431,"Unless you want to waste your life, do not align the primordial teleporter with the planet"
25432,"To start off, I would recommend this game to anyone if it weren't for one MAJOR issue. 

The game will spontaneously crash at random times; sometimes at the menu, sometimes 3 hours into a run. 

Graphics drivers are up to date, tried running as admin, tried running in compatibility for every windows version known to man, tried windowed mode, tried unplugging misc devices, tried verifying game files, tried resetting caches, tried running the game in a VM with nothing that could possibly cause a software conflict, and yet...

None of these fixes, alone or in any combination with one another, have had any impact on the random Unity crashes.

This issue does not affect everyone, so, if you want to roll the dice on the crashing, get the game. If the odds are in your favor, you'll love it."

25502,good game
25503,It is fun shooter and all the items are intresting
25504,"- No VOIP (for a co-op game)
- Astonishingly bad server browser (which forgets all your settings every single time) and no matchmaking (for a co-op game)
- No respawning (for a co-op game)
- No joining existing games to make up for disconnected players (for a co-op game)
- No systemic way to check if all players are ready to trigger important actions (for a co-op game)

This is just scratching the surface. The combat is decent but all other aspects of the design are horrible. I'm mystified as to why this has such high reviews on Steam. Massively regret buying it."

25506,"Since i bought this game i basically cant put it down. Of all the rogue-likes that i have played this one brings the fast pace of Hades, the shooter and item aspect of Enter the Gungeon plus the cherry on top, online multiplayer with friends. 

Now obviously this isn't the first time multiplayer has been added to a rogue-like but i think Hopoo Games really improved on the multiplayer aspect of this game. Compared to Gungeon, as far as i know its only local in person multiplayer that caps at 2 players, while Ror2 can have 4 players which can get pretty chaotic at times. Honestly all of the features they added even before booting up a run is pretty cool with artefacts which can completely change the way you play the game. 

The Survivors feel wicked to play and not clunky, the survivors feels smooth to play if that makes sense. This game also is really challenging at times, especially with the artefacts one example is a artefact that doubles enemies but halves their HP, which crate huge swarms of enemies that if your wave clear is not good can really tank your run at times. 

The items are fantastic, compared to other rogue-likes I've played the fact where there is a limited amount of unique times that can stack infinitely is hilarious and convenient at the same time where i can try and build towards a suitable build for my survivor or just run a artefact that i can choose what item to go and stack 20 of one item and just troll around. 

I'll stop here and say try it yourself, honestly its worth the 25+ dollars plus it can go on sale for roughly 17$ which is a steal in my opinion, i would pick it up soon especially with DLC coming really soon (supposed to release in the first quarter of 2022). All in all a amazing game would rate a 10/10."

So much replay ability, Many many achievements to unlock that then also unlock other playable characters and items to use ingame.
Also i love the way when you get a new item it attaches it to your character for visual effect.
I have owned this game since very early access, and enjoy playing it to chill out or to mess around with friends. 
It can be extremely funny to put it on the hard difficulty and watch a friend die in 10 seconds. xD"

25576,"This is a really incredible game.  Lots to explore, unlock, and figure out.  I've not played it on flatscreen, but with the VR mod that adds full motion controlls this game is thrilling.  You certainly have to have a strong stomach to play this game in VR.  Love playing with my buds while I do it.  Can't suggest this game enough."

25578,Its a good game
25579,"Sometimes it rains, sometimes it doesnt."
25580,"Risk of Rain 2 is what you play when you want a good time. It feels the just right of amount of challenging without being overly frustrating and yet still inviting you push yourself further to overcome the challenges it presents. 

Another selling point of this game is the achievements. Now that I've started actively hunting down achievements and trying to deliberately go after them, Risk of Rain 2 actively rewards and incentives you to go after them. By unlocking achievements you can get new abilities, potential item drops and entirely new characters. It no holds bar, punches the insidious practice of gate-keeping new content behind a paywall right in the teeth and makes you earn it. You actually feel like there's some accomplishment involved when you finally ace that level or manage to clock your firerate beyond 200%. 

I highly recommend this game and especially if you plan to play with friends."
25581,really epic
25582, i love it 10/10
25583,this game is very fun and has alot of replay ability and if you get bored of the base game you can get mods which are very fun and the modding community if very nice and there is also almost a mod always being made and the multiplayer is even more fun

25592,best as always
25593,good game
25594,great game
25595,Did somebody say BUNGUS
25596,"Id say this game is a solid 9 or 10. You start off confused and lost, not knowing the benefits and powers that each little item can give you, and the power and control you gain, to memorizing 85 or 90% of all items, the downsides to them, the upsides, and still even then, the game is hard, and challenging. Good graphics, good controls, satisfying blowing up all the enemies with one shot, etc. Overall EPIC game. 
Also the music is godly. Though, every game has its ups and downs. The perfect game, doesn't exist, and won't ever factually exist. Some of the reasons this game isn't a 10 out of 10 baller fuckin game, its a 9, it's due to the tediousness of it. You get and want the same items that are overpowered, you loop 5 times getting to stage 45, making your weapons one shot every single godamn enemy you see, infinite health, range, etc. The game has been recently updated by a far amount, though there is still a problem; item variety. There was 18 items added, and 5 new equipments, and some others added with the void dlc, and i yet have to see about 16 of the commons, and all of the oranges. I think the game has a fuck ton of items, and it isn't really the item VARIETY per say, its really the knowing whats good and whats horrible. once you are good enough to understand and execute the things you need for a god run, the game gets dull. For example, if you are wanting a god run to beat mythrix without looping once, you will need a few simple items, nothing more. here is a list of things you need to beat him in less than an hour, and quickly: sheild regenerators, teddy bears, daggers, glasses, solder syringes, focus crystals, will-o the wisps, ukulele, crowbars, and ONE brilliant behemoth. If you have all those items, a wealthy amount of them, you win, if your a mediocre player at the least. Yes, of course, without a doubt there are millions, no BILLIONS of combinations to beat the game as quick as possible and as easy as possible, but those items that are listed are easily S-tier items, and will get you dubs back to back. The picture here is, the items never change, its the same basic strat and want in a match; the OP items. BUT, like I said before, I edited this today, the day the DLC came out, and realized this game is phenomenal, and it holds a special place in my heart. Despite the powerful con to this game, it is truly legendary, extrodanary, unique, beautiful, satisfying, encouraging, funny, glorious, rewarding, and, bone chilling in the best way possible. The feeling you get while ending it all, fighting the final boss, the music, the rush, the drones shooting bullet hell towards it, you, using your strength, speed, durability, knowledge you've gained during this long hard fought journey, it is a truly fucking amazing feeling. This game, is something else. -A fan"

It's incredible it want u to progress untill it does not.
And u will love it for it. 
U can unlock loads of characters with a variety of skills and play styles. 
There are tons of secrets to unlock, and items to effectively alter all your runs to your own demand. 

After 150h I can still say I have not unlocked everything and I still want to. 

It is loads of fun to dive back into with friends and see how far u can get. I honestly had a few runs where we felt like gods and right after it died to a stupid mistake .

If anything, B U N G U S  is a selling point of this game"

25628,Great game I like how the levels get incredibly harder as you progress through the game i can spend hours playing this with me and my friends
25629,idk wtf they did but my game cant get past the title screen now without crashing
25630,"Definitely recommended for anyone that enjoys games that include semi-rogue likes, first-person shooters, a diverse cast of characters with unique abilities, and a lot of hidden material that you will not get to see through many of your playthroughs.

There are multiple characters to be unlocked and a multitude of paths to be taken when playing through ROR2. Many of these paths may take a while to find (if you're not using a guide) but definitely adds some excitement to the game and boosts replayability. Many of these paths can lead you to a dead end but some can lead you down a loop, which in my opinion, adds so much more to the game. These loops aren't just the same things you've seen over and over; they include newer, stronger enemies and bosses, secrets, and even new items to unlock but all contained in the maps you know like the back of your hand after a few hours of play.

Multiplayer is its own beast unto itself. With most common servers being up to a max of 4 players and some custom servers which I've seen up to 32 players, the ability to drop into a started game, and a custom set of game rules (items which you can obtain through one of the previously mentioned paths that alter what effects are given throughout the run).

The only cons I can think of off hand are that when playing in multiplayer, it is possible for anyone to steal items (boons) that you unlock, through chests, item stands, etc..., with your in-game currency. If an item that you've bought goes to another online player, it can get very frustrating, especially if it's not a one-time occurrence. This can cause your abilities to fall behind and not long after, basically will be unable to compete with any of the mobs that appear on the maps, which in turn will make it so you can't really afford to unlock items, or even stay alive long enough to catch up.

Some players will deliberately hold up progress in multiplayer games to either benefit themselves or to just sabotage a run. This can become increasingly frustrating when you've made it further into the game than you had hoped for. The icing on the cake for these situations are that you are unable to vote someone out of the game, if they've taken the previously mentioned actions.

Please don't let this deter you from trying the game. It is, in my opinion, one of the best FPS Rogue-likes out there that bring so much to the table."

25640,"There are very few games that allow you to potentially COMPLETELY break the game through ability scaling. You're meant to absolutely suck at this game until you figure out the rhythm and balance of how much time to spend on a stage vs. how much to farm. And then you'll be cruising through runs where killing one enemy creates an insane proc chain reaction that kills every enemy on screen except one that you didn't realize snuck up behind you and now you're dead.

25660,"thought there would be rain but there wasnt

luckily i hate rain"
25661,"Every inch packed with lore and content, every challenge rewarding, every character versatile and unique, and works very well with light or moderate modding. It's very fun to experience the random chance of a run being either very challenging and ending in failure, in a sweet spot of challenge and power, and an absolute power trip where the right combination of items on your character make it an easy win. Random chance isn't everything in your success, but it's big."
25662,A great game to play while multitasking or if you're just looking to waste time. Don't miss out on this amazing soundtrack either.
25663,Fun roguelike noice

25665,i go pew pew and swoosh swoosh. very fun
25666,"The game doesn't work whenever my HOTAS is plugged in. I can't unplug them because they are wired through my desk. The only button accepted by the game is Enter. I shouldn't have to unplug something that's always plugged in to play a game, especially when EVERY OTHER GAME lets me play no problem."

25673,"Very cool game, though difficult to play alone. Certain classes are just better than others, but that's to be expected with almost any game. It's very engaging, and extremely rewarding once you succeed. All I can really say is when you get to the final level, that's when the game is at its peak. So yeah, would recommend, a little pricey but very worth it in the end."
25674,where is the rain?

"
25701,"Though I'm a huge fan of rogue-lite/likes, I find some to be terribly boring, frustrating, or disrespectful to one's limited time. Unfortunately, RoR2 falls into this category.

Items and luck are far and away more important to progression than skill. This is made all the more tedious by the armfuls of completely worthless items in the pool. Certain items/combinations of items are all but required to not get overwhelmed and oneshot by enemies later in the run. 

I'm too old and decrepit to play with the speed required to keep the difficulty manageable, leading myself to be left behind by teammates, hitting a brick wall of difficulty, or feeling unsatisfied progressing to the next level. 

Oftentimes, dying in a party results in you dying every. single. level. as you're placed so far behind by a lack of items and levels. This, compounded by other problems with the game, lead the game, even (or possibly, especially) in coop, to be comparable to grinding my skin with a cheese grater."
25702,Played this on console for 200+ hours. PC feels even better plus modding makes that price tag a steal.
25703,very good recommend :)
25704,I died so therefore this game sucks monkey balls
25705,The combat feels perfect with the i am really bad at words just buy the fucking game you pew pew in style ok

25707,this game is really fun
25708,"I should go for my umbrella, don't want to get wet."
25709,"I've already platinum-ed the game and still have fun coming back to it.  Mods and the soon-to-be-released DLC allow for much replayability.  
10/10"
25710,"This game is freaking terrifying. I don't mean that in the ""BOO"" ""AHH"" way of things.

I mean that I look at my clock after playing for 30 minutes and realize I now have grey hair and my kids have grown and left the house. Time FLIES playing this, its freaky. It scares me."
25711,"This game will make you feel like a god, only to then one-shot kill you.

10 out of 10"
25712,"You can stack items
You can kill a boss as soon as it appears and have no idea how it died
Keep stacking an Lunar item called Gesture of the Drowned and a green item called Fuel Cell then if you see an equipment called Eccentric Vase
[b] don't pick it up [/b]"
25713,Fun
25714,"Very fun game, great atmosphere and art style"
25715,"bought it cuz it looked cool, didnt really know anything about it. it has a great soundtrack, its not super balanced but its a ton of fun once you find your style. don't feel pressured to play it the ""right"" way just play it and have fun, its one of my favorite games of the past 5 years at the time of writing, highly worth the money"
25716,game is good
25717,Fun grinding and replayability. I'm a big fan of this kind of game. GL HF on your next run!

The regular difficulty is sufficiently challenging on its own and there's plenty of variety from run to run. Only gripe might be that this game is built around item drops, but the item drops are not balanced such that multiple builds are viable on a character. Most characters benefit from the same few items, and you're generally looking to get these items each run (although you may not get them). Nevertheless, a great addition roguelike genre."

25803,"Omfg i cannot put into words how much i love this game (dont let my play time fool you, i transferred my game). From the artstyle to the gamplay and even the hidden lore.
Firstly the artsyle is amazing and you can really feel this cool ""cosmos-space-voodoo"" stuff (you need to play for yourself to understand). On top of that the lore of the game is hidden behind the item logs is very interesting and well written.
But all that aside lets talk about the juciey stuff, the reason we're all here, the gameplay. Let me be honest, im a rougelike junky , I cant get enought of them, and this is litterly the best one i ever played. (in my opinion better the Hades). the gameplay loop allows you to do almost everything and keep the run going forever to see how broken and badass you get. playing this game feel really ""fair"". if you are strong in one point and feel invinceble that is only subject to change because with the cool time machanic in this game the enemies also get stronger with you. AND OMFG DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE SOUNDTRACK. MASTERPIECE.

25874,very fun with friends
25875,"Risk of Rain 2 is a an shooter action roguelike, where runs consist of fighting through a 3d environments looking for the portal to the next world while collecting items to make yourself stronger. Like all roguelikes, it is permadeath but with meta progression where you unlock and find more things even on failed runs.

I think I just have to admit that this game is not for me. I tried picking it up several times, but I found it just too frustrating to get into. 

My core complaint is about communication: the game tells you next to nothing and expects you to figure it out yourself. This is all well and good, until the act of exploration and experimentation dooms your run. For example, you gain items throughout a run, some much better than others. You will also find many stations throughout the game where you can trade a random item for a different one. The problem is that you don't know what an item does until you pick it up and sometimes not even then (looking at you ukelele). I have on more than one occasion traded one or more items for a borderline useless item. I never know how much effort or how much I should pay for the various items I find, because I literally don't know what they are. All I know is that I need SOME of them and have to get lucky. 

Also there is a clock constantly ticking, the game getting harder as time goes on, so you don't want to take your time and figure stuff out. The various maps range in size with plenty of dead ends around. I have been unable to find the portal on many runs, wasting precious time retreading old ground. I assume I would get better at spotting it after more runs, but its just one more example of the game punishing you for not knowing how its constructed. 

Other examples of the game actively punishing you for things you had no chance of knowing is the various instakill boss moves. Great example is the Wandering Vagrant boss that has an explosion attack that goes all around it, that you either need to seek cover for or be far enough away from to tank. Now the boss uses exclusively ranged attacks that you dodge, so an undogeable super nova comes out of nowhere and kills you. I had something like this happen every other boss, where there was something critical I needed to know that I felt the game just did not tell me about.

A few learning curves that you need to retry and experience is fine, but the sheer quantity of stuff that will just end your run because you didn't know put me right off. Other games also punish you for not knowing things as a way of teaching the players, but rarely will it be this much and rarely will it kill you in a permadeath scenario. It is just too much. Worst part is, I tried several months later to give the game another shot but I had already forgotten the few things I had learned the first time around making my experience even worse. 

Bottom line, I am sure there is a great game on the other side of the learning curve. I am sure if I took the time to memorize the various items, learn the ins and outs of the bosses, and develop a sense for the layout of the maps, I could have a good time. But 6 hours in I am still not having a good time, so I don't think I'll ever make it to the other side of the curve."
25876,"very fun! 10/10 would recommend
"
25877,This game is super fun. I'm hooked. Great buy.
25878,"Risk of Rain 2 is how you waste 1-2 hours of your life grinding the hardest stage in the game and then instantly dying to some random bullshit.


Then you go ""damn, that was fun."" And do it all over again."
25879,it's electric!
25880,Can't stop playing lol
25881,Buy it. Best roguelike.
25882,I've had a great time playing this game and the mods are fantastic
25883,Absolutely
25884,very fun! even being stunted with mouse pad this has been a great experience! no clue how I'm supposed to survive monsoon mode tho....

25887,"Great game for exploring alone and having fun with friends.
+ Great music
+ Great gameplay with depth
+ A lot of shit to unlock

- Only cons is the game takes a lot of time to get a good run."
25888,fun
25889,"If you enjoy self-pain, play this game"
25890,"Great successor to RoR1 - step from 2D to 3D was done masterfully, the soundtrack is as beautiful as it was in first part and you have this same feeling of immense power when you ""click"" and start to conquer the game. 
10/10
One of best action roguelikes that you can find today"
25891,Love this game
25892,good if you have too much time... WAY TOO MUCH TIME
25893,"pain it is
but really fun it is"
25894,"No back story 
No tutorial 
No Intro to game 

I bought this game in the sale after reading all reviews on steam which are ""overwhelming"" btw and tbh i did not enjoy my few minutes. This game did not click with me by any chance.

My first boat the game showed me the main menu that had single player and multiplayer. So yeah i went multiplayer and it had server browser with symbols and shape like tags which i had no idea what they were. So i went in and people were shooting in it and in the right corner it had some objectives with shapes. So yeah i began shooting with my guy,picking up things and offering dollars to shrine??? 
Then i went into single player hoping to see a story or something that will introduce me to the game and its mechanics which it did not. I did not mind it and just started to shoot things with that annoying song in the back and defeated a big boss robot. Teleported to another world with no backstory....uninstalled and refunded!!"
25895,Glad I bought it on sale.
25896,fun

25939,"Honestly was a little worried when this first came out about the dramatic change in style but it manages to feel a lot better than the first game. 
Also having lower end hardware isn't a huge issue when enjoying this game. Until you start to get a loop of two in a 8th gen i7 and an MX 350 are plenty to run on very high graphgics"

25952,"I really liked how quickly each run becomes incomprehensible. Can't wait for a first person mode, recommend taking psychedelics before playing."
25953,Bread 👍
25954,This is the type of game that you can play a few rounds of and always come back to enjoy. You can play it with your friends or solo and both will give you a very fulfilling experience and a lot of good times.
25955,epic
25956,10/10 would get one shot again.
25957,its cool :-)
25958,its pretty fun
25959,Great run-base game.
25960,"It's fun!  You will die a lot, but it's really fun.  Many things to unlock, even more things that are rather creepy and/or scary.  Even as a fairly casual player (I usually don't play games with this much shooting in it) it is approachable on the lower levels of difficulty.  I have not won yet on 30+ runs, but have gotten close twice.  I will die more, and maybe even win some."
25961,"At this point I would be stupid not to recommend Risk of Rain 2, It's like Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Issac had a love child that is a 3D third person shooter. Risk of Rain 2 has a very addicting gameplay loop, a lot of items to find and try, and a refreshing amount of characters to unlock and play with (The old fashioned way as well, no microtransactions). Oh and the soundtrack is my new favourite in all of gaming except the nostalgic ones of course. 

Risk of Rain 2 has always been in the background as I search though sales and look through games, it is always there as I scroll. I was always passing it by without a second glance because of the cover art, it just didn't look appealing to me and the few glimpses I saw of gameplay didn't look like much. but man oh man was I making a mistake. If you are on the fence about this game just give it a try already."
25962,idgi
25963,"This game is fantastic, I love the direction it takes, the art style, the gameplay, everything. I would 1000% recommend buying it and giving it a play even if you're not usually a roguelite/roguelike player. I came in the form of a longtime PvE/Looter Shooter enjoyer and this game is one I'm not afraid to call a favorite even though it's not quite in my usual genre."

25969,there wasnt rain (still good)
25970,"you have to start the entire game over again if you die, very annoying"
25971,"This game is an amazing experience for any experienced roguelike or shooter players, as the game will cut you no slack or pamper you. You just have to overcome each randomly determined obstacle with your grit, your merit, and your problem solving."
25972,"This game is fast paced, fun and unique in its own right. The art design is beautiful, the characters are unique and the game can last for hours but still be entertaining with lots of different types of enemies and loot which offer unique power-ups which add flavor to the game so lots of replay-ability. I would definitely recommend."
25973,yes
25974,"It is quite entertaining and can really get you going, especially when you want to obliterate every wisp in existence."
25975,yess
25976,SHOOT THING AND DIE

25978,game much wow. BTW in final boss the blue pillars aren't boosts. i died 3 times to that
25979,"Good I enjoy it
"
25980,"Better than drugs.

I never took drugs but i like this game"
25981,"This ""game"" (Risk of Rain 2) sucks, I recently discovered that there is not actually any rain (the condensed moisture of the atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops) in the ""game"" (Risk of Rain 2). This is absolutely unacceptable considering they put the word ""Rain"" (the condensed moisture of the atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops) in the ""game""'s title (Risk of Rain 2). This ""game"" (Risk of Rain 2) is actively STEALING from dev teams who pour blood, sweat and tears into putting actual rain (the condensed moisture of the atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops) into their games! (like Mojang did with their hit game Minecraft!) This sort of clickbait should not be tolerated on the Steam platform!"
25982,I love how each character has unique move sets and entirely change the way you play the game. Great diversity.
25983,Risk of rain... wave after wave of goodness. What else is there to say?

25989,"Reforge Items is annoying. Lost most of my items due to not knowing what Reforge means and hence failed the last level.

At least tell people what Reforge means or double confirm. People work hard on getting their items, no reason to ""trick"" them lose their items intentionally or not."

25994,games very fun and exciting a lot of different combos that you can try your play time in a single game can be over 5 hours if you want it to in my opinion this game is underrated its very good and a decent storyline you can use different attackers you can have different items to make a combo and so much more a definitely reccomend

26035,"This game is one of my favorite games ever made. Never have I come across a game so addictive, so, consistently challenging and enjoyable, so ingeniously well put together. Every enemy, every item, every stage layout in the game has a specialized purpose that you can take advantage of. There are so many deep layers to the combat, so much so that even I who has played a great many games, can confidently say that this game has one of the most fantastic combat systems in any game in history. The soundtrack is also simply phenomenal. I don't usually mind a games' soundtrack but this game absolutely murders you with its divine music. This is a fun, interesting, endlessly playable, challenging, diverse, lovingly made masterpiece. If you are thinking of buying this but are also wondering if it would be worth the price, please get it. I know that I'm not really a source anyone knows, and this game certainly isn't for the faint of heart, but trust me. It's worth the Risk."
26036,good shit playing with friends
26037,"In all honesty, this game was not what I was expecting it to be. I was expecting a game with stages, sort of like Mario. It's more of a ""survive the waves"" type of game, but I think It's done pretty well. I will say, when I first started, I was really confused on how exactly some mechanics worked, and I still don't know how a few do, but It's still fun nonetheless, even if you play just solo. Overall solid 8/10, highly addictive, though I wonder for how much longer the game will have my interest."

26043,"Most of my playtime in [i]Risk Of Rain 2[/i] was spent with friends, on Discord voice chat. Having a strategy for which class (or player) gets which upgrades can have great results - coordinated play will give you plenty of time to enjoy the level designs, loot and spawn mechanics, and the gameplay differences between the characters. Solo play - or last-player-alive play - is a completely different experience, and feels sparse or incomplete compared to the full group multiplayer experience. Highly recommended if you'll be playing with a friend or in a group!"

ótimo jogo! como eu disse, perfeito para pessoas como eu que estão depressivas, destruídas e no final da vida, pois esse jogo faz você se sentir recompensado e com uma mistura de caos e sensação de progresso contínuo de uma forma pouco complexa sem exigir muito foco do usuário, possibilitando ao jogador muito  tempo para refletir sobre cotidinanos da vida durante a gameplay! Recomendo bastante!"

Leaving my child behind
Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind

With all this anger, guilt and sadness
Coming to haunt me forever
I can't wait for the cliff
At the end of the river

Is this revenge I am seeking
Or seeking someone to avenge me
Stuck in my own paradox
I wanna set myself free

Maybe I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
It won't be long before I'll become a puppet

It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter

Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother

I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes

Your sweet little eyes, your little smile
Is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

Justification is killing me
But killing isn't justified
What happened to my son
I'm terrified

It lingers in my mind
And the thought keeps on getting bigger
I'm sorry my sweet baby
I wish I've been there

It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter

Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So I could ponder
The sanity of your mother"

26093,"This game has the most replay-ability out of any game I have played.  Every survivor is fun to play with, with unique play styles for all of them.  The game could seem kind of boring and overwhelming at first but after a few runs, the game becomes more and more enjoyable.  You get a feel of all the items and can figure out what all of the survivors do which expands what you are able to accomplish in the game.  The DLC adds so much too, I would recommend buying that with the game. 
9/10"
26094,Fantastic casual multiplayer action.
26095,fun for all ages ;)
26096,"I was playing risk of rain 2 since that early access golem page at the main menu. Before I got it on my own account, I played on my dad's computer. This game has become nostalgic. That serotonin release when my dad texted me at school he unlocked mercenary, my heart nearing self destruction beating mithrix as artificer, and unlocking the CAPTAIN! Not liking captain very much and continuing to be a commando main, bandit being released and instead being a bandit main, with it's lore, gameplay, music and music this game is a very good game! It's one of my favourites, and I love it."
26097,this game is really fun but im garbage

26121,This is an amazing game. You should play it. You should get your ass served to you on a silver platter. And you shall relish the conquest
26122,"Risk of Rain 2 is a fantastic game. 

In comparison to Risk of Rain 1 which was set on a 2D plane, Risk 2 is 3D and continues the story of Risk 1 in a stunning indie visual way. You can clearly tell how much the devs love their creation, and all the hard work they have put into this game to make it a great experience both in single-player, and multi-player settings. 

The gameplay feels great honestly and when playing with friends and co-ordinating together on each level, it feels like you all have your individual skill set when working as a team. The game feels well balanced and frequently reminds you of the need to keep moving (via sudden and brutal death from hostiles).  

In summary, It is a charming game to play and frequently gift this game to friends. - Well worth the price!"
26123,Its super fun to mess around or try harder difficulties.
26124,It's like Risk of Rain 1 but with an extra dimension.

26148,"insanely satisfying to play, need to invest time though, well-spent product"
26149,"Easy to get into. A shooty rougelite that you can play without a lot of mental effort. It's very replayable which I think is the mark of a good roguelite.

You shoot things to get money and you spend money to open chests and get items that empower your character of choice. There's only so many chests per stage so you have to beat a boss challenge to go to new more difficult stages with more items. The game ramps up the difficulty based on how long you are alive so you need to get items quickly to keep up with the advancing difficulty.

There's multiplayer but the public servers are kinda boring, probably a blast with friends. 

When you're close to finishing the game you can unlock artifacts which are mutators that change game rules. Most artifacts make the game harder but a few can make it much easier or just broken. One artifact in particular, Command, allows one to choose the items one gets and that's very interesting but takes away from replayability so don't overuse it.

There's lots of characters and they all play differently at first but sort of become less different as you gain more items since the items begin to define your character more than your non-upgradable skills. Still, it's fun to unlock and play all the different characters."
26150,"I am not a huge fan of shooter games at all, I very rarely find shooter games fun. BUT THIS. Omg, it is so fun. My first time playing it and I played it for 8 hours straight. It was so much fun."

26169,great game to kill some time or lose a few hours in this very addicting game i highly recommend playing with a few friends.
26170,"Risk of rain 1 was a fantastic side scrolling frantic roguelike.
Risk of Rain 2 should really be called Risk of Rain 3D because it basically is Risk of Rain 1, as a over the shoulder 3D, with oodles of polish. They've managed to capture the same feeling and gameplay, but now in a more accessible 3D style.
Highly recommended"

26173,Fun to play
26174,"This game is called Risk of Rain 2. All I can say is well, this game is something, I've seen gameplay and thought to my self ""this game looks obscure and undelightful"" but oh boy was I wrong. This game is so esquisent and delightful to play. This game brings me so much fun when I'm playing. Thank you creators for creating this game."
26175,"I like to smite some Lemurs, but these flame boys are something else."
26176,"Before I played Risk of Rain 2 i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."

26190,"I've been told to buy this at least 100 times over the last 2 years.
 It took me drinking an entire bottle of vodka on New Years eve for my friends to con me into actually doing it. Thanks to that I'm down $15 for a game that's worth maybe $3. To be fair it's nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.

[b] Pros [/b]

-Semi random generated worlds make it somewhat interesting to replay.
-The graphics are bad but don't hurt to look at. Very fitting.
-There are a lot of classes I think
-it runs well

[b] Cons [/b] 
-The combat feels very bad, It's nothing more than holding down primary fire and spamming all of your ability buttons.
-Significantly overpriced.
-Ugly until you get used to it.
-3rd person ONLY.
-The whole game can be played in about an hour and the story appears to be nonsense.
-The name is nonsense, there isn't even any rain in the game.
-The soundtrack made me want to fire a shotgun into my forehead.

I'm only giving it a negative review because it does not deserve the ""overwhelmingly positive"" that it has.  I am basically neutral towards it."

Like randomness, you can spawn as a random survivor on every level and have your equipment change anytime you use it. Like to be in control? Theres options that let you choose what items you get. Wanna be a glass cannon your entire run? We got an option for that as well. With all the characters in the game you're sure to have a blast with a character that fits your dig."

I was recommended this game by a fellow friend. From the beginning i was absolutely hooked. I have never played a game like it before. The Artwork, to the in game terrains are alone worth being in this world. As a fellow COD Zombies fan i can only describe it as the time goes  on the harder it gets and i think that is another aspect im in love with."

26253,no rain.
26254,"RoR2 falls short in the amount of chaos that you could create in the original by stacking absurd amounts of items, but the shift to 3D adds more tactics and vertical thought to the combat. Cover is now actually a thing. Line of sight actually matters in a firefight. The higher ground can and will save your life. Aiming is far more than just spraying down a 2D avenue. And there's still enough explosive item stacks to ruin your framerate if you want to. 
It even comes with a dedicated girlfriend class (The engineer) for when you're tired of playing the game and would like the AI to do it for you. Always a positive."
26255,Very noice game

26274,Still dont know what half the stuff I pick up do
26275,"Every round teaches you something and is a unique experience, making the uphill climb to overcome the challenge of the game that much more rewarding when you succeed. I would recommend playing on rainstorm difficulty until beating the final boss for the first time, then locking into monsoon as the increase in difficulty really makes the experience that much more enjoyable in the long run.

i play modded so it makes it much more fun but also more chaotic later

26310,"This is like one of the best games ever made. After the first time I played it, I grew the wings of a bald eagle to fly over to my ex girlfriend's house and blow her mom's back out. After that, I aided the discovery of the covid vaccine before the government exploited it, and ever since then I've been surrounded by an endless stream of tits and champagne. 

I highly recommend playing and learning the game without assistance from guides or youtube videos or whatever new age BS that takes away from half of the reason games are fun. Anyways, this game has a sick balance of fun gameplay, a kickass soundtrack, originality, and fluid and quick micro. It's awesome."
26311,Reminds me of playing as a rat but its raining.
26312,Fun with your mom

26328,"It's not a bad game per se, but it definitely gets repetitive real fast. Runs don't really feel very different, and can easily drag on for an hour or two. I'm sure you'll get more effecient with play, but I'm already bored. The main difference in runs, is which hero you select. And unlocking new ones, is seemingly a slog, with  rng involved. I haven't played a lot, but I'm already to bored to bother with that grind. Big mistake to lock the only real variable this game has to offer, behind a grind with rng involved. In my opinion, this game is in dire need of meta progression between runs. Gameplay is simply sluggish and medicore in my opinion."

26335,"1) Start as a pleb
2) Get Loot Boxes

26336,I always come back to this game for a bit of fun when nothing else seems quite as fulfilling. From the nearest of escapes from death on some levels to just unleashes a wave of destruction on your foes when you have the right item combo.

26350,"This game is really good the combat is great and if you feel like there's not any games that you want to play but you still want to play a game this game is really good! The only problems are when you look for hours for that on teleporter and when you play for 45 minutes to get a character and you end up dying but those feelings are in all games so yeah pretty good game I would recommend this game.
edit:
 Oh and I forgot the soundtrack the soundtrack is too good I don't have any words for how good this soundtrack is just too good and I have only played for 5 hours so long and so far I love it!
Edit: After survivors of the void update now I have two words, NERF LARVA"

26369,"Why do you not have this game? It is a time vacuum in the most positive sense of the word. The ~30-50 mins it takes to complete a run feel just long enough for satisfaction and just short enough that you don't regret sinking the time.
The variety of items and the build potentials are amazing, I really do appreciate the feeling of freedom, and of power when you find *that build*. If you even have an inkling of interest in the genre, I highly recommend."

26376,this game is def one you want to play with as many ppl as you can
26377,it aight.
26378,"This game is amazing.

Easily in my top 5 video games of all time.

It's a platform 3d collectathon third person shooter with so much character and charm, it's infectious. It's an extremely difficult game, even on easy if you are new, but I have rarely felt cheated. My opinions on items and characters have changed immensely over my time playing it, and every character, map, and item gives you such a unique experience (except the chronobauble...)

This is a game where you get attached to everything. Every aspect of Risk of Rain feels personalized despite the fact that there's barely any customization for loadouts. Each character feels like they are from an entirely different genre with incredibly diverse playstyles (ex. There's a call of duty basic commando, a spellcaster with high damage and flight but lots of cooldown management like Diablo or something, A plant that heals itself and uses health as an alternate resource to manage like it's from an RTS, A grappling hooked tank like from bionic commando, and an engineer like from TF2 just to name a few of the wildly different playstyles). Characters I thought I'd love, I hated to play as, and characters I had no interest in became my favourites. This is definitely a game that requires a lot of experimentation and play time to really get the hang of, but you'll have no trouble feeling motivated to play it.

Speed and skill is the name of the game, and getting your personal and team strategies down is half the fun. I mostly play one character, and I still find tons of interesting combinations to keep me invested and creative as I play. As much as I hate to say it, you almost have no time to think or plan, but the experience of playing this game, and getting just that much better at thinking quick is a remarkable feeling.

If you are on the fence about this game, get it. You won't be disappointed."
26379,"its cool game and there is spider man aka loader!
"
26380,"play it
"
26381,"Shoot monster kaboom, very recommend"
26382,its neat
26383,"It's an extremely well produced version of the original, to the point that you have to play a lot to see the original inside it. Your first fifty or so hours are going to be really, really fun. Running around, unlocking stuff, finding new builds and new items. Cool. 

It gives you a meaningful choice how you spend your time. And the big plus for me is that there was so much variety in the stuff to unlock and see. 

But then it runs into the same problem as the original where you end up feeling the loop and you see it for the grind it is. Kiting away and dealing tons of damage, repeat. It's the kind of problem you run into where you really only have one or two metrics your leveling up effectively. Crit damage, crit chance, base damage, bleed. These are all the same stats effectively and based on who you are playing/ how, one is going to be objectively better. 

I don't think it's one of those rouge lights you can squeeze hundreds of hours out of, but the time it does work for you is going to be a blast. And the co-op function is amazing if you have friends. 

It's definitely worth playing and the devs keep supporting it. 7/10. A low 7/10."
26384,"Honestly, my kind of game. Some easy and fun to pick up shooting action with fun powerups and items.
Something quickt o pick up and put down and to enjoy with a controller and your feet up."

26397,rex is my friend
26398,excellent
26399,"Risk of Rain is one of those pieces of entertainment that people say are ""laced with cocaine"" and you only find out how true that is immediately at the start. I'd say this is a good litmus test in finding out if you have an addictive personality or not. It's probably the most fun game I've played and the only game I'm willing to put a review on."
26400,Risk of Rain 2 really peaked my interest because of how you can modify the game to be as hard or as easy as you want. if you just want to chill and not really think about what you're doing you can make it so that you can choose the items you get. If you want a real challenge just crank up the difficulty and make only elite enemies spawn. Not only is the difficulty so diverse but the characters can be customized as well after completing a few achievements. There is a playstyle for everyone.
26401,play till you forget what day kinda game.
26402,Just had an aneurysm trying to explain proc coefficients to my friend. Would recommend
26403,"This game is just a really fun game.
thats all"
26404,Why is this fun
26405,"I never played a game that intentionally DIDN'T want me to finish it. 

Contradictory game mechanics, bullshit items that either won't work with other items or screw up your run entirely, this game's generally just a waste of time. I play on harder ""difficulties"" and for what? Why? Bragging that I beat Risk of Rain 2 on Monsoon? Big fucking deal.

After I beat a hard boss I feel literally nothing, no sense of accomplishment, no sense of pride, no sense of fucking achievement. 

It only took me 7-8 hours to unlock most of the characters, so now really I have no reason to play it. I'm never even thinking about this game again."
26406,Lots of missiles. Go boom. Big damage. Lots of money and Loot. Love it.

26413,"I love this game, as some of my first experiences with a roguelike game I was hesitant at first to play it, but I love it. It was addicting with the crazy hard challenges and bosses. I learned the aspects of the game and became better. Playing it with friends was also very fun, I recommend it, except it scales up harder with more people."

26418,"this game is a great way to bond with your brother and your boyfriend, if they are both gamers, or so i have discovered"
26419,"To be completely honest, this game is so fun. As someone who really didn't like roguelikes, even Hades for that matter, this game is such a game changer. The classes you can play as differ so much from each other that it feels like such a different game, and you can even change their loadout and moves aswell making the game have atleast one class that someone will love. My personal favorite is the poison lizard thing that can shoot acid and leap causing major impact damage in a small radius. The game has many achievements which are actually used in order to unlock new items in game and even new classes. I will say that my only complaint is that sometimes, the enemy variety feels a little bland, but it really doesn't faze me much as it may someone else. I haven't played this game in multiplayer yet because I'm still trying to convince friends, but overall, this game is a blast. Def worth the price and time."
26420,"addictive and fun.

26421,"Наиграл около 50 часов, спиратив игру очень давно.
Сейчас исправил наконец грешок.
Очень люблю Risk of Rain 2."
26422,"The scaling difficulty, playability (despite there being a steep learning curve to the game), level/enemy/character designs as well as the amount of usable items and characters and their varying abilities, leaves me with one question: Why are some indie game devs so much better at making a game than most AAA developers?"
26423,"I love this game. I got it as a holiday present, and it's been nearly the only thing I've played since. If you love figuring out ways to become overpowered or ""cheese"" the game, this is the game for you. There are plenty of items, secrets, and lore that has kept me entertained for the past 2 weeks, and will definitely keep me entertained for much longer. This is easily the best gift I received this season."

26429,"This is one of the most perfect games I've ever played!
It has beautiful music, unique gameplay, dead drop amazing graphics that compliment everything the game has to offer!
Items are fun to have and it only gets better with how they stack
The characters are all unique and equally as fun (except huntress, I do not care for her)
The lore is quite deep, leaving me to research it for hours just to read all of it.
And lastly the mods while few are absolutely fun to play with!

The only downside is that there is no quit saving meaning that once you play you have to play to win or lose which I'm not the biggest fan of but mods help alleviate that a bit."
26430,Dope ass game
26431,If you are looking for a 4 player coop experience and you haven't tried this game yet you are missing out.
26432,"It's a huge upgrade from the first game. Lots of depth and fun characters to unlock. The more characters you find/unlock, the more likely it is you'll be able to find your playstyle. Definitely worth the purchase."
26433,"fun 3d roguelike with some actual progression attached to it. No p2w transactions, micro transaction skins. Guts and glory like the old days."
26434,"If you like roguelikes, this is the perfect one"
26435,"Maybe one of the best Action Roguelikes out there.
And even better with friends! 
The game has amazing modding support and a great team behind the game.

This game is honestly a must get. 100%"

26439,"Great game, follows the rouge like arcade games like Hades or Dead Cells. Pace feels slow at the start and difficulty does increase at a good pace. My main complaint is the slow movement, building speed is vital. After you learn where the teleport points are you hopefully stop wasting time looking all over the map."

What is that sound, coming from beneath?  It is an Overloading Worm, brimming with the powerful light of its lighting!  Nary before I could shudder, and utter surprise, zap I went, having stepped on the behemoth, and died promptly on the spot.  The planet claimed another soul that day, and Mithrix laughed at my misfortune.

Scott Wozniak: Hey all, Scott here! And do I ever have a beef with the National Calendar Society, months are opinions, not statements, so welcome to the month of Bluth!

[He turns a bit to the side, revealing his calendar for Bluth of 2017.]

Scott Wozniak: You see, I was always bummed there weren't a lot of holidays leading up to Christmas, December's just a month of filler with a climax at the very end. So I have effectively moved the first 23 days of Christmas into its own month, Bluth, with tons of new holidays!

[Cut to a close-up shot of the calendar, showing that its currently the 17th of Bluth, or Why is Scott Wearing That Hat? Day]

Scott Wozniak: Today just so happens to be Why is Scott Wearing That Hat? Day!

[Abruptly stops music and cuts to a shot of Scott wearing a straw hat and shrugging.]

Scott Wozniak: The only problem I have with the month of Bluth is that the last six days are reserved strictly for Empathy. So it looks like I have some time to kill before Christmas, and what better way to pass the time than to look through some mail!

26521,"Absolutely perfect sequel to a fantastic game. Incredible transition from 2D to 3D with fantastic music and artstyle while still maintaining the incredible roguelike gameplay from the first game.
As a huge fan of roguelikes, I'd have to say Risk of Rain 2 is one of my favorite rougelikes on steam as of writing this and easily one of the best coop roguelikes by far.
The devs have done a fantastic job listening to the community and supporting the game over the last 2 years and I'm eager to see how the expansions might add to the game going forward.
Additionally, the modding community is quite extensive and it's very simple to mod the game to better fit your preferences or even add additional content for more replayability.
If you like roguelikes, especially if you have friends who would play with you, this game is well worth $25 USD not including sales. Easiest recommend of my life."

Playing around with artifacts gave this game a huge boost of life for me as well, swarms+sacrifice being my favorite combo but the randomizer is a great way to have some fun at a severe challenge."

26563,"I haven't played to much Risk of Rain 2 and have only beaten the game one time.  I got the game on sale back in early November, and didn't like it at first.  I would always die at the teleporter boss, and if I didn't die there I would die on the next stage.  But then, when I figured out that items were the way to go, I got farther.  Eventually, around hour 18, I beat the game as Huntress.  I haven't really tried again since then mainly becuase runs can take anywhere from 40 to 70 minutes on the easiest mode.  This can be hard, especially because you can't save.  It can be hard to just play a run because you don't get anything, even if you end the run.  And typically I don't have the time to just sit down for an hour or more on any normal day and play Risk of Rain 2.  That is really all I have against it.  It is fun, lot's of content, and diverse characters.  I think that if I had more time to play games on a given day, I would be putting RoR higher on the list.

Here is my score I give Risk of Rain 2:

8.9 out of 10.0"
26564,v ery good gaming
26565,You either become unkillable or helplessly watch as your entire health bar ticks down from a single burning elite and there is no in-between.
26566,Amazing game with hundreds of hours of content. Near infinite scaling enemies are always one step away from a game over.
26567,forecast is cloudy with a chance of addiction
26568,"Risk of Rain returns with a diferent perspective....and that's about all. The 3rd person perspective greatly damages the gamemplay. The game retains all the mechanics from the previous title, but said mechanics were never thought for a 3rd person shooter, and they don't work.

Despite having a lot of flaws, the game is very addictive and its a good cooperative game.

The good:
+The game looks nice
+The characters have interesting skill sets
+Lots of items
+A new printer system that allows you to customize the build
+Very addictive gameplay
+Fun if played in coop

The bad:
-The variety of enemies and bosses is low enought your will feel like you are always fighting the same stuff
-The ammount of maps is also very low
-The teleporter is really hard to find in a 3rd person perspective, making runs strongly luck-based
-The dificulty escalates very abruptly. Some runs may be really easy while others are impossible, depending on random elements.
-The item system makes for a very unforgiving multiplayer
-The ammount of emenies in screen makes it nearly impossible to see what is hitting you some times
-This game is VERY heavy on CPU (particularly on the more advanced dificulties). So avoid it if you are worried about heat.`
-Very weak game to play solo"

26570,"Guys it said only a RISK of rain, not a garuntee"
26571,Insane game. Worth the money

26575,"very gooddddddd
"
26576,"Lots of items of different tiers. When you're too bored with the normal gameplay, you can start using artifacts and completely break the game. It's fun and lets you experiment, build for different playstyles. Keeps you coming back to try something new."

26598,"I absolutely HATE twitchy action games. But, I am addicted to this game. The random items you can find to change aspects of your damage/health/armor is so enticing, especially when you just want to end the stage before the game gets tougher, but you want to get even more items to add to your collection to make you a super-soldier-assissin-robot... thing.

I'm still learning a lot about the game, but take it from someone that hates twitchy-shoot 'em-up-type games: This one is actually enjoyable. And frustrating. And you'll find yourself saying ""Just one more game"" and then it's sunrise and you have to go to work."
26599,very good game
26600,Literally best game ever

26644,"Its the best game ever. This game is the best. I do not care your opinion on this game unless it's to prove this game is the best game. You cannot talk to me or make eye-contact with me unless you show me your personal best speedrun at Super Mario Odyssey Any% because Risk of Rain 2 is the best game. If you insist on denying this fact, I will call Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson from popular video game Fortnite to personally beat your ass. This game is the best. 6/10. Problem?"
26645,Literally the best game to ever touch earth's surface. I swear man it's actually godlike go play it rn. Only downside is there's no rain. Risk of Pain T-T
26646,this game is very fun and i think that you should buy it 👍
26647,cool
26648,"Running around for 30 minutes trying to find the exit with absolutely no indication of where it could generally be while bullet sponges of absolutely zero threat to you spawn infinitely only to get 100-0'd by one attack from the boss... after getting oneshot by the previous boss with no indication that either of these bosses are going to do that kind of ridiculous damage...

...Is shockingly not very fun. Just play Gunfire Reborn, it's a much faster-paced, zanier, more beginner friendly, just more FUN game. Risk of Rain 2 might not be a bad game necessarily (maybe I just didn't get to the good part), but holy hell I'm not yanking out my teeth just so I can orgasm."
26649,"It's 15 bones, baby. That's all it is. Buy it!"
26650,"Very good sequel to a fun game, even better with friends"

26663,gud game shot lots of things with friends
26664,Evolve from a peon to a god
26665,"TLDR: 8/10, Had no clue what I was missing.

This is a polished masterpiece of a game. I had no clue a 3-D rogue-like could be so good. There are diverse characters and playstyles and a myriad of items and perks to buff and build your character as you wish while synergizing them all together! Characters encourage a specific style for each of them, without making them feel too linear. Want consistency and balance? Play commando. Want mobility and speed? Play loader! Want to not have to think about hurting enemies, and instead let mechanics do it for you? Play Acrid or Engineer! There's such good viability for each character (Not saying there is no meta) that you don't ever feel worried about going in at a real disadvantage. Controls/Movement are tight and tactile, and scaling is gradual enough to let you process the change without feeling overwhelmed. There are tons of secrets in the game to explore and plenty of progression to keep you enthralled for one of my favorite roguelikes to date (but it will never defeat gungeon).

Special Note: The music is RIDICULOUS. Polyrythyms, metal power ballads, eletcronic bangers and thrashers... Its ridiculous..."
26666,Fuck you Malachite Beetle
26667,89ujhuyi8hiu
26668,it is really fun with other people and when you play with no distortions
26669,"I hate the imps, I hate the imps!!!"
26670,"Awesome game ever since early access.

"
26671,This game is great. Just want MORE CONTENT!
26672,Just don't think about it too hard and it's an easy game to blow off some steam with.
26673,This game made me fired from my job/10
26674,Got this game for Christmas and it is really fun. Only thing is there isn't too many people online for multiplayer but you there are enough that you can usually get into a lobby.
26675,h
26676,"At it's best, Risk of Rain 2 will have you engaged in hectic but satisfying swarm combat with unique playable characters, interesting abilities, buffs, and the occasional synergy.

At it's worst, the game is a sadistic slog where you simply hope that you won't get screwed over by RNG, and that you'll be given enough healing items to survive the constant unavoidable damage. If you're new to the game, there's a very good chance you will die to one of the instant-death effects right at the end.

It can be very fun, but in my experience fun has been the rare exception, not the rule. For example, I once got stuck on a level for over 20 minutes because the teleporter was clipped into the terrain and other objects. 
By the time I finally found and activated it, the boss immediately two-shot me because the difficulty had scaled up too far. I've done about a dozen runs, and almost every single time I have walked away from the game pissed off.
This game does not respect your time, and is all too eager to instantly end a run. 

Maybe pick it up when there's a good discount. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine."
26677,Its a really good game its got good game mechanics and an overall good game
26678,BEST GAME EVER
26679,"I have a friend named brayden who plays loader and just flies out of the map resulting in the vc screaming at him

9/10 pretty solid"
26680,Fun and challenging
26681,"Style: Platformer/Level based
House Party Game: No
Completable Solo: No
Completable Multiplayer: Yes

Combat Weaponry: Swords, Fist, Guns, Bows, Magic Gauntlets
Combat Type: Ranged and Melee

Deeper Detail:
Very fun game to burn some time in, several classes and play styles to choose from allowing you to mix and match your builds to your hearts desire in medium to lower difficulties.
However, on ""Monson"" difficulty (the hardest) you are going to be forced to min max specific builds in order to finish anything. In addition, if you're a completionist this is going to be a huge disappointment and the funs going to be completely sucked out of the game within a few hours."

26685,"this is a rewrite of my original. risk of rain 2 is a fast paced action roguelike, and is a time sponge, you pic it up for about 10 mins and you are instantly hooked. that art style is beautiful, the music is stellar, the games play is fast snappy and intuitive, and pretty much reinvented the wheel when it came to the repetitive gameplay loops that plague most roguelikes. the base game can get boring however, runs can slog, and some just fail outright. but throw in the dlc, and it pretty much erases those problems from existing in the first place. by adding a handfull of brand new consepts, maps, enemies, bosses and more. i hole heartedly recommend this game, as it is one of my favorite roguelike, and seems to be one of the majorities as well."
26686,"I got this after a few of my friends reccomended it to me, and 40+ hours later, I can safely say the money was well spent. This is perhaps one of the best Rogue-likes out there next to Binding of issaac and each character is both fun and rewarding to play. On top of that, GOOD GOD THE MUSIC. Stage 5's track especially is just so damn good that I'm convinced that the composer is the reincarnation of jesus himself, it's that good. All in all, get this game, you won't regret it. also pick up the 1st game if you want, it's basically this, but 2D."
26687,it is very fun even more fun with friends
26688,this game is bad it blew up my frined aj aka bromethius green
26689,"This game is absolutely amazing in every aspect. 

However, there's currently a glitch which makes it unplayable for me. I can only navigate the game using a Controller, which by the way i dont even have installed. Or by using a joystick which i by the way do not even own or have ever own. 

I can't disable this feature either. So until this bug is fixxed, i cannot recommend this game to others as its virtually unplayable unless you're a god at controller, which i am not. I wanna use Keyboard and mouse."
26690,Good times to be had!  Get in there!
26691,niutfgffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
26692,Fun and Challenging to play solo or with friends
26693,"Starts off okay, then it gets unbearably painful, but you come back for more.

no rain tho"
26694,every run is unique and challenging while still being fun which is probably my favourite part in all honesty because i have rarely ever had a run that started out bad (not including my first run) and overall always had the feeling I wasn't about to die on the spot.
26695,Great game. Perfect for solo or Multi with friends.
26696,"One of the best roguelikes I have played, although good runs can be time consuming, it is extremely enjoyable."

Talking about the game itself, the variety of characters, items, game modes, and secrets to uncover make for a very enjoyable time.  I would recommend this game at full price, and I would recommend it even more on sale.  Also, the songs are quite good, and I would recommend snagging the OST."

However... I have played Risk of Rain 2 with friends several times and have experienced unmatched lag unlike that of any other game I have played even if the host has ""good"" South African WiFi, I don't know if it has to do with me being In South Africa or not but just know if you are looking to buy to play with friends there is a possibility of lag."

I have replayed this game a dozen times, and each time I revisit the cold depths of Risk of Rain 2's oceans, I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe, and no other game can pull out of me. Experience this game in its entirety, every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it.

26755,This game is the most fun I've had in a while. It makes literal hours feel like a 15-20 minute break. Time flies. Anyway you're not gonna regret this purchase.
26756,"I have seen many of my favorite streamers played this game and I didn't give it a chance to watch them play this for 10 seconds. After so many years, I finally tried this game and all I can say is that this is one of those few games who you can call a masterpiece. One of the best, if not the best ""Roguelike"" game out there. IF you are still skeptical on trying it out, this is your sign to buy it and play it."
26757,Fun Fun FUN
26758,haha comando gun go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
26759,"I wasn't really interested in this game, but a friend got it for me so he'd have someone to play with and I loved it way more then I thought I would!
My favorite rogue-like alone and with friends!"
26760,Hard but fun. Feel like I've heard that somewhere before...
26761,buy it
26762,"Alright people hear me out on the pros:

-Very smooth gameplay
-Solo is as enjoyable as multiplayer (people with no friends and eternal loneliness, you hear this? yay!)
-Beautiful artwork
-Great variety of items/characters to make each run different
-A small but achievement based progression system
-Secrets and hidden areas
-Can offer both challenging and easy times
-Actual lore behind the game (It ain't just a random chaotic slaughter simulator game)
-And most importantly, FIRE MUSIC. You MUST buy the game's soundtrack aswell cause otherwise it's straight up DISRESPECT towards the artist. (kidding but seriously the music [b][i]is electric [/i][/b]if you liked it support my man Chris the artist)


And now, time for cons:

THERE AIN'T NO CONS


And finally, a note:

-I have around 35 hours in this game as of right now writing this, and I'm at 60% completion. Keep this in mind as a sample in terms of content if you worry about it too much. (I'm not a sloppy gamer so these 35 hours are legit purposeful playtime)"
26763,Imagine playing a multiplayer game with friends
26764,It's just great
26765,This game is literally guy kills guy that's it
26766,fun

26768,"The Archer Lady is T H I C C.
PLUS SIDE:
- Game has an amazing replay value.
- Multiple characters to fit everyones play style
- Challenge scales perfectly (Get Greedy, get CLAPPED.)
SUPER PLUS SIDE:
- Your character wears every item you pick up. EVERY ITEM.

UN-PLUS SIDE:
- No Rain at all, unless its from you crying cause you got smack diddly-bopped by a GrandFather or them Giant Green Wisps.
- Should be able to drop items in Multiplayer :D (Trading items or something would be awesome.)

Can't wait to see what else they bring to the game. :D"
26769,yes
26770,"Awesome game with very polished play mechanics, the Huntress is near perfection with play style and initial load out, with the right artifacts and upgrades you can have a very agile character who can get out of any situation, from that point forward you will be ground down till you fail, brutal end game but lots of fun and very engaging."

26843,"Only ever really heard good things about the game for the longest time and now that I've played it I can see why.

Upon really getting to grips with the games basic systems, that baseline understanding blows the game wide open and everything becomes that much more enjoyable. 

Each character [that I've played] feels wholly distinct while still fitting well within the games scaling and itemization. You can immediately tell which characters suit which play style with the informative descriptions before dropping in. The challenges for each are nicely themed and range in varying difficulties and with the ones I've done they are well worth doing.

The game's itemization and scaling feel good on the whole, you can certainly make do without any big pulls for a good while before you start to feel lacking though sometimes you can fall prey to some bad rng but you wouldn't be playing the game if you didn't want that risk. Items are simple in nature and very effective, anything you don't want to hold on to can be exchanged later (with a bit of luck) and the distribution between the item tiers seems very fair.

The enemies/bosses and their elite variants provide an engaging challenge and a good bit of variety throughout and the final boss is fittingly unlike everything else before it. It's usually pretty simple to figure out what's done you in and thus easier to know what to improve upon last time.

Levels are generally nice to look at and throw their own sets of challenges at the players alongside some tricky areas to get to as well. The game does a good job of letting players identify where the next objective is (or isn't).

The game's art style proves itself immediately recognizable and easy on the eyes. The game is very lightweight and runs well as a result, very handy for when things start to get crazy and you need everything to go smoothly. Visual and audio cues are plenty and very easy to read to know what's happening and serve as an essential part of the whole 'not dying' thing.  

On the whole, a very complete package for fans of the roguelike genre. Plenty of room for player growth with each character. Several engaging challenges and secrets to discover. Special modifiers to be optionally applied to every run. A killer soundtrack and pretty a game. And that's not to mention the extensive modding community either.



"
26844,"The game is designed to be a time waster. Frankly, none of the enemies except the bosses are difficult at all, and depending on the character you play they are either target practice or bullet sponges. The entire game seems to be designed to artificially inflate game time, with long intervals between enemy spawns and sometimes difficult to find teleporters with mostly meaningless interactions."
26845,Items go BRRRRRRR
26846,god tier
26847,Just the right amount of frustrating and satisfying.
26848,"This game is fun alone or with friends, unmodded or new vegas level modded, it can be made super easy or super hard, you can have so much fun it crashes your game. This game is perfect in every way, the game's graphical style fits it so well and the rogue like dungeon style is amazing with the character with each level being chock full of new enemies to see and new shit to die to and I honestly love this game to bits and will continue to support it until I can not longer do so because with this game the developers encourage you to fuck around and do things that they would never expect hell they purposely don't do certain things to the game for people to fuck around with and do stuff like speed runs, so I will say all in all that this game is fantastically crafted and I recommend buying it at full price or on discount it doesn't matter because the game is so fun and great to play with some buddies or alone."

26878,"Awesome game, totally underpriced for what it has to offer!"
26879,It's really hard to play starting out and you'll die a bunch. I reccommend playing mulitplayer with someone who knows the game for a bit until you gain some confidence at the game and can know the items better.
26880,I LOVE THIS GAME. its great  but i feel that drizzle is to easy and is making newer players not get good at the game and then they go to servers to get carryd for a dumb alt skin i would know i did it
26881,10/10
26882,I lost the game becuses my dog ate it
26883,is good
26884,"Risk of rain is a fun time if you're into this genre of game. The characters are all very unique and fun to play, the items all do some interesting things, and the levels are all gorgeous with lots of variety and flavor. However if you have any kind of bad luck run for your life! On monsoon your success is 70% dictated by the random item drops on every level, and as satisfying as it is when you do get good rng, if you don't you won't get anywhere. If this game had less luck and more skill this would be an easy 10/10 but overall I have to give it an 8/10."
26885,"This is one of the most fun and chaotic experiences i've had. 

This game has over 100 items you can combine, over 10 characters, dozens and dozens of enemy types, it even has lore for those who care about that. It keeps you entertained byyou  constantly unlocking new items, equipments and character abilities through challenges and just progressing the game. 
You can make insanely busted builds and stomp every enemy in your path, loop through the levels multiple times to rack up an arsenal to face the final boss or you can just hunt for unlocks. It's amazing. Ah, yeah, not to mention the soundtrack which is really good. Shoutout to The Rain Formerly Known As Purple in particular."
26886,Very fun! Lots to do!
26887,very cool game
26888,video gaming
26889,"This game is a rollercoaster of emotions. One day I'm having an absolute blast, getting achievements, unlocking characters and items, progressing very far... and then the next all that progress is completely lost due to a corrupted file. I've no idea how the game got corrupted or why, but it happens out of nowhere. If you're okay with being brought back to square fucking one, then go ahead and give this a go... but you've been warned. If not, then just play Hades instead."
26890,This game is very fun once you start to unlock the other characters because after that it's mostly just finding which character you like most and learning the best and funnest ways to beat the game.
26891,Very fun game alone or with friends and it has a wicked soundtrack well worth the money
26892,"An excellent roguelike with just enough variety to feel accessible without ever getting stale.

Characters are excellent - they each play in completely different way with high skill ceilings and tricky challenges to progress their skillsets.

Items are wacky, fun, and still good - no item is truly useless and there is a good balance of simple status effects and buffs with gameplay-shifting build-breakers.

Level design is very well thought out - some play to certain characters strengths, while others may dramatically hurt your run depending on your items and character. They feel familiar, overwhelming, challenging, and complimentary to the flow of gameplay all at once.

The story is barebones, but it does well enough to serve why we're here and what's going on. At the end of the day, it helps define a great, minimalistic art style that is informative, distinct, and charming all in one.

Enemy design is great - it never over-complicates itself like many 3D roguelikes do, but instead streamlines your expectations with similar status effects to those you can apply, creating familiarity without forgetting challenge."

26910,"SO GOOD, MORE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABT THIS GAME"
26911,"I have to ask - did the musician for this game get laid continuously in high school? Because the jams are smooth as butter. The soundtrack alone makes this game worth it. I'm pretty sure I got pregnant just listening to it, and I'm an old man.

The game itself is a great blend of character-based third person shooting action and roguelike. I'm sure there's tons of other reviews saying the same thing. The different characters are very unique in playstyle and (for the most part) are cool to find for unlocking, and all of the new items from playing and dying in spectacular ways means every new run has something new to do.

So, yeah. Late to the party, but a solid ""yes"" from me."
26912,amazing soundtrack and heated gameplay
26913,"Many things to kill, many characters and build combinations to try. Very good game!"

26918,"This game not only bring a wonderful mix of gameplay, art and music, but a world I find myself constantly getting lost in, and being filled with lots of different emotion on losing a run, getting a godrun or trying out new tech, survivors and abilities, there is just so much to do with what feels like the 'same' yes, you are always fighting bosses, buying things and repeating, but the spice is *how* you approach that.

I personally, love needing to adapt to a situation rather than create one. being given a high quality item i base the rest of my decisions around is what i love, and working around the difficulties of a characters (such as, a melee character) and using this disadvantage.

So cool. love this game, I seriously cannot wait for the coming updates x o xo"

27034,3/5
27035,"Risk of Rain 2 is a very well made game that is a ton of fun to play, especially with friends. I will tell you what you are getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game. Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelike game where you progress through stages via teleporters and level up, gain items, and fight stronger and more unique enemies as you go with a starting character (there are 11) you chose in the lobby. Every teleporter there is a boss that will be REQUIRED to kill before entering to the next stage. Once you reach stage 5, you can choose to loop (go back to the first stage and continue but the enemies as well as you keep items/levels) or fight a final boss after defeating some pillars. You can also add artifacts in the lobby to spice up the experience.

Upsides of RoR2
- Very fun leveling up faster than the enemies and feeling a sense of progress
- A lot of ways to customize your experience (artifacts, 11 different characters, even mods, etc)
- Very fun with friends
- Plenty of secrets and lore added into the game
- Bungus

Downsides of RoR2
- Kinda annoying if you die to a lagspike in a god run that took several hours
- Without friends if you have already beat the game several times, it loses replayibility value

That is my summary of RoR2. Of course thats not all, theres still plenty to see for yourself. I would rate this game a 9.5/10. I have 108 hours and it still is a lot of fun. That is all, have a great day!"

Trying to get all my VR friends to buy it so we can play some ROR2 together now too."

27050,Still waiting for it to start raining.
27051,"Replayable with each attempt being different with the chance of items you get as well as the different characters you can unlock, increasing the difficulty really proves to be a challenge, and the artifacts make it all the much more challenging. Exploring the stages can also prove rewarding with each stage having its secrets further unlocking new items and getting achievements. Lots of fun :)"

27079,"Otherwise the game is mostly good, but you can't save during a run and while it's not uncommon in roguelites that the last boss is a bit irritating, in RoR2 the last level is absolutely obnoxious."
27080,"pog game, sucks when it crashed but eh can only blame my crappy tower"
27081,"[h1] Genuinely blown away by this experience so far [/h1]

It's extremely rare these days that you stumble across a game that really gets a grip on you, that kind of grip where you refuse to put it down and it remains in the back of your mind. This game hooked me very quickly with the chaotic gameplay coupled nicely with roguelike elements that gives it extra replayability. 

Main pros:

- This game isn't afraid of you becoming ridiculously powerful to the point of godlike abilities, and that's as fun as it sounds
- Brilliantly intense combat that goes from 0-100 within a second
- Multiple different characters (many of which you can unlock after completing certain objectives) that each have a fun and unique place
- Expansive maps that (for the most part) look great and apparently hide secrets
- Time-pressure mechanic (which I didn't originally think I'd be fond of) actually works really well
- Almost every time I die, it's because of a clear mistake I made or something I need to learn from, which lessens tilt and creates a more enjoyable experience overall
- The devs appear to be transparent and communicative with the community

Main cons:

- Potentially controversial opinion, but artifacts kind of ruin the game for me to some degree. Having the option available to switch up your game is great, but providing no downside for doing so (or alternatively, an obvious benefit to playing vanilla) means there is no good reason not to pick up strong artifacts that feel like cheat codes. Yes, you could just say ""dont use them"" but I'm in the camp that would rather not have this option in the first place,or have a significant reason not to use them, rather than rely on self restraint.
- Dramatically fluctuating FPS can be a bit jarring at points
- This may be personal preference, but imo the colours are a little washed out
- Enemy variety is on the lower side (why are those rock monsters and lesser wisps everywhere?)
- (Minor final boss spoiler) [spoiler] The final level + boss kinda sucks imo. It's either a cakewalk or you're underpowered and gameplay slows to a crawl [/spoiler]

This game has been a joy so far and I'm glad I stumbled upon it :)"

27158,"good game
"
27159,Pretty cool I think
27160,"I first played this game with no familiarity or context about what I was getting into, and after 47.6 hours as of this review, I believe this is the best way to enjoy the game. Do NOT, if you haven't already, spoil yourself for what this game is and what lies within it. It is a magical experience that must be enjoyed by yourself or with friends with a blind eye. Anyways, I digress.

[b] The Basics [/b]

   The game starts you with just two unique survivors and dumps you into an unrelenting world of challenge, filled with aliens, loot, secrets, and many, many, run killers. This game is by far the most unique yet challenging roguelike I have ever touched, while also being one of the easiest to learn. Just as a roguelike should be, you start each game with nothing but the survivor you have chosen. You will go around killing enemies and collecting loot, making yourself more powerful, to make it to the next stage and to continue battling the increasing challenge of enemies. You can play by yourself or tag along with friends. Your goal for each run might not be the same, as you may want to go for a boss, particular stage, certain character or ability unlock, or build to end it on. No run-through of the game will ever feel the same because of the dynamic enemies that you will be finding and fighting, the different varieties of loot drops you may come across, and of course, the challenges that await being discovered.

 [b] The Challenge [/b]
   
    This game will kick your fucking teeth in. It's so hard and sometimes demoralizing to think you're doing so well in your skills as a survivor and luck in your loot drops to then be instantly killed by a tough enemy you may have never even seen before. Yet, you start another run. That's something this game forces on you somewhat early on, learning from your mistakes. Don't take any run for granted, it could turn sour in a heartbeat. That's why, when you do have that one ""god-run,"" it feels so satisfying to achieve and to wanna pursue again in another run-through. Skill and luck do play a factor in achieving such a run; however, for those who are not to fond of the RNG, Scrappers and 3D-Printers exist within stages to help mitigate the risks that come with luck based RNG. These two mechanics, to me anyways, are so important to successful runs that beginner players will come to realize, giving a lot of depth to the game. Speaking of...

[b] The Depth [/b]

    The Scrappers and 3D-Printers give players the option to get rid of loot they don't want in exchange for a guaranteed drop of your choice; essentially, allowing for players to have choice in the builds they want to make for their survivor within a particular run. Because the contents of these printers will never be the same, the choices in a custom build will never be the same every run. There are both silly funny and stupid busted builds that players will come to realize are possible with their survivors when experimenting with these two mechanics, once more increasing the replay value because of what can be possible. 

    I previously mentioned the secrets that this game has; many of them are purposefully withheld from players to further increase the surprise and reward factor when they are eventually discovered. These secrets can range from new item drops, surprise character unlocks, stage easter eggs, new enemies/bosses, new secret stages/realms, and even new gameplay mechanics. Some of these secrets you may come across super early and some far later into your playtime than you'd realize. It ranges for each player. For example, it took me and a friend 23 hours into the game to come across the visually horrifying and equally as powerful [spoiler] Grandparent [/spoiler] enemy and about 40 hours to discover the [spoiler] A Moment, Whole [/spoiler] hidden realm that allowed us to fight a new boss we had never seen before. Most of these secrets are not just for show and tell either, as some may have a huge impact on your future runs once discovered. For example, after the discovery of the [spoiler] Void Fields [/spoiler] hidden realm, I never miss a chance to stop by there to try my chances at better early-game loot for a run. And on Siren's Call, my party [spoiler] always destroys all of the bird eggs to spawn the secret Alloy Worship boss fight [/spoiler] to guarantee our chances at an extra Red Legendary loot drop. With the hours that I have, you'd be surprised to hear that there are still at least two enemies I have yet to encounter. There are plenty more secrets not mentioned above that leave players to discover and utilize them on their own. I highly encourage discovering them yourself and not through other means, as the natural progression of the game will allow you to discover everything in a satisfying and rewarding manner. The game's natural progression and depth will keep you coming back and playing for far longer than you'd imagine. 

    In terms of natural progression, their are also unlockable characters and items you will be earning as you play. In the beginning, you'll really just be playing to play and will occasionally unlock something. But once you explore the game more, you'll start to figure out how to unlock certain things you want to earn and will shoot for runs that fulfill the requirements in unlocking it. Each character plays differently and feels unique to the rest of the cast, breathing new life into a run once you begin mastering them. 

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]

    This review is getting long so I'm going to wrap it up here. The final two things I would like to mention is the soundtrack and the mod support. The soundtrack is a BANGER, and shouldn't go as hard as it does. Just get to Stage 5 or search up ""The Rain Formerly Known As Purple,"" on Youtube or Spotify to hear what I mean, the guitar solo is orgasmic. And the mod support adds infinite replayability to this already replayable game. My friends and I play with the ROR1 Survivors, ROR1 Classic Items, ROR2 Unused Enemies, and Starstorm 2 mod to retain much of the original first game while also making the second game feel different from vanilla but still ROR2. 

    I'm sure I forgot something I love about this game to mention, but I'm sure you can hear it from another person's positive review. Hell this game is full of them. It's worth more money than it already is. I never write reviews, but this game is a masterpiece. I haven't enjoyed a video game this much in years. You can tell that so much love was put into it and everyone in the community should thank the devs for continuing to support it. I am going to continue increasing my hours in the hopes of another god run.

27174,"I'll do some pros and cons. 

Pros:
Interesting map layout and design.
Really good gunplay.
Interesting enemies and bosses.
Its difficulty levels are good and accurate.
It's fun to progress and go through teleporters.
Good controls.
Cool powerups and abilities.
Good selection of characters.
If you fall off of the map you don't die.
Very easy to learn.
(One thing I personally think is cool, as the levels go on, the difficulty scale goes up, the thing I like about it is
the contents of the difficulties, the last 3 are, ""I see you"", ""I'm coming for you"" and and endless series of 'HAHAHA').

CONS:
If you quit the game, it ends your run.
If you open a chest that swaps out one of your powerups for another, you don't get to choose which powerup it takes, and you can't get it back (it doesn't even tell you that you can't choose).

All in all, I give it a 9/10.

Fun fact: while I was thinking of cons, I realized even more pros.

27255,"I now hate lizards, fire, and anything to do with clay"
27256,"One of my favourite games to play with friends. All the hours of intense fun have been more than repaid the small pricetag of this game. It's an experience I wholeheartedly reccomend playing.

The mechanics and the progression create for an intense and hard gameplay, yet extremely rewarding and satisfying. Risk of Rain 2 hardly becomes boring thanks to the number of playable characters, loadouts and artifacts that help keep each run interesting and different."
27257,"Incredible game for anyone that likes fps games, there's literally something for everyone in this game."
27258,"you get to feel completely overpowered and break the game into a million pieces
somehow it remains pretty well balanced, play it with friends"
27259,"shoot is fun :)
"
27260,"Game good.
One bullet deletes all mobs in map, pc crashes due to too much particle effects.
Would crash pc again 10/10"
27261,"As someone who isn't a huge fan of rogue likes Risk of Rain is perfect for me.
There's lots of variety, unlocks are common and it's not hard to finish a run in some form.
Meaning you constantly feel like you're making progress.

On top of that the characters are really fun to play and the game has great game feel as a result.
The massive variety in play styles stops you getting bored to quick as you can just try something else out.

My one complaint is that runs tend to play out quite similar.
You'll use your combat abilities until you've picked up a huge amount of passive damage and healing then you'll keep killing til you can't no more.
Sometimes it's harder, sometimes it's easier depending on RNG.
But you won't really have big pick ups that change your run massively like some other roguelikes.
Since most of the damage buffs are entirely passive and usually apply to all of your abilities you'll probably play your max level character the same as the first level, you'll just move a bit faster and have shorter cooldowns.
"
27262,very good

27269,good
27270,"Risk of Rain 2 is a masterfully crafted, well made gaming experience that's right up the alley of any rouge-like fan or anyone who's looking for a good challenge.

The scenery goes absolutely perfect with it's polygon aesthetic. The soundtrack is an absolute banger and goes very well with your gameplay as you traverse flaming deserts to illusive void fields. The art direction always beats a game's graphics in terms of what ages better in my opinion, and I think that this will be a prime example when someone looks back at it some years later.

Choose your own playstyle with a handful of unique characters, each with their own unique weapons and utilities. Fight off hordes of creatures ranging from fireball lizards to phasing shadow demons. Loot from a selection of useful (some useless) tools and upgrades to help to fight your way to the finish line. Play how you want, but if you've come looking for victory, play fast! Difficulty rises the longer you aren't aren't progressing, rising from ""This Is Difficult, But Fun!"" to ""Dear God Why Did I Buy This $22 Piece Of Steaming Hot Trash In The First Place."" I can see how the difficulty can shoo some players off. I understand that some people are looking for a casual game to play and I totally understand, but if you like a good challenge and something that needs some speed, try this, you might like it! 
And if this game scared you off in the past, I suggest that you try it again if you're not sure, you might like it this time!
"
27271,fun!
27272,Risk of rain is a good 3rd person shooting game with rougelike elements. It is super dope and I would recommend.
27273,"great game to play really enjoyed it and even better with friends
"
27274,"good game
very hard but fun to play with friends
"
27275,this game is good and everyone should play it
27276,Risk of Addiction 2.
27277,"I really love Risk of Rain 2 and despite never playing the first one I enjoy coming back at random and still playing it months later after completionist, Its fun for a 5 minutes blitz or for a 80 minute super game. Reminds me of the scaling on Bloons games and offers a lot of room for better success rates through upgrades abilities and A ton of different characters."
27278,its a great experince and I've had countless hours of fun with friends
27279,shoot things grab things shoot things
27280,A lot of risk but no rain :(
27281,it's AWESOME the best game i ever played
27282,"fun and fast pace
"
27283,"Bigger, better and harder than the first one. Soundtrack is still very nice, a bit more intense this time around. One of the smoothest transitions from a 2D game into a 3D sequel. You'll prolly die a lot and love every second of it."
27284,"Hopoo has cracked the code on time travel!  

1. Buy Risk of Rain 2
2. Assemble 1-3 friends
3.  Open Risk of Rain 2

That's it...it's just that easy.  You'll immediately time travel to 12 hours in the future with no recollection of the time that has past!  What a time to be alive!

Side note - minus .1 on the score for failing to meet rain expectations.  Otherwise, flawless game!"
27285,The very very very very best game execpt for maybe The Binding of isaac

"
27291,There was Rain
27292,yes
27293,"awesome
"
27294,"Fantastic game with a lot of options, the artifacts allow you to basically make your own version of the game within itself, I like to use command, swarms and sacrifice to just steamroll, but there are SO many combinations that would let you craft your own experience. I enjoy it best with friends.

Upadte at 147 hours and true 100% completion, just before the DLC comes out. I would highly reccomend playing swarms, sacrifice, spite, and chaos; very fun VERY scary. The game continues to impress me with its replayability, and, having just done 4.4 quadrillion damage over the course of a command run on mercenary while unlockable hunting, I must say it truly makes you feel like a god sometimes. This does come with the caveat of (at least in my case) making mercenary 99.9% of your damage done of all time, but hey, Big number go brr"
27295,
27296,hehe Brass Contraption go bonk
27297,"This game is very fun, and even better with friends, the idea for the items to be unlocked as you play more in awesome, because it keeps you coming back to the game with new items, aswell as after each run you almost always unlocked something, a monster log or item."
27298,i like the lizard
27299,very fun with incredible replay value

27303,"honestly this game is fun but it just isn't for me. i feel like the enemies are just spammed and dont get me wrong i love the chaos sometimes but sometimes i just dont.

EDIT: i spoke to soon, this game is good"
27304,"Risk of Rain 2 is great successor to the first game. I would not say it is better, just different being that players are in a 3D environment as opposed to a 2D one. I will say I play Risk of Rain 2 more than Risk of Rain."
27305,this game good
27306,Such a great experience. I loved everything and to me Hopoo Studios got every single attention to detail RIGHT. I love this game from the top to the bottom of my heart and I only wish the best for this game to thrive even more in the DLCs to come.
27307,"If you buy this game on sale, buy it for a friend. The developers deserve the money for this kickass game. Best $15 I've ever spent"

27388," Imagine the biggest waste of time now imagine that wasted time being fun this is the game in a nutshell, overall a dog water game, but a good dog water game."
27389,fun with friends and fun without friends and you can play for hours and have fun
27390,Tons of fun and addicting.
27391,"I've come to the realization that the rain implied in the title doesn't translate to in-game rain, but more of a metaphor, something like, in your point of view, a really enjoyable and nice run, good items and overall performance in battle, and then, a big fire lizard dude slaps you in the back of the head and the next thing you see is your character's rag doll flying all over the map while your health bar is in negative.

There, right there, that's the moment the so mentioned ""rain"" comes into play, it wasn't referring to some meteorological phenomenon at all, it was talking about you, more specific, your feelings, it's not the sky that is raining, your eyes are, tears of pure disappointment and anger, yet . . . I want to start a new run, how strange. . . maybe i'm a masochist."

27400,"just all around a good game, would recommend"
27401,"You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the sole survivor of a planet-wide cataclysm caused by your own actions destabilizing the fragile balance of forces that kept the shattered terrain from collapsing under its own gravity (the villain)"
27402,I can't stop playing this game. Someone please help... or join me.
27403,Only a couple hours in but very fun especially with your friends. The item system and combat movement is really smooth. Hope the replay value is good but this is a really fun high paced game!
27404,yes
27405,"You managed to create the perfect combination of items. 
Once you kill one enemy and you set off a rube goldberg chain of debuffs, that makes bodies explode, slows enemies and burns them to ash, feeding a growing snowstorm that freezes and damages your foes, leeching health for every tick of damage, giving you a shield that stacks with every kill, making your graphics card beg for mercy. Enemies and bosses alike melt in front of you. You're invincible, you're going to beat the game. Who's going to stop you? You have the power of god and anime on your side!

Out of nowhere you hear a guitar. Almost inaudible at first, it plays a few notes, barely a melody. Your brain refuses to recognise the pattern.

The guitar repeats the notes.

A cold shiver creeps up your spine. Everything is going perfectly, your health and shield bar is full, your 17 health drones swarm around you like cleaner fish a great white, you see enemies get atomised in cinematic 12 fps and yet.... 
something is off.

Suddenly, the guitar plays a quick melody, not very loud, but it hits you like a freight train. 
Something from behind attacks you, dealing 4 trillion damage instantly. 

Before you can even make sense of what happened, the screen tints yellow and freezes.

27408,A lot of fun. No 2 runs are the same and a whole lot of fun with friends
27409,been playing the first one for years and when the devs announced this game i was so excited about it!!!!!!!!! and when i played 30mins or so i just fell in love with this game!!
27410,boom
27411,so good
27412,This game is absolutely fantastic. 11/10 would recommend for hours and hours of fun. Love that the more you play the more you are able to customize your game to be really challenging or just be able to have a fun meme run.
27413,This game can be hard at times but if you keep trying and do not give up you can really like the game.

27421,gud game
27422,"Don't be fooled by the first 1-3 hours of gameplay, the game ramps up quick and before you know it you're knee-deep into the grind. If you love Path of Exile and Borderlands / looter shooters, this is for you."
27423,"I have over 150 hours on this game and it never stops being so fun
Unlocking items, characters, etc is a lot of fun
The soundtrack is insane
The art style's cute
The game's frame rate will struggle if you get far in a run but that can be helped by the ability to make the game look super minimalist
Highly recommend playing this game, especially with friends, but you may want to get it when it's on sale."
27424,One of the best rogue-like games that i have seen. The gameplay is lovely and the amount of items paired with the amount of enemies gives it a long lifespan. Amount of characters are lovely but i would really like if there were more characters and characters like bandit who needs specific actions for extra bit of gain like bleed and guaranteed crit from enemies' backs. Overall is just a delight to play and anybody who enjoys a fine rogue-like should definitly give it a go. I am not even gonna start on music cuz that shit is god damn beatifull from start to end.
27425,the shrine of chance is a scam
27426,"i love this game so much. i don't need anything but this game. i lost my house, my wife left me, i lost custody of the kids, but it's all ok cause i have this game!"

27499,"I recently hit the 1k hours mark. That's time played not sitting idle. So i've played about 1,000 matches. Typically one match can last around an hour, sometimes half an hour, and i've had both games reaching stage 40+ for over 5 hours and i've stayed on the first stage for 4hrs (with sacrifice). 

I've had all achievements since 2019 and i still play the game almost everyday. This game is bloody addictive. The culmination of a fresh start, with vanilla or various artifacts, possibly mods, new people to play with, game get's more players every sale, and an expansion is set to come out in 2022.

I STRONGLY recommend this game to anyone and everyone. HOWEVER, be warned, the community for this game can get very toxic. I try to steer clear of the forums as there are a few trolls and negative people on there.

That being said, i have enjoyed at least 80% of my time in this game, because you have to rely on the RNG gods for their favor in the items and rarity your going to receive and the types of monsters that may spawn up your arse as soon as you begin looting something.

Pros : 
Amazing gameplay
Decent graphics
Cool soundtrack
Odd storyline
12 unique survivors and counting
All survivors have multiple playstyles
Many different monsters & variants
Hundreds of items that can stack
Endless hours of non-repetitive gameplay
16 game modifiers to change the experience
3 additional game modes
Special ingame earnable currency for benefit/detriment items
So many fun things to do with this game i wont spoil them all here

Cons:

Sometimes players steal your items
Some players don't type R for ready checking the teleportal
Some players use meteorite
Some players use ceremonial daggers in multiplayer
Some players a re pure cunts.

So mostly players ruin the game, it's up to you to decide if they annoy you or not!

27509,"Roguelike game played in third-person. Runs generally can last up to an hour, if you make it far and don't die. Expect the following things from this game:

+ stylized graphics
+ a healthy variation of environments, enemies, and artifacts (game modifiers you enable before a run) to mix things up
+ Lunar Items also add interesting ways of mixing things up
+ each character has their own rhythms that make them feel distinct and...well, their own characters, rather than classes.
+ though the game can feature characters with very fast movement speeds, you generally move a lot faster than enemies, and enemies in this game are generally easy to outrun or maneuver unless you specifically move near them to attack. This aspect of the gameplay loop means that you can always try running back so you have time to plan your next attack, if things get tricky. This makes the game less reliant on twitch reflexes.
+ a solid gameplay loop
- both final bosses (the default and the Beads of Fealty routes) have abilities that can decide the fight before it even begins if you do something wrong with your inventory.
- RNG for item drops on this game can be very unforgiving, and on some characters such as the Commando, this is almost to the point of deciding your entire run. However, if you really do not like the RNG, an option exists; enabling the Artifact of Command before your run starts will allow you to choose item drops, removing a huge part of RNG.

Risk of Rain, the first one, was a fun little game. Deceivingly simple it really built up after 20 or 30 hours. It had a good recipe at its core. And when Risk of Rain 2 was announced... In 3D... It just felt right. It felt like it was going to work. Maybe that wasn't the consensus at the time given that kind of leap rarely works for a series, but I was onboard. I bought it right away and dove in once I could. It works. Spectacularly. The change allowed the game to blossom. 120 some odd hours later of blindly blasting about and I finally beat the game on ""Monsoon"" (hard) difficulty. Solo, with the commando (base character). Yup, solo. This game is billed as a game to be played with others. It is indeed at its best co-op (up to 4players). But you can go it alone. There's a huge community around the game and I'm sure if I poked my nose in I could've learned some tips or game meta stuff that would've made my journey a little easier. But I was too stubborn. I had to conquer that moon myself. 

After a year of playing it in bursts on and off I beat it the way it felt right to me. And so it was finally time to review. 

I hesitate to break details down or talk too much about character variety, difficulty arcs, powerups because all I'll do is gush. This game is an all timer for me. Simple as that. I have a million things to say about it and they're all redundantly good and positive. As of the writing of this; 100k reviews ""overwhelmingly"" agree that it's a good one! All I can really hope to add to the consensus is that; It's perfectly fun, and a heck of a challenge, solo too. That doesn't get mentioned much. I'm pretty sure the review website I read even explicitly said it wasn't fun solo when they reviewed it back on release. But it is. The mountain is harder to conquer alone, a Sherpa (or three) makes for an even more spectacular time, but just have it any way you can. Play this game! If you're reading a review and still haven't tried it; do it. You can get everything out of Risk of Rain 2 that you are willing to put in. It rewards effort. It rewards your time. It rewards your grind. And it takes an awful lot to plateau. Even then, there's usually an update (or a DLC!) looming. More more more. 

Your weather forecast should always be rain. Strongly recommended. An all time classic that is still being developed really isn't something to be ignored or skipped."

all jokes aside very good game
the variety between the characters is great
i used a save editor to get some crap, i'll admit, but that's just because i'm impatient and just wanted the characters, items and artifacts without needing to go through all the crap
while i'm not a fan of luck, the artifact of command lets you just BE THE LUCK which gives me immense dopamine

27524,"This is an amazing game that intimidated the crap out of me at first! There's great depth and if you put in a little time and brainpower to learning the ropes and finding a main (or few) you will be greatly rewarded with the thrill of ridiculous power. Don't be put-off if you play with friends at first and are overwhelmed as they carry you; just give yourself time for the concepts to sink-in.

Just know that when people say ""you can play it on a potato,"" you [i]technically can[/i] but your runs will always be short because at some point your frames will slow dramatically. It's still [i]possible[/i] to clear levels when spawns chunk you down to like 8fps, but don't expect reliably epic god-runs if you aren't on a decent PC.
So, on a 2.4 GHz CPU with 7GB RAM and a 1050 ti and lowest settings it was [i]possible[/i] to complete 20 levels and [i]possible[/i] to grind-out runs longer than 6 real-life hours, but it was [b]not reliable and not recommended.[/b]"

Acquiring new items that help you in every stage, what's nice too is when you die in a stage, you don't lose your items, but you do have to wait until the next stage to reappear. It's packed with quite a few characters that you need to unlock as well as unlock their secondary abilities and skins, but the grind for them is so worth it! Definitely recommend this game to anyone wanting to purchase it, especially since it's on sale too."

27567,"good game 
"
27568,"Spoilers (?). Just beware.

Game is good - for me. I love mindless RNG-based shooting after tense working days.

I play only singleplayer runs. I bought RoR2 after release and didn't play it in early access.

For 90% of time I run as Commando, Mercenary, Huntress or Artificer. I find other characters boring for now: Artificer also felt like a sack of potato but then it became sooo good and satisfying to play. Those four chars have higher mobility and can deal some dmg.

Most of the time I play on Drizzle or Rainstorm. Monsoon feels tense and I don't want that kind of challenge. But it is certainly welcomed.

Drizzle is quite easy after 1 loop. Do you know what the loop is? Reach Sky Meadow, find a challenge teleporter, put a code (any code will do) and go through. Or use other routes. Enemies will become stronger, bosses will spawn randomly as regular enemies, teleporter bosses will be doubled with each loop.

It's more complicated on higher difficulty. This requires some skill and some amount of luck. 
RNG gods may give blessing and you will get red items during 1st stage, or they won't bless you. So you will play around with what's available. Later there are chests/bosses which drops good loot. Whatever, it's not that unfair - after all, this is roguelike. If RNG isn't what you want - why even bother?

Obtain more and more items and you may prevail during the run.

Still, RoR2 will try to play itself if you gathered enough items. Leeching HP and building shield while dealing DMG, also almost all that DMG leads to crits, bleeding, curse, chain lightning, explosions and so on... 
Sometimes I didn't even understand what killed enemies. I mean... Some of them died out of my sight -- maybe I sprinted or jumped too fast for them to deal with it. You can become so thick and threatening after being very fragile. I like it - some may not.

How to make runs different or challenging? Use artifacts. There are a lot of them. Become a glass canon, make all enemies elites (and eff them with some specific item), etc. It's cool, I appreciate the effort.

And after long 200-300 minutes of a run you will come to Mithrix, the last boss.
Most of enemies are slow, really slow, they can be spongy and deal good DMG. He is fast and can deal high DMG, easily one-shooting.
This guy is boring and lacks variety. It usually takes minutes to kick him to the death even when mobs/bosses vaporize in seconds or during spawn.
He has three or four phases:
- running-smashing-dodging
- (can't say this is a TRUE phase) call for mobs... ew
- running-smashing-dodging + calling for mobs + do some DMG with magick :)
- stealing your items and walking slowly (maybe something else but he dies quickly, losing items when getting DMG)
That's why I would rather loop around 5-6 times then going straight to Mithrix. To have my mindless fun with this game. Nevertheless, it's more satisfying to obliterate in the Void then beating that sack of moonflash.

Therefore, I kinda recommend this game. 
Nothing too deep. Bang-bang. Some skill or luck till you become a death machine are required."

they are a very simple concept, tons of fun for hours upon hours. But there's one thing all rogue-like games have in common, there all 2D. Which is understandable, adding another dimension is tough with games like these. But Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D rogue, run and gun with 12 unique characters, each with a different play style. It makes sense how its one of the most top selling games on steam, this game is a masterpiece. Now I've never played the original risk of rain, but I don't feel like i need to, this game is rogue-like perfection"

27602,"My first game I did NOT know how to play, the difficulty kept increasing! Is this winnable??? Died before I even understood that money was lost between teleports... lol

Then I played with some friends who knew how the system worked, all of a sudden the game made sense and I could walk around casually at the final timer difficulty, incredible! Being carried by some OP teammates gave me the time to actually read item descriptions and ask questions, far better than any video tutorial.

It's such a break from the stereotypical FPS genre and it's so much more fun. The whole progression isn't ""beat each level in order and get better gear"" it's ""run because every second you waste makes it harder and pile on everything you can grab"".

The amount of replayability is also insane, not even having unlocked any new characters, every run was something entirely different and I had to learn new mechanics and strategy every time, forcing me to think fast while always in motion, it keeps the pace of the game enjoyable and leaves no chance to settle into a single play style for the whole run."

27697,"Well what can I say? Extremely overrated game imo. I played for about 30 minutes, reached the first boss. The gameplay is incredible easy and you get to learn it very fast. It is smooth and you can't really complain much on that. Still I do not feel the the music appealing and the environment is kinda dull and the graphics are meh. The enemies aren't interesting in the least. 

Look at good games for example, Borderlands, Dying Light. That is how you make a game interesting. I know those games are very different. But they have something that makes it appealing. Music, story, enemies etc. I can understand people liking this game. But this was just not for me at all. Refunded."

27718,very good game yes
27719,"Rouge-likes have always been a very interesting genre of game, but no rouge-like has ever come close to RoR2. The game flows really well, and it's very easy to get hooked on the game and saying ""one more"" constantly through day or night until your boss calls you asking why you weren't at work for the past week. Besides some unlocks, every run you start in RoR2 has you start over from ground zero; no items, no exp, stage 1, adding a fresh feeling at the start of every run. The longer the game goes on, the harder it gets, and it's always a grueling feeling watching the dificulty tick over from ""I'M COMING FOR YOU"" to ""HAHAHAHA."" With that being said, the game does require a lot of time to actually play, as each run typically lasts around an hour if you don't loop around, and an extra half an hour for each loop after that. Still, this is easily the best game I've ever played. 13/10."
27720,j
27721,"This game is soooo fun, as solo or with friends its a really fun time. All the chaos that happens is just insanity and hilarious to watch burn down and feels even better when you defeat it. The only ""bad"" thing about this game is just me generally not understanding why the final boss isnt on the 20th stage but is instead on the 6th, seems kinda odd to me but the goods outweigh the bad mostly."

27734,"Good game. You will certainly get your money's worth. Extremely replayable and can be as challenging as you want it to be. Even if you get bored of it normally, it's great for a background zone out games and has tons of mods that can spice things up if you get bored with the normal stuff. Additionally, its a great game if you like hunting for easter eggs, as almost every unlock is behind some sort of secret."
27735,One of the best
27736,just buy it
27737,play it. it's too fun
27738,"Absolutely top of its class when it comes to action roguelikes. Solid learning curve and awesome gameplay.

My only criticism with this game is there is lack of ""builds"" so to speak. You're always looking for the same key items - AtG, Runald's/Kjaro's band, ukelele and so on. I suppose its only natural that in a rogue like you'd wanna stack as many bonus damage items as possible, but once you get 1.5-2 ish hours in, all games are basically the same.

It sounds worse than it is, since i would take 10 times as long for me to list all the pros than the cons, so just know: its damn good.

9/10, upcomming dlc will probably bump it to a 10/10, if you believe its possible for a game to be perfect, that is"
27739,good game :)
27740,"Very fun and addictive roguelike shooter/fighter. Could play this game for hours, highly recommend to anyone any day even if  you aren't the biggest fan of roguelike games, this is one of the best ones out there. This game is like home for sweaty try hards. The more you play and progress through the levels the difficulty increases until you cannot handle it anymore, it gets pretty intense but is super fun. One thing I don't/can't recommend though is playing on 64 player slot servers as doing so with max settings turned up my game had a very bad crash/freeze on one of the higher difficulties/levels. Hundreds of bosses/enemies spawning constantly and only 30 some players were on the servers I played in on. Having that many players on a server with all that going on at the same time was causing the game to lag very badly and eventually ended up in a freeze/crash and had to restart my pc. My PC Specs below.

CPU: Ryzen 9 3600x
GPU: Nvidia GeForce 2060 Super SC Ultra
Ram: 32gb Trident Royal Z
Storage: 1TB SSD

So yeah if there's one bad thing about this game it would be the 64 slot playable servers.  Other than that, the game is solid and has a highly addictive and interesting gameplay loop. Great game here. The game and the play style you can pick and choose from(different characters with different weapons/abilities) has something to offer for everyone. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game. 10/10"

27745,"v fun. dont spoil yourself, its more fun that way."
27746,I putt my cock and balls in a blender 10/10
27747,awesome #1 indie game
27748,"Really fun game, it's like diablo 2 meets fps. Kinda like borderlands with the rpg elements but less about the story and more straight up gameplay. Less focus on skill trees and more centered around the items that tailor your builds.

Also has a VR mod, that you can still play with friends playing pancake. Overall really fun and addicting gameplay. It's fully playable and fun single player but really shines with a buddy or a couple friends!"
27749,The game is fun. Lots of items and classes that you can play with but i recommend playing something else other than this from time to time since it can get quite boring playing the same game over and over.
27750,godbeast
27751,"I enjoy this game alot.
Great gameplay that varies depending on your chosen skills/survivor/artifacts.
Music that bops.
Achievement system that's pretty good and rewards you with unlocks for later runs.
Accurate difficulty scaling depending on time.
Long/short runs depending on playstyle.
Playing with friends is a fun experience, unless you get behind by dying alot while your friends have fun.
Great bossfights and variety in mobs.
And a dev-team that seems capable and listens to the community.

27766,rain kinda risky tho
27767,very fun
27768,ok
27769,"This game is very boring, Don't get it, me and my friend got this game on winter sale and we played it for 2 hours and it never got any better, all you do is shoot then get some items then go to a different place then you shoot some more there's no story or any kind of lore to the actual game, That said the game also has its upsides to it like the sound track is good also the game looks very nice but that's the only fun thing about this game, also it takes forever to even get the first 2 characters on normal it took us like 2 hours just to get a character, to sum this up the game is very nice looking and has great music but the game play is repetitive and boring. Don't trust the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews. I hope this helps you save some money."
27770,"I LOVE THIS GAME
it has consumed my life."
27771,"Great game to play with friends. Risk of Rain 2 is a rogue-like, which means there will be a lot of randomness, death, and in this case, chaos. The sequel follows the same basic pattern as the original: go through levels collecting various items to affect the character’s attacks and become as powerful as possible before ending the game, either in death or by defeating the boss. With a diverse cast of characters and plenty of challenges, there is always something new to try and achieve."

As a grinding game, Risk of Rain 2 is not fun to play.

27829,"To put it simply...

Stumbling around through ugly, monotonous environments isn't ""spooky"". It's just boring. There isn't anything to do in the world but stare at the same few creatures you're hacking and slashing your way through. Endless. Sprawling. Grey and brown.

And then there's the lack of video settings options. And the abject failure of the button mapping to update the HUD's tips and labels. So after you remap your keys you better remember what they are when you come back after a month because the game absolutely will not tell you. This is basic UI design issues and it's profoundly embarrassing to be seeing this in the 21st century. And then there's the awkward translations which end up misdirecting you or even just flat-out lying to you about what things do. No, you actually can't This critique has been repeating a theme a lot, but it's fitting for this specific game. It's not actually a game. It's just a tedium simulator. It's not difficult, it's anti-designed. It's not dark and depressing, it's just boring and ugly.

Is it the absolute worst I've ever played? No. But it's among the worst ten, in the last twenty five years of gaming.

At least Barbie's Shopping Adventure had colors."

Don't let the amount of hours steam said I played fool you - I have more than 80 hours on this godly game, which is why I got 88/112 achievements (I transferred my save).

+ Fun Gameplay.
+ Unique Characters.
+ Time Mechanic is unique and cool.
+ Bungus is included.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Sometimes you fight Wandering Vagrant on Stage 1 (and if you're unlucky you'll fight a Wandering Vagrant on stages 2 & 4 as well).
- Brass Contraptions exist.

Just buy it ffs.

27922,"One of the best games I have ever played. 
10/10
Pros
-The games design and pacing is phenomenal, the game is built around the player's ability to come up with combinations 
 of items, abilities, equipment's and characters. The choice to allow items to stack infinitely allows for the unlimited 
 empowerment of the player to a point when you almost always feel overpowered, while making each run very unique. Yet 
 despite this (when playing on the highest difficulty especially) the player never feels complacent. Even when you can kill 
 an entire stage by being afk 5 times in a row, there is a good chance you will be one shot next stage, keeping the game 
 always fresh.
-Each of the characters is unique and plays different, while some do feel more powerful than others every character feels 
 balanced and on a level playing field and each synchronises with different items much better making each run feel unique 
 and keeping any item from being wholly redundant.
-Music and visuals are awesome, though it is subjective I doubt its controversial to say that the music slaps. The visuals are  
 vibrant and well designed giving each enemy distinctive features, types and abilities so they feel fresh.
-Game has full modding support and a very active modding community.
-The devs are absolute legends.

Cons
-If you have epilepsy or light sensitivity, I would advise to avoid the game.
-It is extremely fast paced and at times somewhat overwhelming.
-There is a disturbing amount of porn mods (this may be a positive for some)

28007,"Each run you do is different and will vary depending on the drops you can get access to. Also it depends on whether you're willing to spend the time to get the money to open the drops, or if you just want to rush through to the next level.

Haven't played it multiplayer, but I can imagine that the chaos with a team would be quite entertaining . . . and obviously challenging.

Solid game. Better than its predecessor. Easy 7/10, and that is based solely off the single player experience."

28020,Solid.
28021,"Wonderful 3rd person rogue-like shooter, with multiple fun and viable builds and loadouts for each of the very distinct characters. Immensely replayable and great with friends. Supports modding, and is still receiving patches (and some new content soon, though full disclaimer, the devs said this would be the last new content for a while), all in all, worth the price as a single player experience, and a great time with some friends. 10/10"

28061,Cool game. The real meat of the game is real late when you're on the second-to-last or final level. It gets so chaotic that you feel like a god no one can touch.
28062,"incredibly mid and repetitive.
its not BAD but its not GOOD, just not the type of thing i can see myself playing for any extended period of time"
28063,"This game is incredibly fun. You drop in, grab gear, and fight enemies. There is an ever increasing difficulty so you are forced to play fast (the fun way) to survive and keep up with the enemies. There is a fairly large cast of survivors each on is incredible unique and bring their own play style to this already great game. 10/10 would recommend"
28064,KNOCKLOUGHRIM LOVES THIS PRODUCT!!!
28065,"It's a nice game to play solo or multiplayer. It has its own unique charm and character, and offers a lot of action and replayability. You will die, but it's ok. Each playable character has a different play style, and each run is different due to the RNG. You will find a character that you love. Overall it's a great game that I find myself coming back to. It also has a great dev team."
28066,Absolute banger.
28067,big ass bosses be exploding and shi
28068,Same 1 final boss
28069,"I just want to thank Hopoo for this masterpiece in action/rogue-like gaming. 
I played the first game a lot with my friends back when it came out in 2013/14, and after a while we had sussed out how to overcome the difficulty curve and play until we would nearly crashed our computers. 
The original game was great, and seeing this game announced left me with high expectations for the sequel, and when the pre-release version was made public I, and my friends bought it as soon as possible. We were blown away to see the game in 3D: the characters, enemies and bosses all making an almost seamless transition into the new 3D environment. Even with just 3 maps it was just like going back to 2013: we just threw ourselves into the game and all the challenges, with improving with each run.
The game is a bit of a challenge for my ageing computer, but even with low graphics settings selected, I think the game is great to look at, the sound design and music (just like in the first game) really round off the gaming experience, and the difficulty always keeps you on your toes. 
So if you like a frantic action game where you feel like you are in constant danger, then I really recommend Risk of Rain 2."
28070,Amazing game for its style:D
28071,Who doesn't want to fly around in circles just to punch a lizard in the jaw?
28072,good game
28073,"Put a 24 hours and then tell me if its a bad game,if you do you clearly didnt pass stage 1"
28074,"I never thought I'd be enjoying a roguelike, but here I am actually doing so. In terms of production it's a very stable game (I almost encountered no bugs). I appreciate the enormous amount of lore, even though I'm quite beyond reading it. Great job by the indie team."
28075,"This game is very fun. It has a lack of rain though, but it doesn't mean the game isn't worth playing."
28076,"nice game, but wher da rain at"
28077,Nice game
28078,"fun for long time, bing chilling cool"

28114,Rouge-like masterpiece.
28115,Boring
28116,"This game is extremely fun, it presents a challenge that my and my friends can push trough without it being overly challenging that makes it impossible. My buds and I have only beaten the game a few times but it definitely makes you want to come back for more. 

Got this game as a birthday present from one of my best friends and I couldn't be more entertained with it."
28117,"300 hours in, I feel like I could play for another 300. Incredibly well polished, amazing mods, flawless multiplayer, and a gameplay loop that I'd venture to call it incredibly addictive. Do yourself a favor, pick this game up. I give my highest score yet, of a perfect 5/5 (Almost as good as Knack 2).

28131,"I give this game a thumbs up! First of all, Risk Of Rain 2 is by far the best rouge-like game that I have, I'd say it would even be one of my favorite games! Also, this game is built like a tank, it takes a lot to make this game lag. Lastly, this game has 11 different characters to choose from and earn, making you able to spend hundreds of hours with always action packed game play! In conclusion, I would rate this game a solid 9 out of 10! 
              P.S. A couple downsides about this game is, one, you can just set a timer and expect to be done right around that time, and two, this game does get very repetitive and grindy so beware. Still after all that, Risk Of Rain 2 is well worth the price!"
28132,"be having a god run, killing every shit you see alive and boom it hit.... malachite...."

Not too much of a learning curve in my opinion, but of course, I played the first game, and though there are new challenges in 3D, as long as you keep strafing and keep your wits about you, you'll be fine. Devs have only further improved on everything with the sequel, and playing over the past two years with the content updates has been very rewarding. You will get back your money's worth tenfold."

Perfect for beginners and fun to play even if you finish the game. Complete runs can last from 35 to 70 minutes on average. With the abundance of items, characters, and a DLC on the way there is room for endless hours of fun!
Edit1: DLC is great! It is another perfect release!"

This game is also incredibly fun with friends and if you don't have friends then there's always someone on the official discord server who's willing to play.

28253,a glug game to be sure
28254,You know a game is good when you’re genuinely having fun and this is one of those games.
28255,"Absolute banger of a game. Every run is different and each character is unique and fun to play. The game is also extremely mod-friendly and there are tons of quality of life and content mods available which just enhance the experience. The upcoming DLC looks amazing so far as well and will only add more content to the game, as well as a new game mode. 

There are modifiers called ""artifacts"" which you can enable to change up the gameplay, but in my opinion the absolute best way to play this game is with no artifacts on, which keeps the replayability high by keeping your items random and having you adapt to what the game deals you. 

There's a little bit of a learning curve, you will die a lot, but that's all part of the game. Don't get discouraged if you're having a tough time at the start, you'll learn quickly how to avoid different enemies and how to navigate each stage. It's much less daunting than it may originally appear."

28269,only negative is the big ass price
28270,Opinion after 10 hours of gameplay: I got this recommended to me by a friend so I gave it a shot. Aiming feels good and movement feels very smooth. Gameplay is fun until you reach the boss/portal phase. Then it just turns from a fun/good game into an RNG bullethell. Getting killed during those phases often feels completely out of your control and sometimes even literally unavoidable which is very annoying and frustrating. Would not recommend for now.
28271,"Where do I begin with Risk of Rain 2...

There's a lot of positive things to say about it, so here goes.

[h1] Starting off with my personal thoughts on the characters: [/h1]

- Commando: Your beginning class and the designated Dark Souls class (because y'know, rolling around?)
Pretty strong yet underrated honestly, mainly because some builds like dps + bleed can really get him in a good DPS spot alongside other classes like Mercenary. He's also built (at least to me) to be a Jack of all Trades class, so any item will work on him just fine. Well, mostly. 

My only complaints about him are about his basic kit. They'll quickly lose use without mods or builds as you unlock the Tactical Slide and Shotgun secondary. However, you can play him as you like. 

- Huntress: Previously the class you got from an achievement (Warrior) but now another starting character, she's the designated kiting class, ignoring [i] other ideals. [/i] She's good at dodging past attacks and dealing damage of her own, though her low health pool makes her not so ideal for head-on attacks, though Crowbars work wonders.

My only complaint is how weak Arrow Rain feels compared to Ballista, but Arrow Rain still has it's uses in vanilla or modded, so it's not entirely useless!

- Bandit: Returning from Risk of Rain 1 and taking Huntress's spot in the Warrior achievement, he's a classic favourite of mine so seeing him return was a welcome surprise. I don't have any real complaints about him seeing as his kit is fluid, works well, and is fun to use. 

- MUL-T: Another good DPS class with extremely strong Crowbar synergy with his rebar railguns (like with Huntress), he's your main damage dealer in the classes in terms of range. He also has good mobility and works wonders with both ranged and melee builds. No real complaints here, but feel free to share any of your own!

- Engineer: The classic ""sit and wait"" class for some, but for others, not so much. His bungus turret strat is probably one of the most well known and the most broken builds on him, but I'll let you in on a secret. [spoiler] Try a bleed crit build on his laser turrets, it's super fun. [/spoiler] 

My only complaint is kinda how crap his primary is, but mods or getting good with it can alleviate the problem. 

- Artificer: Honestly - at least for me - one of the hardest yet most rewarding classes to play. She's not terrible by any means, but you'll have to learn quite a bit with her to play her good. I personally like using the crowbar ice spear tactic over the ball but any build works, [i] even the Purity flamethrower strat. [/i]

No complaints here besides how... lacklustre her alternate primary feels, but it might have some uses. 

- Mercenary: One of two overpowered melee characters, his Purity Eviscerate build tests the endurance of both the enemy and your index finger as you spam R to save your ever so risky life. Other builds however - like Slicing Winds builds - are super fun too! 

No complaints here.

- REX: One of two that I main personally, and also an absolute powerhouse with the right red items. With a fast enough attack speed, Rejuvenation Rack and Aegis, you can come [i] nearly [/i] invincible. Even though his unlock requirement can be tedious, I'd say it's worth it. 

My only complaint is how tedious the requirement is, but it's by far worth the trouble. 

- Loader: The other overpowered melee class next to Mercenary, Loader is a wrecking ball of a class capable of destroying bosses with the right setups. Thunderslam and Charged Gauntlet alongside Spiked Fist are a good build for those who unlock them, though even her basic kit is extremely good. 

No complaints here. 

- Acrid: The other that I main, and a sad mess of a class. He's a good melee class... but not on Monsoon. You can make him [b] work [/b] on Monsoon, but eventually you'll have to ditch his melee. Ranged Acrid however is a good setup. 

My complaints are that his melee builds don't really work without mods or luck, but he's still good either way. 

- Captain: The oldie but goldie that obliterates enemies with care packages like it's Call of Duty all over again. He's a reliable class and his bleed builds work amazingly on almost anything. His nuke may be impractical but it's fun once in a while. 

No complaints here. 

There are all my personal opinions, so they're short, not really informative, nor may they be true for y'all, so feel free to share your own opinions. 

[h1] On the game itself. [/h1] 

It's a roguelike shooter that pits you against enemies in various environments. Some are strong, some are weak, some are small, some are big. It all tests your patience, reaction time, and luck with loot. Most items work well or terribly with some characters while some completely break characters and turn them into absolute killing machines. You can loop as much as you want or go to (spoiler content ahead:) [spoiler] defeat Mithrix, the King of Nothing, atop Commencement. [/spoiler] 

Items are unlocked from achievements, so are Artifacts, which alter the game in certain ways. You'll naturally get item unlocks from playing the game, but you'll have to seek out the artifact boards and do their respective Trial for those achievements. Same goes with classes. 

I don't have much else to say here, so I recommend looking at Spades' beginner guide video on this game 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7hqQ21Zs9k

And generally just have fun at your own pace; don't rush through it, find your footing and your preferred character, and have fun blazing through stages, either alone or with friends!"

A lot of fun item combinations to discover which can quickly give you a god complex as you look at enemies and they die, but is also equally challenging.

It would've been a simple thing for the devs to have put microtransactions or other continuous engagement garbage in and they resisted the temptation.

28301,"I cannot stress enough how much fucking fun this whole game is.

Nearly 100% of the game is RNG-based, with every single level, item drop, enemy spawn, and robot spawn being completely random every single run, and it creates for a really fun and intriguing setup for each run.

THE GAME IS DIFFICULT. The game constantly moves the difficulty up whilst you play, and enemies will crush you should you not be careful.

However, the game does allow you to become ludicrously OP, and that's the best part, becoming so absolutely powerful you crush legions of foes with just simply standing around is so crazy.

But I won't continue writing, just get the damn game already, you will have absolutely zero regrets."

The multiplayer in this game is also really good, highly recommend playing this game with friends."

28365,"Risk of Rain 2 is a fine game in concept, and I'm sure a lot of people will love it and have fun with it, but I persoanlly have too many bones to pick with this game to give it a great recommendation, and would rather advise thinking carefully before picking it up.

A game of Risk of Rain 2 is a massive time commitment, and that's my main gripe with it. A normal game will take between 45m-1h30m. You can't save midway, and the entire game is based on a timer where the longer it takes, the harder the game gets. The only way to pause that timer is to go to a market place, where there's a secret minigame that takes another 10-15 minutes to get more upgrades, and you have no reason NOT to take it since it's upgrades with no penalties. After one game and failing to finish a run that you thought you had good stuff going on, my brain never goes ""ONE MORE!"", but rather ""I'd rather play anything else"".

By the time you reach the final levels and boss, the stacks of perks and items are so insane player skill is practically a second thought. Either you can annihilate almost everything in an instant, are almost or completely invincible, or you're going to die. When you die, you're out for an entire level, so you won't get all of the perks your friends gets on the rest of the map, you have to sit your ass and do nothing for 5+ minutes while they finish the level, and by the time you join in the next level, you'll be under-geared, under-perked, and you'll likely die again and have to wait and be carried to the end game.

Maybe I'm just bad at the game, or maybe I just don't get it, but for me, these massive stacking of abilities means everything gets incredibly blurred by the end and I don't find that particularly fun."
28366,its pretty gud
28367,fun
28368,GUD GAME
28369,10/10 would sacrifice myself to obelisk unknowingly again :)
28370,"Super epic game, fun and enjoyable. All the survivors all fun to play, bosses are intriguing, and there is always a challenge you could be doing. I especially enjoy the ""Prismatic Trials"", a live seeded speedrun game mode. 9/10 would recommend..."
28371,A perfect game to play with friends 11/10
28372,Nice little game to kill time on. Enjoyable every single run as it always varies on the items you drop. Gets even better as you unlock more characters and master them. Highly recommended
28373,A good rogue like game to play for when your bored and want to get into a third person game for the first time
28374,"Great game, better sequel.
Just the right amount of difficulty and story, the story isn't in your face and can be ignored if you don't care.
Risk of Rain 1 & 2 are officially (at the time of writing this review) the only 2 games I have ever gotten 100% achievements. I recommended this game when it was just a side scroller but now that it's 3D I'm happy to see this franchise get the attention it deserves.

The only downside to this game is no base save mechanic however, this can be rectified with mods.
"
28375,this is the peak of fun honestly i feel like most rougelikes have shit ass gameplay and compinsate about it with wacky items (which is fine i love isaac and all) but this game fucking breaks it with top notch gameplay rich envirments fair diffculty and even great humor

28378,Cool game fun
28379,best
28380,yeah
28381,Very fun game. I like it.
28382,"Never stops being fun and satisfying, the game is replayable af because there is always something to unlock and some of those unlockables are pretty hard to get but since the game is actually fun you ACTUALLY want to unlock the game's achievements or on the other hand you just forget you wanted to unlock some shit because you are too focused on having fun playing the game. 

It's not even just the unlockables, you just get to know your character and what makes it tick which items to go for or how to better play them so you always have something new to look for in the game.

Another thing is CHOICE, surprising for a game with a lot of RNG, but the game gives you a lot of it, you can change the game's difficulty, you can use artifacts which will either make the game harder or easier, you can destroy items to make other ones you prefer, you can use different skills for you character which completely change the way you play, you can accept optional challenges during your run which are risky but rewarding or optional difficulty modifiers that sometimes spawn around the map each level, you can either loop indefinitely or go to a final boss stage, etc.

The art is extremely good, this is coming from someone who actually makes a living making art for games, specially knowing that the guy in charge of the art was not an artist before the creation of ROR1 so its remarkable how he has grown the quality of the in game art with time. I mean I bought the game day one and I can literally tell how they have been polishing those assets little by little.

Music. I don't know man I'm not a musician but that shit slaps.

Playing with friends will either be the best or the worst thing ever lol, I recommend using the shared items mod or looking for lobbies with the mod enables so you dont need to install it. Also the community is big enough so that the discord server from the devs has some LFG channels where you can find some people to play with and make some friends."
28383,It's my most favorite game right now. It's so satisfying and so well made. If you like fast grinding games and fighting with your friends this is the game for you. I loved it and enjoyed it so much and you should buy it too.
28384,git gud
28385,9/10
28386,BEST GAME OF ALL TIME?!?!?!?!?!??!? (Gone Wrong)
28387,One of my favourite games. I have played a lot of games.
28388,good
28389,"I have thorougly enjoyed every hour I've spent on this game! Fun, replayable and a blast togheter with other players!
"
28390,"The game is very fun, but has some issues with power scaling, even on harder difficulties as long as you survive the early levels you can quickly overpower enemies without much concern. That said it's very fun and feels nice to hit that OP, join a world and watch everything die with one button push, plus it features Faceless Void as the final boss. 

I recommend if you play this game with friends however you have a good set of rules in place or a good set of friends to play it with. Have played it with good friends and rules for loot and it's a blast and no one feels left out. I've also played it with people who insisted there be no loot rules who chewed people out for hogging all of the loot."
28391,its ok
28392,rocks hurt when they fly through space

28396,"This is one of the best games i have played as it is action packed, tense and every playthrough is different. It's great on your own and even better with friends. Definitely 100% recommend it."
28397,nothing will terrify me as much as a celestine wisp that may or may not be hiding a scavenger in its bublé. gud gam
28398,One of my favorite roguelikes easily :)

28427,"This game is nothing short of perfect. Easy time killer. There is a ton of stuff to do. There is almost zero grinding except for lunar coins (although the text file for these is unencrypted for players who want to just edit them). Trust me, get this game. It is a steal even at full price. I would have paid twice as much for it as I did.

This game deserves awards and is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. Go Hopoo!"
28428,"friends got me this as a gift so i could play it with them. we're in normal mode as a trio and a lunar coin drops. i go ""what's this?"" they go ""oh that's a rare item you have to save up over time so you can buy certain things, mind if i take it?"" i go ""yea sure i'm probably only ever gonna play this with you guys anyway."" i now have more hours in the game than they do"

28438,"This game is a masterpiece. I haven't enjoyed many single player games in the past few years, I just get bored after an hour or two. I haven't been able to play old games I used to play solo anymore, all I think about is if i'm bored/when I'm going to BE bored. This game however, awoken that old feeling in me. Just playing a game for 4 hours straight, thoughts entirely focused on the game. My head is clear of all negativity when I get really into a run, this game is pure bliss of a distraction. I just get so focused on this game when I play it, and that's super important for me to enjoy a game. I need to be able to fully cut off the outside world.
 
I can't wait to put more hours into this."

28448,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
28449,"Normally not a huge fan of roguelikes but wow I'm addicted.  The gameplay's fun, the art and music are beautiful, every character plays completely differently.
Setting up a multiplayer lobby of >4 people is a little tedious (requires console commands), but that's a very minor nitpick and the only change I would make to this game.  I cannot wait for the expansion.

EDIT: Holy shit this game is good"
28450,gud gam
28451,great game
28452,"constantly causing crashes and bsod. scoured the internet for two days, no solution. 

At this point this is fraud. You released a broken, incredibly poorly optimized game that clearly needed much longer in Early Access. It is literally unplayable. Another cash grabbing dev team only in it for the money.

Shame on you!"
28453,"it can be hard but it is fun
"
28454,fun game
28455,"MAN, his music was really electric."
28456,This game is one of the best things to play with your friends. Very well made and a fantastic game in general. I would highly recommend getting this game as it is one of the best games to come out over the past year.
28457,yes

28460,I accidentally deleted my game files
28461,"As someone who played the first game avidly a couple years back, i can safely say that this one improved on it in every aspect (minus the lack of sniper and chef). There's a ridiculous amount of replay value as no run will ever be the same, except when you'll die to the same elder lemurian/brass contraption after thinking to yourself that ""this is the run"". Highly recommend, and i'm excited to see what Hopoo has in store for us in the DLC. 11/10"
28462,"I hope someone reads this and saves themselves from purchasing this game.

I absolutely do not see the appeal of ROR2. I see people comparing this to BOI but its nothing like it. Some of the enemy mechanics are unforgiving and will catch you unexpectedly a lot of the time. You end up losing tonnes of time spent on your runs due to this. 90% of the characters are useless. If you playing this with friends it could possibly be fun but there is a good chance they will hate this game.

I will continue to give ROR2 a chance but at the moment its a horrible experience for me."

"
28473,its a great indie rouge if you have time to kill
28474,This game only being $24.99 is down right disrespectful. This game should be worth at least 60. Hell I'd pay 100 for it. Its so good and worth all your time.
28475,"Not many games can keep me coming back but I have kept coming back to this game for the past couple days. I am trying to 100% complete the game and every step of the process is fun, even dying on the last stage of the void fields just makes me wanna go back and try again. This game is one of the best games I have truly ever played and with the recent COD and Battlefield franchises it leads me to think Indie developers are truly the best at making games. I don't write reviews but this game deserves the respect of everyone for how well developed it is."
28476,Fun with friends! Lots of content.

28489,"This game honestly caught me by surprise from how well it delivers in ways most games fail to do. The game itself has such a wide roster of survivors that provide every player with the playstyle that suits them, whether it be fast paced hacking and slashing enemies or just nuking enemies with one attack. The replay value of this game is so high due to how many different builds the items allow you to create and the modifiers you can add to the game to change the way you approach the game. The only small issue with the game is how multiplayer can be troublesome with too many people hoarding the limited items present and how your game can easily crash if your computer is not capable to handle the large amount of enemies and particles that can occur in the game. To sum up, this is definitely worth your time and money to play this game as it just takes all the good aspects of the rougelite genre and combine it into this masterpiece."
28490,"This game is the perfection of the first game's great concept but not as solid execution. Easily my most played game on Steam, RoR2 has endless challenges and unlockables that challenge you to play the game a new way every time."

28507,"it's fun if you got nothing else to play, I recommend with a friend for the best experience."
28508,I shoot things and numbers come out of them and that's very good.
28509,"Risk of Rain 2 is such a blast. I've been playing it with three other friends regularly since I bought it about a month ago. The rogue like elements add variety to each run as you try to make the perfect build for your survivor each time. It's challenging in a good way, there's always that ""one more run"" feeling and it's kept me up late into the night. 

The gameplay is smooth and action packed. Each survivor is distinct and has a different style. Glass cannons, tanks, support, and melee characters are all present. I have my favorites, such as Mul-T with dual wielding nail guns but each survivor is fun and I switch often for the variety. Unlocking loadouts, survivors, and artifacts gives you something else to strive for other than just seeing how long you can last. There are alternate game modes as well but I haven't tried them yet, the standard mode has been a blast. 

It's fun solo but it really shines in co-op. I regularly play with 3 friends and it's so much fun. Another aspect that needs to mentioned is the soundtrack. Chris Christodoulou did an amazing job creating a killer soundtrack that really adds character to the game. It's not often I listen to a game soundtrack outside of playing the game but I do with this one. it's one of my favorites up there with Persona 5. 

I highly recommend Risk of Rain 2 especially if you have friends to play with. Gameplay is smooth, survivors are unique, it's challenging, and addicting in the best possible way."
28510,"very big fan of this game, but not a very big fan of the fact in the void fields, if they get crowbars, your run is over if you get hit, but this has quickly become one of my favorite games so far."

28522,"Quite a good rougelike that can be easily broken depending on the items you obtain and is fairly enjoyable when changing classes. However, not all classes are balanced and thus it would be a bit better if they would make some more balance patches than content patches.

Good solo, best with friends who are similar to your skill level.

7.5/10. Good rougelike with an interesting style."

28543,"Bro good game
"
28544,"i have shouted various swears out of rage while playing this game

8/10

character balance is felt a bit out of whack sometimes.
I play monsoon and started trying to go for obliteration for each character, i feel the difference in power/consistency heavily switch from huntress or mul-t to commando or artificer. i admit i do have fun with all the characters, it's just a smack in the back of the head when you die to a stone titan beam on commando that could've been easily avoided if I was just using armor resist from mul-t's utility or huntress'  utility and special or loader's utility, you get my point.
Either way love this game, learning curve is indeed steep but this game has me trained like a dog for those dopamine hits."
28545,Not good
28546,"Greatest soundtrack of anything ever

Game is pretty fun too"
28547,haha wtf how have you not played this yet
28548,"excellent game, it is difficult but it pushes you to get better. The difficulty increases as time passes. Collect loot by killing enemies and bosses to progress. Unlock skills and artifacts by completing challenges."
28549,Really fun and Intresting

28551,this game fucks. get the goku mod

28554,"Fantastic, even though it never rains..."
28555,good
28556,A great little game that forces you to chose a balance between how powerful you and the enemies simultaneously become.  A fantastic and unique experience that is absolutely worth a buy.
28557,"let me date the crabs, let me date the crabs, let me date them, let me, they are walking hole volcanoes, could you imagine that?? you cant i bet you couldn't let me date them"
28558,"if you like playing games with friends, this is  fantastic. Mods are also great and easy to install"
28559,"GREAT GAME
personally don't have that much time in it but i think its really good!i would like if it had a save button but with rogue likes such as this its common not to.
i'm not going to say its perfect but it is slowly getting closer to that level.
 I've experienced some run ending glitches but there far and few.
over all i think it was worth every dollar i spent on it and i think its a solid 8/10!
 with some more updates it can definitely become one of the best games out there but for now i'm just waiting for that day!

hope this helped anyone looking into getting this game"
28560,"It is kinda hard to get going (like most rougelikes) but once you do it is VERY addictive. It is very replayable because of all the different modifiers, like artifacts, characters, and difficulties allowing most runs to never feel the same, and they all feel unique. Sometimes when a run goes bad, it really sucks because RNGesus isnt on your side and you get bad items and die fast, but when you get a good run, it feels amazing. Each character has pros and cons further adding to how good this game is, and there is lots of balance between most things."
28561,Is good.
28562,"You offer to the shrine, but gain nothing.

28577,Good roguelike. I hate malachites
28578,I love overheating my PC!
28579,"I really wouldn't say I do or don't recommend this game. It's just ok.
Pretty shallow gameplay. 
It seems like there are a lot of items to choose from, but most of them are pretty worthless. You can do a crit build or you can be weaker than you would be if you had done a crit build. That's pretty much it, since the crit build literally has everything in it, including healing.
There are a decent number of monster affixes in actuality, but you're gonna see like 80% just the frost explosion and the burny fire affix, so it really feels like there's no variety at all.
There are melee characters, but like all of the monster affixes seem to exist simply to screw over melee characters, so why would you?
There are characters with attacks that are ground effects, but pretty much half of everything in the game is airborne making those attacks useless. Honestly, though, it doesn't matter too dang much, because once you get past like the second zone you're usually way too strong to die unless you majorly screw up.
It's fun to play together, but it just has head-scratchingly confusing gameplay design choices and is ultimately a shallow experience. It could be really great though, with some changes to the aforementioned things."
28580,DMG!!!
28581,"Risk of Rain 2 is an awesome third-person shooter action roguelike. There is a ton to do and unlock in this game. As of this review there are 11 playable characters, each of which have multiple abilites and a skin that you can unlock through achievements. There are a ton of different items to pick up that will change how each run is played. 2 maps to go to for each stage with an option to loop back around instead of finishing your run. This game is insanely fun and I highly recommend it"
28582,love it! 10/10
28583,its ight
28584,Good game.  Fun with friends.

28601,fun good shooty guning
28602,Yes. Toaster approved.
28603,"9/10

The fatal flaw is that all the best item combos that'll keep you alive through the majority of the game become useless against the final boss. Will o the Wisps and Ukeleles will wipe stages clean for you but once you're up against one guy better hope your bandoliers, desk plants and pauldrons do something for you. It'd be good if Commencement resembled a final teleporter event and Chimeras spawned in over time during the fight but w/e

There's also a ton of just plain bad items clogging up the loot pool. I've tried to get through Eclipse 4 about 15 times and only ended up with decent movement speed a handful of attempts. Shoulda rolled my dice better

If there was a guaranteed goat hoof cauldron on Commencement I'd trade all my reds in every time.

The last roguelike game I'll ever play, almost perfect. I'll change this review to a recommendation when Hopoo lets us pick up the pots on Abandoned Aqueduct"

28614,Absolutely Excellent. takes everything the first game did well and expands on it in new and interesting ways. Only thing i miss is the Classic RoR1 music.
28615,10/10 game i have lost all sense of reality and the only thing that matters is my next run.

no homo i wish to kiss Hopoo Games devs and Chris Christodolou on the mouth"
28619,"Pros:
- bungus
- you can obliterate yourself from existence
- you can steal loot from your friends
- in the later stages there is so much shit on the screen that I don't know what I'm shooting at

Cons:
- literally none"
28620,"hm. fun to play multiplayer, but the more you try to think the worse it gets. you have to struggle to find anything interesting in this game but i don't know of any alternatives"
28621,"Amazing game to play alone and with friends, it makes you hate your entire existence once a little beetle goes ninja and kills you at first for not moving around, then you start to hate with passion the most ""weak"" monsters in the game: The Lesser Whisps. Those little things will ruin any hope of you to survive if you are low HP and they spawn because they NEVER MISS... But the game is still extremely good and the best part is, It's roguelike, so you die? who cares? i'll go again and again and still have fun from stage 1. Super recommended"

28632,"I love playing this game. When I beat it the first time, I thought that I would get tired of the gameplay but I just keep coming back to it. A great game for anyone looking for a singleplayer or multiplayer game that keeps you on your toes :D"
28633,"In 3 days of owning this game I've averaged over 8 hours per day. 
Amazing gameplay, tons of replayability and depth to the game and the soundtrack is badass."
28634,"This game has 4 phases to it: 
1) EZ mode
2) harder but still killing it
3) Do I loop again?
4) We shouldn't have looped

Seriously tho. Best steam gift I have been given. Would easily spend $20 or more on this game. Super replayable. Fun with friends. What more needs to be said?"
28635,good.

28637,fun game
28638,yees verygood
28639,YEa
28640,"Amazing game so much action packed into 1gb of a download. The game gets harder as time goes on spawning more and stronger enemies with it. Getting through the levels quickly as possibly grabbing the best items on the way for your character. This game is worth playing.

To the developers I would ask that maybe you could add in some more content such as characters and maybe a new level.

I'll give this game a 4/5 would die again on monsoon difficulty."
28641,thanks
28642,Bungus is Fungus
28643,"This game is like a scifi Souls game, where you encounter every last possible reason to Alt+F4 within the first 10 runs because you die to the same lesser wisp because he is destined to get revenge for its family that you had obliterated in passed lives. Then you get a bunch of really great items and you are on your way to Mithi-boi and the rng just decides to give you your final test. Making it up to the final boss getting to his final phase, killing him-and then a void reaver decides to blow your sh*t up ending what you thought would be the god run. 

Also, If you don't pick up shaped glass you're a coward."

28647,"Not a lot of handholding, but easy enough to pick up, the real challenge lies in putting it down again."
28648,better than sex
28649,"honestly a hella fun game to either play alone or with a couple of friends and just lose track of time in a run. visually very pleasing, has a great soundtrack, has multiple characters to play as and all have their own unique playstyles. i regret not playing this more when it first came out until now but i'm loving every moment of it that i've spent and will continue to spend in this game"
28650,Got so addicted in playing Eclipse I actually dreamt of finishing 1 run of Eclipse. At least I was able to actually finish 1 run of eclipse irl. 10/10
28651,good
28652,"actual rougelike perfection wtf.
like i usually write long-ass reviews but i don't even have shit to say this time. it has no problems as far as I can tell that are remotely significant. it lags if you play the same run for like two hours while there are 65,394,384 calculations being made a second ig. play it."
28653,yes
28654,"how to have fun playing this game
1. open risk of rain 2
2. start a run
3. spawn in the middle of a void seed
4. get shot by a wisp
5. die to a single stack of collapse doing 80% of your health bar and void damage
conclusion: get lucky or get lost"
28655,"Fast paced rogue-like, where no run will ever be the same due to the variety of characters, loadouts, items, and the pure RNG that can make or break your next boss battle. The road is frustrating, but the first time you beat the game only makes you want to do it all over again, even if your wife is saying ""don't you dare start another 45 min run."" Baby, it's midnight on a Wednesday and I got to put Mithrix in his place again.

Great game and even more awesome soundtrack! Highly recommend."

28671,"The only reason anyone is stupid enough to leave a dislike on this game is they have gaming journalist disease. (They suck at it, therefore game must be bad and poorly made.)

Overall top tier game, easily in my top 5 of all time. Super re-playable with tons of modifiers. Giant modding community and a well optimized mod loader that doesn't look like a Russian hacking playground. Soundtrack is amazing and very diverse."
28672,tis gyam
28673,YES
28674,very good
28675,"I had originally left a review for this game when I had 46 hours in it. It's time I come back to it, now that I've sixtupled the amount of time I have in the game.

I still do not recommend this game as a solo player. Sure, in multiplayer it's a great experience. If your friends are loot goblins, there are ways to fix that with mods like ShareSuite. The characters complement each other  extremely well. I was running a challenge to complete all achievements as SinglePlayer. Although I almost got it done, it's time I give up. The melee characters are quite frankly trash. Loader is very strong, but in my humble opinion, very boring. Mercenary is just trash, period. Maybe I don't get how to play it, but I'd rather not put myself through the pain of having to play that character for no reason. Sadly, a lot of achievements are tied to these guys, notably their mastery and the prismatic trial.

This is most certainly my extreme schizophrenia when it comes to RNG, but this game is [b]hella[/b] rigged. You will have games where some items are simply absent entirely, and for some reason it tends to be the ones your character needs to prosper. I'm talking about bustling fungus on engineer, crit glasses on volley huntress, etc. And yet, you'll play another game right after as another character and get a printer of that exact item!... except you only get printers of that specific item, 5 maps in a row. It's rigged, I tell you.

[h3]Original review[/h3]
Even after this much time in the game, [strike]I despise the fact that you have to get out of levels after ""about 5 minutes"" because otherwise you fall behind. Even though I understand the reasoning behind it, I think it's a dumb mechanic and honestly, ruins the game for me.[/strike] Dumb friend told me dumb rule, doesn't apply.

It's important to note that I'm a solo player. It is beyond me that someone could so poorly balance a game for solo play yet so perfectly balance it for coop. Do not buy this if you're going to play it solo, it's a waste of time."
28676,Uh huh

28680,"Utter chaos and obliteration, for both the player and the enemies."
28681,10/10 Highly recommend if ur into rogue-like games
28682,I would happily commit a hour or two per game. A great album of music that immerses you into the game's rhythm. Very impressed by this 3D sequel.
28683,good classic video game fun
28684,"(High)RISK of FUN^2.

If you do not want to risk having fun, then this game is not for you."
28685,crazy shit
28686,yes beautiful game beautiful music super damn fun and monsoon is hell i love it
28687,YES
28688,fucking amazebalss
28689,"I've tried so hard to like this game, but a ""winnable"" run takes such specific item RNG that it just isn't fun. An average run for me lasts about 30 minutes before getting randomly 1 shot by some obnoxious elite that I didn't see spawn directly behind me while fighting 400 other monsters in my field of view.

This game severely needs a balancing mechanic for upper end monster damage. There are very few (if any) other Rogue-likes where you can be nearing the end of a run and a regular ass enemy takes you out in 1 hit. Life? Hah, doesn't matter, because if you didn't get one-shot you'll surely just die momentarily afterwards. The unlocks are just plain boring to interact with too and seemingly pure RNG whether you can complete them in any given run. In the end, nothing matters about this game because you will surely spend 80% of all your runs dying in one hit to something you didn't notice within the first 3s it was spawned."
28690,Soob
28691,epic game

The graphics are lovely and won't tire your eyes. 
The gameplay is amazingly fun.
The co-op experience is awesome.
It is the perfect casual and fun game to play with your friends if you like dungeon-like games!

Really worth the price. Looking forward for the 2022 DLC and whatever is going to come next!"
28698,saws go brrrrr
28699,yes
28700,Probably the most addictive rogue-like that I have played since the Binding of Isaac. Each character is unique and unlocking them and their abilities was great fun. RNG is the typical mixed bag. You might die 2 minutes into a run or become a godlike being. Totally worth every cent and it's even better with friends.
28701,"game good

28712,Honestly one of my favorite rouge like games on the market right now especially on top of the flexibility you have with characters and builds. On top of this the game has an amazing modding community which is just the cherry on top. I would definitely recommend this game to new and experienced players alike.

28715,Good game

28722,Good
28723,rougelike excellence
28724,"I loved RoR and enjoyed RoR 2 somewhat, but it was ultimately a letdown for me. The game is fun overall, but the last map and final boss are really boring and grindy such that the game loses a lot of replayability IMO."
28725,Great game to just kick it with pals.
28726,Very cool
28727,"This game is digital crack. If you like rogue-likes, then don't skip this one. I thought I didn't like the genre until I played this game"

28737,"Overwhelmingly positive rating says it all. Fun game with ton of replayability. Worth it's full price. Also looking forward to new DLC which is during the time of writing this review, coming out in Q1 2022."
28738,This game used to be fun. Unbalanced DLC has completely ruined it. Collapse is broken. The new mercs aren't fun. No patch notes because they're amateurs. Feels like they've lost the plot and have no idea how to balance the game anymore. They even screwed up the base game. RIP.

literally every character is unique and interesting

except commando though you could say they're unique by being the only not unique character on the roster

28795,There is literally no reason not to have this game.

28797,I poke my head out of the gutter for one freaking second and the vagrant shovels orbs in my face.
28798,A fantastic sequel that captures the spirit and feel of the first game and builds upon it.  A thoroughly enjoyable LAN party game experience!

28807,"I had a very good time playing this game solo and with friends. Most characters felt nice to play.
I found no bugs while playing. 
The music and graphics are fitting.
The game can be modded -> nice mods I saw : Some for quality of life, some that change an entire class, some that challenge you in different ways.
I think it is a very good roguelike game!"

28819,good
28820,"Risk of Rain 2 is a game made by devs that care, and the gameplay shows that. You rarely, if ever feel cheated when you fail. It is by no means an easy game, but it presents a very fun and unique challenge, while also allowing you to play it in a variety of different ways that can all be effective if done right. The art style is fantastic, the visuals never get old, and don't even get me started on the god tier soundtrack. One of the few games that I have songs in the soundtrack saved and will listen to them when in my free time.

The game has a great mod community, but the vanilla game is still a fun and entertaining experience. The more you play, you unlock a variety of new items, new characters with different sets of skills and abilities, discover new areas, each with their own secrets. Those secrets could unlock new characters, an alternate stage, secret boss fights, among many other things. The only catch to this game is it has you do it all on your own. No tutorial, no hints, no guide, you're just dropped into the game and left to figure it out on your own. If you have friends with previous experience, and that have made some progression, you can play with them to much more quickly unlock new items and discover the secrets of the game. The multiplayer is loads of fun with friends, I've never actually tried playing with random players so i can't really say much about that. But the game is fun to play solo as well."
28821,The only thing it rained was meteorites
28822,i don't wanna wait
28823,Game is a huge time dump especially at the beginning. and a great amount of mix up. From achievement hunting to clearing eclipse and hell even mods your gonna get WAY over your moneys worth.

28827,Fantastic game! Hours of fun with lots of replayablilty! Lots of characters to unlock keeping it intresting. Super fun to play with friends (up to 4). Very Hard! If you liked the first game this is a very faithful sequel turning the game 3-D.

28834,"I love RoR 2, great community, nice gameplay, lot of fun builds to do with the items you can collect, good challenging content and run pretty smoothly, even with lot of things on the screen.

Good job, im having fun and I will surely continue to have fun for months!
btw the game is even better with friends !"
28835,"bungus engie
"
28836,"I played a fair bit o the first RoR, and tbh, it took me a long time to play RoR2, because I felt like it would be IM-possible to recreate the vibe in 3d.  Eventually, I relented, and what I found was nothing short of a miracle.  It's high praise when the only reasonable comparable example you can think of is Mario 64.  I'm writing these words not because the game needs more support at this point.  Obviously, it does not.  I just want to share my enthusiasm for this wonderful game."

28847,GOTY
28848,"Risk of Rain 2 is a massive step up from its predecessor, Risk of Rain, in almost every way. New stages, new survivors, new items, new bosses... the game add so much more of what players already loved. Not just that, but it also delivers all this content in an entirely new format, going from a 2D side scroller to a 3rd person shooter. 

If you're someone who enjoys roguelikes, then I can say wholeheartedly that this is more than likely the game for you."

28862,Great game with ton's of replayability.
28863,Good time killer.
28864,This game is a master piece once you get into a flow you cant put it down. Although it is hard for new players to get into it due to the limited selections of who you can play but once you start to unlock some more survivors it is a blast. Worth every penny.
28865,"Awesome game, great with friends or solo. Consider buying this only if you have a quick pc, as the higher levels have more elements to them which can greatly reduce performance."

28890,"Good game to zone out to.
"
28891,"You were killed in one shot and you can't deny it. I don't even need to be there to see it. I know that is how you died. You could not have died in any other way. It will always be a one-shot kill death. There is no other death. You can only die that way. There is no other way of dying after all. Massive damage in an extremely short period of time is what will kill you and there is no escaping. It doesn't matter how much health you have it'll all be gone and there is no escape either. You'll be back to do it again. You will never stop. You'll keep getting one shot for all eternity, til all stars burn out and there is nothing but darkness left in the universe and then longer still until all of eternity ceases to be and there is just nothingness. All memories will cease to exist, all of reality is gone. Except one thing. One singular thing. A feeling. A sensation. This will continue to persist and you recognize it. This is the feeling of being killed in one shot."
28892,the game do be kind epic if you like roguelikes
28893,Its a  very good game but you might need to learn how to items work
28894,"I like this game a lot

I don't play it consistently but, I always enjoy it when I play."

28900,10/10 One of my favorite releases of the past decade.
28901,"“after 50 hours and around 100 conquest matches i can confidently say that the majority of negative reviews are overreactions. The bulk of bugs are visual with the rest being minor inconvenience like dying once or twice. although there is the occasional bug which may require a PC/game restart although, i have found that the frequency of these major bugs is similar to that of other fan favourite titles. All three modes are overall fun with hazard zone being surprisingly enjoyable. The only lacking content is the amount of sidearms (3) but the variety of all other weapon types and gadgets covers the majority of playstyles. Only additions i would like are a nearby medic menu when downed and crouch sprinting.”

28902,fun
28903,get the game it has spider-man
28904,THIS GAME SLAPS
28905,just spent 3 hours of my life on a run just to get one shot by a crab. would recommend.
28906,10 hours in(on a first day) and the game is just getting better and better. Every character is so unique and every run feels different. 10/10 would recommend
28907,"Just fun to play and we are getting more content
"
28908,fun
28909,P
28910,I have been officially diagnosed with a gambling addiction after playing this game. I now have to attend bi-weekly meetings or I go on severe gambling sprees.
28911,I think this is easily the best roguelike on the market. Every character is so meticulously designed to feel like it's an entirely different game. I do recommend playing in co-op but I've spent so much time in single that it's also pretty good.
28912,addicting and very fun with friends <3
28913,"Here's my first experience from someone who knew nothing about the game

After dying several times at the third stage on medium mode, I switched to easy and immediately found life 10x easier.

At one point everything was blowing up for reasons I don’t understand and I was starting to become scared of my own power. Bosses would die in seconds and I was left standing there bewildered and confused.

Then I went to through some wacky portal and got vaporised by an obelisk.

Thoughts so far: 10/10 would get obliterated by an obelisk again."
28914,It's fun in both single player and multiplayer. I really enjoy the Artifact of Command and curating whole runs.
28915,"Shoot, Punch?, SCRATCH?, Kill, Loot, NEED I SAY MORE?"
28916,Good game to get lost into with friends or even alone!
28917,"Absolute banger, lots of unlockables, great gameplay, easy to learn and hard to master, i love this game so much."
28918,"I love this game,. my friend jake has this game he like its too!"
28919,It's one of those where you learn to love the abuse. I'm still finding new items and challenges after 123 hours.
28920,I like gayme very fun adn many hours spent cheap too
28921,"ETHEREAL CHALLENGE: too hard the rng is bad for that in particular.
"
28922,"The only thing I don't get about this game, is that I have yet to find the rain, so it's not very risky.
9/10.
Don't recommend if you are looking for the board game RISK, by Hasbro."
28923,gud
28924,haha dont die lol
28925,"You have to become a space garbage katamari in order to become really powerful, while speedrunning your genocide quest and then murder or get murdered by an almost naked dude with a hammer.

28927,nicer dicer lemon splicer
28928,neat
28929,"The endless amount of playtime with different builds everytime, really allows you to see what a true roguelike is, which boss you get at the beginning what items you get from chest and bosses. The easter eggs and artifacts are something you actually want to look for. All around the game is very polished and the character diversity is amazing so you'll never go in feeling burnt out."
28930,"Great game 6/10 would play again

BUT 10/10 would play again with the best friends :D"

28942,No support for GNU/Linux.
28943,Bandit
28944,"Very good Co-Op Roguelike. Thoroughly enjoyable. Recommend a decent PC, though, as with mine this game had big issues from time to time, which made the huge chaos even more impossible to follow than it already is. That doesn't have to do anything with the game, though, the game is amazing. Would recommend waiting for a sale."
28945,My friend survival time 65mins and mine is 25mins
28946,"Worth every penny, great for single and multyplayer."
28947,One of the greatest games I've ever played. Kind of Rogue-Like genre. The Soundtrack is literally one of the best I've ever listened to. Big shoutout to Chris Christodoulou!
28948,risk of brain
28949,stupid clay pot spider idiot blowed me up
28950,i remember before i had this game i had no life and nobody who loves me. i still have no life and nobody who loves me but at least this game is good
28951,It is very challenging but also very fun.
28952,"I'm kind of enjoying it, but it ran out of steam for me... The mechanics are pretty darn slick, but the game is missing two big things for me: the ability to acquire a truly god-like game-breaking build, and pacing. The game slams on the breaks as soon as you enter the last level to fight the final boss and never picks back up. So here I am now, finally getting pretty good with one of the classes, and I just don't want to play another round because the possibility of an incredibly fun and exciting round just isn't there like it is for other rogue-lites (Hades, Nuclear Throne, FTL, Noita, just to name a few!). In all of those, the game is exciting the entire way through, never loses momentum, and there's always the possibility of a game-breaking build. Here, it's mediocrity all the way through. It feels like the devs for this game rushed it out too quickly, and that's a terrible shame because this game could have been so much better."
28953,incredibly fun game. i love trying to beat it with all the different characters. incredibly replayable

28969,"literally amazing if your one of those people who love high intensity survival wave type games, boy oh boy did you find yourself the game. The game features many different stages, items, bosses and entities, characters, secrets, and lots of achievements. This is a game that if you play with friends/family you are going to have a great time and have some good laughs, or your going to kill each other because your cousin activated the artifact of death, throws the game, kills you all, and you just want.... oh ya did I mention there's artifacts included. with these artifacts you can make the game harder then it was already from before. I'd give this game a solid 10/10"

Downsides.
- Lack of rain.
- WHY DO THE BIG LIZARDS HIT SO HARD WHEN THEY BONK YOU
- There are these little things called lesser wisps, now I don't know about you, but I HATE them.
- WHY ARE THERE SO MANY LESSER WISPS.
Upsides.
- Grapple hook lady with big punchy arms.
- Acidic crocodile gorilla.
- Man with shotgun who just squashed his enemies with a care package.
- I picked up a bazooka and now my bullets explode.
- Guy with dual wielding pistol kills boss by rolling around him.
- OP anime protagonist with a sword.
Final rating?
10/10

Look no further

29018,Gun go pew 10/10
29019,good
29020,Excellent game.  Don't look up any advice from anyone on youtube or other sources.  It is a lot of fun figuring this game out on your own.
29021,Spain without the S
29022,My computer starts to rumble when I get to higher stages therefore it gud game
29023,"Developers put so much work into this game, even released several free updates that could have been sold as DLC. Can't wait for the expansion. Enthralling gameplay on each run and incredibly fun item combinations that make you feel powerful."
29024,"I really enjoyed the gameplay of Risk of rain 2 with the 3d aspect, combat and all the hidden secret you can find and unlock. At the start of the game can be very difficult to understand how to play be in the end it's well worth it."
29025,Got the game 100% on ps4. Bought it again on steam. If that doesn't suggest it's a fun game then I don't know what will.
29026,The game has a cowboy now so I guess you could say its pretty cool.

"
29030,Fun game
29031,"ROR 1 was a 2D masterpiece, the 2 is a 3D one. 

A casual/hardcore experience with up to 4 (or more modded) people, with a frenetic combat and cool progression. You can play with full rng on items, or unlock artifacts that remove randomization or even make even your character randomize every game.

And even when you finish the game, mods expand the experience as no other game. With new characters well balanced (most of), stunning  new items e tons of quality of life.
Btw the mod manager of ROR 2, R2modman has the feature of ""exporting"" your modlist and mod configs as a code, so all your friends who don't know a thing about modding can just paste a code a play together."
29032,lit
29033,"Very fun with friends, needs more progression but overall veri nise"
29034,this is a great game and if you really get into it it may be easy at first but as you keep going it will get progressively harder until you cant play anymore and there is almost no limit to the difficulty and it just lasts until you are tired which makes it an amazing game because i can never get bored.
29035,good game.
29036,"bandit go pew, loader go punch"
29037,great
29038,play it or die
29039,"If there was a Risk Of Rain 3, I would definitely buy it.
"
29040,"Really fun, you can get extremely op and literally no anything"
29041,Constant levels of Fun Even a Bad run is still fun
29042,"I liked the first game, but this one didn't vibe with me at all."
29043,good game not gungeon
29044,"To be completely honest, the game isn't really for me. The mechanic of scaling difficulty makes gameplay stressful and unfun."
29045,very fun
29046,Great fun with the homies
29047,"Bought this game during early access, the amount of content they added throughout the years is a lot. Very fun and addictive rouge-like game. If its on sale, 100% worth buying no discussion."
29048,super
29049,"Great game I love playing it, and think more people should play it."
29050,Hard game.
29051,"Fast-paced action with co-op. 

And the music... is electric."
29052,"I highly recommend to play this game if you like Roguelike games. It's one of the best ones I've played, and I've played quite a bit of them, most of them being indies.

This one might not have ""a lot"" of enemies, ""a lot"" of worlds, but it just feels so good to play.

The atmosphere is superb, a lot of object combos, very distinct characters with very distinct skills.

There are some flaws, the biggest one being bosses do not make their attack obvious, so you might have to search how to dodge this or that. Another one is some bosses have insanely powerful attacks even at the first level, which is annoying since it's not about dodging but just running away, basically no skill required, it's just a loss of time.

Those flaws are small though, and the game has so many great things as mentioned before. Do not get overshadowed by those flaws, you have to try it and decide by yourself. I am fucking terrible at games, so it might just be that too, I am almost at IGN ""critics"" level."
29053,Haven't went as deep into this as other roguelikes but it is a blast to play with friends and challenging to unlock everything!
29054,Come and lose your mind with your friends !
29055,"Very fun and cant tell wahts happening after about 10 rounds
Enjoy with your friends"
29056,">kill thousands of the same enemy the same way
>one enemy gets closer than usual
>lose 3 hour long run
>enjoy every second
10/10 Game honestly, release it again so it's game awards material"
29057,cool
29058,not worth my money
29059,This game is amazing and captures what the first game wanted and much more! i love everything about this game.
29060,Has a VR conversion mod you can get and it's pretty awesome
29061,The Rain falls down upon my skin every time I land...So I risk it for the biscuit.. 10/10 would recommend. LET IT RAIN!!
29062,"This game is AWESOME. Lot's of interesting and unique ways to play and with the map randomization, no play through ever seems that same. Great to play with friends to test your skills."
29063,"A wonderful sequel to the first game. You will die. A lot. Love the music, love the game."
29064,Quite possibly the best game ever. seriously.
29065,"Holy shit this is a good game. I though I wouldn't like it as it was third person, but it fully fits the theme. Chris Christodoulou writes a banger score that accompanies the gameplay so well. Overall a great experience, would recommend to others :)"
29066,very good with friends
29067,"Good, incredibly good. One might even say exquisite."
29068,Certified yeah
29069,BIG FAT NUTS
29070,I never get tired of playing this game.
29071,I come back to play this more often than skyrim
29072,"One of the best games I've ever played

Worth full price

10/10"
29073,if you're seeing this review. BUY THIS GAME NOW
29074,"Really fun game, especially with friends! 
A 50 minute run feels like 10 minutes."
29075,GOOD SOUP best game ive played in a long time
29076,AMASING AWSOME PERFECT GAME YOU SHOULD PLAYYYYYYYYY PLS
29077,1
29078,"This game is straight fireeee

If you have seen reviews, watched others play, I highly recommend trying it out for yourself. Wait for a sale or buy at full price? In my opinion, it's worth the full asking price, but if you can get it on sale, absolutely do so.

====================================

-Graphics 4.5/5 [They  could have done a bit better with the environments, but that's about it.]

-Sound 4/5 [Explosions get a bit loud at times, and can easily overpower all other volume, this needs to be turned down]

-Music 10/5 [I can't believe how good the sound track to the game is.]

-Fun Factor replayability 5/5 [So many characters, so many different playstyles, so many bosses, so many secrets.]

Value 5/5 [There are mods, multiplayer, you can add characters and so on...]

====================================

Quite easily one of the best games I have ever played."

29104,"Fun Loot'N'Shoot style roguelike. Game is fast paced and fun on its own, and you can build the experience you want even moreso with a wonderful modding community at your back."
29105,"This game in particular really hits that g spot that others on the same genre can't, for me at least. I really enjoy the non-ending waves of enemies and the depth of the game. I recommend it to whoever is looking for something fun and new!"

That was a mistake
This game is fucking fantastic, I wish I would have played so long ago when I first saw it
I could play again and again, and I am not even to the hard/fun bits yet"

29129,It's dope yo.
29130,good
29131,This game is very epic
29132,yes
29133,"Game crashed 4 hours into a run I was just doing for laughs but I'm still pretty salty about that. Should definitely be some way to recover the run in that case but, oh well."
29134,endless fun. eternal sadness
29135,"The beginning of this game when you just start gives you so much freedom, you begin completing quests to get new items and rewards for your next run, every time you play the game you get a little further and it keeps compelling you to move forward. Though, nearing the end of the game it starts to get a little stale, when you have unlocked all of the items and the characters, there's not much you feel you can do, mods are a great solution to this but even they can get a little stale too. This game could have been a 5/5 but instead I'm going to have to agree that it is a
4/5 great game."
29136,fun and challenging even for casuals on the lowest difficulty.
29137,"Very fun game, great with friends. Each character is unique in their own ways giving different game-play and skills to play around with. The monsoon skins are nice. Long runs are challenging in a fun and exciting way. 10/10 would recommend."
29138,mmmm funny man with ukelele
29139,tf2 + the binding of issac = this fun madness
29140,Bullshit
29141,"Original, creative, great concept art, and extremely fun game to play especially with friends."
29142,"great game, highly recommend"
29143,"an absolutely amazing game that will suck you into it harder than a black hole and leave you wondering how you just spent 2 hours on a single run. and it's getting a dlc soonish (at the time of writing this). which i already like because it has secret messages in morse code and stuff on the store page.

3 incredibly painful achievements/10 (mercenary, who hurt you)"
29144,"I haven't noticed any rain yet, I guess the risk is pretty low."
29145,items go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
29146,Fun but grindy
29147,rogue like perfection
29148,"Game is good. Similar to FortNite, except you cannot build."
29149,I couldn't tell ya
29150,"mmm

yep"
29151,very cool :)
29152,"Great game.

EDIT: Year later. Still good game."
29153,"""so, are we in some kind of risk of rain(2)?"""
29154,good
29155,"Risk of rain 2 is one of those games that even after fully completing I still find myself returning to it. 

The game is visually exciting and the sound design is good but it's the core gameplay that I always return for, the ability to loop and play for ages if you want to is amazing and with a wide cast of characters it's very rare to get bored. 

With thousands of different playstyles made possible by the large roster of characters and items this game is enjoyable for nearly everyone. An example of one of my favorite builds in this game is an infinite missle build which allows you to just infinity fire off missles that auto target enemies and proc all your other items and abilities.

Now one issue that I find my self and friends getting annoyed at with the game is joining in progress games or saving games in general. Unless you play the game modded you cannot save your runs and that can be frustrating when you have a good run going and if you want a friend to join a mutiplayer game you have to end your run and start a new one for them to load in.

Now there is some other smaller issues but overall this game is truly amazing and the less you know about it going into it the more fun and fascinating it is. Would reccomend to anyone at any price but get ready to spend hours playing this without even noticing!
(As seen by the amount of hours I've played) 



(I hope this review made sense I typed it on mobile)"
29156,"This game BEGS you to break it, to bring it to its knees and to actually crash it. I love it and I'm eager to see what the next updates bring to this game."
29157,"any game that support mods is in my top priority 
even with unbalanced mods.. you will be killed"
29158,its a good game for aim practice and the loot stats are what really make it fun
29159,"GOOD
"
29160,"Game is both simple and surprisingly deep.  You can romp around and shoot at monsters without much thought in colorful, interesting environments,  or you can lose your mind try to perfect the perfect build for a character while dealing with increasingly brutal enemies."
29161,kinda coo
29162,"I hate Rougelikes and I love this. Beautiful visuals, wonderful soundtrack, and a refreshing lack of developer sadism."
29163,left my daughter for it
29164,"Overall it is a good game, not great, but good. Gameplay and mechanics of the game are good. I like the concept. Here is my problems with the game:

1. The first time you play it, they just drop you into the thick of it without anything to go off of. As someone who didn't play the first installment and knew nothing coming into playing the second, felt like they just dropped me into the middle of something and told me to figure it out.

2. The replayability of this game stems from making better runs and finding secrets in levels. I've spent  over 50 hours playing the game with maybe 4 survivor unlocks and no artifacts. I feel like each run gets me nowhere and doesn't make me much better at the game if at all. There is no reward after a run unless you get really far. There is no currency you can earn each run to save up for anything. You can spend 30+ minutes on a run and almost always have nothing to show for it after.

My experience is based off of playing it single player. I have played only one online game and there was just massive connection issues and wasn't fun."

Cons:

> 4 or more hr runs might make your computer combust randomly"
29182,"I was skeptical about how well this game would scale to 3D from a 2D game.
Let me say the devs really outdid themselves when they made this.
It is just as fun to play the old characters from ROR1 as it is to play the new characters."
29183,goooooood

29189,It pretty good yo!
29190,"100% chance of precipitation can't really be called a risk, game should be called its going to rain."

[b]-[/b] Three previous issues wont get fixed unless you want to pay for the upcomming DLC.
[b]-[/b] DLC to the game this lacking in content so early after 1.0 is a crime.
I still enjoyed this game but be aware it sucks."
29192,The most entertaining game I have witnessed so far.
29193,hell yeah brother
29194,"Just barely was able to refund this game. Here are the problems:
- Not really much direction
    - Sure you are supposed to learn the game through trial and error but there isn't even a tutorial for controls
    - The text is too tiny and too spread out
- Gameplay
    - Gameplay was fine and I would have liked it if it wasn't for the boring items and characters.
    - Items are just little stat boosts that stack. Yay. Why no items that have a major impact (like the feather which is practically essential for a winning run).
    - The characters all feel super underpowered. 
    - The most you can do to survive is just run and jump around but even then you will get sniped by a (s)hitscan enemy.
- Enemies:
    - The enemies are just the worst. You have easy to dodge enemies that can only melee, ones who have hitscan lasers, and ones who can just one tap you if you stand still for even a second.

29198,Is good
29199,An incredible game with an equally incredible soundtrack. We need more games like this where payers are allowed to obtain endless amounts of items until your character becomes uncontrollable. Looking forward to playing this game again and again with all the unique characters and infinite item combinations that make it the most re-playable game of all time. This is a must play and you owe yourself to try this masterpiece.

29246,"Risk of Rain 2 is a 3D roguelike third person shooter, based around a difficulty timer ushering players through successive worlds while acquiring items to advance their combat abilities.  The sequel acts as an excellent followup to the original,  having made the leap from 2D to 3D beautifully, and coming out better for it.  

Players should anticipate high paced gameplay, with a difficult learning curve, but intentionally exploitable difficulty.  Depending on the settings you utilize, you can modulate to your current skill level.  Expect standard roguelike shenanigans, with two hit KOs, and RNG deciding you just aren't going to have a good time.  

When a build clicks, the game's difficulty inverts on itself in that perfect way that leaves you feeling like a living god as you smite the enemies that would ruin you any other run.  

And the soundtrack is great."

29287,"Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The game allows for cross-platform play, first released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A separate VR version of the game, Among Us VR, will be released for Meta Quest 2, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR, developed by Schell Games.

Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of ""The Skeld"" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper ""MIRA HQ"", the ""Polus"" planetary station, and ""The Airship"" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does not alter their appearance. The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that is not resolved in time.

29297,"Probably the best roguelike I've ever played. Tons of fun alone and with friends. Seemingly infinite replay-ability. Great soundtrack. Great visual style. Lots of different ways to play with character variety, multiple abilities per character, difficulty settings and run-modifiers. Couldn't recommend this game enough. For this price, it's an absolute steal. Developers still support the game with content updates and there's a paid expansion coming adding more bosses, items, zones, playable characters, etc. A must have for fans of roguelikes!"
29298,orbital strike fun
29299,Now I can see why people like this game so much. Not quite what I expected but very fun and addictive. Very hard at first and has a steep learning curve. Another game that makes me forget what time it is but not quite enough to become one of my top favorites of all time (definitely honorable mention worthy). I can tell I have only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer and even though the levels are a combo of handmade and randomly generated the playthroughs are different enough to not make me get bored easily. Thankfully each new character brings a whole new dynamic to the game or this would've been boring after 100-200 hours. Luckily there are many characters and each so far are like a whole new game in themselves. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade style 3rd person combat and permadeath games. Honestly anyone who likes a bit of an adrenaline ride with no breaks (unless you pause) will probably love this game and it could easily become an instant favorite. The most annoying thing I can think about it is that there is very little explanation of the underlying bits and although it's probably on purpose it forces the person to either look up a guide and risk major spoilers or play completely blind (which I would recommend for any game like this). Hope you like it as much as I do and I will try to update the review once I get to 1k hours if I do (which I bet will happen in a year or more).

29306,Risking my pain to play the game
29307,"The best rogue like game of all time

Positive:

Gameplay 10/10: As simple as shooting, slashing, or bashing a variety of aliens that get gradually stronger and more numerous with time. Also, with unlockable characters, loadouts, skins, and endless stages, this game has a ton of replayability. 

graphics 10/10: This game has such a unique artstyle where it isn't throwing the good textures in your face like most games do.

Soundtrack 10/10: This games music might be more hardcore than Doom's, and this is DOOM we are talking about here. It is a great mix of epic and melancholy that just sort of blasts in the background while you commit genocide.

Humor 9/10: It may be few and far inbetween, but this game does have some pretty funny bits. especially some of the logbook entries.

Negative:

some of the sound effects can get a bit repetative. That is literally the only complaint.

Other notes:

Before the anniversary update, Mithrix was way too easy to exploit.

I don't care what kind of giant lizard-lava-bug-robot monsters this game wants to throw at me, the lesser wisps are the most annoying little pests in this entire game (This was written before sotv was released... did I just predict the blind pests???)

The one thing this game is missing is voice acting. that would be epic.

All of the logbook entries are great. ALL OF THEM. They range from goofy references to poetic lore paragraphs. The shurikens are canonically shipped to ""Sensai Dareth's Mojo dojo"". Wait... isn't that the guy from ninjago?? NINJAGO IS CANON IN ROR2 LETS GO!1!!!!!1!1!

Final score: 10/10
And so he left... never knowing what the mercenary's loadout was"
29308,gud gaim

29329,I love this game with a passion
29330,"This game is my favorite rougelike, it has that brutally difficult feeling that comes with the genre but allows you to really go ham if you're good enough. In most rougelikes you can just kinda die due to bad luck, but this game gives you more than enough ways to build a kit the way you want it, without just letting you choose what items. The great thing about it is you can just get as many upgrades as possible, there is no inventory space, and no stack limit, but it's not as easy as just get everything you see because some upgrades are pretty much useless to some characters, and the lunar items give you an insane, game changing buff that changes a playstyle completely, but they are the only type of item that has a downside, so they are a really big risk (pun intended). and to top it off it has multiplayer, so get the game already."

29337,"This game deserves every praise it has and more. My first roguelite/like was Dead Cells. While I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I played it sporadically, jumping in for a run every now and then between other games. With RoR2, it took over and I ended up completing it in a few days. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun, it makes you want to have one more run after the last. Every character I've unlocked so far has been unique and none have felt underwhelming, although it does take a run or two to adjust your playstyle. Art, music, enemy design, levels, and any other metric you can think of to judge the game is top notch. 

And that final boss..."
29338,This game is very fun and different each run.  I think they did a good job translating from 2d to 3d.
29339,❤️
29340,"I die in one hit to everything. (Damn lemurians)
11/10 would die 100s more times."
29341,there is no Rain in this game...
29342,Very fun and surprisingly smooth. Lots of unlockables and challanges. Runs are usually pretty fast but there is a a lot of variety if you go for different builds. Chains of aoe on hit/crit/kill effects are exciting.
29343,perfect game
29344,Its the goods
29345,these are pretty epic lizards oh shit im dead
29346,a very great bungus sim
29347,Disappointing lack of rain.
29348,"Addicting, and rewarding gameplay. Honestly the pinnacle of 3D rogue-likes, just fantastic in every way and very fun with friends. Devs are also very transparent. If i would say anything negative, its that after you unlock everything and beat the majority of the game, it can become repetitive and boring. You'll find yourself waiting for the next update/dlc. Still fun to return to every once and a while, would fully suggest trying it out!"
29349,"I risked rain.

Then I risked rain again.

I had a risk of rain twice.

13/10 procedural drops
"
29350,Its  fun
29351,"Expect to stay dry because there is no risk of rain in this game.
0/10 terrible forecast"
29352,"Well I refunded this game once! Back at the time when there wasn't much in there and almost all you had to do was running and shooting and picking up some occasional random drops that happened to be mostly useless! Don't want to be rude, but that's how it looked like about 2 years ago. So i decided to pick it up again and give it another go, but this time I stayed! Game not only kept calling to me ""you need to break through all the way to the end"", but also the taste of doing achievements took me all the way into another level.
Got to admit tho, when I picked it up I thought it was a procedural generation based dungeon crawler, but I was a bit put off when I reached the border of a zone and died to hazard! But the concept is still neat in my opinion and deserves attention."
29353,Este juego es espectacular
29354,Amazing Game its so much fun!!! I recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of fun with friends but also a proper Challenge :D
29355,"Good game with decent replayability. I played from release before the last boss was added pretty much though, so some people might find it less exciting playing through again after they have defeated the boss and ""beaten"" the game. It has some secrets in out of the way spaces and achievements unlock real items or features in game runs, and I currently stand at 109/112 achievements. I liked it."
29356,I am a total whore for roguelike games
29357,"its fun, not really repetitive either, and there is lore if thats something youre interested in"

Anyway, I am a huge fan of space related things and if you are as well I'm sure you'll take a liking to this game. I have only played for a relatively small amount of time but I can already tell that I'll be spending a lot of time in the world of Risk of Rain 2 so take a chance on this game if it looks interesting to you, you won't regret spending a few bucks on it :)"

Amazing graphics, captivating gameplay, interesting characters (Can't wait to unlock them all), controls are responsive and crisp. Super happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that loves both FPS and rogue-likes because this is the perfect marriage of these two!"
29386,fun game
29387,it good

29389,very poggers
29390,"I love Acrid, he's the cutest!"
29391,funny
29392,"This game is so fun and will suck you in. Once you complete a good run, there is no going back."
29393,"For a low price this game is fun, I play this game often and i have a lot of fun, i would recomend having friends play with you but you can play with randoms too would work fine, the rush of having to race the clock and the mecanics of the movement and art style is really nice. The game is about having to beat a game quickly or the monsters would get to hard. For a low price and exciting game play i would recommend this game to people who love to play faster pace games."
29394,fun game very much reccomend
29395,I developed a mental illness
29396,"I honestly don't understand why this game is so raved about. I keep trying it, but quickly put it back down. It's not fun. I like a challenge, but if not fun, then what's the point? Per the reviews, playing this with others seems to be a win. I played solo. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know. I enjoyed Isaac, Hades, Deal Cells, etc., but this game, no."

This is a good one"
29410,"I liked it so much I bought it twice, and then bought it for everyone I know."
29411,"Oh, how I wish Artificer felt fun to play"
29412,I've played it a few times
29413,who the fuck plays commando or bandit!!???
29414,This is the purest electronic translation of crack cocaine as a video game.
29415,shoot monster and get item
29416,"This is an AWESOME game. It has a ton of replayability, where every run is different. There are so many things to unlock and challenges to complete, so I'm always coming back for more. It's also extremely satisfying when I become super overpowered, so that I'm practically instantly killing enemies. Even when I 100% this game, I'll still be playing it. Also, the DLC is definitely worth the money, in my opinion. With the new characters, items, and enemies, I love this game even more."
29417,Good game. Solo or with 1-3 mates. Buy at any price.
29418,I played this game on ps4 for over 100 hours and bought it again on steam so i could play with mods and my friends. The only issue I have with the game is that you can't exit out and save your game mid run but there are mods that do that so not a big deal. Really interested in what the dlc will add to the game.
29419,absolutely positively awesome
29420,it is yes
29421,good soup
29422,Super great game
29423,Be careful of the rain.
29424,good action roguelite
29425,"Very Fun, shit tonnes of content. Gonna end up spending too much time than I should with this one."
29426,"Amazing gameplay. The lore is interesting if you want to read it, but it's not forced on you. Your sole requirement is to blast through as many levels as possible until you die or your computer does!"
29427,"At first you won't understand many things, then you won't understand them but they are really fun. 
The game looks very cool and is easy to figure out how to play it.
It's fun to just go around and do thousands of damage or be an extremely tanky dude that heals off damage.

Pretty good game, hits the spot to play it chill and is a roguelite, basically never-ending fun."
29428,"i didnt think they could top risk of rain 1

29453,😃👍
29454,Risk of Rain 2 is a game I would recommend to any rougelite fan. With in-game difficulty modifications and the ability to use external software for additional mods makes this game highly replayable. It is best played with friends while you're trying weird builds.
29455,Always fun!
29456,I play this game too much.  I got my brother and my best friend to start playing it and they both love it.
29457,"best game, so fun"
29458,good yes
29459,"Indie or not RoR2 is the true definition of successor to already fascinating first release. 
RoR2 is fun, simple yet  immersive, ever evolving that could challenge any player out there.
Customisation is not its strong point if you are here to easy grind skins and new characters but the pure joy comes when you spend many hours just to unlock one of them.
Truly outstanding game that is a must have no matter what you like to play!"

29469,This is honestly one of the best games I’ve ever played. The music is incredible #1. It’s just a perfectly flowing dance that’s fun and challenging at the same time. Mad it took me so long to play it.

29474,"Its reallllly good, just play it"
29475,"This game is without a doubt a MUST purchase, not only for the replayability, but also EVERYTHING ELSE. Bonus points for being one of the few games that praise mods, allowing for more content that feels oh to close to a new expansion. PaladinMod, Starstorm2, and Enforcer are great examples."
29476,game good
29477,Very good game
29478,"very fun. more content than the first, but still not as good. best seen as a seperate game in the same universe, rather than a direct sequel"

29480,I enjoy the game
29481,"fuckin' hate crabs crabs fuckin fuck suck

29483,One of the best games I've ever played. So many ways to keep it fresh every time you play. So much to discover and master. Gorgeous atmosphere. A really really good game for multiplayer. Highly recommend for literally anyone.
29484,The game can be a fun time sink when you're looking to mindlessly murder or be murdered.
29485,"Great to play solo and even better with a team. Forces you to have to work together if you wish to survive. Tons of fun and gets super fast and wild, when you're in the thick of it."
29486,Easy way to kill an hour
29487,I hate the GOD DAMN VOID REAVERS
29488,Mods give Huntress big butt :)
29489,Im addicted to this game. The gameplay is just...its too fun.
29490,mithrix is stuck on the moon lol
29491,I can not for the life of me describe the absolute bliss that I felt the first time I beat the game. I will remember that moment for the rest of my life. I will recommend this game the any and everyone.

29509,As good as they say.
29510,"Would you rather play a super hero game and feel like your playing a generic action game?  Or play this action game and feel like a super hero?  Amazing game, infinite replay, fun alone or with friends, good price.  10/10 God tier game."

The game has so many characters and items that interact with each other, every run is a new experience.
I bought the game in 2019 when it got released into early access but never started the game till february 2021 when i saw a old Uberdanger video and i gave the game a try with a friend, since then i play this game every now and then.

29528,Help.... it's Raining wrecking balls and i'm still rushing for chests.
29529,"I was very cautious about buying this game because the predecessor was a pixel graphic 2d game and it was amazing.
Since many titles try to innovate by changing graphics and fail miserably, I was not inclined in buying RoR2.

Now I can't believe it took me so long to try it.

It's a great game. Yes, it is different in some ways from the first but many things remain the same and being 3d might not please everyone. 

It keeps me playing for many hours because of:
1. Lot of action, constantly.
2. There is always some new thing to discover.
3. All characters are interesting to play in their own way.

I hope they do an expansion or update or DLC or anything, adding some more alternate game modes and/or bosses and/or characters.
The game is really good they can add more on top of it and still be great."

29577,"This game, and the previous on by extension are two of my favorite games that I have ever played. They are infinitely re-playable, and with the introduction in Risk of Rain 2 of smooth multiplayer and artifacts even more so. My friends and I will try out new builds and funny combos with each new run. The developers seem to have a deep well of love for this series, it shows in the frequent updates and additions. I'm looking forward to supporting them with the release of their first paid DLC. The amount of fun my friends and I have gotten from this game far outweighs the cost originally paid for it. Keep up the good work Devs!"

29606,"This game is one of my absolute favorites, and is definitely my favorite Roguelite (or is it Roguelike?). There is so much to praise with this game; gameplay, replayability, challenge, soundtrack, visual style, et cetera.

I often play this game just to listen to the OST it is so good. The composer, Chris Christodoulou created what I consider a masterpiece OST. Combined with the game's visual style, Risk of Rain 2 can be a very relaxing and chill game to play, depending on what difficulty and Artifacts you play. 

Artifacts are game modifiers that you can permanently unlock by doing a certain challenge in a run, that can greatly differ gameplay. For example, there is one Artifact that makes you deal 500% more damage, but your health is capped at 10%. That Artifact is quite tame compared to some others, like one that makes your character change from level to level. With the game's three difficulties and plethora of Artifacts, and alternate gamemodes, the game can be tailored to your desired difficulty, and makes almost limitless replayability. 

All of these points are just about the game itself, but then there is also co-op multiplayer. You can play with random people online, though I never have, if that's your speed. You can also play with some buddies and bond over this amazing game. It can be fun to compete with friends over who gets the better build, who gets the best score in the end, or even who can afford that chest first to gain another item.

This game is worth every penny, and then some!"
29607,"Great game. Haven't finished it yet, but it's just everything I want from a game like this. Every run will give you the opportunity to become overpowered in some way. It's Coop and moddable with friends. Great game."
29608,Super fun game especially when you just want something to do because you're bored. Can be pretty difficult first starting out though even more so when you don't know what you're doing.
29609,sooooooooo much fun!
29610,Shits bussin
29611,And his games were electric
29612,BUNGUS
29613,Mushrooms.
29614,Fun getting killed by balloons
29615,fun game with friends. (review for Steam awards 2021  badge)
29616,11/10 better with friends
29617,endless playability i've played this until 7 am on several occasions 5/7
29618,spend 4 hours and die by a mushroom thats on fire 20/10
29619,yes
29620,"really sucks you in, looking forward to the DLC"
29621,"very nice, i like"
29622,commando
29623,"I only bought this game for the VRmod. Turned out the modded characters for the standard game is far more intriguing. I am having tons of fun with the Dragon Ball Z characters and Gurren Lagann mod.
Even the dev must have never expected they accidentally made the only Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann fighting game in the market.

Respect to both the modding community and the dev of this game!"
29624,"I originally didn't see myself liking this game as I wasn't interested in typical rogue-likes where you die over and over with randomized levels and all that jazz. However, after playing it and experiencing it firsthand, my mind has totally been changed. Risk of Rain 2 has super satisfying controls, items, levels, music, they really went the distance. I can't really even point at a part of the game I don't like. Sometimes things happen in game that feel unfair, but that's just the experience and it still manages to feel fun even when insane things happen.

200 hours later, it's in the top 3 games I've ever played and I'm even considering doing cosplay for characters in the game. Even if you're the kind of person who dislikes this type of game, get Risk of Rain 2 anyway, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
29625,fun
29626,"Risk of Rain 2 is probably one of the most enjoyable and re-playable shooters on the market today. Each character feels incredibly unique and no two characters play exactly the same, making it almost impossible to not find a character you like.  and don't even get me started on the beautiful environments, great graphics and the truly phenomenal soundtrack to make sitting there playing it over and over again until your brain is just a puddle of rain water just that much more fun. and once you grab some friends (or just find a nice public server) and jump into multiplayer it adds a whole new feel to the gameplay, synergy and teamwork goes a long way especially when on the higher difficulties. all in all I'd give it a solid 10/10 since I haven't encountered any bugs and all the gameplay feels polished and crisp."
29627,yea
29628,"Good for killing time and making sure that you have no friend's after, taking items from them."
29629,"steep learning curve, very satisfying"
29630,this game is extremely fun but also hard
29631,give me the steam badge plz ok thanks
29632,this game is fucking stupid.
29633,"fucking banger of a game, if you like runnin and you like gunnin, and you like becoming so overpowered that you could destroy the sun, you should try risk of rain 2"
29634,Fun
29635,It's Fun
29636,"Such a fun game would recommend, very skill based and focus based. time flies while playing it."
29637,Yes
29638,God damn this game is engaging. 11 hour long run and wanna play again 6 hours later type of engaging.
29639,Games a total time sink. 100/10 would recommend
29640,"This game truly stands a cut above the rest. There's nothing quite like it that evokes the same feeling of exhilarating gameplay while also keeping you glued to your chair for hours. The gameplay is highly addictive, and although it can be stressful, it is very easy to slip into ""the zone"" and spend 3 hours in the blink of an eye. The soundtrack is simply phenomenal and worth the price of admission alone. The technical feat of getting a game like this to perform well even in the later stages when the screen is littered with mobs is pretty incredible. The developers should be very proud of this gem."
29641,"i can't believe they added doomfist from overwatch, why did they rename him to loader"

29643,Really enjoy smoking a bit and listening to music while I play this game. Engaging but you don't need all your brain cells to understand what is going on.
29644,gud
29645,lot of fun vanilla or modded. even better with friends
29646,The best roguelike I've ever played. It good.
29647,I loved Risk of Rain and this is just as good if not better. 10/10
29648,They were right. It is awesome.
29649,;)
29650,Game is one of the best I've played in a long time and somehow when I run out of games I get sucked back in. if you haven't played loader yet I highly recommend him.
29651,good
29652,"It's a lot of fun to do a run with friends, but it can become a little shallow after you've played it for a while. Even so, I highly recommend it."
29653,lizard
29654,"This game is soooooo good. Its one of the only games I can enjoy playing solo, though its even funner with friends! Its like the Lo-fi of games in a way for me, if that makes any sense."
29655,"Top tier game, no cap one of the best games I have played"
29656,Great game
29657,"Fun for quite some time, best with friends"
29658,Great game
29659,"Amazing game, it was insanely fun to play and unlock characters and all the characters were fun to play and mess around with."
29660,"A fantastic game, one of the best I've ever played, with almost infinite replay value. And if you ever get tired of it, there's also some modding capability."
29661,I like the anime boobies
29662,"10/10 highly recommend 
would get insta-killed by green beetle again
(if you havent played this game you do not know the fear those green beatles strike into my heart when i see them. your just like ""oh its only a elite beetle, it cant be that hard."" but you would be very wrong)
the soundtrack is amazing
gameplay loop is great and i will find myself spending hours playing it
tons of items and characters to unlock
each character has alternate abilities you can unlock and each challenge to unlock them is well thought out and tricky to unlock but once you do the all the time you spent feels totally worth it as you test out the fun new ability
tons of levels and everytime the chests and teleporters are in different places
multiplayer works great
every run is different
but best feature of all: NO LOADING SCREENS!!!! (except when you open the game)
I highly recommend you buy this game, i have already beaten it multiple times and i still enjoy coming back for another run to try to unlock the things i haven't unlocked yet
hopoo did an amazing job on this game (i still cant believe they went from 2d roguelite platformer to 3d third person shooter with amazing enviroments)."
29663,"Watched some guy try to roll a pot on a button for more than 30 minutes and failed, decided to get the game. 10/10"
29664,"phenomenal shooter, and phenomenal rogue lite. seriously much deeper than anticipated. and great with a group of friends."
29665,"Amazing, I've sunk a couple hours into it, and it ngl, it loses its flavour after a bit, but when it comes back and hits. It HITS."
29666,"So much fun, especially with friends!"
29667,fun
29668,"I like the risk of rain
"
29669,The sequel is just as good as the original and even better with friends.
29670,reminds me of muck
29671,This game is amazing and the soundtrack is fantastic.
29672,"solo or MP, replayable, set you challenge, always fun, if too easy try to rush final boss with double enemies artifact xD"
29673,This game is a Great rouge like that has you constantly learning how to get better 10/10 would recommend
29674,Great game with tons of action. Well implemented roguelike mechanics.
29675,has 1 or 2 rough edges but is overall one of the best rogue likes out there
29676,yes

29678,gamer gamer
29679,real good loved this game from the moment it came out
29680,"Amazing roguelike, pretty hard though. Tons of replayability and stuff to do. Runs can be super long, like several hours. Highly recommend getting it

Also really good soundtrack

DLC is awesome"
29681,i love visual pollution
29682,"Played through RoR 1 over and over and over...

And now I'm playing through this one.
It's really that good"
29683,"Loved the first Risk of Rain, and loved this one just as much, always great to play with friends or alone, especially when you just want to absolutely destroy everything in your path."
29684,is fun
29685,when you
29686,"Isreal and women are awesome, especially fat women cuddly and snuggly more cushion"
29687,One of many games I can pound several hours into and still enjoy every moment. Rogue-likes such as these truly bring the fun and I genuinely recommend this game to anyone looking for a game that is made to be broken.
29688,"Meh.





























IM NEVER GOING TO STOP PLAYING ROR2 THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME"
29689,"You ever been asked the question “which game could you play the rest of your life without getting bored?” Well, this is that game, at least for me. This game’s constant cycle of fear, struggle, overcoming odds and death always keeps me engaged. Gameplay is fast paced with constant engagement between searching and fighting. The items you get can make or break a run and you are always trying to balance your time buying and fighting. I wasn’t feeling the music at first, but over time it has grown on me, especially the Sky Meadows theme. I highly reccomend playing this on a call with friends. The absolute chaos that erupts from this game’s multiplayer is unlike anything I have ever experienced. At the time of writing the first DLC has been announced but not released, and it shows so much promise for the future. I will look forward to trying it out once it comes out. Thank you Hopoo for creating this, and please continue to support this indescribable experience."
29690,"sick game, easy to just sink hours into with tunes on or a pod"
29691,this is my go to game
29692,one of the best games i've ever played
29693,yes
29694,"If you want to be stuck to a game for 2 and a half hours on a single run reaching near omnipotence, and make yourself seem so powerful that god looks like your bitch. I'd give this game a try."
29695,"Fun game, no rain and lots of pain. 11/10"
29696,"Hours of fun running and gunning as a variety of classes to fit any playstyle. Unique items that change every run to feel like a different game. A learning curve that allows casual play and high end challenge alike. And still releasing new content. Truly one of, if not THE, best modern transitional sequels from 2d to 3d."
29697,BEST ROGUE LIKE GAME I HAVE PLAYED
29698,huntress jsut aimbot lmao
29699,"I really enjoyed this game.
Then I reached Commencement.

Masterpiece."
29700,Deadbolt +1
29701,Based.
29702,"Excellent game, can be pretty hard at times, but not unfair. This makes the game even more rewarding, when you finally get that god-run."
29703,hard but fun would probably play again.
29704,"its pretty good, would die to some bullcrap on stage 19 right before getting the achievements I came in for again"
29705,yes
29706,this shit good tho
29707,There is a high probability of a downpour
29708,gud
29709,"amazing game
the only game i can play alone for hours"
29710,"Picked the game up last night because friends said it was good, and played 4 hours straight before realizing it was 3am. Good game, a must buy for BoI players or just lovers of Chaos."
29711,haha
29712,yup
29713,I mean its excellent! Better even with friends
29714,"Este es uno de los juegos que TIENES que jugar con amigos, mata los enemigos, adquiere oro y compra artefactos para avanzar en el juego. Una vez elimines el boss final de esta etapa, vas a otra como si fuera un tower defense game pero entre amigos, mientras más artefactos tengas mejor. Cada personaje es único y diferente. A must have for sure!"
29715,one of the main reasons you should buy risk of rain 2 is the amount of fun content that is packed in this game. compare to other rouge-like games risk of rain 2 is always superior. i really recommend buying risk of rain 2 its a really good game
29716,fun game
29717,Being selfish never felt so good before. Get movement speed items first so you can snatch your teammates' equipment even faster.
29718,God I wanna punch Mitrix in the face.
29719,Bungus out of 10. Would recommend.
29720,Stupid game running around with no point in mind. Constantly have to toggle sprint....what is the point of this? Either make it hold to sprint or a real toggle  on / off for sprint.  Hard to be a fast paced game when there is no clear objective just pedantically shooting .... come on...
29721,My 47 hours have been spent finding enough crowbar to one shot every living being possible. 10/10 good fun.
29722,Noice
29723,this game is sicc. that is all
29724,"Very good roguelite in 3D, there is not many good ones of this kind. And pretty smooth one: it's just comfortable to play. And yes, RoR2 still is a way better to play with friends than in solo."
29725,yes
29726,This game is fun :D
29727,I love this game. I think it should win the award because the fact is that they continue to make this game more and more fun with more expansive additions even after all this time.
29728,"Very fun game, especially if you have friends to play it with."
29729,fine you force me
29730,"super solid game with friends
go on
pick it up"
29731,"A friend bought it for me, It's definitely worth it, even if you pay for it. There is a lot of mod support, and it's always better with friends."
29732,UNIQUE STYLE INSANE SOUNDTRACK POLY KALA MECHANICS
29733,you may need a bigger ukulele is fun game better when joking with friends but still as fun alone
29734,Pog game
29735,amazing
29736,it gud
29737,"Quite good / fun game.
You can play the game in your own pace. You can rush and try to be as fast as possible or you can take it slow and try to get strong enough to survive through the hell of monsters thats going to come later on. (Pro tipp: If you go slow use the artifact of sacrifice)"
29738,very fun to play with friends and by yourself
29739,"10/10 Very gud, would die to Brass Contraptions again."
29740,Solid fun.  10/10
29741,Good game.
29742,Doesn't rain at all
29743,10/10  got a run so powerful  after 2 hours i had 3 fps and got 1 shotted
29744,I like killing things in mass quantity yes I can be trusted with guns
29745,"Incredible game, continued development with large updates and DLC coming up. Tons of fun, especially when played with friends."
29746,"I don't have any regret spend on this game. Absolutely, AWESOME! Just take my money! *Crying in happiness* T0T"
29747,yes
29748,I ONLY PLAY LOADER. I ONLY PUNCH THINGS. RANGED ATTACKS NOT NECESSARY. 10/10 GREAT ONE PUNCH MAN SIMULATOR.
29749,"If you liked Risk of Rain, getting Risk of Rain 2 should be a no-brainer. This is just more Risk of Rain for us to enjoy, polishing some details that were present on the first one, like not having to scour the entire map looking for the remaining enemies in order to proceed to the next stage, for example.

If you haven't played the original, this is a solo/coop rogue-lite arena kind of game, where you play as one of the available Survivors, each one with their own set of abilities, going from stage to stage defeating enemies to earn money in order to buy items that provide boosts and additional bonuses to your Survivor. The game works around time: as time passes, the enemies become stronger. The longer you play, the more fierce your enemies, and hopefully you, will be.

There's a lot to collect, including Survivors, Monster Logs, Stages' lore, items and artifacts, giving the game a lot of replayability. 

And of course, a soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou is always a blessing.

I will always recommend this game to anyone who asks me, and if you can gather up some friends to play it with, that's just an assured good time."
29750,"Got this game as a gift and wowee this game is blastin, slashin, explorin, fun! Goo gosh golly! I thought I didn't care for roguelike games. I mean I tried Hades and I thought it was cool and I appreciate the story tellin but by Gluteus Maximus Morales! Dis game gud. And it ain't in early access either? Damn so it's a finished product? Ureka!"
29751,Most addictive rogue-lite I have ever played. After already playing 200+ hours on PS4 I bought it a second time on PC. Good Enough to buy more than once!
29752,"10/10 game, super fun. I've sunk hundred of hours."
29753,Fun game to play with friends especially when you're into those survival games
29754,"Good game, buy it NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"
29755,good
29756,awesome game!
29757,Good game.
29758,Gud
29759,its kinda good i guess
29760,"this game makes you feel like a superhero, the fluid movement and slick animation makes every move you make so rewarding. the beautiful environment and colorful monster enemies are what gives this game it's realistic feeling that sucks you inside the screen. for more casual players you can always play on drizzle AKA the easy difficulty, for more advanced players Rainstorm or Monsoon are the way to go. every single character can be very fun and very powerful if played correctly, just don't pick commando (he sucks). overall Risk Of Rain 2 is one of the best Action Roguelite games out there, you should definitely give it a try, I'm sure you'll have a blast. 9/10. 
Thank You For Reading :)"
29761,a great game with devs that really care about the community
29762,fery naiece
29763,100% it you coward!
29764,Love it when u do a 3+ hrs run only to be killed by some Bronzong looking MF-er.
29765,10/10
29766,i suck at this game
29767,YES
29768,
29769,I have finally achieved my dream of being obliterated from reality
29770,Shrine is a total robber!
29771,Good game
29772,Buy it.
29773,"Gets hard but extremely fun, can play with friends and gets chaotic af"
29774,"This game is a long term investment with your time and money. Your health and social life will suffer cause of it. Can you handle the pain?! and the sorrow that comes after~

By the time you have all the achievements done....the world around you will be different. Everyone you once knew are no longer alive. it is only you at the computer...alone. You'll look at your hands....and see how dirty and broken they are. You'll get up from the crusty chair and look into the mirror. The only thing you'll witness is how old and ashy your skin has become. Then you'll walk over to the window and only see desolation. Where has the time gone? What have you become~"
29775,just play and see for yourself
29776,"how do I only have 98 hours 
I open this game and my whole day is gone"
29777,"mbunk bunk bunk
mmmmbunk bunk bunk"
29778,this is one of my favourite of all time i have put a lot more hours on switch. it is a very fun game. would recommend.
29779,infintely replayable
29780,"Pretty fun game I hadn't heard of for a long time. Challenging in a good way, and is a race against time every run."
29781,big fun
29782,gud
29783,Bungus
29784,"This game is so damn fun. but it can be cheesed. and once you figure out how to cheese it, the game will become so easy that you will no longer be challenged by anything. but the fun is in finding out how this is done. So I still recommend it."
29785,"1. Fun to play alone 
2. Even more fun to play with friends
conclusion great game o.o
highly recommend it ^-^"
29786,My umbrella is in the shop
29787,so many women are talking to me right now

29789,cant wait for Ror xd
29790,good
29791,is good
29792,Excellent replayability. doesn't get too old too quick.
29793,"so baka
"
29794,the best rogue like I've ever played easily. also challenging and super replayable!
29795,It's good
29796,Risk of Rain 2 is a honest sequel and brilliant recreation of the game I loved years ago.
29797,literally one of the greatest games ever made
29798,yes
29799,i died to a magic electricity worm
