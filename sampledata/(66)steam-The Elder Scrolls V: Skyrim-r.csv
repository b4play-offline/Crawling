0,"Skyrim is an amazing game and should be played by everyone that likes gigantic open-world role-playing in a magical-medieval setting with deep awe-inspiring lore, a long main story line, and seemingly unending side quests.

I believe the above provides the gist to why everyone should play Skyrim, but to add some more detail about actual gameplay here are some highlights:
- Inventory management,
- First and/or third person play you choose at any time,
- Fun combat,
- You will do battle against various types of dragons in the main quest line, but also through random encounter battles with dragons that spawn without warning throughout the world,
- Also, dragon fights are much more than just a wow factor you want to fight and defeat them for a real reason that is directly tied to a gameplay and is also baked into the lore of the world itself,
- Custom crafted armor and weapons, accessories, enchanting, spell configuration, alchemy, extensive skill trees for all play-styles, and dungeon diving,
- The base game is gigantic on it's own and then there are multiple DLCs that not only expand the map but also add depth to the game with unique items, spells, races, and powers. One such DLC also adds a more in depth base building mechanic that is awesome. You can own homes in the base game and make them yours, but this particular DLC adds so much more.
- Remastered graphics, you can play the game on a potato computer or crank it up to ULTRA-bliss on a powerful PC and in either case you will love playing Skyrim.
- Also, Skyrim has one of THE BEST character customization tools I have seen anywhere.

My personal recommendation is buy the remastered version with better graphics and purchase the ""all DLCs included"" bundle they are definitely worth it and the DLCs are togglable meaning that even if you own them you don't have to use them and can play the base game as much as you like. I absolutely love playing this game and after multiple character builds, base game and then game with DLCs, and literal real-world years of playing I still love starting a new save file and replaying the entire game from zero to this day (09/18/2022)."

2,"I... I can't leave... The spell still holds me... I try to leave but. I always come back. Run, oh poor soul. Run. None can escape the grasp of Skyrim..."
3,I attribute the survival of my mental health on my second deployment to this game on Nintendo Switch. I feel bad for anyone that won't experience this classic in their life time.
4,Its pog
5,"this version is 10 times better than the ps version.( the PS version cheats by sending higher level enemines after you) I like being a vampire and entering the castle without being attacked.(PS version the vampires will yell ""vampire"" and attack you)"

9,"Todd Howard you bastard
"
10,"Although it has some bugs (mine doesn't seem to have that many) it's still a great game. Lots of dragons to kill/enslave/make friends with, and the graphics are lovely. The marriage/adoption mechanic is something I hope will return in ES6."
11,"An ugly fat monkey is stronger than an ancient firebreathing dragon

30,its ok
31,"No vampire attacks in town, killing off your blacksmith.  Random dragon attacks are more manageable. Mods tend to work better, and are less problematic.  Overall experience is much more rewarding."
32,fun game the gameplay is confusing tho but at parts it is bun because yes also E
33,I like everything about this game.
34,Simply put it's a classic. I don't think I will stop ever coming back to this game.
35,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best games ever made. Years later, that continues to be the case. This adventure offers a rich world, densely packed with exciting things to do, as well as many occasions for creating lasting memories. I jotted down exciting things that happened during this particular playthrough so many times I lost count."
36,Truly one of the games ever.

43,tincan beloved
44,Great game.
45,"This game is my favourite of all games ever created. You can't even imagine how many hours I've spent in this game on Xbox 360. Yeah you should buy the Special Edition one, but I got this one A LONG LONG time ago."
46,Awesome game! Going to try out the mod for mul
47,"One of the best role-playing games I have ever played. The main story is okay, but the huge world filled with lots of interesting lore, characters and side quests is the best aspect of this game. I also really like the skill system where using a skill makes you gradually more proficient in it.

You should definitely check out the community mods - they fix some of the weaknesses of the game and give you endless flexibility to tailor the game to your preferences."
48,Nice game fuck alduin
49,"The best part of this game has to be the community support with modified content to continually refresh the game experience.  Many of these modders contribute their time and effort free of charge, and need to be recognized for their service to the players."
50,Amazing Game!!!!
51,It is what it is
52,everything
53,Best game ever.
54,install 300+ mods just for your game to crash. 10/10
55,It's alright

57,good open world game
58,"Guards can teleport, I love this feature"

60,"I'm an old guy and have been playing this game since it came out.  It's wonderful.  At first, I was very awkward but as I continued to play, I've got very good.  I only play on my pc because I'm not sure how this game works with other players.  I see that it has different mods to play, but I'm not sure how to get to them.  I recommend this game without reservation.  It is the best game I've ever played."
61,"First PC game ever ended up being the first game I ever fell in love with, very fitting."

69,its incredible in every way
70,"Fun game and with the mods available, it is a never ending journey in fantasy land. Hey become a child again and be the HERO!"
71,Skyrim is a great game to get lost in and have a good time.
72,This game is highly addictive and not recommendable for people who have a busy life. Its just to much awesome and very hard to get away from when your starting to get the hang of it.
73,"I think this is probably the best game ever made, and I don't even like vikings or dragons."

80,UUHGGHHHHHHH
81,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
82,most re-playable game that exists
83,"It's Skyrim. Story is just kind of okay, but it's fun."
84,"make sure you type commands perfectly because if you get too many compiler errors not just your game, but your entire pc will crash and you'll have to restart it. other than that it's good"

103,boobies and dragons. nice.
104,"It's still a game I go back to, I don't know why it holds up so well.  Could be that sometimes I just want to wander around a bit, and the scenery is pretty.  You can get mods that greatly improve the look of things, but the base game is still nice enough.  Don't forget to look up occasionally."
105,You can literally rim an elder who is looking at a scroll in the sky.
106,fun
107,awesome dude!

109,"This game is addicting, This game flows through my Bloodstream, my brain is dovahkiin. To this day, even after 34+ hours of gameplay, I am still trying to finish the goddamn questline."

126,you HAVE to play this game with mods (you need all dlc else most mods wont work) otherwise the game feels boring after like an hour
127,Cool game fun to make a really powerful weapon and obliterate EVERYTHING over all i would give it a 7.5/10
128,"Why the hell is the final boss so easy?
Anyways good game. 
No sex sadly, gotta mod the game for that."
129,"I waited a long time to play this game for the first time. This truly is a cornerstone in gaming history and I highly recommend it. I've played a number of open world games and none of them felt as immersive, organic, or big as Skyrim did. It is a fantastic combination of RPG elements and story-driven gameplay."

140,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Skyrim and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
141,game gave me AIDS. then when i was at walmart i saw todd howartd punch a baby.
142,Awesome Game
143,Based review at 69 hours

149,"I was was like wow you know, this game, its great!"
150,"Kind of goes without saying, this was a revolutionary game. There are of course several takes on ancient Nordic culture in the art styles of games (a standout is God of War), but Skyrim's Norse art style preceded many other prominent styles and likely inspired them. The game has a great deal of fun quests with freedom of choice in mind. However, there are two large weaknesses:
-Using a lot of magic spells mid to late game is simply not viable.
-Settling the differences between the Empire and Stormcloaks to fight the dragon menace. That meeting not only takes way too long and tanks the pace of the campaign, it also has little to no effect on the player relations with the factions. If you're siding with the Stormcloaks and essentially decide against them with every concession, they don't seem to mind. Granted, it does actually change what territories are controlled by which factions, but surely the Dragonborn would be held accountable for turning the table on one of the factions?"
151,Just the best ...
152,on various consoles i have played litteraly 100s of hours completely immersed living in this world
153,Incredibly detailed and complex--highly addictive--also has console command override codes for bypassing problems.  Very hard to stay away from once you get inside.  The best werewolf simulator I have ever seen!
154,Short Game. I'm surprised I went through the main missions so fast. It felt abrupt? I'll go back and do all the side missions and story lines. Short game.
155,Classic
156,ive spent more timing reordering my mod list than playing the game. 10/10

166,"Terrible game. I will continue to play it out of pure hatred for the Elves. Fuck elves. They're stupid rat faced looking bastards and deserve to be put on a burning cross. If i could gain the power of a god, and smite them all down to a crisp the size of an atom I would do so in a heart beat. They all deserve to die, and if you play as an Elf unironically you should consider burning everything you own. Fuck Elves."
167,Great graphics and fun game play/
168,It is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. Graphics are outstanding and Bethesda puts out high quality enjoyable games.
169,"Not my favorite Elder Scrolls game, but it's good. Play it."
170,"Spent entirely too much time drinking vodka and playing this game when it came out. I remember most of the 316 hours I logged had something to do with making crap-tons of iron knives and then enchanting them. This game was great. Probably still is, but I'm afraid to play it again and find out. Thank you, Bethesda, for making the early 2010s interesting."
171,"What can I say about Skyrim? It's gigantic. It's open. It's endless hours of play, that you never really finish."
172,"I've had a copy of this game since it first came out. One of the best Elder Scrolls, second to Morrowind"
173,One of my all time favorites. I've been following the series since Daggerfall and this is by far the best.
174,"Good game, even though it's buggy and hasn't aged that well. Mod's are a must."

10/10 Gameplay"
178,"Amazing game, keeping up the legacy of the elder scrolls games. But they seem to be milking it way too much, still 11 years later and no newer ESVI :(."

185,It's SkyRim. What else to say.
186,"the real crime is that this game doesnt come with every laptop/pc nowadays. should be free when you install windows 10. the REAL fun begins when you discover mods. but the games real problems start to shine... when you install mods. 11/10, am going to play obsessively for three months and lose track of reality again."

210,Outstanding game given it's age. it has become an Iconic example of Bethesda's creativity and skill in bringing such a wonderf6ul game to the public.
211,Nearly infinite ways to create and play your character. Is nice to forego the main quest on a few play throughs and experiment with other builds and explore new dungeons and quests. buy that 'other' house you never did. Take out Astrid for once. Never participate in the Civil War. so many choices...One of the best RPGs ever made.

221,Are you brave enough if so pick up your sword and pick a side and fight for the kingdom take on the enemy army fight dragons become  the most powerful and change the world you can take side quests and fight through the main quest which ever way you decide you can enjoy hours of endless fun
222,good good good
223,"This game is a good action-RPG which is *really* showing its age. It's been eleven years, Bethesda; just make another Elder Scrolls game. (I know they won't though; they made an MMO instead of a new entry to the franchise.)

But, anyway, the game's still pretty fun. Except the fact that, due to the game-breaking ""Cornered Rat"" bug, I have never finished this game, even after over 1'000 hours of playtime."
224,"Probably one of the most legendary games I've ever played, the most refined and complete, the most diverse and filled to the rim with magical content, and the freedom to choose your fate. Fantastic. I've never played a game for so long and still enjoyed it just as much as when I first started. I've completed the main quest line and there is still so much content to explore. 10/10 would recommend to anyone, even none gamers."
225,Whole new world waiting for you.

227,Yes
228,"One of the greatest RPGs ever made. A must-play for anyone who wants to call themselves a gamer.

10/10."

230,Yes.
231,it good i think
232,pokebal
233,Its a W. Enough said
234,Pretty Kewl IMO
235,still one of the best games
236,"There's a reason this game has been re-released +5 times now.

This game is an all time classic, even though it is well over a decade old. If you've never played the game as is, it could be worth it your first time through, just so when you get to the actual meat of the game (aka the hours and hours you'll spend ripping out your hair modding this game to the point of crash-to-desktop), you'll appreciate what the community has done to make this game replayable, though I would argue the special edition is the version you should get, since the game is *still* being updated with new mods, thanks to the dedicated modders of the community.

A word of wisdom as well - when modding, decide what you want the theme of the game to be. You want to do some wizardry? Heavily invest in spells. Want the game to be more of a hack and slash adventure? Invest in weapon/armor mods, combat mods that'll change up how you and the npcs will attack, etc etc. That being said, you will find this to be quickly impossible and you'll find yourself making a monstrous Frankenstein in your mods folder. This, of course, is natural, and you should enjoy it. Just keep in mind, install your mods one at a time. It *will* be tedious, but it'll save you the tremendous headache of trying to figure out which mod is the one that's making your game crash at the start."
237,"Quick Review Time!

Skyrim is one of those rare mythical games, everyone talks about it, most people played, and dare I say it possibly influenced other games which its overwhelming success. In bland terms some may call it an rpg, though I would argue its not a very rich in terms of player choices in the quests. Nevertheless the lore, game play and world building make up for any deficiencies. I may be a bit biased since I love the lord of the rings universe and to have a rpg like this in a similar fantasy world is breathtaking.

I would also like to point out that the game is very customizable with a endless array of free modifications online, completly transforming your experience as you see fit, want to add Shrek to Tamirel? go for it, maybe sonic too? Why not. I'm a personal fan of the re-skin ones. 

Overall a really fun single player game for you to explore in a medieval fantasy world. I recommend."
238,"Using the mod workshop makes this games so much better
"
239,its pretty cool
240,MOOOO
241,pretty fun game easy to lose track of time playing
242,It's Skyrim bois what more to say?

245,One of the pivotal open world action adventure games of our generation

260,"A mediocre game that's only good with mods, and if you buy this version you need to pay full price for Special Edition just to use most of the good mods. F*ck Bethesda."
261,I think it's finally time to start trying out mods.
262,"it just works

263,Is alright
264,idk how you can be a fan of rpg and not play this game.

269,"very big good
"
270,"This is such an amazing game, it is an open world killy people game. You can do so many things and follow so many different quest lines. If you want to you can be a sneaky cat thief, or you can be a warhammer orc that likes to smash everyone into pieces. There is so much freedom with this game, I still play it even though it was made 2011, I don't know many other games I play that were made 11 years ago and are still extremely fun."
271,amazing storyline and so full of adventure I love it!
272,Very nice
273,"Pros: It's Skyrim
Cons: It's Skyrim
Overall: It's frekkin Skyrim."
274,Best. Game. Ever.
275,"Even the base game is good enough for one play through. Combat is fine and such.

Then you mod it. Mod it to the point where you're amazed how it's actually running with all of the mods.

Then you add 50 more mods just too prove to the game it can take all of it."
276,One of the greatest games of all time.
277,"I see why they hid this version.
Too many softlocking bugs, and Bethesda being Bethesda, they dont fix it because they are lazy assholes. Just buy the special edition because its worth it. Still really good if you look past that bullshit though."
278,Dragon yes?
279,Great game made better with mods.
280,The game's okay.

289,"Very indepth RPG elements. We can get lost in reading books that gives idea about lore for hours. Gameplay offers a good mix of discovery and not much hand holding. When I started playing I just walked in the opposite direction and discovered a dungeon and some good contents. Even before reaching the monks to learn dragon shout, I had stumbled upon the verses for upgrading it by random exploration."
290,Finally started and just finished its beginning. I quit when the dragon showed up. Audio volume is a bit low. :(
291,"a classic, and superior to its more recent editions for its mod support"
292,gostei muito só n da pra pegar a serena fora isso muiuto bom tem dragão

307,"great game, with super support from modders keeps the game fresh and tailored to your personal taste."
308,I mean... open world with dragons... what else do you even need ?
309,"Very good game, played it since I was a child and I love it."
310,This rating is mostly due to the mods the community has created tbf
311,"Very good game, it may have been made in 2011 but it has better gameplay and graphics then most games in 2022"
312,"Skyrim is the best in the series.
And it helps that Bethesda games are playable with one hand.
Unlike Dragon Age Inquisition, The Witcher 2/3 and Sacred 3, to name a few.
Well done!

314,"Skyrim is the best RPG game in my life, a game with a rich story and every story always makes me enthusiastic and curious. For me, Skyrim is a game that we very must play if we really like RPG games, a masterpiece!"
315,"This game is kinda mid tbh. I really like it though and it has provided me a wonderful experience for many years.

Pairs well with mods and drinking games."
316,"It is Skyrim, need I say more? Worth the cost."
317,googgmame i like the rimjob sky
318,An incredible game with amazing adventures usually take an entire 3 years to finish the entire game.
319,Played Skyrim for years and still keep coming back to it
320,A classic game that will forever be remembered in the history of gaming. A game that truly set the standards and foundation for open world gaming as well as the peak of the modding and player-interaction community.
321,"If you're looking for an interactive open world, this is it. With glitches designed to bring you back wondering what else you can break, a built-in no-guilt command console that wont keep you from your trophies, and talking angry dragons... what more could you want, really? 

Almost 300 hours on record doing sidequests, i'm level 40 something, i've shouted a goat off a mountain, i can turn my enemies into rabbits, and i've only just barely touched the main story. Seriously a great time-sink- i 1000% recommend. :)"
322,w
323,my fave <3
324,"Amazing time waster
"
325,"It's an okay game. Nothing really fancy and I really don't get where the fuzz is all about.
I mean, you can mod all you want but it's still the same game; and if you mod it to the point where it's an entire new game, what's the point of saying it's still skyrim? Kind of a Ship of Theseus thing.

A total con I have about this game is when it comes to NPCs and AI they are so dumb.
Also, how many times will a random npc interrupt a dialogue to say something stupid? Or stop a fight to deliver a message to me?"
326,Top Ten all time...even though I start it back up for old times and never finish it...
327,"It's all about the atmosphere, since 11/11/11  :^)"
328,"Do not try to do many things. Just focus on 2 or 3 of them. Example: Light Armor + Dual-Hand. Or Sneak + One-hand.

The more skills you have, the more levels will monsters have. So just get skill in 2 or 3 things instead of having 7 different skills areas."
329,I actually love this game. to me it'a even better than any other mmorpg out today.
330,Fresh installed Title crashes at launch XD
331,w   game
332,"Skyrim will give odds to most modern RPGs - there are no the same type of locations and blueprinted dungeons. If one and a half cripples puffed over the creation of underground locations for Oblivion, then in Skyrim more than ten architects were involved in the design of the catacombs. Dungeons have only one drawback - almost all of them are absolutely linear. If you see a branch of the corridor, you can be sure that it ends in a dead end, where, most likely, there is a treasure chest. However, not a single game can do without stupid conventions, and you can seriously scold Skyrim only because after another thought “well, another quest, and sleep” you go to bed at three in the morning. And in our time of ""one-time"" games, this is worth a lot."
333,Epic game!
334,Good game that is good.
335,"As one can see, I have played a rather large number of hours of this game. It goes without saying that I love this game, even heavily modded."
336,"The gameplay is still amazing in 2022, but bethesda unlisted this game from steam."
337,It's Skyrim lol.

339,"Do we still really need to present Skyrim? A classic, a must-have. I have nothing to say that anyone wouldn't have said before me; this game is a masterpiece."
340,Mods have kept this game enjoyable to play for years
341,It's so good that they released it a half a dozen times!
342,"aDVENTURE GAME: DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS: LOTS OF QUESTS OF DIFFERENT NATURES: SO FAR, GAME MATCHES MY STRENGTHS AGAINST pcS"
343,Game was super fun and immersive. Highly recommend playing. You probably already know it's good. This review is pointless.
344,EVEN STILL NOT AS GOOD AS ARENA
345,FUS RO DAMMED WHAT A GAME
346,good
347,my friend loves this game and the naked mods
348,"best game to mod ratio, great game to get immersed into and be who you wanna be"
349,It just works!
350,"You know, I prefer this version, because there is no way to upgrade to ""Skyrim Anniversary Edition"", also no Creation Club. 
Old Skyrim right here, original experience, updated by community and tons of mods."
351,GOOD GAME
352,Its Skyrim... what more can I say. Get it!
353,"one of the greatest games ever
"
354,good
355,"Very engaging large scale open world rpg. Good story, many side quests / misc objectives. Good freedom of choice with regards to play style and difficulty. Great modding community to help keep the game enjoyable (graphics, content, QOL etc.).
Absolutely love this game and I can't help but keep going back to it. I always find something new in every playthrough and try a different way to play every time."
356,good game
357,10/10 a great time
358,"CAUTION: ONCE STARTED IT IS NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP PLAYING
This game was far ahead of its time."
359,So Much Fun!!!
360,"I love this game. I've had it on five devices for my entire teenagerhood and adulthood. Hours of content, open-world exploration is my FAVORITE thing, no deadlines or immediate ""you HAVE to do this"" quests unless you want to do them, you don't even have to finish the game! And no strict good/bad, you can be selfless and good, or you can be murderous and still the hero. I've spent hours ignoring the main quest for silly side quests."
361,"Magnificent graphics, great storyline, increadible play area, modifyable"
362,Dont hit the chicken
363,One of my favorite games.
364,many opportunities not used but still the GOAT of games

366,"yes 
it the elder scrolls v skyrim"
367,"2011 game but lots of mods can be install with great gameplay.
highly recommended"
368,"If you enjoy RPG's and haven't played SkyRim, then you're a great disappointment to your parents and I.  I believe it was the late Winston Churchill that said(and I quote):  ""I pity da fool who  don't play no SkyRim!  SUKKA!"""
369,It is a great experience . I have played in on PC and PS4 and would recommend on any platform .
370,"Great game, i cant believe its been over 10 years since this masterpiece came out.

Ive got 133.3 hours as of this review, but ive bought this game 6 different times over the last 11 years, and probably have well over several hundred hours in it now.

It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. And even now after 11 years the modding community is keeping this game alive and in better shape then Bethesda ever did."

376,This was the first elder scroll game i ever played and i absolutely love it. story is great and it works on my potato laptop at ultra settings.
377,It's Skyrim. Self explanatory.
378,amazing
379,gg
380,If you ask me this is the best game ever made.
381,As fresh as a Swedish winter! Ah... :D
382,good
383,Great Game
384,One of the best games made next to oblivion
385,A great game with massive content. My only reservations after hundreds of hours of playing boil down to minor things like NPC reactions and conversations not really adapting as you gain fame (even if you're already the head of the mages' guild you'll be called a rookie when joining the thieves' guild or similar).
386,good with all the dlc and a bunch of mods
387,"I mean, what is there to say about Skyrim? 10 years since release and I'm still finding myself replaying it fairly often, trying new builds and characters. And the modding support only furthers that.

I like to insert my own character into RPGs like that, with their own lives and backstories, and I feel like Skyrim is truly a game that allows me to do that, and even though there are some tedious quests, it's still an enjoyable experience and keeps me coming back again and again."
388,"If, like me, you were considering getting this version as you want to play an old game without playing the new-game price of the re-re-re-release: don't buy this. 

This version has all the pre-unofficial patch, but the unofficial patch mod seems to have been discontinued / deleted for this older version of skyrim.

My advice is either pay out the nose for whatever Tod is charging 50 quid for these days or steal a version that doesn't have bugs"
389,Best fantasy game ever. Period and end.
390,skyrim is just an amazing game. its super re-playable.

398,"I've been putting off this review for a while, but it's time. 11/11/11 is an appropriate release date for this game, because the theme song makes me want to rlcrank it up to 11 and rip the knob off. I played 11 hours in my first sitting with the game. I'd rate it 11 out of 10.

I had an Xbox 360 when Skyrim came out, and the console didn't have the beefiest RPG library. I latched on to that rare, quality RPG when I could. Sure, Skyrim has a *ton* of bugs, but the game is still a masterpiece. There's a reason it keeps getting re-released nearly a decade later, right?

I charged through woth my Xbox 360 copy and earned every single achievement available. When I sold the Xbox and got a PS3, I turned around and got my platinum trophy. I then bought Elder Scrolls Anthology for PC, so I could see Morrowind and Oblivion that I missed, replay Arena and Daggerfall, explore the world of mods and 100% Skyrim yet again. Getting Special Edition for free was a nice bonus.

The mods are amazing. I've been working on that third 100% for years because I keep getting sidetracked by mods. This game is infinitely expandable due to the large install base, large community and incredible content.

Maxing out all skills, building various characters and mastering all play styles will keep you hooked for hours on end.

It's not the best game out there, but it's endearing and has gotten me through rough times. Skyrim will always hold a special place on my top 5 games of all time."
399,What's not to love?
400,lol
401,get the Special Edition instead
402,Skyrim is literally (in my non-biased fact-based opinion) the best game ever developed. If you've never played before i can promise you won't be disappointed. However- i highly recommend you get the special edition or you'll miss out on a ton of cool weapons and armor and stuff like that.
403,kill me
404,"Been playing since release and now that I know Skyrim like the back of my hand I can finally rate which Feud has the best pussy. Whiterun: Good Nords and some Redguards, also some juicy werewolf milk up in Jorrvaskr-Falkreath: A bit too dead but that wendussy got me acting unwise-Riften: Brynjolf stole my bitch for the 3rd time this week-Windhelm: a bit too racist and claustrophobic but still good, also wet Argonian pussy hits different-Markarth: Forsworn are feral fr-Solitude: probably the highest quality pussy in Skyrim-Morthal: Swampy and wet but mid-Dawnstar and Winterhold are both freezing cold but Nord women know how to warm you up, also they know freaky stuff in the College of Winterhold. Honourable mentions: Solstheim: Those Dark Elves knows what's up, also Skaal makes me go beast mode-Castle Volkihar: That's NOT what I meant by ""Suck all my blood out"". 10/10 game."
405,"I mean, it's Skyrim. There's not really much more to say. It's a classic, and any money you spend on it will be money well-spent."
406,"Another great game that aged well with the times.

A Classic - 2 thumbs up!"
407,I still to this day dont know if i love or hate this game
408,classic!
409,looking back this game is just awful and overrated. mid story and a lack of stuff to do idk why it got so popular
410,One of the best games in the world
411,"""Fus!""
""Yes!""
""Fus!""
""Yees~ don't stop""
""Ro dah!""
""Yees! Please more, I beg you! 😩""
""Fus.. ro dah!"""
412,"Sure, it's got issues, but still is one of the best games ever! Much of that is due to the amazing modding community."

415,It's alright.
416,80% of time is used troubleshooting 20% is playing the game
417,Awesome game overall. Bethesda strikes again!
418,Pretty decent game. Pretty broken too but fun kind of broken.
419,my child hood on god
420,They put drugs in that game. Addicted since its release.
421,It's an Amazing game
422,8/10 there is a skyrim but this is the unlisted old skyrim just eat the extra 20$ for SE+anniversary
423,"Many years and 500 hours of playtime later, I still find Skyrim to be a pleasure to return to. This game has high replay-ability due to its many side questlines and possible combinations of ""classes""."
424,"380 hours on steam, another 100+ on PS3 way back in the day. This game is......pretty good."
425,"GOOD GAME
"
426,"My first open world ARPG, until playing this I had only played tactical RPGs and such this game was a breath of fresh air for me when I played it, now nearly 9 years later after my first playthrough, I'd say its a game everyone should try, no matter the edition, not because it's a perfect game, it's not, but because it's great at what it sets out to do, let you explore and get lost in it's world, especially if you don't look up what to do or where you are going. I'd recommend this game for anyone looking for a world to explore."
427,DRAGON GO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
428,"dony play the storyline
"
429,pee pee poo poo
430,"While not as much as some, the ungodly amount of hours poured into this game should say it all...

Clearly, it's very recommended.

"
431,"its Skyrim...hate it or love it, its one of those legendary games. like Ocarina of Time or Half Life 2."
432,Every time i play this game i get an raging erection
433,I am a mod developer for Oblivion and love Skyrim as a leading edge RPG that is one of a kind.
434,"great game, even better npcs
"
435,I LOVE TODD HOWARD
436,It's...Skyrim. Need I say more?
437,Better than Daggerfall
438,"vanilla skyrim - 7/10
skyrim with mods - 12/10
no idea how people play this game without using console"
439,Just an amazing game.
440,best rpg game i gave ever played
441,"You just cant beat an all time classic. I still play this game when I can. Its just so easy to pick back up, one moment your'e playing and its 12 o'clock, next thing you know the sun is coming out and you forgot you have to work the day shift."
442,roooda!
443,"without mods, it's a pretty mid, lacking a good story, and void of consequences. It predicates itself on being an 'exploration' game rather than an rpg (but claims to be one anyway) but most of the locations aren't interesting, combat is dated, and it helped set a trend for video games to be bad at launch and then patched over later. Not even mentioning that there isn't a good faction to kill those knife-eared fucks."
444,great game for sand boxing
445,
446,"It's Skyrim I mean, at this point can anyone not recommend it?"
447,One of the best games I ever played.
448,"Open world, unlimited add-ons and races!  the coolest support community(nexus)"
449,Possibly one of the greatest platforms for exploration and creativity of all time. The GOAT.
450,skyrim
451,liked
452,"Shouted people off mountains, they ragdolled. 10/10"
453,Maybe the greatest open-world sandbox video game ever made -- and certainly the best game with mods.  I honestly don't believe with any major came company will ever be able to create something this good again.
454,It's fun! Good to kill some time and the open world concept is pretty decent.
455,foot
456,A great role playing game. That gives you freedom to go where you want. Great beautiful player made houses to download. Kick ass weapons.
457,Its Skyrim ......
458,"It's Skyrim. It's fun. I mean, duh."
459,Heavily dissatisfied with this product.  not worth a damn penny.
460,good
461,Awesome Game. Use to play it on the XBox 360 and it holds up just as well on pc.

480,"I LOVE PENIS

481,Bought this game only for OSA. I had fun.
482,I mean this is skyrim do ı need say something ?
483,"I've bought this game 4 times, so my hours displayed here are just a fraction of the true hours I've logged into Skyrim. 

Considering playing? Do it. Just do it.
I don't even need to explain why

My grandchildren will probably play this game"
484,big tiddy khajiit mod
485,Very well made!
486,"One of the first games I played as a kid, also the first game that would get me addicted to playing it. To me Skyrim is a timeless nostalgia, I always end up playing Skyrim when i have nothing else to play. For anyone just getting into playing open world RPGs I definitely recommend trying out Skyrim."
487,"with the correct set of mods, this can be the best porn game you have ever played :v"
488,"good game, can't progress cuz i'm literally shit at using my brain. Pickpocket 88 from whiterun alone lol"
489,ngj
490,it just works
491,"I have now played this since it first was introduced. My first experience was with the X-Box version that my kids used. Then I eventually bought the game for myself for my laptop. I still play it sometimes, even though I now own the ""Special Edition"" also. I think the Special Edition is better, but can be daunting with all the new additions to the game. The ""open world"" nature of this game is so appealing it becomes a place where you want to visit frequently, like home."
492,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
493,Most awesome game ever.
494,]''
495,amazing game all round
496,"YOU CAN BUY STEAM KEYS ON EBAY or here https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/ . 8/10, I'd give 10/10 if it wasn't bugged to hell like almost all, if not all, Bethesda games are. Bugs are fine as long as they are fixed, not ignored like Bethesda does with all of their titles except Fallout 76 and that's only because it's online. Definitely buy if you haven't already (99% of my time played is on console)
Pro's
- Very high replayability
- A lot of content
- A lot of different viable builds
Con's
- Massive amount of bugs that the devs ignored and are here to stay at this point (lazy devs? idk)
- Game has a lot of issues if you play above 60 fps
- You can't manage the fps without mods
- A lot of what mods improve should of already been part of the base game (lazy devs? idk)"
497,It's freaking Skyrim.
498,Why i dont got skyrim special edition :( I purchase this long time ago :( Now I have to buy this game again ? :(
499,remimd me of  mont and bkade
500,"Oldrim is oldrim, sure it's skyrim, but you have to buy the DLCs seperately and unlike SSE it's 32 bit."
501,Probably the GOAT prior to Elden Ring. What else is there to say?

523,"Awesome, timeless game"
524,sweetroll
525,This is the ONLY game in the entire universe where you can collect an infinite amount of ... cabbages!
526,is an amazing game with a few bugs modded or unmodded ive gotten alot of hours out of this game for many years and still come back to it years later must have game endless play you can choose whatever storyline you want and play how you want
527,"What really got me into this game was to add more mods.

There are so many mods out there already, people still make mods, it always feels fresh
It's been years and I would still recommend you the game. I personally never regretted it."

532,"this goddamned game actually blows donkey cock, if i wanted a stupid game that refused to run i'd have played v rising on my shitty computer!! is this game *trying* to piss me off??? i've never had any of my problems on the xbox 360 like i do here.

let's start off with the button mapping issues, good god. i set them to the way *i* use my controller, and yet it does an exact opposite of what i wanted, and pretended like they were my buttons. on top of the shit controls, there's the fact that the camera is the embodiment of heavy. i feel like my character is straining just to look at something. i could barely get past the opening tutorial just because of how terrible it all is. also thanks, bethesda, for not fixing any of the issues with the game! /s

bc i already have a terrible feeling if i continued, i'd have had a psychotic break. game breaking bugs should not be a part of a game. already had that experience on 360, don't wanna deal with it here."

541,Game got corrupted and I lost about 100 hrs of play time
542,"I have been playing Skyrim since it was first released slightly over a decade ago.  I like that the game allows the player to roam freely through the world space largely choosing what it is that they want to do.  You can follow the main story line quest, or you can set off on your own and create your own life largely ignoring what happens elsewhere in the game.  The fact that the game is fairly easy to customize and has literally thousands of mods that allow you to change it to suit your playing style and interests is just fantastic.  Finally, I prefer playing as an archer and therefore really like the first person POV when aiming my bow."
543,good gaem
544,elder scrolls 6 plz

562,"Besides the usual bugs and insanity its been a pretty fun game for me over the years, with and without cheats.  Honestly sometimes a good game to immerse yourself in when you need to escape reality for a bit. The mods plentiful as well... just um... don't go on a murderous rampage at the very beginning if you want to just play some or most of the story."

605,"Most mods and players are using/only compatible with the Anniversary Edition, which Bethesda said ""No you cant upgrade to it, you have to re-buy the exact same game again""

And i reply,  ""No""

I dont like to be scammed and im not a flipping money tree, IM POOR OK. Im not buying the exact same game twice. I dont promote self harm.

Bethesda, upgrade my copy of Skyrim to Anniversary Edition for free please. You already took my money, you arent taking it twice for something which should clearly have been an UPDATE.

A famous quote: ""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me""
I outright refuse to buy the same thing twice and put on that ""Sucker"" paper hat. Sorry not sorry, im standing my ground.

Either Bethesda upgrades me or i simply dont get to enjoy Skyrim.  
Do not try to gift me the game and put on a ""Sucker"" hat, i will refuse it, and save you from wasting your money into a billionares abyss-like bank account."
606,"First time I played this was when it came out years ago.
I didn't leave my house in 3 months - People thought I died

Finding myself bored with other games, I came back to it. This time i have sank a ton of time into it, finding out why its appraised as one of the GOATS. I now understand, the atmosphere is amazing, the quests though sometimes bland, do feel real. I feel for the citizens of Skyrim, I understand now. If you havent played it (probably why youre reading this) then give it a try! Roleplay, I am a stealing, sneaky archer who does whatever he would like, no one can tell me what to do."
610,"to many mods , horses and now fu*%#*@ help"
611,The battle system is a challenge especially with a controller but the game has not failed me yet. Oblivion was better story-wise in my opinion but even with a slightly smaller story system in Skyrim the game still makes you wanna keep on playing forever.  I give it a 4.99999 out of 5
612,never bought the dumb reboots and wasted my money
613,Just buy the special edition tbh
614,"I have spent more than 300 damn hours in this game across all my plataforms and i can only say one thing. Do you go to the cloud district very often? Oh, what am i saying? I'll have you know theres no PUSEEEEYY! 


No but fr fuck Nazeem"
615,"cool

story

bro"
616,is good
617,Still going strong 11+ years later.
618,"Besides the stupid-ass overused meme made off this game's intro, Skyrim is awesome. 

There is an incredible amount of work put into this game's story and writing, and satisfying combat. This combat can be combined with magic, spells, potions, and healing items. This game is practically pitch perfect. Infact, I feel that it is perfect. Of course the graphics could be better or less dull, but you can just buy the special edition. But the graphics are still impressive for such an old game, I admit. 

There are also many mods you can install, like changing the amount of blood, skipping the long intro, and some lewd mods for lonely men, who have never been touched by any woman."
619,"does anyone else seem to think its insanely predatory, that bethesda has tried to hide this on steam to force people to buy the 60 dollar HD version instead, that doesn't even run on most PCs? lol"
620,Awesome Game.
621,fun init
622,its so creative
623,this game isn't curing my depression but it's putting up a good fight
624,its what youve loved for years or what youve been years behind on loving.
625,Masterpiece
626,very fun and adventurous rpg that is made evan better by community mods
627,One of the greatest games to date.
628,its good
629,Very fun game to play
630,"Among the most replayable RPG experiences ever invented, with a perpetually active modding community constantly renewing and deepening the experience, there is no wonder they have sold it five times."
631,Played it a little bit
632,This game is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It has everything to offer from a fun story to fun bugs. It is best played alone on a rainy day while sipping from your hot tea.
633,Awesome game with awesome graphics and cuality. Aged great. Favorite game.
634,Fab
635,Its Skyrim... I think at this point it's name is well enough known that a review is unnecessary
636,it ok
637,"I mean, it's Skyrim."
638,good game
639,"The open world and interaction was a big asset to the game as well as the ability to mod.  I found the game very captivating and fun.  The DLC's were a lot of fun, as well.  I would highly recommend this and with the many modifications that are available out there the possibilities are endless."
640,Still an overall great game all these year's later! :)
641,He said dog ran away sad times
642,supper fun to play i love  playing this in first person
643,Awesome game!
644,"best rpg ever
"
645,"It is worth noting that the world has become much more realistic, now jumping, running, fighting and other mechanical components look much more exciting and no longer look like dull two- or three-button actions. There is no multiplayer in the game, so I will not discuss it.
The game is definitely worthy of attention. You can play for a very long time, if there was only a desire."
646,skyrim is a good game
647,A great game ....even better when modded out...
648,haha dragon
649,best ever in whole world
650,gooder game
651,"I have been playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim since it came out in 2011.  I love this game so much, it's like having a life outside of our current world.  There are other games I could play, but Skyrim is my favorite and I always come back to it like I'm coming home."
652,A game for people who love RPG single player games that can be modded and replayed.
653,"My favorite game of all time. I have played this on 360, ps4 and PC and I think across all three I have well over 1000 hours played."
654,fine
655,Incredible game!
656,ye
657,"Skyrim isn't exactly a game that I wouldn't recommend to others--I think it's popular for a reason--but I certainly wouldn't recommend myself to play it again. I came back a second time after 6 years and unfortunately riding a horse isn't as exciting anymore and the rest is a mediocre experience.

In my opinion the creatures of Skyrim are boring. It lacks both the creative hybrids of Morrowind and the traditional fantasy of Daggerfall. Instead, you are left with real-life animals such as bears, tigers, deer, and wolves. The creatures that are creative are secluded into specific areas such as spriggan and giant camps or Dwarven ruins. Interesting creatures are important for building the world as they are the most common enemy encounters while traveling. That, or the generic bandit.

The architecture of Skyrim is similarly uninspired. There is nothing close to the scale of Vivec. The best example of a Nord Nord city is Dwemer (you can decide whether I mean Markarth or Blackreach). The best building is in Sovngarde, which you get to see for about 30 minutes. It's not as though there isn't a good real-life basis. They could have done Scandinavian longhouses, upturned boats, or went fantastical and carved the cities into the ice. Cities like Morthal and Winterhold are barely trying. Look, not every city had to be sprawling, but the least they could have done is brought some more quests to these locations. Mortal has the obligatory city quest, ""Laid to Rest"", then fades from existence.

The guild quests are all played [spoiler]crooked[/spoiler]. For some reason the writers decided each needed a [spoiler]twist[/spoiler]. Unfortunately, this means they don't age very well on subsequent playthroughs, where the logical inconsistencies are more apparent. [spoiler]The classic: why can you be arch-mage with so little spells? How did the Silver Hand get into Whiterun? Why is Astrid so naive?[/spoiler] Unfortunately, the game does not properly explore the concepts it presents and instead readies the next bombastic scene. For example, [spoiler]killing the emperor is made to be such a big deal when you have never interacted with him before. He's literally just a title.[/spoiler] Killing a Jarl would have been much more consequential morally and gameplay-wise.

One of the biggest cases of missed potential, other than the entire Civil War, is in the College of Winterhold. For some reason nobody in the College cares about the Falmer, which is a massive addition to the Dwemer story. A quest where the player make some contact with the Falmer which is non-violent would have gone a lone way. They could have even put an easter egg Falmer merchant and it would have been more interesting. Instead, every Dwemer ruin is full of these guys but for all the dead adventurers, nobody investigates. There is one quest examining the Disappearance of the Dwarves with [spoiler]Arniel Gane[/spoiler], but it's practically played for comedic effect.

I didn't find myself attached to any of Skyrim's characters. Delphine and Esbern are astoundingly unlikable. That didn't help the main quest. Side note: one thing you'll notice about Skyrim is that it doesn't give you any opportunity to deal with characters you don't like. Everybody hates the Black-Briars and Silver-Bloods, but you can't help Mjoll deal with them. Not only are they essential, but even if you did kill them, if the game doesn't react, it's not fun. The Dark Brotherhood members give you generic lines like ""make it swift"" or ""don't get caught"" when you ask what they think about your current job. Why do I care when half of them get [spoiler]slaughtered[/spoiler]. At least Cicero and Astrid have good voice acting, though. Seeing a character like Serana in Dawnguard, who reacts to events in dialogue, shows what could have been here.

Combat is severely hampered by the simplification of mechanics. Granted, I played on legendary which was a mistake. The lack of spell variety exemplifies this. There's no burden, drain attribute, or fortify mechanics that used to make combat tactical. Stealth or pure melee combat is always going to get stale after a while. There are no movement or quality of life spells. Alteration lacks levitate or jump. Mysticism teleports are gone. I get the cities are closed, but man the overworld would be fun to fly through. There isn't even a way to run faster. Perk progression is pretty boring, though the system can be good, as in New Vegas. A mixed system with interesting perks and impactful skills and attributes would have been best. It's like they forgot how fun is was to feel a skill like acrobatics level.

The main quest is ignored by most players for a good reason. Alduin is wholly one-dimensional with no motivations, just nature. It's a severe downgrade from someone like Dagoth Ur. You know the whole villain motivation chart. Perhaps they could have had a lieutenant to replace Paarthurnax to be interesting or Alduin was the total evil. My biggest complaint is that the world does not change according to the story. This makes it feel lifeless and stagnant. Morrowind made you feel becoming the Nerevarine through reputation and dialogue. The most acknowledgment you get that the world is not in stasis in Skyrim, are one-liners from the guards. It's pretty pathetic, and the heavily simplified dialogue system does not help.

Side quests in Skyrim are generally pretty bad. I wouldn't bother with many besides ""Lost to the Ages"", which is fantastic, and the Daedric quests. The Daedric quests are predictable and most of the time they [spoiler]just ask you to kill the guy following you, who you met 5 seconds ago[/spoiler], but at least they have the budget. Minus Mephala. And Vaermina literally just says [spoiler]""kill him because he'll betray you lmao""[/spoiler] in the last 5 seconds. A lot of Skyrim's miscellaneous quests are fetch quests, which are always bad. Here's the difference with Morrowind's fetch quests: at least they had context and went towards progression in a guild. The guy asking you to run a steak to the Jarl's steward is just going to give you 5 gold and no roleplay value.

If there's anything good about Skyrim it's exploration and grinding shout completion. The dungeons have more depth than Morrowind, but they're not masterpieces either. It's very regular with the puzzles and draugr boss at the end. The DLC improve on this somewhat. Modding is also nice, but I have trouble calling that a positive for the base game. Sparing the complacency they bring to the developers, mods take time to download, have their own variable quality, and usually cannot fix issues with the game that are intrinsic to its identity."

669,"I've definitely played for more than 400 some hours, but I can absolutely recommend either SE or LE Oldrim.  I'm a bit of a Fallout addict tbh, but Skyrim is a much prettier, more nature-oriented escape.  Highly reccommend."
670,This is very much a nostalgia and good for its time game. 10+ years later it isn't really worth the time sink it is.
671,huge game
672,play it. it good. it slowly kills you from the inside.

687,"I am just getting started I am just figuring this out, however it feels good so far. I will keep you updated. I recommend."
688,"It's addictive and when you thought there was nothing else, then there's something else to do!!"
689,"Skyrim was the only game I played for about 3 years. It's one of the best games ever, despite some minor bugs. That's part of Bethesda's charm at this point I suppose. Story is good, gameplay is immersive and fun, music is excellent. It's easy to get lost in this world (in a good way). Highly recommend 10/10"
690,One of the best games ever made. Bought it 4 times now.
691,I've played for 30hrs so far and haven't done a single main quest.
692,"I own 42 copies of this game.
(and several collectable coins)"
693,"Incredible game with huge modding support.
VERY re playable and fun even years after it released, definitely recommend to everyone"
694,"Probably one of the best RPGs ever made, has not aged well since then but I cannot complain about a game that I've played 2000+ hours of over multiple PCs and console generations. If you don't like something about this game, Skyrim has one of the biggest modding scenes ever, every single little thing can be modified.

I would recommend purchasing Special Edition rather than this one as Special Edition is on an updated engine and will crash and stutter far less."

713,
714,amazing game
715,Roaming around doing quests at your own pace. 10/10.
716,There should be edition with re-written world building and whole campaign storyline so it could be much way better.
717,"This game was epic.  Such an open world, interesting story line, great mechanics and game play!  And the length of the game - pretty much unheard of in present day!

My son and I spent many good times on this one.  I wish there were more like this."
718,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
719,I don't think there will ever be a time where I don't come back to this game.
720,Fun game
721,I have tried to play this game 2 times prior and always got lost and left. This time i didn't give up and it's honestly one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. I loved this game.

723,"Had to download a mod manager and a mod in order to get past the opening scene because of the cart was flipping around, I tried everything else to fix it.

The modding community is always active so even after beating the game theirs creative mods that
might keep you company. Its really fun & cool."
732,Gamer
733,Its good
734,"Play once without mods and never play it again. If you don't you will just be spending hours adding mods to this game just to never be satisfied with the result, that the game still is average at best and a big waist of time after beating it the first time."
735,"It's Skyrim, you love it or hate it.

Play it. Get the immersion mods... it's worth it."
736,This game is so involved and diverse.  So much to do and learn. On top of that I get to kill DRAGONS that are so life like.
737,"Plenty of bugs. Leveling some things is a terrible experience but other than that its a lot of fun.
Who reads this anyway? Doesnt everybody know?

Theres very good Music, theres a lot to do, there are very iconic moments. 
the DLCs are cool and really add to my experience as i use the houses regularly as my base and are better with the mannequins and your own mead hall. Also owning a house is something i could only dream of IRL :("
738,Greatest game ever made
739,this game is mad cool just so awesome
740,"This game is the definition of ""It just works"". This game holds itself together on Elmer's Glue Sticks and paper mache, but you will have fun. You will spend several hours just wandering around doing nothing of importance, and find several quest related areas, complete them, and find out about the actual quest several hours later. You will waste dozens of hours into the vanilla version of this game, finally come to a place that you consider a fitting end and exit the game, saying you will never play this limping horse of a game ever again, just to come back, pump it full of mods, and remain for another several hundred hours. So yeah I'd say it's fun."
741,the base game is great and with mods makes it a whole new fun!

750,good game
751,booty
752,Fun game to play
753,"Ok, guys. I'm gonna be the brave soul to admit the truth about this sacred cow. Someone has to.

THIS GAME EFFING SUCKS! I've tried numerous times to get into this game, on several different platforms, for over ten years, but I am completely, hosplessly unable to extract any joy from this game, and the thing I find most fascinating is that many people I meet IRL will share my opinion. It's so crazy how far apart the online consensus is from my own experience talking with people.

This game blows."
754,Great game even eleven years later!
755,THE REPLAY VALUE IS CRAZY!!! i always find myself creating a new character and either making a new story for said character or just speed running the game for like the 1337th time. it's that fun. the quests and the progression system are awesome sauce. skyrim is what created my passion for adventure because if the dovahkiin could experience all this stuff in his life then i want it too :)
756,game is le epic :)
757,i mean its alright
758,"classic game, still good in 2022"

765,this game is amazing do not download any mods its great as it is
766,pog game :]
767,goooooooooood
768,love it
769,"It is a classic for a reason, that's all I have to say about the gameplay, story, and experience. On the tech side low system requirements mean that even a relatively weak modern laptop (read: affordable on a college budget) can run it and the mods you can put on it with a decent desktop are insane."
770,"I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.

Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.

t contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.

Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.

Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.

Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.

Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

You can speed by all this if you want. You can drive directly through the main story content, see the conclusion and bail out, having never increased a skill category to 100 or read a virtual copy of The Antecedents of Dwemer Law. But to do so is to defeat the purpose of playing The Elder Scrolls. This is a world that rewards the obsessive and the adventurous, one where creative quest designs are the standard across primary and secondary storylines, not the exception. Primary quest lines may proceed in predictable fashion for a while, but only to lull you into a sense of complacency before the inevitable betrayal sends you scrambling in unexpected directions. The rewards are just as exciting, offering all sorts of unique gear and significant bonuses for dealing with the Thieves Guild, entering into the ranks of the magical College of Winterhold, or joining the battle-hardened Companions in Whiterun. These are the strongest storylines in the game, but even the shorter quests sprinkled all over Skyrim impress.

Random NPCs will run up to deliver notes in the middle of the wilderness, others whisper rumors in inns. Blacking out after randomly entering into a drinking contest, luring innocents to their deaths at demonic shrines or complying with the demands of a cannibal haunting a morgue are only some of the peculiar events you may encounter in Skyrim's non-essential content."
771,poop
772,still the best of all the skyrims
773,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, however, bethesda not allowing you to buy the dlc in order to force you to buy the special triple deluxe edition. On top of that, my game won't even open now, crashes on startup. WILL NOT buy your stupid editions, I expect to be able to play the game I've already purchased!"
774,"An underrated game, I think more people should hear about it."
775,A
776,300 hours per month...
777,Abandonware
778,dragons 👍
779,yeah its pretty good
780,I play this on my toaster now.
781,You gotta play it. It's necessary
782,yes many goog gam
783,Very fun game! Brilliant if you like medieval period with magical elements.
784,"Why?!  That would mean more people downloading and playing it who should be retired, because we are old.  I started out learning how to mod Morrowind.  Haven't got time to Mod because I like playing Skyrim more than modding it.  Then there's the other games I am enchanted by.   Ooo!

If you like exploring!!! Anywhere any time even in RL, Skyrim GoTY is a good game to do that.  You can make your own way without ever getting into playing through the stories."
785,Awesome classic
786,Skyrim... It just works....
787,"Never fails to give you a great time adventuring, even after completing all quests over and over. It does get a bit tiring with all the loading screens but they're worth it.
Feels like coming home every time you start a new game after maybe years of not playing. And not too difficult so a nice game if you don't want to grind levels to get to the next part (aka most working adults)."
788,It's Skyrim. Need I say more?
789,"Amazing game, always something fun to come back too on boring days or days that you don't want to play your fps"
790,dragons
791,bait and switch---
792,This is my all time favourite game. I have played it multiple times on console and now I have it on PC i'm finally having fun with all the different mods. It is honestly my comfort game that I always go back to.
793,I love this game very much I've played it alot and all the quest alot if you like open-world single player rpg's this is the game for you
794,"The GOAT Never forget, 11/11/11 !!!!"
795,"Honestly, no idea what people ever saw in this game. Couldn't care less about the story and gameplay. It's just a walking simulator. Just like New Vegas is a walking simulator, but a better one. There is nothing in this game that motivated me to ,,explore"" and travel 100 miles to get to a quest. Just an RPG in an extremely generic medieval fantasy setting. Combat is extremely unresponsive and the quests + dialogue are all not interesting."
796,Khajit Simulator V5.0
797,"One of the Best PC games out there. The game is buggy (understatement of the century, I know), however this is the reason why you get it on PC and specifically via Steam. to gain access to the Steam Workshop Mods. Skyrim's Nexus Mods page is great though keep in mind that there is a ton of NSFW mods (might be good for some of you freaks out there...) Skyrim Special Edition is considered to be the improved version but in my opinion the original is the best option because it had the biggest support for a long time. Do NOT Look up any Reddit Pages related to this game, You WILL Regret it!"
798,Another classic for Bethesda!
799,Amazing...
800,great game but you had to be there
801,Best ever.  Logged about 500 hours and still going.
802,Been playing this since it came out on xbox360 and the entire game is well done and has so many possible ways to play it. Mixing hand to hand combat with magic to stealth magic and so on. Just exploring the game itself brings you hundreds of hours!
803,This game is more buggy than Cyberpunk on launch.
804,Love this game so much
805,even in 2022 very few to no games come close to this experience
806,"GG.
Would say it's a 10/10, but the grind can get unreal sometimes, so i'll say it's a 9/10.
Nevertheless, a fantastic prices of art."
807,"I just can't get in to it.

Maybe the combat is too clunky, maybe the amount of bugs isn't worth it or the world doesn't interest me.
Either way... I played it for 5 hours and got sick of it."
808,"[h1]The best Elder Scrolls after Morrowind[/h1]

Played for like 50 hours without any mod. Played for 400 more with mods that completely changed the experience. So whether you enjoy vanilla games or are a mad modder, you'll enjoy Skyrim.

Beautiful graphics even today (needless to say they can be made quite gorgeous with the right mods), simple but nice combat system (again, mods to suit them to your tastes), interesting story, haunting atmosphere, discreet but lovely music, a ton of side quests, activities and things to do instead of saving Skyrim from ancient dragons (and yes, as you've guessed, there are mods to add even more things to do)... But I think what I enjoy the most is the total freedom this game offers.

The NPCs aren't as well written as in a Witcher game but they're still lively and interesting. Especially Nazeem in Whiterun, oh you'll love this one!

In short: You don't need a review. It's fricking Skyrim, this game is a legend!
"
809,"It's _skyrim_

but admittedly, this is the non-definitive edition, so you're unlikely to even see this review, so ... whatever"
810,"i've always loved this game. just started playing on pc
"
811,Very fun and great to seize the leisure time!
812,"constant crashing, I just had to re-load the game starting with a full steam re-load.  no online options at all.  Every time I take a break and do not play for a month or two I have to go through this.
"
813,
814,"One of the many ways of playing Skyrim. You know, by now you've got
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Very Special Edition
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR
The Elder Scrolls VI: Skyrim & Knuckles featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry® series with a new Funky Mode Triple Deluxe"
815,Absofruitely worth buying. Absonotely no doubt of playing. Worth every penny. Every second spent in this universe.
816,"Lets be honest, you already own this game."
817,"incredibly easy to mod, yet incredibly easy to crash."
818,do i need to say why ?
819,do you go to the cloud district very often
820,Bão demais da conta
821,"Holds up still after more than 10 years
"
822,sweet roll
823,"i absolutely LOVE this game, its one of those games you can keep playing over and over. The story line is very good and i like how you can start off in different areas depending on which faction you want to go with. after you complete the main story line there are still so many side quests to do its like the game never ends. i honestly enjoyed playing this game that i played it for 3 years straight. of course there are some very nice mods that you can put in this game to make it better and more immersive, but i chose not to put any mods and still enjoyed the game."
824,"There isn't a soul on this planet that hates this game. They may not like it but no one hates it, this game is huge and if you've never played it before you'll spend the next couple of years finding new stuff in the game. Only now since i played the game when it first came out (when i was just a kid) have i really found what most of the game has to offer, and even then I find myself returning to it atleast once year like its a phase, because even if you have beaten the game and its many side quests, you'll without a doubt in my mind, come back, maybe its because of mods, maybe its because you want to try out a new build, you will come back to this game. This game is a massive title, and it played a major part in my childhood as it introduced me to the Fantasy RPG concept and genre and is to this day my favorite Fantasy game. 9/10 Would Recommend. The only thing I would say bad about this game is Bethesda trying to milk this cow every chance they get. Three re-releases and now they're milking fallout. <3 this game though"

827,"If you haven't already tried this game, you were never probably gonna. 

Anyways, here's the plan. Buy this game, start a new game, and pick Wood Elf. Pump points into sneak, archery, and light armor. Might need either 1h or 2h weapon too if you're having trouble with just a bow (and you will early game). Can't go wrong enchanting too, but it's best for making money early game as it increases the value of any item you enchant, and then making your gear better late game (and you probably don't need money anymore). Create fortify health/restore health potions and poisons for your bow. Get the 3x sneak attack for bows under the Sneak tree pronto. Easy mode."
828,Always a fun time playing this gem!

841,something something--unspecified mods make the game good for some reason--something something--free pass to be a glitchy unfinished game--something something--THE ATMOSPHERE BRO--something something--dead arrow to the knee meme

843,fajna gierka na kilka godzinek co nie
844,"one of the most overrated games of all time. glorified modding platform, just like bugthesda fallouts"
845,i dont want to write a review
846,"SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL! FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF-

shit wrong game"
847,mods
848,So many things have been said about this game. It's just a requirement to play at this point.
849,"This game is nearly flawless. For how old it is and how many times I have beaten it, I still spend time playing it."
850,Skyrim has always been a fantastic game supported by the entire gaming community. Whether you are just playing vanilla or have a modded beast of a play-through you can enjoy the immersive and beautiful game.
851,"Ah Skyrim, what can I say? Altough I only play on Special Edition (Which is more stable and looks slightly better) Skyrim will be my first ever game that got me into modding and gave me a firsthand insight into the magical world of Bethesda games. Nearly any complaint or gripe you have with this game there's a mod that fixes it. Cities not big enough? There's a mod for that. Not enough Weapons or Equipment? There's mods for that too. Want jiggly dick and boobie physics? Got mods for that too my friend. 

The lands of Skyrim can literally be shaped into whatever you want. It's honestly the reason I have so many hours across these games. ~15-20 hours for my vanilla playthrough. The rest comes from... well... you get my point."
852,great game to get lost in.  342 hrs and still finding new areas and enemies/weapons to kill or make.
853,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
854,very good
855,hmm a shame this version doesnt appear on steam search anymore lol
856,Best game of all time.
857,i have not played this game for 108 hours
858,"my brother said he's never played skyrim but it's in his library and he's got 106 minutes of play time with it
anyways it's a good game, it's basically fallout in medieval times with a nice aesthetic and gorgeous graphics
i've only played it on xbox though but i doubt there's any difference"
859,I've played this game since it came out. I find it relaxing and fun even just roaming around.
860,It is a good game for the open world/action/medival/super natrual type game
861,I kind of like it.
862,"Very fun RPG. I started playing it on Xbox way back, and have just recently started playing it on PC. I love that it still feels the same (bugs and all)."
863,Do I Really Need to Explain Why?
864,special edition is better
865,The most perfect piece of shit that Todd made
866,284 hours I will never get back again

877,Its dope. Play it.
878,Is there a mod to make my cat meow rather than yell?
879,"I used to play this game all the time, then I took an arrow to the knee."

882,"Classic, Big modding community... lots of mods."
883,Classic open world game
884,I wish i had spent all that time in middle school on more important things than video games now that i'm an adult who plays casually.
885,Why dragon breast so small
886,"When I first started Skyrim I was simply blown away. It was my first Elder Scrolls game and I was quiet the beginner.
However, I was soon captivated by the world building, the lore, the nice mechanics and the gameplay, as well as the writting and the quests.

Skyrim does have its flaws and after over 600hrs in the game I can assure you that the good parts of this game definetly outweight these.

I recommend you that you should always play it vanilla (unmodded) first to get a taste of the original experience. But the good thing about this game is that no matter if modded or not, with a simple change in playstyle it feels fresh and vibrant again even thou it is the same game. 

Skyrim is definetly the game of this decade and a must-play! I rate it 10/10. enjoy!"
887,got my gains 10/10
888,"it still glitches on the beginning segment, and i cant alt-tab out."
889,"OG game, I like it"
890,Best Of
891,"so today hguys i reviev skyrim, so it good game but pro. i give good adive to you listen to me now. go go go!!"
892,"Still popular for a reason!  Even without mods, this is still a great action RPG.  Very lite on the RPG elements such as classes and stats, but the exploring is loads of fun, and Fus-Ro-Dahing a bear off the steep side of a mountain will never get old!"
893,great game
894,Should be listed again
895,Toddy H does it again
896,its aight ig
897,how is it still so broken after so many years and re-sales and special editions?
898,"Steam removed Skyrim from my account and my playtime is no longer viewable. wtf has happened??????

Edit: I ONLY HAVE 18 HOURS??? WTF??? I HAVE MORE!! WAY WAY MORE!!!
Edit: My play hours are STILL wrong, however steam said ""You requested removal"" NO A FREAKING DIDN'T! WTF!?

Game is good though."
899,"What hasn't already been said about skyrim, or most of the elder scrolls games? You can play for years and probably master some of what it offers, but not everything. It's diverse and extensive: lots of area to explore and quests to run, lots of gear to find or craft, and plenty of mods for all sorts of things.
Skills and leveling are never the same thru the series, so get a guide a study up. You'll still be finding new things within it for years."
900,I've played this **** on/off for 11 years and it doesn't get old.
901,punch the chicken
902,skyrim
903,"Its just a nice game in general, great graphics and nice textures. But the next time i play it, i do not wanna see a mammoth in a tree."

905,Fuck special edition
906,Love it

913,"Great game.
So far"
914,It is very fun and you can do anything its a free world and check it out i have played this game over and over and have had fun before so i hope you do too
915,"Its the best of every Elder Scrolls game rolled into one.  If you haven't played this yet, your life is incomplete!"
916,"The special edition has a lot of imporvements and you know, actually goes on sale, so you should probably take a hint from this one not showing up on Steam Store searches and just by that instead."
917,"All time classic, too many hours spent here."
918,i want new version pls
919,"This is the latest Game of the Elder Scrolls series, and is a real corker. Open ended world, with great story and great visuals. Highly recommended."
920,aaaaaaaaaaaa
921,Not too bad. I've heard you can even mod it too.
922,"Honestly, I can't really say anything more about the great enjoyment that this giant RPG brings that hasn't already been mentioned by previous reviewers. It's a wonderful product that defined my middle/high school years of playing video games. I have many fond memories of watching my friends play it on their Xbox 360 and being amazed by the expansiveness and possibilities available. Glitches aside, Bethesda made a great game and I would recommend ANY RPG fan to give it, or it's remaster, a try."
923,"a blast to play, 10/10
"
924,"Yes.

I use it to play vanilla with no DLC."
925,its like far cry.... but with swords!!!!
926,NO

931,It just works
932,I commited a crime in a city and when i left an area it saved and i got insta killed by the guards before i could go into any menu so i couldnt carry on playing the game
933,Decent game. play it.
934,"Amazing game. Revolutionary for it's time. Ideas behind it made for great time on the PS3. It's a shame Bethesda only gives 1/10th's a shit about their games. Enough effort to force several ""new editions"" of the game to the market over the years but does not upkeep their bugs and patches. The same has been evident about many of their newer games and has had terrible reputation. Game is pretty much unplayable. NPC's dying, NPC/Player/Items fly everywhere. Game was awesome when it is stable. Due to the fact that most companies fix their problems unlike Bethesda, I highly recommend to only pirate their games. Boycott Bethesda, they have shown constantly that they do not care about their players."
935,
936,"No clue why no one is talking about this game, it's great! For a game coming out in 2022, it could definitely use some higher resolution textures, smoother runtime, fishing, and mod compatibility, but oh well! Bethesda probably has a lot of other things going on. Guess I'll have to wait and see!"
937,The Best Moddable Sandboxed Game on Steam Period.
938,skrim gud
939,"I don't particularly like nostalgia unless it's my own, and this is just that."
940,"Its really good, had some issue with missing audio at the start but all i did was get an audio mod it worked! 100% worth the price!"
941,?
942,Still one of my most favorite games of all time
943,"imagine buying the same game more than once



this post was made by the OG skyrim gang"
944,"This is MY world. In here, I am KING. I'll do whatever and whomever I please. And, if I want to run it on a 10 year old, 1200 Watt, Quad-GPU smokestack in 2022, I WILL."

962,Best game ever. Hard to believe it's over a decade old.
963,Say. No. More.
964,This game was apart of my childhood (I used to play on Xbox 360 years ago) and it does a great job of putting in the world of Skyrim. I would have no problem paying the $60 for new releases for this 10-11 year old game\
965,it is a pretty good game and its story is one of my favourite but in a side quest the game bugges
966,"Since you have a choice between Special Edition and this, you should probably grab special edition... unless the mod you want was never adapted to Special Edition, then you're SOL."

968,"Massive open world, lots of replayability"
969,"My invincible lizard husband, Derkeethus, wasn't invincible as promised, so i uninstalled the game

derkeethus my beloved, he was so broken, the game was so broken
the dragons were invincible, my husband was not
3/10 didn't even get to kill the chicken"
970,The Skyrim Scrolls Skyrim: Special Skyrim Edition is great. Can't wait for Skyrim Scrolls 6: Skyrim 2
971,After 11 years I still really enjoy this game. There's still lots to do!
972,It's Skyrim. Buy it if you haven't yet
973,Skyrim is so good
974,It just works!
975,open world interesting game play
976,The now classic dungeon crawler and still one of the best open world games
977,By Talos this can't be happening
978,"I loved tha whole experience it gives. You can do really anything while open world works perfectly - while being somewhat unplannable, and i love being maker of my own journey. Oh, and for stealing: may all bless you, creator!"
979,Great game despite being 10+ years old. 9/10
980,Yes
981,"3 hours trying to complete the very first cutscene the horse either dies and you cannot continue or you tokyo drift around and get stuck somewhere, not the game i remember from years ago"
982,"Install > mod it for hours > only play for about 15 minutes/session > finally bored > uninstall > forget about it for 3-4 months > repeat.

Always hoping for that '1st time playing' feelings to come again, but i know it wouldn't. Still a great game nonetheless. (sorry for potato english)"
983,"e
"
984,I think I haven't played enough yet of this gem.
985,"this game was my childhood, me and my brother beat it together in 2011 before he relapsed"
986,COCK and BALLS
987,Great game where I spent many hours to complete all the quests and became quite attached to the game where I adopted 2 kids. The choices you make affect how the game pans out
988,"Such good fun. On the computer you get access to mods and console commands, which make this game super fun even for casual gamers. Don't like the grind? Just console command your way to level 99, max perks, and OP armor. Then go beat the game :)"

990,fusrodah
991,nice
992,Lots of mods (on nexusmods) will provide beautiful graphics and you can follow whatever quest and story you have the most fun with.  The old people who shouldn't play are those who always need to be told what to do.
993,its still fun
994,It's Skyrim.
995,After 11 years I finally beat Skyrim
996,can not stop playing! so great
997,"Hey you, you're finally awake"
998,It's just works!
999,I have a huge special interest in this game in particular and i love getting lost in the hours of exploring and somehow finding new ways to experience the same old world time and time again. Very fun to do RP runs with.
1000,Literally the best game ever
1001,I don't think anything can ever justify the amount of time out of my life i have spent playing this game but i have zero regrets
1002,mid tbh
1003,"This game is a classic. You know this, I know this. 
PLAY IT."
1004,I LOVE
1005,you can eat in the rain forest cafe
1006,"Its fun, cant complain."
1007,I think this game is good
1008,serenaholic
1009,skyrim is my virtual hometown
1010,"Hours of endless fun, even years later.  One of the most re-playable games on the market."
1011,Fun. Re-playable. Cool glitches. Best game ever. 10/10
1012,it just works!
1013,ive been playing this game since it was first released on console. sure it's a buggy mess but its a fun buggy mess. need to get my hours up on pc version though. these are rookie numbers.
1014,"Hi,
Skyrim has a lot of features to admire in a in-game setting. If you like divers character builds then you will like Skyrim. The plot has almost a never ending segment that covers a vast territory. Skyrim is a masterful sequel to Oblivion. 
Adam"
1015,best game ever made
1016,Classic game.
1017,"i like this game, very cool game, okay thank u bye"
1018,good
1019,All the yes's!
1020,"Overall it is a good game, but after many attempts to finish the main quest it loses my attention, mainly because almost every feature is average or below."
1021,Awesome game. MAKE 6 ALREADY
1022,most my hours on my old xbox account but loved this
1023,Where did this one go?
1024,"I think Skyrim was the first game I was genuinely addicted to, and I think it may have been the first RPG I played. I first bought it on the PS3 maybe a year after it came out and the first thing I did was spend hours on making a perfect character. 
When I finally got on my way I continued wasting time by jumping all the way up to the mountain to Bleak Falls Barrow because I didn't even think about the fact that they might have made an actual road to get there. 
It even took me a few years before I found out there was a Troll on the way to the Greybeards.

Although I really enjoyed it, and I even knew most of the lore at some point and trying to collect all the books in the game, I really can't seem to get back into it. It might just be the fact that I played it too much, or maybe nostalgia makes it seem better than it is, or I've just outgrown it. I wish I could just reset my memory and play it for the first time again, because I can still remember that feeling of playing it for the first time, I just can't get that feeling anymore when I boot the game up now."
1025,GOAT game
1026,get it
1027,its skyrim.
1028,"One of the best experience I've ever had in a video game. 
See that mountain? You can climb it."
1029,Love Elder Scrolls games
1030,still great all these years later
1031,it has good storyline and is able to run on almost every device including xbox playstation pc and even laptop
1032,Its a fun fantasy game play it
1033,thIS GAME ID THE BOMB!
1034,"I have played this and SE for years, got hooked on it when i was a kid and fell in love with the lore and stories. I still replay this game as i always find new characters to create for different story lines. Its a fun game in my opinion and worth the purchase. SE is pretty good as well if you want slight changes to the graphics :)"
1035,"Skyrim. First gaming experience for most, and first modding experience for even more. The key word here is 'modding'. Game's fine on its own, but it's decades old. If you're new to Skyrim, or any Bethesda title in general, do yourself a favour; download the Vortex Mod Loader, and head over to Nexus Mods. Install Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE), and then enjoy the wonderful world of mods that people have made, to bring a glorious, but old game, into the current day."
1036,I have bought this game 4 times now
1037,I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES I HATE HIGH ELVES

1039,Its a very fun game but the glitches kinda ruin the immersion
1040,yes very nise ver y good
1041,the best
1042,"Yes, this game rocks! My son played it for years and I watched every now and then. One day I decided to sit down and have a go at it myself. 

Fun. Lots of hidden items, lots of loot, lots of variety. As a novice, I was happy to learn the console commands to help me along the way. I have now just downloaded Obliviion as per my son's suggestion."

1046,good
1047,Evejn recommends🔓💜
1048,Probably one of the best games I've ever played
1049,It just works.
1050,"I have both the Special Edition and the original edition of the game and have been playing the original edition for years now completing all main and most side quests. I just played today by wandering the outdoors area and still discovered new side quests. It seems that this game always has something new for you to discover even after years of playing it, I have not even started playing the special edition. I will start once I am satisfied with my progress on the original game."
1051,"first time ever playing this classic would reccomend
"
1052,Fus-Ro-Dah
1053,Good game. One mini uncomfortable thing ... cant easily ctrl+tab (or use windows key) out  to google about say the game itself.
1054,"Download the Master Chief follower mod, it's really immersive."
1055,if you download a shitton of mods its awesome
1056,"80% testing mods
20% playing the game"
1057,"just play this game for the first time and having a lot of fun.

does this game pay my bills?
yes
-
does this game offer me sex?
yes"
1058,"After spending HUNDREDS of hours desperately exploring and questing i could not find the bare-feet spell. This was a deal breaker, as it was the only reason i bought this game in the first place. Todd Howard is a hack fraud and no one should ever give him the time of day after this complete and utter failure on his part. 0/10 and would spend the rest of my day keeping other people from buying this garbage."
1059,skyrim (the game).
1060,good
1061,"If the number of hours that I have played this game for do not show how much I love this game, then little else will. With the Mod Workshop and the many different creators and designers that also love this game pouring their own TLC into the game, it is truly something beautiful."
1062,"Get special edition, way more stable for modding"
1063,Skyrim is the best game I've ever played in my life.
1064,I recommend not installing mods until you beat the game because I was too impatient and it ruined my save which is kinda my bad to be honest but it was still a fun game highly recommend
1065,"I have always had a fondness for RPGs when open world RPGs became a thing, I got even more fond. This is, in my opinion the pinnacle or open world RPGs, for fantasy genre. The story is epic the levelling is well designed and quite flexible. The combat is good but FPS was never really designed for melee combat. Being able to mod and customise the game play  is unequal. I could not recommend this game more and it has been 11 years since its release."
1066,It's ok.
1067,break ur neck pls
1068,Finally done with character creation!
1069,it´s ok
1070,"I have loved this game since I started playing it in 2012. With booking over 1000 hours of play, it would seem obvious as my favorite game from Bethesda. Well, that would be right. Plus, my other favorite game is also created by Bethesda, Elder Scrolls Online. If you want to do multi-player, play ESO. As for me, I prefer playing first person, so I tend to play Skyrim before playing ESO. I don't play a whole lot at once, but I do enjoy my time creating things in skyrim, especially the houses you get to build. It feels nostalgic now that I have played for so long, but it never gets boring."
1071,its a lot more fun than i originally thought! and usually i play social or peaceful game so it surprised me when i played until morning without even noticing
1072,i die and it fun
1073,its skyrim bruv
1074,"it is skyrim lol
"
1075,"Ive spent endless ours on this game. I played it back on the Ps 3 for +800 hours and another 500 on PC. It was my entire childhood. The game itself is 50% godsent masterpiece and 50% utter garbage and i love every single bit of it. It has by far the biggest modding community out there and is for a reason the most milked game from bethesda. 

It is 100% worth the price if you install a few bugfixing mods (wich is fairly easy and those should be on the games workshop anyways) but even without any bugfixing you should be able to get a blast out of it. Obviously the game is riddled with small or gamebreaking bullsh*t, completely broken unbalanced exploits and nazeem, but it wont outweigh being able to see lydia getting catapulted into the atmosphere by giants. The main quest is quite bland and i mostly straight up just ignore it. Most of the sidequests however, are very good. The DLC's have done a great job comparatively.

I would only recommend this game with all DLC's included and the willingness to install some bugfixing mods."
1076,"it's skyrim, buy the special edition or anniversary edition instead though.

Vanilla is good, but mods are always better."
1077,this game i love to deth
1078,I've played this alot longer on xbox but I do suggest this game it is amazing and from what i heard the storyline is the best part the gameplay is hard but still possible and you can add amazing mods aswell
1079,"This game is great. Also, if the game is glitching on your PC you should unplug your computer until you are done customising your character. I got this game as a gift, but I'm certain the price is worth it."
1080,yes
1081,"Warning Dont Use The caqs consle command
"
1082,"Load the game - Crash
Start a new game - Crash
Tab out of the game - Crash
Try to enjoy the game - Crash
About to leave a dungeon? - Crash
My computer specs aren't the problem, it's Bethesda"
1083,Good game!
1084,IT BE PRETTY GOOD
1085,"top 5 games ever made
whenever people say the word, ""video game"", you should think of this masterpiece
I would personally recommend to bump that difficulty up, download some mods from nexus/vortex, and enjoy"
1086,Never played it but it's the good ol' oldrim.
1087,All I will say is that there are very few games out there that has been as captivating as TES:Skyrim. From the moment you start the game you get completely immersed into its world and the ongoing events. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE!!!
1088,"You already know.
"
1089,"Literally doing this for the badge, but its skyrim. You've most likely played it. 

Look at how popular it is more than 10 years after release. Enough said."
1090,is skyrim
1091,Broken game. Fun.
1092,Gangster
1093,i like Skyrim.
1094,"Combat, magic and good old fashion dragon's. Whats not to love?"
1095,"-make a character
-play it until you hit lvl 20
-""oh wait that random enemy's attack looked so good""
-make a new character
-happen again
-never go back to your old characters
"
1096,"Greatest Game Ever Made!
"
1097,transcends time and space being considered the greatest game of all time in every possible timeline with the second and third games being rereleases of skyrim. Tod truly is one of the greatest minds to have ever exist and to ever exist and his work will be remembered far past the end of the human empire.
1098,lol
1099,i've played the game way more than 264 hours been playing it for years off and on on different systems. the game is great and you dont really get bored of it if it is the style of game that you play
1100,"Skyrim is a classic obviously. I personally recommend The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion over The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. However I still highly recommend Skyrim, and if you want the game but don't wanna spend the full price of the Special Edition, the original is just as good, with just as good of a modding potential as Special Edition."
1101,"It's alright, but I think it'll be much better on the next gen consoles"
1102,"Do you get to the cloud district very often? What am I saying, of course you don't.

Not until you get this game that is!"
1103,:)
1104,because porn mods
1105,This is like my 8th Skyrim Purchase. If that says anything.
1106,"good game lizard cool
"
1107,"This is a very good game. I've spent lots of hours doing whatever I feel like, I also like getting to join all factions, unrealistic, but fun. you can also become your 12 year old fantasy of being a werewolf. and eat people. and be a stealth archer and kill the boss with 3 shots, and *get in back, i'll drive*"
1108,Great game!
1109,it great with the heartfire dlc and dragonborn dlc
1110,You can play as cat. Is good
1111,Shout people they fly
1112,"10/10 all day everyday 
"
1113,"I'm finally taking the time to review games I've played. I have to say, Skyrim is one of my all-time favorites. Very re-playable and there is no shortage of things to do. Great gameplay and mechanics."
1114,justin langman simulator
1115,"played this game since the day it came out. i highly recommend this game, with pc there are so many oppertunities and new things to do with this game. the mods are amazing and so is the vanilla game."
1116,best game ever .!! Can't stop playing it
1117,(y)
1118,"great game

"
1119,Me costo jugarlo al principio pero tiene unos detalles que para los roleros son la leche.
1120,Classic. Def one I would say everyone should play through once
1121,"mods are your friend




usually...."
1122,this game is wack I love it
1123,fus roh dah
1124,the games alright just dont go too deep into the mods otherwise you'll see something you didnt want to
1125,Yes.
1126,"Legendary game. One of the most popular games ever made and for good reason. Skyrim has an expansive an immersive world, lots to do, lots to explore, and lots to like. It's a Bethesda game, so there is definitely just as expansive a list of bugs with the game, but thankfully there are mods that fix most issues in the game. Speaking of mods, there are an incredible number of them! You can change the game to extreme levels, even making it essentially an entirely different game which keeps the replay-ability high! When factoring in mods, there's not much I can say negative about the game."
1127,Combat is outdated.
1128,Second fav game behind FONV.
1129,Playable on Steam Deck! 🙂
1130,Classic ES game!
1131,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1132,"Tartışmaya gerek yok yılların oyunu işte.
"
1133,"You can't beat the classics! Well, yes you can because now you can get all the workshop mods and play this game exactly how you want to."
1134,ok
1135,its ok i guess
1136,it's skyrim
1137,"I don't know why this version of Skyrim is hidden but I played a lot of it and own it though the store says I don't see top comment for link to the original. I do still support Bedthesda tho, its an amazing game company"
1138,Elder Scrolls VI waiting room
1139,YO
1140,Best replayability of any game in the past 10 years. So many hidden gems
1141,great game!
1142,"this is the worst game probably ever, buy it."
1143,"this game is like crack, whack but you keep coming back to it year on year and before you know it 11 years has passed and oh god where has the time gone"
1144,one of the best  ever made !
1145,Big dragons
1146,"The game's skill system captivated me at first. I liked the 'you progress skills that you use' approach. I restarted a lot. I liked the possiblities what a new character meant.
Then I discovered Requiem. It changed the way I look at Skyrim. It made it harder, but more rewarding to play. The game world made more sense, became harsher.
I tried vanilla again just to get all achievements and it was waay too easy after requiem.
All in all great game with endless possibilities thanks to mods."
1147,very nice
1148,"Skyrim has changed game history. This game is a masterpiece to play. If you like medieval times, killing dragons, werewolves, fighting vampires, becoming an assassin, being a wizard, and saving the world from evil or becoming evil. Then this game is for you. It's got all sorts of different bosses you can fight too. Plus, you can mod this game to your liking! Also, even when you think you are done with the game you are not. There is so much in the world of skyrim that hasn't been explored yet. Maybe you can shout out and be the first discover it."
1149,I hate the fact that if every time i download the game i end restarting from zero and playing too much for weeks.
1150,alduin kinda hot
1151,It's alright
1152,Fuck hearthfire
1153,amazing game must have in your collection
1154,worse that new vegas
1155,"(Note: Vanilla game only, zero mods)
Likes: Cool Fus Ro Dah (abilities in general), entertaining quest lines, pretty much absolute freedom

Dislikes: Freedom is wasted because a lot of quests are also dead ends/boring, Magic is somehow really boring too."
1156,Very Exciting!
1157,"Vast open world with beautiful scenery but with a very lacking combat gameplay and in my opinion a main quest that constrains the ""open-world"", since you are the chosen one and will be known and treated as the chosen one instead of creating your own path in a open-world.
Modding for this game is amazing but ultimately didn't help my experience enough to do a full playthrough. Combat just sucks in this game. Most of my playtime hours are because I let Skyrim running in the background or when testing my way too eager modlist."
1158,Wonderful game that immerses you in the stories.
1159,"came to the store to buy the dlc after finally getting around to playing it and what do i get but ""unlisted on the steam store"" bethesda im literally trying to give you money here. negative iq."
1160,"fun, getb the og one, the anniversary edition is buggy as hell"
1161,veri gud
1162,I think you are legally required to own a copy or two of Skyrim before you can call yourself an actual gamer.
1163,"From my point of view, this game sucks.
It lags and bugs so much, river noises keep bugging and the enemies are glitching.
I have a 2060 rtx and amd ryzen 7... 16 gb ram... I think it should handle...
Plus, when I alt tab, it somehow bugs and sometimes it freezes or 
I can keep playing but my cursor literally shows up(windows cursor) and I think that the sensitivity it's slowing somehow...
Idk if it's me or the settings I have or idk... it's just a crap."
1164,"Skyrim remains a masterpiece due to its countless interesting quests, engaging combat and stunning world-building."
1165,its  MFin skyrim yall.  duh.
1166,best game ever
1167,"love it
"
1168,"They should of left this on steam as like many of us brought this and then brought the special edition also which made them more money. 
even now i have both editions installed as it is nice to compare the differences 
so no can not say it is great as it has been removed."
1169,This game will take over your free time and you will love it.
1170,!
1171,"Loved the series, highly recommend."
1172,Super buggy and awesome!  like Goat Simulator!!!
1173,"Like the open world and being able to play as I wish. Can use different characters and can modify and adapt as i wish, not per a set of ground rules. Nice graphics, mechanics are good. the NPC's get old as they keep spouting the same garbage, but doesn't make it unplayable. Overall it is a good game, and I keep coming back and trying different things to either maximize my power, or take other options in the world."
1174,Skitz as
1175,It's worth the buy and a great game by itself the the best way to play?  Mods.

1179,Mod it into oblivion
1180,best game ever made
1181,Skyrim
1182,This game has been out for years and it doesn't matter how many times I've played through it  I always find myself re-downloading it and playing. It's a game made out of it generation and it still to this day is one of my all time favorites.
1183,I think the amount of time I put into this game is all the review I need.
1184,I AM A MAN AND MAKE MY OWN PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN
1185,"I struggled to get used to the game. But i'm gonna be trying again and see how it goes. I wanna play and like the game a lot, just like most other players. We'll see..."
1186,"Only played it a bit, (212 hours) pretty good"
1187,"the plot for this game is retarded, i steal shit from a dungeon then like fucking kill a dude then being focred to kill a dragon then i learned how to n word then i sent to like this place and these white guys gave me stronger n word"
1188,good
1189,It's like Skyrim with swords
1190,"Classic game. Played vanilla for 50 hours and got about half way through . Now gonna checkout some mods and finish it
"
1191,Great graphics. Great gameplay.  I keep coming back and trying different characters and skill sets.
1192,One of the best ever.
1193,good
1194,"it was fun when you were a kid and had never played anything like it, but in hindsight it's painfully bland and uninspired.
It is completely boring from top to bottom: writing, combat and level design"
1195,"""At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search."" Need i say more ?"
1196,i like killing everyone in sight
1197,"The stupid steam does not track nexus hours, but I have over 2000, I know, applause."
1198,Fun
1199,all time favorite
1200,"Life, is like a Bethesda game. sometimes the cutscene maybe doesn't break, sometimes ur gf is flung into space by a 9 foot giant with a large stick."
1201,"Get a bug-fixing mod, otherwise nearly unplayable"
1202,skyrim
1203,play regular then play mods
1204,"The map is of such limited use.
It becomes tiresome trying to find a castle on a mountain top or even the route into a city that I've just given up."
1205,"This game is amazing. It goes without saying that this is probably the best Bethesda title in the last 10 years (and that's saying something since the game released precisely 10 years ago). 

It has the replayability of a god-made game, an immersive story, amazing world map, incredible quest line/plot, and never-ending activities and the best part: It also has the biggest modding community in the world! I played it in my Hp pavillion on the release date and it literally melted, but was still worth it, because 10 years later I'm still playing it, but in my MSI rig. Undoubtedly one of the best."
1206,Skyrim made me a Dragon Born more times than I died to that damn Ice Troll climbing the mountain to meet the Grey Beards.
1207,a very extensive game with lots of content
1208,skrim
1209,USE SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITON
1210,"Great game, too bad it crashes all the time because of some rendering error."
1211,"Game is really bad. 
No choices, bad story, bad characters, boring combat, gutted magic. 
It's content is as wide as an ocean, but as shallow as a mud puddle."
1212,"thank you todd howard for giving me the opportunity to realise i fucking wasted my life, great game"
1213,ive had skyrim for five days and have 30 hours on it so far. this game is ruining my life 11/10 would play again
1214,
1215,"What a game , definitely one of the greats."
1216,"i kill things good ye
"
1217,buy game play......
1218,Sims medieval done right
1219,It's Skyrim. It's incredible. Even the bugs and glitches (of which there are Bethesda many) are often entertaining.
1220,"It's a good game with a lot of replayability. The open world nature of it makes it so that you can choose to follow the main storyline at your own pace. You can even ignore it completely and just explore the world.

That said, the game is showing its age now and the graphics are a bit out of date. It's still worth the time though."
1221,kinda good
1222,"I played this game a lot on the switch, so I ended up buying it on PC to get a more mod-able version. I really like it and I think it's just one of those games that can appeal to most people. I mean, why are you reading reviews for SKYRIM?"
1223,yes
1224,"Modded it to fuck, eventually could no longer run it, it was well good. Will be sure to stay away in case I lose any more time to this place. Thumbs up."
1225,"played it for over 300 hours back in the day on my PlayStation 3. I would recommend this to anyone who loves RPG's and open world games. Be mindful though, a lot of bugs are present in this game."
1226,.
1227,Fus Roh Dah goes BOOM
1228,i am cat :3 khajiit very good
1229,balls
1230,Quite fun
1231,"Ahh, Skyrim… it’s difficult to pinpoint what it is exactly that keeps me coming back to you. I’ve purchased you so many different times, I’ve lost count.
Skyrim is a staple in my world of gaming; an absolute necessity in any game library.
From the moment you first open your eyes in the back of a wagon—no, from the moment you see the “Bethesda Game Studios Presents,” and hear that brilliant Jeremy Soule soundtrack for the very first time… you are instantly transported into the world of Nirn and the great lands of Tamriel.
This game plays well even eleven years later. Bethesda successfully created a format and standard by which I now hold every game accountable to with the release of Skyrim. They set the bar higher than it had ever been. Many games released today fail to reach it.
Skyrim is an epic, and I can literally go on and on shilling for it all day with no shame. I love this game and everything it has brought forward in the gaming industry since it’s release.
And yes, I did just copy and paste this from my earlier review of the Special Edition. But the game is so good, it deserves a good review on each release."
1232,good soup
1233,"Skyrim is a classic, good game."
1234,meh
1235,Nothing amazing. Its alright.
1236,anyone else not able to play dragonborn dlc? only have dawnguard and hearthfire for some reason
1237,It is okay if you have free time always focus on yourself
1238,IT IS TOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
1239,The game won't work for me
1240,better than SE
1241,"Old game at this point, but always fun to come back to. Can't wait till Elder Scrolls 6"
1242,Check ingame screenshots for an idea of what this can still be :)
1243,"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Mudcrabs on fire off the coast of Windhelm. I watched arrows glitter in the dark near the Solitude Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like… Crimson Nirnroots in Blackreach. Time to Logout.

...for an hour or so.
"
1244,It's Skyrim. Who hasn't played it multiple versions?
1245,The pinnacle of gaming.
1246,This on PC without the Problems it had on Console FINALLY
1247,POV: Anime Protagonist Simulator
1248,Stop re-releasing a mediocre buggy RPG with the same bugs.
1249,Been playing this game since i was in mums tummy. finally save enough penny to buy the real thing. finish this game a long time ago. just bought it because it reminded me of my times when i was able to enjoy my childhood and now the world is full of despair cant even compare. brings me a lot of fun seeing bugs with this game. game breaking bugs. and yes i cant even play games now more often since i became an adult. if don't play any games on steam any more i must be dead at that point. bye now.
1250,"It's skyrim, dude, just get it."
1251,nice fantasy game
1252,"i've been playing since it came out, keep coming back to it although i always quit it because it bugs out most of the time but its always a nice time going to the mountains and the ruins taking in the ambiance and the glorious music, alwlays nice to kill some dudes here and there and rolepplaying some buff kight or a magician.
Ye its old but you can always mod it if you give the time and effort do to so,, i personaly like the vanila game
so i dont bother much with mods but it can be fun and certainly a better expirance at this point if you're new to this game... Anyway nice game, relaxing fun and totaly replayable."
1253,cool
1254,fun to mod
1255,racist nords
1256,"bleming good mate
"
1257,Is good
1258,"Very good game, enjoyed playing for some time.
Note - Purchased Anniversary edition and found it impossible to play - worst purchase I made from Steam"
1259,Out of this world!
1260,gg XD
1261,"I literally installed steam to play Skyrim, in highschool, in 2011. My online games experience up until that point had been flash games and f2p Korean games. There's a lot I don't like about Skyrim. The story is weak, the characters are unmemorable, the combat lacks punch, the character building choices inconsequential. For almost every aspect of what makes a good RPG, I can think of another game that does it better than this one. However, Skyrim is a gaming Colossus, a landmark title and a shining peak for Bethesda I do not think they've matched since. If you've somehow not played Skyrim up to this point, do it."
1262,The loot system sucked and level scaling is a garbage game mechanic. Morrowind was the height of the series and will probably never be surpassed.
1263,
1264,"Step 1: Mod it until it breaks
Step 2: Mod it until its fixed
Step 3: Profit"
1265,"Like the other comments say, it's skyrim.
Give it a try"
1266,Fucking trash game constantly closes for no reason
1267,So many bugs can't be bothered to reload over and over again. Not sure what the hype is all about.
1268,"Game is okay, another basic fantasy game at this point. Bethesda has really fallen off over the years though. How hard is it to add co-op without the use of mods? The answer is it's not. The game was good for 2011 and that's about it. Without the modding community this game is literal trash at this point. Wont be supporting this company  in the future! Don't even get me started with Starfield. LOL They are extremely lazy now."
1269,"classis, iconic, legendary"
1270,come on its fricking skyrim
1271,"a
"
1272,"It's still fun in 2022, and isn't that really the bottom line? Skyrim has aged; there's no denying it. It's not the biggest RPG anymore, nor is does it have a particularly high quality of graphics (not counting mods, of course). But underneath at all, it's still a blast to play."
1273,poopy
1274,"Mods, do mod it"
1275,never gets old.
1276,Recommended provided you spend some hours with links-Plus2
1277,Mod it to make betta graphics. Extremely worth playing.
1278,a classic game that holds its charm over the years
1279,Just play the game.
1280,Who has played this game and didn't like it. No one. This game is iconic and will forever me my favorite game.
1281,Always find myself coming back to this game
1282,"Really good game, shame the devs still haven't fixed big bugs or crashes. If you can overlook the crashing and things not always working perfectly, then it's definitely worth picking up"
1283,Game sucks :)
1284,buy skyrim
1285,still amazing game
1286,skyr
1287,best game still in 2022
1288,Last good Bethesda game.
1289,I have so many hours in this game and some how never left a review. This is the game that made me a Bethesda fan and also made me appreciate top tier RPGs. Instant classic.
1290,"So this game is over 10 years old now. Is it worth getting it now?

I bought it when it was new, and liked it. But I was very busy IRL and the times I could play ended up getting further and further apart. And ended up forgetting about it 50 hours in.

I've had some more time recently and decided to fire it up again with a brnad new character. I'm now 150 new hours in, and I'm hooked. This game definitely stands the test of time. If you love open world RPGs, this is a classic. So many ways to play it, and none of them are wrong. You don't have to play any of the previous Elder Scrolls games to enjoy this one just as much.

If you're considering Skyrim, and especially catch a great Steam sale. Do it."
1291,gud
1292,I mean Who didn't hear of Skyrim at this point!
1293,Love this game! Skyrim is awesome!
1294,skyrim
1295,Awesome in every way
1296,"fun.
"
1297,Good Game
1298,"One of my most played games ever across all platforms and I adore the exploration and world that was crafted in this game. Something to keep in mind though is how poorly the combat and AI has aged. If you haven't already experienced this game it can be really hard to get into especially if you have experienced more modern RPG's prior to playing this one. I love Skyrim but I would consider some of the downsides before recommending this one, and I certainly would not recommend picking it up at full price."
1299," Spent half my teens, downloading lewd mods and starring at my characters fat ass... Im sorry, what was the question again? Oh yes... Recommended!"
1300,"This game is... OK

But the game itself has a lot of issues

dumb ass NPC's that block your path

lots of bugs 

lots of balance issues - magic for example, sucks

the worst UI for a pc game i've ever seen

The story is .. ok. the side quests are.. passable. i guess.

Anyways. You're gonna have to install a few mods (thanks community members - because bethesda cant be bothered) to fix the UI, the balance and so on. There's a shit ton of mods, and at this point the whole game seems to be more of a community / modding efffort, than anything bethesda could (or should )be proud of."
1301,"dragons are fun, carry weight limit is not"
1302,Awesome game
1303,dragon
1304,e
1305,"Amazing game i love it. I like how it's fast paced, somewhat calming and beautiful at time ,and action packed at other times. It's a great game if you love to be the star of the show or the brave hero of the movie. great game despite many flaws ,and the community is great and the mods you can get are top notched and produced by the best of the community."
1306,10/10 you can fuck orcs
1307,This game is a great RPG.  Tons of stuff to do and many ways to do it.  Lots of fun.
1308,"good indie game not many people know about it i reccomend
"
1309,The best game ever created!!
1310,love this game
1311,very good game lots of fun to spam arrows
1312,No microtransactions
1313,"Even after years, this game is still good.
The game still has some bugs but they can be fixed with tutorials.
Overall, good game, but don't mod it too much or else it will crash often."
1314,"Lazy writing, anti-climatic main quests, a lot of ""fetch and bring back"" quests, boring grey landscapes and graphics"
1315,"Great game, could do with better ""Romance"" and companions"
1316,"This is one of the best games ever made, but this is the wrong version. The ""Skyrim Anniversary Edition"" is the one you want. This version is riddled with gamebreaking bugs when played on modern PCs. In my game, I cannot start a new file, because the cart in the beginning is rolling down the mountain, and never makes it to Helgen. Buy the Anniversary Edition!"
1317,"Simply put, Skyrim is a game which you never truly 'finish.' Even when you stop playing, you only ever take a break, not put the game away forever. You will be back at some point."
1318,"Playing this game again after years.. Skyrim is just like my second home ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ 
I hope I can erase my memories and play it again for the first time.

"
1319,Yes
1320,"Very good game. Good experience all around supposedly. I would say it's weakest area is the story. Very generic. Very bland. It is unseasoned food.

So you need seasoning to make the game several orders of magnitude tastier. Feel free to download as many mods as you wish to heighten your experience.

"
1321,"Because Bethsida decides it loves to release the same game over again, and removing the old instances off of the store."
1322,Again please
1323,love the game
1324,Lick it
1325,better than big bang theory
1326,big good
1327,good
1328,Yes
1329,Its a really great game if you have the time really time consuming but still a great game
1330,I just played because Bob Lennon played it
1331,"Love this game, very fun and worth every penny. And more.."
1332,"One of the best action rpgs I have ever played. 

"
1333,Best version of this game
1334,"For a game that came out years ago it is still really enjoyable, and if you can find the right mods, there is almost always something new to explore. My goal was to get 100% completion and it took forever, highly recommend this game."
1335,PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW OR BE A SINNER
1336,its ok
1337,adventure and a chance to have powers that in real life I don't or cannot have.
1338,THINGS THAT WORKED WITH A VANILLA INSTALL NO LONGER WORK-PLEASE STOP PATCHING THIS GAME. IF YOU WANT TO BREAK SOMETHING GO DO IT TO ANNIVERSARY EDITION OR SSE.
1339,Old but gold.
1340,I love the Open World RPG!!!
1341,"\Love the game
"
1342,skyrim
1343,mmmmmmmmmmm gud game
1344,"Stole an iron helmet and iron shoes from Hadvar's uncle as soon as he went to his house to invite us, didn't notice I stole his armor, some dude stared at me and got angry, so I offered him some wine and he started dabbing and drinking in front of his child, I love this game already."
1345,is good
1346,it fun
1347,great
1348,"THE GAME DOES NOT WORK.
FIX YOUR GAME BETHESDA. 
YOUR DADS TOUCH YOUNG BOYS"
1349,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."
1350,"Skyrim is a classic RPG that for many people was an introduction to what open world could be. Now it is clunky and dated, with it being released and re-released so many times that it is clear that it has just become a cash grab. It was impressive when it came out, but now it has been out for over a decade, and it has not aged well. 
Skyrim suffers from what many open world games do, it is spread too thin without enough of a basis in order to provide a good experience while playing. Its map is large, but so many parts of it feel the same, and so many parts do not feel unique. The base combat is simple to the point of boring, and many mechanics reduce to number checks. Speech provides small benefits, but often if you make a minimum requirement it unlocks a new option for dialogue. Most skills that do not affect crafting or combat are like this, and it is unfortunate.
This game has left its mark on gaming, but I really don’t think it is worth coming back to. Many people feel such nostalgia for it, but it does not hold up well. When compared to newer games, Skyrim falls flat, and it isn’t worth getting a bad old game that has been re-released as a cash grab."
1351,fun
1352,meh
1353,"362.9 hours and most of that time was testing mods back when this first came out i played the PS3 version so most of my time is on that but damn after all this time still nothing of value when it comes to the 6th game and now they choose to ""unlisted"" this for some dumb reason heck i have friend on here that rather buy this version. I havent played too much this past few months but once i check out more mods i got to start again got to get to good old 400hours sometime right also i own Skyrim SE too but cant be bother to play that one"
1354,gud game
1355,⠀
1356,Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
1357,"Do I really need to say something about it ? I don't think so.
Must play"
1358,"too much lore.

12/10. would play on my toaster if ported."
1359,"A great addictive game hours of good experiences in all aspects, a work of art."
1360,This is a really good game with a dungens and dragons feel
1361,gud
1362,lol
1363,Best after the 11th playthrough
1364,Don’t !
1365,"This game is incredibly timeless. I've played many different builds though the main story and DLC and still have more to do and try. Hunting for secrets, collecting all the books, seeing all the things? You'll be playing forever."
1366,+
1367,10/10 Classic
1368,"great game huge map
"
1369,There's a reason this game still has so many players and such an active community. A positive review almost feels redundant.
1370,say goodbye to your time
1371,finally skyrim without stutter
1372,Best game of all time
1373,its definitely a game
1374,Great Game and great replayablity.
1375,"Game doesn't even work. Cart to Helgen bugs out, tons of visual & audio bugs. Probably better off buying the Special Edition."
1376,"Bruh, it's Skyrim. This doesn't need a long review, everyone needs to play this."
1377,"I've gotten Skyrim on Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, and PC. Been playing since release even until now in 2022. I love Skryim, and will keep coming back for more from time to time."

1381,Da Game

sneak 100 in 10 minute with a rustic dagger i found in a stinking cave.
lovely game"
1383,crap
1384,:))))))))))))))))))))))))
1385,"Bro, come on. It's Skyrim. This game alone set some boundaries and basics for what Adventure/RPG games should be. This game is a decade (or over) old and remains to be a classic, vanilla or modded. I can't even describe how good this game is and why it upholds its title and an instant and a maintaining hit. Just play it."
1386,good
1387,this game maek cok hard
1388,PLAY IT NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW
1389,
1390,E
1391,"13/10 
You know this is Skyrim."
1392,"Probably the greatest RPG of all time IMO, and certainly the best I've ever played. I probably replay this game to it's completion once every 3-5 years, so never gets old for me. Highly recommended to newcomers and veterans alike of RPG's."
1393,Play for 10 years and still never stop to amuse me with entertainment... Love it to the max!
1394,I love this game. That's all.

We need less weebs. Stop making anime weeb loser mods, you filthy perverts."
1403,good
1404,"the game is dumb and doesnt have windowed fullscreen. it also made me wanna neck trying to alt tab.  somehow it managed to fuck my sound card up and force me to close it in order to hear idiots talking on discord.

1405,great game do recomend exept for the strip club in it

1408,Don't hesitate to play download now
1409,"the possibility is ENDLESSS........so are the mods ; p
"
1410,"I wish I could erase all my memories with this game, just so I can experience it all over again and be blown away by it.
It´s Skyrim, for gods sake! Don´t read reviews! 
Stroll the endless fields of Whiterun, travel to the most northern point of Tamriel, reach the top of the Throat of the World and embrace the view, clear bandit camps and caves from dangerous enemies and creatures, shout yourself through countless fights, enjoy relaxing moments by the lakes and in the forests, watch the northern lights in awe, fight dragons and absorb their souls, talk to the common folk with their everyday problems in the many inns, or just listen to one of the best and most memorable and emotional soundtracks in gaming history and get lost in one of the best games ever made. This game changed gaming forever.
And it only gets better with the thousands of mods that have been released over the years. You can really create your own version of the game, with countless features, weapons, regions, things that you always wished for and one that you could call ""Skyrim - The Definitive Edition""."
1411,its fallout without guns
1412,It's Skyrim. What more is there to say?
1413,One of my favorite games ever!
1414,It just works.
1415,Love it <3
1416,its a timeless masterpiece.
1417,AWESOME GAME!
1418,"This'll never cease to be my favourite game, absolutely goated"

1420,Very good game. Many Death to the Dragon Born there will be.
1421,This is Skyrim of course you should have it
1422,Fun
1423,Best game in the whole story of humankind. nothing more to say.
1424,"If you need a review on Skyrim in this day and age, just crawl back under your rock."
1425,"By far one of the best games I've played EVER. True the game is plagued with so many types of bugs that sometimes you'll think this game was made in a moving car, but all the bugs I've seen are hilarious so it's not so bad. I can lose myself in this game to the point where hours will go by feeling like minuets. It's that fun. If you don't have it, GET IT."
1426,I played the game a tiny bit and I think the game just works. Todd howard made the physics pretty unrealistic tho.
1427,It's okay
1428, thumbs up
1429,"Played 225 hours when I should have been writing my university thesis, only played a single character, haven't touched it since. It's clunky as hell and certainly feeling its age, but if you're looking for a classic in videogames or you're willing to mod it to hell for a smooth experience, then it's definitely worth the tiny cost you'll pay whenever it's on sale (which is almost all the time). Todd, you bastard, you've done it again."
1430,"If you've played Skyrim, you likely understand why anyone would recommend it.
If you haven't yet, I envy you so much."

1439,"your wasting your money if you buy this version of the game, because it comes with nothing, you would need to buy the special edition, then buy the anniversary edition upgrade. Bethesda needs to stop."
1440,"Original, Legendary Edition is all you need. Never mind the other editions. Mods are a must. With mods you can turn this game into pretty much anything you want. Do consider that you need like 10 mods to make it work decently regarding stability. Learn to manually install mods and you'll be fine."
1441,"best rpg

1442,EPIC!!!
1443,GOOD GAME GAMERS
1444,"Do you get to the cloud district very often? Oh what am I talking about, of course you dont."
1445,This game lacks borderless window mode.
1446,recommended
1447,I like that you can freely move and you aren't just hooked to the quests. I also like how you can change your class from warrior to mage. I dislike the spell casting animations in 3rd person and 2d I also don't like the fighting with weapons animation I fell how you crouch for no reason when fighting is just weird and you should have a straight back up with your weapon or spell when you fight like in real life or on tv. I finally hate that your character can't talk and can't run correctly in game all you do is jog and you go faster then the flash with some races!
1448,SHITTER GAME
1449,banaas
1450,Its Skyrim Nuff Said
1451,"Well dis ol goat have awl kinds o' fun...standin own trees, playin own wobbly sheet metal, slaying dragons wit uh ol Mace Of Scorching, talkin ta cat people n orcs n werewolfies n such...it great fun.

1454,It's better than a kick to the nuts
1455,"I mean .. it's skyrim
Dragons, Mudcrabs, cheese wheels - this game has it all."
1456,very fun
1457,With mods it is one of the best games I have played.
1458,It's Skyrim
1459,"Good Game overall, The story is a little simple for my taste compared to the other TES game but the gameplay is esay to play and the modding community give the option to make the game play the way you want, would recomend"
1460,"Garbage asf, worthless standard edition. No point of even owning this because no modders will use anything but legacy edition. Also we all know Skyrim's vanilla gameplay is awful. Boring, uninspired, mashing combat. Lame magic. TERRIBLE """"rpg"""" elements. You can't even build characters as in depth as you could in Oblivion or Morrowind. The world is drab and uninspired. Nothing but a grey filter over the game and it lacks colors, unlike you guessed it, Oblivion. The game sucks man. Dont play this shit"
1461,buy skyrim
1462,Fun game to play even after 10 years.  Always seem to find my way back
1463,best game
1464,its skyrim dude. its good. like dr pepper.

1475,"Years later and it still draws me in occasionally.

Likes:
- The Elder Scrolls lore is detailed and rich
- The over world of Skyrim is detailed with literal boatloads to do in any given place.
- Mechanics and leveling are not hard to understand, the more @ss you kick, the bigger your foot gets in most forms of combat
- The DLC and overall questing will probably keep you busy for literal years. 
- Modding with both the Workshop and the Nexus will have loads more content as well of varying degrees of quality.
In short it deserved it's various GOTY awards back in 2008.
Gripes:
- While I'm not much a stickler for high fidelity, the original is definitely beginning to show it's age, which is something to be expect of a literal decade old game.
- While the Game world is expansive and highly detailed, it gets rather samey for most of, probably contributing to why I don't hear about many 100% speedruns for it.
- And now onto Bethesda and effin [i] Todd [/i]...

There is no shortage of grievances with how this game has been handled by it's company and it's various distributors after it's launch. From the paid mods, to not listing the launched version on Steam, to even re-releasing this game over the literal past decade on various platforms and special editions, it's no surprise that people have begun to dislike Bethesda over the past tenth of a century. I'm pretty sure I'll be seeing Skyrim re-releases on my deathbed.

So, weary traveler, if you find this review by wandering off the beaten internet path and you have a machine that can't quite run the Special edition, I do recommend buying this if you can if not the Steam Store, then maybe off an Eastern Euro keysite."

I have the added bonus of getting to place it on the PC, which enabled mods to the game, making it constantly regain new life.  The game without mods however is still of legendary rapport, and I have to recommend it."
1526,"Ahhh Bethesda... I don't know any game they made that is rubbish. Fact.
Full of rage quit inducing glitches, crashes and bugs, you still gonna love every game they ever made!
As an adult, being wise to mod source safety at least, feel free to explore the huge assortment of bizarre and VERY adult mods and have MUCH fun! If you are a parent with a kid under 18 though your kid generally may NOT play Skyrim. There are plenty reasons why, some explained below. There are some work-arounds to this.

Skyrim is an 18+ yeah? Please! don't try to tell me only 18+ play this though.
TAKE NOTE THEN! (Especially if you always moderate your kid's internet/gaming?)
Bethesda have a somewhat grim and grime covered art and story. The game is an 18 which tries to adjust the player base to adult by default but it is very likely crawling with underage players. This combined with the massive assortment of sexy mods and even sexual content mods though is somewhat eyebrow raising. When you consider that a certain % of the game's players are under 18 and being quickly exposed to quite adult mods on steam and VERY adult mods outside steam (N**us/Lo****lab)? Eyebrow raising. Who cares? Obviously nobody. But you might! For this *mods content child safety risk* reason ALL of Bethesda's highly mod rich games get a -10/10. The filth that can and is being added to the game for years via mods drags the score down into oblivion. You don't have to install those but you cannot help but see it while you browse mods. Some Skyrim modding communities are riddled with fetish, perversion fantasy and pornography fans. It is ignorant of those mod creators to assume all downloads of their mods are by 18+ legal players. You innocently go off looking for new mods not on Steam and next thing you know... Uhm... I ... D... !!! Just NO! 

DO NOT permit your kids to play this game without frequently checking their mods list or first reviewing the mods available for this game. Fallout 4 ect uses the same engine and editors for modding as Skyrim so also check their mods list for that if they have it? Add at least the two mad adult mod sites to your HOST file so they can never be visited? ""127.0.0.1 sketchysourcesexyskyrimexemods.org"" etc? <-Example fake url.
If your kid is all rage bubbles and snot tears over no Skyrim allowed because 18+ advice offered here? Just install it yourself add a few handy popular mods yourself and tell them they MAY NOT LOOK FOR OR ADD OTHER MODS because some mods are very risky and can hack your steam and others have content you think they are not legally allowed to see ..etc, etc? I don't mean blood splashes etc...

Even if you do not mod the game it has an odd 18+ humanoid corpse mechanic. You get attacked by some otherwise cute female bandit at a farm who wants to kill you and wont give up so you have to kill them, they turn and die then fall over a fence. You go to loot the dead bandit. ""Take all"" leaves the bandit female bent over fence with their butt in air in just panties and a bra?! You would think after Morrorwind/oblivion panties/bra corpse age old cringe that they would add a less revealing corpse skin... Nope! Oh well. 18+ it is.
I am not aware of any mod that tries to make the game a PG rating by changing said disturbing corpse skins, removing blood splashes, burned corpses, cultist torture prisons, mass graves etc? The game needs it I think so younger players can ""legally"" play the game. A massive mod project I'm sure. 

Your ""competent"" kid might even start making mods... !? I made one with no clue how to at the start.
Within 15 hours in Skyrim Creation Kit, NifSkope, OutfitStudio, Bodyslide Studio, Gimp+Paint.net and allot of reference reading online I made a very skimpy druid leaf and leather straps armour add-on edited from another imported .dds/.nif set, sadly it is way too sexy, is only half my work and so I do not make it public anywhere. (Is based off the ""DX Druid UNP armour"" for SE/LE but I converted for normal Skyrim and bodyslide converted from UNP small to CBBE small/petite. I added several different sized daggers, small bags and made her top/leg armour considerably more revealing. Changed the entire set to have more vivid leather tan and leaf green colours also. Tried to add as an .obj cute blue glasses but was a bit over my head with that. Her 2nd leg armour is particularly ""au-naturale"" and reveals all. Is a female only set. Making Skyrim reskins and custom armours is apparently easy to do after a short but steep learning curve? Hence the massive assortment of sexy skins, mesh remodels and armours?

While the obligation to keep 18+ games with 18+ players only is up to the user's discretion, please be advised about the other huge amount of 18+ content available for this game! If you are 18 and not offended by such player added content or even enjoy it... get stuck right in! Best adult gaming you ever had I'm 100% sure!
With the adult mods BIG caution BIG comment out of the way... I would say this game made it's mark in history and for that, will never die. Skyrim is forever. Just watch how your <18 year old kids add/browse mods is all? It seems nobody else is so it is up to you if you think your <18 kid might become curious or whatever at such mods. You also have a serious legal responsibility (in some places very much so!) to prevent in every way you can any access to adult content for your kids safety and non disturbing online experience. End of. 

Game is VERY much for adults only I'm afraid, too good for kids, sorry!

I have option of chaning resolution of my COMPUTER (not game) to 60hz or this painful process of finding what works so i can play game normally. IMO not worth it. If bethesda cant figure out way for a game to work on modern computers yet release new version every year, they dont deserve money. Fuck this game"
1541,I overpaid

1547,Witnessed in real time a cart with cabbages fling itself
1548,"""At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search.""

I hate that this version, the version I originally bought, is now ""out of date"" because Bethesda insists on releasing the game every year with a new subtext in the title. For that reason I obviously don't recommend it.

Buying games from Bethesda feels like buying a used PS2 game in 2008 at high school from that one shady kid that acts like a drug dealer and is by no means trustworthy so you inspect that disc for like the whole lunch period to make sure hes not selling you a lemon. 

No ones gonna read this anyways because its unlisted on steam, so who cares. Screw you Bethesda. Why do you have to be like this?  I can't help but avoid buying Bethesda products because they make everything so obtuse and unpleasant and predatory towards actual gamers that my gut response is distrust. I won't use the P word here but I'm for sure never buying another singleplayer game from them and after FO76 I don't trust them with multiplayer either.
"
1549,"Skyrim has been out over a DECADE and is STILL one of the best open world RPG games to date. I would even go as far to say this was the peak of Bethesda's creative capabilities. Truly a solid experience to remember with beautiful graphics, meaningful quests/story and unique dragon AI! Let's not forget the endless amount of player made mods to make your game truly different with each playthrough. 

This makes it the second time I've gotten 100% achievements in Skyrim. First was on PS3 back in 2012, now 10 years later I did the same on Steam and had a blast doing so. Surprisingly, this game seems to have less bugs than any of their Fallout games, but that doesn't mean they're not there. A few times I had to tcl my way through doors that were bugged or had to spawn an NPC next to me that was somehow disappeared from the game. I'm also not sure why Bethesda decided to ""unlist"" this version of Skyrim AND it's DLCs, when this version is much friendlier to modders, as well as being more stable overall. People have made guides on how to find them, plus guides on any issues you might run into while playing, making it quite easy to fix any hiccups. 

Overall, Skyrim is still one of my all-time favorite RPG's, but it's 10 years later and we're still waiting for Elder Scrolls 6... 😪"

1561,.

1563,one of the absolute best games ever played! i will be playing this game for the rest of my life and even if there were the possibility of there being an afterlife i would want to be able to play this game even after i die....problem is i recently had a heart attack and i actually died for around ten minutes and that is a looooooong time to die before being brought back to life...well after being dead for that long after being dead im sorry to say that there was nothing.....it was just in an ocean of black. Nothing happened after i died it was just black and that scares the shit out of me!!! i just experienced an eternal length of just nothing once i died until i was brought back to life. it seriously scared the shit out of me....after i died and was then brought back to life i experienced nothing while i was out and now fear death more than i did before. i died the last time. before i died the first time i felt as though there might be an afterlife and things mattered because i was a christian....that there was something after when you die and guess what...there was nothing....it was an eternal blackness after i went out... i pray that i was wrong and there is something after i am gone but omg the experience i had was the opposite....i was at peace but there was absolutely nothing...that worries me worse than death and then hell :( at least with the possibility of hell you retain yourself intact...what happened with me was just....well nothing....an ocean of black nothingness forever...im more scared of that than no afterlife at all :{
1564,buys game on pc so i can mod 10/10.
1565,"Love Skyrim and have come back to play some more with the DLC's and a decent computer.
Old meme but a fun solo game, im actualy also waiting for the MOD CO-OP :D

OLD Review :
""With a good PC and a 144hz the game is unplayable, tried everything to fix without success, so only get it if you have a potato PC""


FIX: NVidia Controll panel --> Manage 3D Settings --> Program Settings--> ADD program and select skyrim --> Look for setting ""Max Frame Rate"" and set it to 60 FPS."

1567,"What can I say? It's Skyrim. If you've lived for more than 5 years on this planet, you've likely heard of Skyrim before.
The fifth entry of the The Elder Scrolls franchise is available on nigh every platform now. If you haven't grown up with Skyrim, or have been adult during it's release already, you'll likely find this game a buggy mess beyond saving. If, however, the nostalgia factor does kick in, it's still a beautiful game worth playing despite the glitches and bugs you encounter at nearly every corner. To be honest, some bugs grow on you. They almost add to the charme.
Now, most people will tell you that the real beauty of Skyrim comes in the form of the, to this day still very much alive, modding community. But frankly, even Vanilla this game is quite enjoyable. A classic RPG experience with a magic system, a skill system, smithing and enchanting your own gear, leveling skills individually. Your gear changes you cosmetically. You can become an assassin, a thief that steals goods and illegally sells them, a paragon hero, a mage, you can choose either side of a war or none, you can become a mercenary, a vampire, a werewolf, buy our own houses, upgrade them, adopt a child, marry a follower. It has a massive map which you will have to freely traverse on your own. All locations are hidden at first. You can gather tons of materials for alchemy along the way. Did I mention alchemy is yet another skill and you can create tons of potions? Another things that there are tons of is sidequests. Honestly, talk to every NPC you meet that has a name.
That being said, the modding community. I am typically a very vanilla guy when it comes to modding games and often don't do it at all. That being said, I kept it on the down low for Skyrim. I still wanted a Skyrim experience. I added a lot of Quality of Life changes. Smaller things like more weapon variety, a better following system, a community made fix for a quest, additional carrying capacity pouches one can craft and wear in separate slots, some more followers, some more interesting and fitting looking quests, more beautiful weather and lighting. That kinda stuff. And me with my conservative preferences with mods still installed 60+ mods. (This was after playing Skyrim vanilla on consoles.)
To conclude: Honestly if you like the RPG experience at all, Skyrim is a must to play at least once. Immerse yourself in the land of Skyrim and see the long experience through to the end once. It's not even an expensive game anymore. After so many years it is still just as enjoyable to play. Go for it and go at your own case."
1568,Skyrim is one of the greatest games out there. It's medieval gta. I've been playing it since it came out in 2011 and I'm still entertained. The steam workshop only adds more fun to the game. If you want a great game to get many hours of fun out of then this is the game for you.
1569,do i really need to say something?!
1570,yes
1571,Pretty good *thumbs up emoji*
1572,"Skald! Raise a flagon o mead with ye companion in arms!! Delve into the realms of Elder Scrolls through SKYRIM and never look back! Even the glitches are a wonderful dash of hilarity! Totally recommend this game!

1585,"Its a Classic, you havent lived until you have sunk a couple hundred hours into this"
1586,"Everyone should own and play this game at least once. It's buggy, the graphics are a little dated and it doesn't like to be run above 60fps but it's still a classic. Possibly the best game in the world for it's modding scene."

1588,I will never stop coming back to skyrim. A classic in gaming culture forever.
1589,"Thx to the modding community, I'm going through again."
1590,
1591,ye
1592,"Wait, since 2011 I didn't do any review for Skyrim? Wha-..?
Well, great game, very great game, and maybe the last great game that bethesda will ever release.
So instead of buying fallout 76 to your childs for christmas, gives them the good ol' skyrim from 2011 ;)"
1593,Why are you reading this? You've already bought Skyrim at least four times.
1594,One of the best games i ever played
1595,a
1596,"𝓢𝔀𝓮𝓮𝓽 𝓜𝓸𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓻, 𝓼𝔀𝓮𝓮𝓽 𝓜𝓸𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓻, 𝓼𝓮𝓷𝓭 𝔂𝓸𝓾𝓻 𝓬𝓱𝓲𝓵𝓭 𝓾𝓷𝓽𝓸 𝓶𝓮, 𝓯𝓸𝓻 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓼𝓲𝓷𝓼 𝓸𝓯 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓾𝓷𝔀𝓸𝓻𝓽𝓱𝔂 𝓶𝓾𝓼𝓽 𝓫𝓮 𝓫𝓪𝓹𝓽𝓲𝔃𝓮𝓭 𝓲𝓷 𝓫𝓵𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓪𝓷𝓭 𝓯𝓮𝓪𝓻."
1597,The story line is fantastic and fun to play always changing. Play all the Elder Scrolls themed stories.
1598,i love it (:
1599,its good
1600,"my dlcs gone, WHAT THE FUCK BETHESDA???????????"
1601,"It's Elder scrolls , I mean whats not to like...."
1602,The dlc's i paid for are just gone now??
1603,fus ro dah
1604,give me the dlc you pieces of shit
1605,Played this game across multiple platforms so my time on PC doesn't quite reflect hours put in. I love this game and replay it frequently. Would recommend as one of the best fantasy games out there for all audiences and fans of the genre.
1606,An awesome game. The game of games.
1607,"that just the best game ever. Is a classical you have to test it and get your self lost in this land. And also if you want to increase your fun or realism there always the modding, gift of god."
1608,It's OK I guess
1609,its fucked on pc
1610,yes
1611,I'll buy this again when we're able to plug ourselves in like the Matrix.
1612,"Get the newer versions. This one sure does like to crash (LE), SSE and AE seem more stable from what I hear/can tell. To be fair, I've got more mods installed on this version."
1613,"GOAT
"
1614,It just works
1615,Dude it's Skyrim. Leave me alone.
1616,"This game is like a woman. Sure it's beautiful and interesting to listen to, but lord have mercy on your soul if you dare try suggesting to ""improve"" it. Next thing you'll know is, you've poured hundreds of hours trying to find ways of solving its issues that it refuses to explain to you, only to come back a few days later and it runs as if nothing ever happened.

I have a very complex love-hate relationship with this game."
1617,"One of my all time favorites 
"
1618,;
1619,Hey you. You're finally awake.
1620,"steam gave me a ""hero of the people"" achievement after stealing a torture victim's emergency money"
1621,"This game is a beautiful disaster and I love it. Bethesda games are always a buggy mess, but the purpose of a game is to entertain, and it has certainly done that. After 6 years I am still entertained. Also, A+ dragon design"
1622,lets be honest i actually have over 500 hrs in this game its amzing what else do i say?
1623,very good game me and my brothers all play it 10/10 there are so many things you can do you can build a house by hand you can clear cave and it has a great story line
1624,Masterpiece waiting for it to release on my phone
1625,nice
1626,still a classic stil runs
1627,asddf
1628,yes
1629,"I like it so much
"
1630,a work of Art
1631,"I recommend if you like an interesting historic RPG game, with magic & fun(ny) side-plots. Like the choices in fighting styles, and the world exploration aspects."
1632,"good game but fuck you for unlisting it

"
1633,So customizable
1634,"great game
"
1635,"Depth of story, graphics."
1636,It Just Works.
1637,"If you havent played skyrim at this point and you got 40 hours to spend, id reccomend starting here and working back all the way to Arena. btw the first two elder scrolls are free here on steam."
1638,"another one of my favourites
5/5"
1639,"It's skyrim, what else is there to say, worse then the other Elder Scrolls(I like my RPG elements) but still good"
1640,"A lot of replayablity, many different ways to go.
"
1641,fun
1642,"Took arrow to the knee, fought dragons, climbed the mountains, modded the living boots out of this game
10/10 would do that again"
1643,"very addicting, great world building and plot. Very interesting and still one of the best RPGS out there!"
1644,"This game should appeal to most of us whoever dream about finding and rehabbing an abandoned fort... or a hollowed out mountain with its own delicate ecosystem... or living among such beautiful and noble Nords...  or fighting skellies on a daily basis and killing them all... again.  It incorporates a grand tale of redemption and retribution with the classic rebellion of a regal nation, and if I could think of another resplendent ""R"" word, I'd railroad that one in as well.  (See what I did there?)  Skyrim is my favorite RPG of all time.  I've spent so many years rambling among the forests, helping so many citizens, and slaying so many dragons, it feels like home to me.  And a shout out to my husband, Farkas, who has shared so many adventures with me throughout all of my many lifetimes in Skyrim.   Thanks, baby, I wouldn't be the Dragonborn I am without you!  How's that Apple and Cabbage soup coming along?  I'm hungry!"
1645,Skyrim is awsome. My faviorite mod is Star Wars Light Sabers
1646,i like this game because it allows me to escape into a world where i can be what ever i want and do what ever i want so i don't have to put up with the crappy real world for a few hours :)
1647,dragoons
1648,All around good series!
1649,One of the best open world games!
1650,fun
1651,fallout without guns
1652,:)
1653,skyrim
1654,"An amazing open world games, with lots of choices on stuff to do."
1655,Ten years and I keep coming back to it.
1656,"Huge game, many quality mods available.
"
1657,epico
1658,This game could be only about history of Dragonborn and Serana and it still would be perfect
1659,Booba mods
1660,"This game is Fast Game and good And i love it And i didnt play it on my pc i played it on a Ps 4 and i loved it YOOOOOO 
"
1661,"It's good I guess. Pick a direction and start walking, and you'll have fun soon enough."
1662,"Great story line, interesting places just a great game to play!"
1663,Very good game
1664,Mods FTW.
1665,Game makes me happy
1666,"This game takes you back to if you was skilled with melee,crossbows,or bows you can be come a powerful aly or enmy
"
1667,buy skyrim on the tiger wristwatch come on it will be funny
1668,played hundreds on times and always come back to it so this game is baso the best thing ever :-0
1669,"As someone who has finished this game multiple times. I Can say that it is still very enjoyable with realistic graphics mods and gameplay overhauls. You will need to go to nexus mods though. Steam modding is very very limited, as it doesnt allow the use of extended scripts"
1670,"Good gameplay, with atmosphere of old Skandinavien sagas, Lot of possibilities on open world area! Well done!"
1671,"can't stop playing, even after 10 years"
1672,Very fun
1673,amazing
1674,"love it, who doesnt?"
1675,"Fantastic game .I keep coming back to it. Sometimes, it is for the replay-ability of the game. So many differences in each play thru. Also, there are a lot of mods that can make it almost like a completely different game. The voice acting,story, art &design all combine in a great rpg experience."
1676,[I] Most immersive game out there.  [/i]
1677,FUCKING AMAZING. no words for it other than a must have for everyone
1678,"whyyy havent you played this yet? i dont care if you just like shooters, i dont like shooters no more because of this

thank you"
1679,Great fun to play
1680,I will be quick: 10/10.
1681,"This is the greatest game of all time, buy it. BUY IT NOW."
1682,"This is the most Fantastic Game you will ever play, it is amazing and just when you think you have seen and done everything it opens up another complete World and it is so large you just cannot believe how big this game really is, all of a sudden you are in another whole new world, I played Oblivion in the 1990's which was amazing at that time but this game will blow anyone away, the work that must have gone into this game really is one of the biggest honours they deserve, the play and the detailed views are just like being on the top of Mount Everest, everything you will ever see or do is in this game, I had to start the game twice as they changed the start of the game, they still seem to be updating it, however I am again for some reason missing a file and I am at level 76 and it looks like I will not finish the game again. There is some file missing and I cannot get any help to solve the problem, I have played 6,944.8 hours. But It looks like all this will be wasted and if that is the case I Intend to start from the beginning again I will do this! because I have been so involved it is living in another World and it's taken over my life. So I will start from the beginning once again, that is how good this game really is I intend to finish the game if it takes me double the hours I already have been playing, which I started on 19th September 2019 I am not a person who rushes into things and I like to keep all my homes in good condition, just like I do in my real life and I am 77 years young and will be 78 later this year, The only part I disliked was where it takes you into the mad-hatters tea party from Alice in wonderland, which I could not finish without looking up what I needed to do, I would advise anyone to look up what to do otherwise you will do some things that you cannot finish (I wish I had done that before now) I am lucky enough to have purchased the game when it was on a DVD and the Legendary V game which has three other parts which make this game so large, My advice is buy the game if you like action R.P.G you will never regret it. Take my advice never try any cheats but you need to get some Information when your stuck, as you will do some things either before they were in line up, or before you need to and find yourself missing other Important things which I think is why I could not finish the game for the 2nd time around. But it is worth every single £/$ you will pay, nothing 10-years after it was made has overtaken this game in my honest belief, but I wish that Bethesda would help when someone like myself for no reason can play one second then come back and find there is a file missing, which spoils all the work and effort you have put into the game, I am up to 100% in most things and 76% through the game, only to have to start all over again after all the hours I have put into the game."
1683,"Good game, pls give award i need points"
1684,good game
1685,"This game is obviously ""The Best Game Ever"". It's been re'released on just about every system, including VR systems.. I think I even have a copy that I can play on my microwave. Just do it! Don't let your magic and fantasy dreams be dreams, just DO IT!"
1686,One Of The Best Games Of All Time...
1687,"It's awesome!
Need the next one, having withdrawal symptoms...
"
1688, its fun morrowind is still better tho
1689,Bethesda at its finest.
1690,The Elder Scrolls series has been one of the few game series that I've followed for many years. I highly recommend any of their single player content.
1691,"Sorry I left you for that Ice Troll, Maria.  RIP."
1692,Obviously.
1693,6/10. The game has clunky combat where one is waiting around. The waiting is there as a result from no attack cancelation to block an attack and attacks not stopping an immediate attack if you attack just before an enemy. The fov is painfully narrow too.
1694,It got rid of the dlc i owned. What absolute scum
1695,"It's been a long time that I have played this game and It's one of the most memorable games I've ever played from the year of 2011. Bethesda still continues to advertise this in the Nintendo Switch era. So this means Elder Scrolls won't have a 6th title. Maybe another 10 more years? Still, this game was legendary in it's own right. You are the chosen one known as, ""Dovahkin"" (Dragon Born) who holds the destiny to change the big land of the Nords called, Skyrim. At the time, this game was the biggest open world game ever to be introduced and you needed a big graphics card to play it. The game has everything you need to see this amazing fantasy land. Fight dragons, zombies, wizards, trolls, giants, giant spiders, werewolves, vampires, and the list goes on!! It's almost the perfect ""Dungeons and Dragons"" adventure you can ever experience. It was the perfect game to be stuck for months. So grab your sword and shield, or spice up your magic powers and learn the shout of the dragon and scream ""FUS RO DAH!!!"" 

9.5 / 10"
1696,I don't know if it needs a recommendation but i am recommending as an oblivion player :D(Still waiting for TES 6)
1697,"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee!"
1698,1789 hours
1699,Downloaded about 600 mods. The DND bard experience.
1700,"“Do you get to the cloud district very often? Oh, what am I saying? Of course you don't.” -Nazeem"
1701,best game
1702,"The game is a fun sandbox game for new sandbox players, 10/10 Recommended"
1703,"Time flying by like nothing:


me:
""hmm? Must've been the wind"""
1704,"""it just works."""
1705,209 HOURS ON THIS ACCOUNT I LOVE IT
1706,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim best game I ever Played. I liked Skyrim special edition for its colors, but the mods messed the game up so bad I couldn't play it."
1707,good
1708,"Sem necessidade de comentários. Lançado para até em relógios cássio, é o RPG que continua vivo depois de 10 anos de lançamento."
1709,"I would rather die then eat todds bread
that bastard"
1710,play the game
1711,i hate it
1712,Because YES
1713,One of the best games of all time. Period.
1714,Easily one of the greatest games ever made
1715,fantastic replayability and fun. infinitely modable
1716,Many hours to put into it plus mods make it last longer
1717,69 hours huh huh
1718,its skyrim whats not to like
1719,"You take a lot from me too. I can't pretend I need to defend some part of me from you. But I can't pretend, I don't need to defend some part of me from you <3."
1720,"Whenever a new open world fantasy game is released (I'm looking at you, Elden Ring), I spend a brief moment pondering whether I should purchase it. Then I remember I can simply mod skyrim into a near identical game, and put another weeks worth of hours into this beautiful masterpiece of a game."
1721,Skyrim without DLCs and mods will always be my favorite.
1722,great game for changing/modifying the original junky game.
1723,modded is fun as hell and normal gameplay is still replayable
1724,classic
1725,"Skyrim is a dumpster game and I love it because it's a dumpster game. To me Sky Rimjob is like a feel good sit com. Not polished, yet super addictive and probably the show you've watched the most times despite being a 6/10 at best.

Really makes you feel like you're still playing Skyrim after more than decade.
"
1726,good
1727,For Skyrim! ... FOR Skyrim! ... For Skyrim! ... For Dragon Age! ......... Uuuuhhh... For Skyrim? AAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
1728,Perfect for those who visit the cloud district often.
1729,"I love this game. I've loved it since the first time I played it on my brother's PS3 not long after it was released. Now I can finally (after getting more ram) play it on my laptop and so far... It's been incredible! The art is quite good, the music is epic, and the story line (from what I remember) was a lot of fun!"

1734,I like playing mine all modded up!
1735,Hey you're finally awake
1736,"Does Skyrim really need a review? Just get it already, why are you here?"
1737,noice
1738,This game is on my top 5 list Meaning one of the few games I have Enjoyed enough to play all the way through and even Many hours after the fact<beating the main story line>  and even Years later i Still consider playing it from time to time I must say this game is a Must play you wont find a game this well done easily. I would Not hesitate if you haven't played it yet you will not be disappointed. Its one for the hall of fame I'm compleatly shocked that the makers didn't Make more DLC for this game. but you can find a lot of addons in the steam workshop.

Believe Me, that Wow feeling wil be a stonge follower, trhuout this Epic exploration of Skyrim´s beautifull 
 Landscape with a very rich and various Flora / Fauna.

nice game ngl
"
1765,"After the years, this game is still something."
1766,Amazing game always has been. Can add lots of extra Mods onto to add to the adventure
1767,"Possibly the best replay value game ever made. After years of rinsing this game on the Xbox I finally got it on the PC and tried it with mods and would recommend anyone else to do the same. Get the flora overhaul and the HD mod, It like a remastered version on crack."
1768,/
1769,it gud
1770,"in reality i have about 1,000 h on xbox 360 but i never got to play the dlcs im glad i get to play with new content this game brought me my most joyous times playing games and i hope this brings you as much fun as it did me"
1771,"Bro, it's Skyrim. Amazing game, trust me."
1772,Less buggy than Cyberpunk 2077
1773,Classic Vanilla with mods is great but I worry if Skyrim 6 will be worse or better? I hope to be playing Skyrim 6 in the future not vanilla 20 years down the road
1774,PO-TA-OS! BOIL'M MASH'M STICK THEM IN A STEW!

1781,"Whenever I fire up skyrim it feels like coming home.

If you don't own this game at least 3 times over already, What are you doing ?

It's skyrim. Just play the damn thing already."
1782,GOTY? yes!
1783,An epic game. Years old but I still come back to it.
1784,i mean its skyrim do i really have to explain they dont realease a new version of this game ever year for no reason XD
1785,"This game is a classic within the gaming community.
I have played hundred of hours on this game, playing it and the DLCs on my xbox 360, despite this I was never near completing the game.
It's a great game with a simple but effective story, but with enough fantastical fantasy elements to keep you hooked throughout. The best part isn't even the main story. It's the endless content you have afterwards with all the different types of guilds as you learn their characters and become their leader. 
If you enjoy fantasy games and RPG, you'll most certainly enjoy this.

"
1786,"Only good with mods, of which there are many"

1789,Worst Elder Scrolls Ever!!
1790,Huge map!

"
1799,"10+ years later and this game maintains the quirks and glitches it gained fame from. 

Honestly if you haven't picked this up yet, you're wrong"
1800,"I somewhat say yes to Oldrim but the game is unstable when you play around with the mods. I also decided to do arcade game/comic book silliness with Oldrim due to the fact that Skyrim Special Edition set the precedence for radically more stable mods and that's where I keep all the realism at. Once I got two seperate versions of Skyrim I had to figure out what to do with Oldrim, one of the things I came up with was an Easter playthrough as I have more than enough games for Halloween and virtually none for Easter and due to the availability of character models from universes that made no sense in the existing one I thought 'why not' for when will I visit Oldrim save once a year now that I have it figured out? Also it makes a great character modeling program as I can't really afford the high ended and sophisticated ones. Oldrim is terrible for what I try to mod Skyrim for but excellent for testing things out or having a 'what the hell' playthrough simply for fun and no other good reason. I won't be playing Skyblivion, or Skygerfall or even Skywind on this edition so yeah, its got some use after all, I could even make wallpapers or posters from whatever screens I make, awesome idea. Yes it has some claim to fame and if CDProjekt Red ever learns anything from Oldrim and Skyrim SE it would be that the shelf life of a highly modable game and even a finished game goes a long way. Anyways, for those of you who own a copy, I just gave you ideas, take it or leave it."
1801,the fact that the game is from 2011 and still excites so many people is just incredible
1802,good ggggggggod

1815,"A game that stands the test of time. Bought this game when it first came out and am still going back to it over a decade later. This is the game that set the standard for open world rpgs, and there are very few games that have come close to it since. I've logged almost 460 hours on steam with it so far and am now thinking of starting up another character. This is a game that you won't regret buying."
1816,Unga Bunga!
1817,Skyrim is good. Duh.
1818,Hands down one of the best games I have ever played.
1819,"Launcher is absolutely broken. Launcher rechecks graphics every time, detects low settings and runs in small window or crashes. Ignores manual intervention. 

What the heck happened, this was so stable now it won't run? Please help!!"

1853,"It's a standard, essential game. In my opinion every video game fan should play through it at least once."
1854,"While the graphics may not be able to compete with today's standard, that does not take away from this game in the slightest. In fact, i believe it gives it more character, allows you to suspend your disbelief in this otherworldly setting. If i wanted real life graphics, why not just look out the window, go for a walk? This game's sound, world-building, story-line and combat is fun to indulge in, and while at some points can be very taxing on your esteem and have massive difficulty spikes, i will always love Skyrim. One of my favourite games of all time. Plus, it was one of the first tripe A titles i ever played, so it has nostalgia factor for me."
1855,"After all these years, this game in vanilla version still rocks. And with a few good mods, it rocks even more. Though it's a shame that Bethesda decided to hide the original game from Steam store to push SE onto people, because not everyone can run the SE version on their pc"
1856,this game is so sick and cool and very recommend and it is very insane
1857,I like the solo game play and being able to Mod it out good.
1858,Great game recommend this version if you are going to mod skyrim with hidef textures

1864,"Story - 2/5
Atmosphere - 4/5
Gameplay - 3/5

Beautiful open world, with a lot of interesting quests lines. Yet, outside the quests the world feels very sterile and not much is going on in it. There certainly is a lot to do, and the undying modding community still provides fresh, albeit uncanonical, content. However after playing through the game once you've seen all the game can offer numerous times. The story is interesting enough to get you through the game once, maybe twice but that's it.

This could be said about any Elders Scrolls game.

As a sendbox game it is good. As a narrative driven experience not so much. I played it twice (with 100% completion) and I'll probably never play it again."
1865,this is a great game played it across all major platforms the start of the game is my favorite!
1866,I love you Todd Howard
1867,You seriously haven't tried Skyrim yet? Are you okay?

1891,"Neat game d=(~.^)z  - 9 out of 9
Bought the game on 11/11/11 but did seem to get the DLCs for free at some point. I did the main quest once on my Dunmer Arms Warrior. I Have different character archetypes who've done the various other quest lines and so on. I ended up buying the Special Edition but have yet to launch it and install mods haha. So far this version has kept me tied in. I stopped adding mods after a while to prevent any crashes, and to just focus on actually playing the game. Plus, I've changed Drives a few times over and have had to go back and fix it all up."
1892,"You don't need another review, but if you haven't played Skyrim you should play it... and you should mod the hell out of it.

Also I fully expect Bethesda to still be milking this dry cow / beating this dead horse for another decade. Can you believe that this is nearly 11 years old?"
1893,Isn't this game like postal 2 but without the guns?
1894,i have been a long time elder scolls player and i am not going to stop if you ever decide to get this game its fun to play unmodded or modded i just love all elder scolls games
1895,Da horsy do da fly den fly do da cat and ground go by by my game crashed!
1896,Amazing Game! Amazing Team! It's the game that keeps on giving! This game has it all! A great game at a great price for all ages! Must recommend!
1897,.
1898,"This game has not aged well if I am to give my honest opinion, what mostly bothers me about this game is the stale combat system. Then again the game is pretty old and is was great for it's time. But luckily the best part about this game is the huge modding community, you can make the game feel like it was made today or thousands of more things to do in the game, if it may be new items, new quests, weather changes, mob changes, world changes, you name it. You can do what you want with this game and that is the best part about it. The fact that the base story is great also helps."
1899,I LOVED skyrim as a game. playing on the xbox 360 was the joy of my life and loved playing it in VR. but how do i say this properly? it wasnt meant for pc. high graphics break the game entirely from basic glitches to downright softlocking. lowering the graphics works the carrige glitch but it doesnt help that there is invisible water where i go. i just dont get why it was so horribly ruined when it got to pc
1900,cool
1901,I love this game.
1902,⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀
1903,"Lots of fun, but more bugs than any game you've ever played.  Publishers don't fix anything it seems.  There are bugs reported from years ago, where only solution is a series of complicated console commands and even then it may not work.

Some of the bugs will prevent you from continuing in a particular factions quest lines or may prevent you from finishing the game in general.  Sucks when you put all that time into building a cool character and lose it.

Many times I've just left frustrated, but always seem to come back.  Addicted to building new characters, customisation is incredible.

Play it, but don't get too attached to anything, be ready for your whole world to crumble at any moment."
1904,It's Skyrim. It's great. We all know that.
1905,"More than a few injuries on my knee but that was very much worth it.

1910,only if one u dont mind playing alone!! n the other is wish they would fix it so perhaps a friend or 2 could join in the game to play along!!!!
1911,Why can't I kill the children.

1940,Its dope.
1941,"its skyrim dude... i have probably 3,000 hours on xbox i had to buy it twice to appease todd howard"
1942,One of the best games of all time. Change my mind.
1943,"Story: 5 There are some solid and really fun sidequests in Skyrim, but there also a lot of weak ones, too. The world and setting also never really managed to draw me in. It feels very a pretty generic fantasy world, with usually very little in terms of new or interesting ideas to offer.  

Graphics: 8 The graphics in Skyrim are solid even by modern standards but nothing spectacular. Mods can improve drastically on that, though. 

Gameplay: 7 The gameplay in Skyrim is really nothinig impressive by modern standards. By far the funnest aspect of combat is using the ""fus-ro-dah"" shout. There are plenty of mods that make combat a lot more enjoyable, though. Shitty puzzles and a lack of much player choice also bring the game down a bit. 

Sound: 10 Skyrim has easily of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time. The only games I can think of that match up off the top of my head are Undertale and Final Fantasy 7. 

30/40"
1944,"It's good, interesting, runs great on low end computers(60+ fps), and its not boring. Would recommend if you are looking for something to play during your free time."
1945,It's ok I guess
1946,A fantastic immersive experience. Love this game.
1947,"One of two of the best games I have ever played. A little on rails, but it is an older game, but still one of the greatest in terms of content and replay ability. Still runs on low end hardware, and graphics are still very good. Mods are a huge deal and can change the kind of game you are playing, from rpg's to action and crafting, to full on war-zone, or building. Whatever the player is looking for.
Special edition is good, but if you want a entry level hardware game that runs very good, get the original version.
"
1948,yes
1949,very chad
1950,this was my very first game i got on PlayStation 3 then years later my uncle built me a pc to run it and i fell in love the game is just my happy place so much to do and see and enjoy . and mod the hell out of it make it your game. create a character and just go there no rules do what you want play it your way.
1951,"Most overrated boring game
Don't know why people like it when Fallout new Vegas is around"
1952,What can you say.... its Skyrim.
1953,hmmm
1954,mid
1955,"Always different, particularly with mods."
1956,"going back to this one after anniversary edition, thanks bethesda!"
1957,is good
1958,cool!!
1959,"Played this game for more hours than my Steam account says because i'd play it offline when i lost internet for months. What can I say about Skyrim? It's Bethesda. It's buggy, unoptimized and uses an updated, but very buggy game engine. Keeping with Bethesda's theme of streamlining, Skyrim removes more functionality from their previous game, Oblivion (another game I've played literal years in). The storyline is milquetoast, generic, and barely average. Your decisions have no outlasting effect on the overall game aside from the colors of a few banners, a few NPC's, and the color of their armor. Aside from this and the multitude of game breaking bugs, and memory leaks (only addressed from the wonderful modding community), The voice acting is passable but repetative (less so with mods). The musical score from Jeremy Soule is atmospheric, epic, and subtle at all the right moments...absolutely excellent. However, music aside, I cannot recommend this game to anyone on PC or console (I own both, PC and PS4). However, the modding community is the saving grace for this title. It's a shame that I only reinstall this game only to play the Legacy of the Dragonborn mod, Wyrmtooth, and several others that make the game interesting, enjoyable, and fun. This reflects poorly on Bethesda, as the mods are better than the game (the DLCs are another story...aside from buggy, both Dawnguard and Solsteim are very good complimentary additions to the boring main game, Hearthfire is buggy and...meh, but modded Hearthfire is great). If you play vanilla Skyrim you're missing out. Play modded. Get the bugs fixed and make the game fun, interesting, and a worthy title to play. Unofficial Patch is a must. Get SKSE. There's a list of wonderful bug fixing mods that are essential. Get Legacy of the Dragonborn. Get Wyrmstooth. Change the game for the better."

1962,Epic
1963,Masterpiece
1964,100 hours- Good game someone gifted it to me very fun i am a tank wizzard and i like it might get elder scrolls 4 when i finish the game
1965,"Still good after all these years. A fantasy game based on a Nordic Country, where magic is a thing and warriors and mages are the norm. Lots of caves, dungeons and you not only can chose a race for yourself as well as team up with one of the two main political forces in the field - one is your old Cyrodilic Empire, the other is a local movement of Nord tradition, lead by an ambitious character, Ulfric. Whether you side with one of them, you'll have to deal with lots and lots of bandits, mages, wicked monsters, witches, and so on - so, life is never boring in these parts. You can even go vampire-hunting in a wonderful quest line where you end up with... a wonderful Vampire Companion!... Go figure - an amazing part of the game. Highly recommended 
- as well as getting the phenomenal Caliente's Beautiful Body Enhancer Mod (if you do love beautiful female bodies like me).
All that said, there you will find: A HUGE Map (so great to enter so many buildings, caves and dungeons, never boring), lots of activities and quests, lots of improvements you have to grind for (both in abilities and magic powers, as well as a lot of interesting quests that reward you nicely).
There is another version of this game (""Special Edition"") but I prefer this one because there are wonderful Mods in the Steam Workshop. Actually very fine works to take advantage of."
1966,"All time classic. Perfect to mod untill it's unplayable, spend hours figuring out which mod is causing problems, start a new game and never finish the main quest."
1967,Pretty good I know I’m a stranger on the internet but I would suggest you play it if you haven’t already

1979,"The OG Skyrim. Dated compared to the SE edition. This game has a much larger modding community compared to the other iterations. It is a good edition, but definitely one for the more die hard fans. The game is unlisted, so getting this edition on steam may be impossible."
1980,"The MOD community has made me want to play this game more and more. The game itself is alright. With different MODs, it's amazing."
1981,"Skyrim, a game I can keep coming back to, to play just normally or just mod the heck out of it!!!"
1982,What's not to love? The graphics are outstanding and not to mention the MODS.... Totally great RPG!
1983,"Such a fun game, i love it so much"
1984,"This is outstanding game, this is something more than just a game since it has a special spirit, a spirit of ancient Skyrim from some other realm! This game makes you feel the atmosphere, the hurdles of that realm, the adventurous environment and the joy which you develop upon every step you make there.

Everyone knows of Elder Scrolls Online, which seems to be a bigger game, plus an MMO... but honestly, somehow, it does not give what Skyrim gives you... this special atmosphere of alternative ancient reality where you immerse.

Modding community is just amazing, this keeps game alive even now in 2022. Graphics is Acceptable even today, since many people nowadays care more about the gameplay rather than just graphics features."
1985,just a great excape! and adventure!!!
1986,FUS RO DAH!!!
1987,Fun
1988,"i love it.
"
1989,This game is well worth every penny! Great Community. Great gameplay overall (Although it has aged since it's release so mechanics will feel less polished compared to modern titles). Great way to get into game development with it's modding tools. This game deserves a 10/10 or 9/10 (Special Edition is about a 7/10 although the engine upgrade is worth it for modern systems).
1990,e banger coae
1991,I've played 2364 hours. So I guess one could say that enjoy the game.
1992,kinda okay
1993,"SSE is 'better' in almost every way within the confines of the engine, production and using engine fix mods, but you can do that as well with this version and also make it look absolutely gorgeous in comparison. I'd still go SSE for a long run, but going back to my LE builds, I think, ummm, if only SSE could look like this."

2002,"Bethesda game design is inherently rotten to the core. Skyrim presents you with a large world, a variety of skills, and the seeming illusion of freedom, but all of this boils down to watered down, surface level mechanics that encourage neither exploration nor roleplaying.

The skills are designed without any roleplaying in mind: there is nothing that limits you from becoming proficient in everything possible, which means there can be no defining characteristics of a single class which can not be overruled - we should remember Hegel, that identity is the identity of identity and non-identity; that without the ability for a role to not be, there is no role that can be.

The world is designed with fast travel in mind, making it inhospitable to exploring on foot, rendering the world a gimmick to draw players in without being experienced or used anywhere close to its full potential.

Speech and choices in the game are rendered practically inert, destroying any idea of this being a roleplaying game, instead of a sequence of the same, repetitive, uninspired quests over and over again with no real investment beyond the player's boredom and no other way to waste the time."
2003,STEAM LADDER WORLDWIDE No.7
2004,This game needs no introduction. Does not need to be heavily modded. Although Sky UI is definitely recommended.

2019,"one of my first open world and one of the best still. Even if it's been so many years since the gale have been released, there is so many mods to make it look better, add gameplay and even entire stories...

2025,Todd you son of a b*tch
2026,Great game by itself. However potentially infinite content through mods. You make the game anything you want with mods 10/10 game.
2027,"It's a good game with a huge library of mods to chose from, the story is interesting and the questing and exploration are good, but I still feel there is a freedom the older games had was striped, I am referring to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, even thou that game is as old as me now, I feel it gives a lot more freedom to do with spells, alchemy and affiliation to factions then Skyrim. 
Nonetheless, in my opinion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a worth while game to go through and explore, the mountainous setting is beautiful and intriguing, with old ruins and ancient dwemer cities to explore, you can always pick a direction and go until the end of the map and find something to do."

2035,"This game's impact on the larger cultural and economic landscape of the medium is much, much worse than the game is itself. I hope that someday it becomes more profitable for Bethesda to publish a game that isn't Skyrim, because I would kill for another game that presents the kind of fascinating experience that Skyrim does, even if I, personally, find that experience to be often frustrating."

2045,Best game ever
2046,"IMHO this game must be modded to be enjoyed best. At least get mods that fix bugs if nothing else. Using other mods can tailor the game to your tastes. Great game to replay as there is such a variety of races to play as, each with it's own advantages/disadvantages."
2047,"Gorgeous landacapes and adventure awaits! Very immersive game, easy to begin , but becaareful as it is hard to end :)"
2048,A classic
2049,"This game is insane, everything about it is amazing!!!"
2050,"Although it has been around for over a decade, this game still remain relevant for normal game play and for the modding community. I decided to play this game because of the number of mods available. The story is timeless, and (if you want) can go back and play the games leading up to the current lore. Animation are fairly smooth and the graphics (although not up to current standards) are very good and immersive. Don't get me started on the available mods to make it even better. Do yourself a favor, play this game!"
2051,top
2052,"Have played this game across many systems and different mod profiles, a classic for a reason."
2053,"Damn you Skyrim! I played this game a ton when it came out on PS3, I also had it already for a long, long time in my Steam catalogue, but didn't play it on PC. Now i got my SteamDeck and though to just quickly check it out, pretty old game, should run well. Yeah, it does, it is amazing on the Deck, and the game is also still freaking amazing! The supposed 'quick' try is turning out into another Skyrim marathon, i can feel it's pretty impossible to put the game down as long as i got battery life left.

The game is not SteamDeck verified, but except for the launch menu, it works just fine with the controls."
2054,Best game ever when played with mods
2055,"I used to love this game, it was my go to for just chilling out after work adding mods of all kinds to make all the games i wanted to play that didn't exist yet.

Now though? nothing works, all these different versions of the same game has rendered modding impossible for me. after all these fun filled years I have uninstalled the game never to play it or any other of it's shitty versions again.

Will also never purchase another bethesda product again. Absolutely pathetic company."
2056,"A classic, but it looks like you can't download the DLCs for some reason?"
2057,"The lego game. With mods, this game can be anything you want"
2058,"It's better than the Special Edition because the mod potential is still there without the Creation Club nonsense. Unfortunately, I didn't get the DLCs before they were disappeared off the store :C"
2059,A classic when it comes to modding in a game. Imagination is the limit when it comes to every playthrough!
2060,fuck you todd howard i found oldrim i personally hope both the fallout series and the elder scrolls series die so that you cant fuck them up anymore now im off to make my computer scream in agony for how heavily i will mod the game
2061,best game
2062,Me like. Skyrim nice. World big. Things to do plenty. Boom.
2063,So many years on and it still plays.
2064,FUS RO DAH the dragonborn is godlike 10/10 for all skyrim players the game is the best in 2022 if for new fans enjoy this master of a video game
2065,"YEAH IT'S FUN BUT WEIRD THAT YOU CANNOT BUY THIS VERSION
NO DLC'S BUT PRETTY SURE ALL 3 COST LIKE £5 ON CDKEYS"
2066,This is the game that introduced me to RPGs and gave me a passion for them. I love it.
2067,"How to write a review on already one of most famous games of all times? How to write a review on not just a game but on a cultural phenomena? Because as we all know this is what TESV: Skyrim truly is. No one can't really doubt it, that's for sure. But it's not like it was something unexpected. All the previews games of the series became largely famous and iconic. However, the success of Skyrim is something different. It went even higher than any expectations of Bethesda. But Todd Howard probably was expecting something like this to happen eventually. He always was master of his craft and we should be thankful to him for creation of amazing fantasy worlds with so many sandbox elements. So, you might be wondering how to explain such major success of Skyrim, when there were 30 millions of copies sold only by 2016. And later a digital-only Special Edition was released with this version being removed from all stores, and still, sales of original version were continuing along with special edition because of numerous DVDs left all around of the world. And with game being released on 3 generation of consoles and receiving 2 re-issues, it's very difficult to calculate how many copies of Skyrim were sold worldwide. We probably will never know it but whatever. It's a huge number. So, I will better try to explain here this major success of Skyrim. You see, by 2010s videogames completely stopped to be an entertainment just for some small communities of geeks and nerds and became absolute mainstream. So, games were finally recognized as direction of art by everyone and the industry growth made its possible to bring the console or gaming PC to almost every household. However, another important reason of Skyrim success story is the quality of the game itself, of course. After achieving very good results in TESIII Morrowind and TESIV Oblivion, as well as making some training in Fallout 3, Todd Howard and Co mastered their skills to the level that they were capable to finally give us such a great game as TESV Skyrim. It wasn't without its flaws but many core-elements of the series were heavily polished here, making the game to be enjoyable to a super wide audience. Also such things as world's building, graphics, artdirection were largely improved as well. Not to mention the fact that Jeremy Soul himself came back to once again write super epic soundtrack. And I also must say that the modding possibilities were a very and very important force which prolonged the game's life. So, all those factors made Skyrim to become a true game of the people and one of most famous games in history. But I also want to mention here few more things - growth of fan community, growth of global geek culture and the development of the Internet and socials in 2010s. A good example of it would be how the cover on ""The Dragonborn Comes"" by Malukah went viral and all what happened after it. So, in the conclusion I want to say that it was pretty cool to witness all this to happen. In 2011 I finished school and Skyrim was released. Now in 2022 I am writing this review and it's nice to take such a broader look back and to give my thanks to Todd Howard and all the developers for their amazing work."
2068,This Is one of the greatest games of all time nothing else needs to be said
2069,its a great game if you like lore and role play

"
2077,todd howard's magnum opus
2078,There's a missing zero from my total playtime
2079,"I bought the original Skyrim when it 1st came out & loved the fact it was open world. I am a bit confused that the Anniversary Skyrim is different from the original one I bought?
 At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search. <---- I have to buy the anniversary Skyrim & lose my current character from the other version??? I'm very disappointed."
2080,yes
2081,"Can't buy the DLC for the original version lol. At least give us an upgrade since that's off the table?

Still great tho."
2082,Recomend
2083,Go play EE. This is only good for some old mods
2084,"For an old retired and disabled guy like me it is a lot of fun, a bit of a challenge and a great way to pass time quickly"
2085,fun
2086,memes init
2087,is fun!
2088,"As someone who is new to playing the series and has little experience to open world games, I can pretty much understand why people do still love this older version of the game. It has tons of replayability, world building, mechanics, and effort put into it. In times I do wonder if veteran players did manage to do everything on the base+dlcs game.

I know there are quite a bit of bugs in the game, but as someone who is studying programming. It is to be expected, but is genuinely surprised that there are far fewer than I expected due to how big the game is. But even so, the modding potential of this game is vast with so many already made (including yes, unofficial bugfixes if you want). Which makes the game have more replayability.

One thing of note though, this game is now sadly hidden and the bundle together with the dlc is now gone. So you have to get the link to the dlcs and buy them separately. As someone who doesn't have good pc for the special edition, this greatly saddens me. Which left me to wonder ""why remove the bundle?"", But despite that, I still wanted the game so I bought it with the dlcs. (only this time)"
2089,I enjoyed this. I just did the main quest. I made a two handed swordsman. The game is very easy on normal the way I played it. I just whacked the Dragon of Time a few times on the head and it died. The story and lore are much more interesting than Oblivion. The world is reasonably pretty.
2090,Yep
2091,It's a big ol sandbox weher you kin run round and hit stuff talk to people
2092,The game doesn't work at all. Good luck launching it. I have spent countless hours trying and following guides and all kinds of wasted time. If you have a modern resolution you're screwed.

2117,"Been playing Skyrim a year after it's released date and have been playing ever since; i just can't believe in the beauty of the game.  With the wide range of mods offered to this date and beyond for Skyrim; it changes my perspective of the game each time and renew my interests over and over.

I've clocked 7100+ on the original Skyrim alone over the years with many more to come."
2118,"I have picked up this game soon after it came out. At the time I was 11 and as a loner I would always boot up my Xbox360 and play some Skyrim (even for 12/15 hours a day), so all my memories are mainly filled with its amazing soundtrack and ambient noises. Speaking of which, I believe the soundtrack got reworked and cut quite a bit in the Special Edition. I have nothing but love for this game, I bought it four times throughout the years and played it on different software and I have accumulated something like 1200 hours of gameplay overall. Much love and respect for everyone in the community and thank you modders for making people's dream of marrying Serana and killing children come true.
PS: Fuck the Thalmor."

2133,"Not gonna lie, it's kind of strange that this is unlisted now. There's legitimate reasons to want to play it as it was. Not that the special edition isn't lovely and everything, but all my time with the modding community was with this version. And this version just runs better on my computer, so...

Yeah, tis Skyrim."

2156,Most wonderful piece of garbage
2157,I cant recommend this game more. I have played this game more then any other game. It will keep you busy for a long time and take a long time to beat. There are a lot of main and side missions and is a really well made world. It is also a really fun game to re play after you beat it

2170,"Yeah... no , i barely launched the game and it is already a pain, the mouse sensitivity is not 1:1 ratio , and whatever i try in the .ini files i can never get a 1:1 ratio , making it quite unplayable, plus the game has its own mouse cursor untied to the OS's cursor , making it even worse.."

2182,Bom
2183,"This game is so good, every second I play this, I orgasm just a little. Every time I am not I can only huddle in the corner and dive into an existential crisis. By the way, I have played this for about 800 hours so far during covid. Imagine how much fun I had (in my pants) during those 800 hours. I have literally spent so much time playing this, it is safe to say that it has saved me from the virus considering how long I have spent indoors. I have even resorted to shitting myself instead of using the bathroom. Eventually, I bought one of those orange buckets you can get from Home Depot, and my ass literally has a permanent circle imprinted on it due to the amount of time I spent sitting on it. Skyrim saved my life, and has given me a new, second life within my computer."
2184,All the DLC got unlisted? Arrr mateys! Seems we've run out of options!

Mods fix many glitches but you will still find yourself stuck in a free fall behind a rock from time to time. GET OVER IT. All things considered, this is one of my favorite games ever released."

2221,goooooood
2222,need I say more?
2223,Good game
2224,"Before we begin, it must be said: I have poured over 400 hours into this game, more than anything I've ever played. I'd be a hypocrite to focus only on the negatives after this much time spent in Skyrim. I'm a completionist and have just finished virtually coring out the entire world from one side to the other, enjoying countless adventure in the beautiful, unforgiving homeland of the Nords. It's astonishing how much work went into building it, and the minds that contributed to the lore.

OK OK, so let's quit the back-slapping and highlight some of my favourite moments where I realised that as gorgeous as this game was, it was also more broken than anything I've ever played. Utterly ramshackle in some regards. The devs clearly pumped all of their budget into bespoke dungeons and fabulous models and brilliantly penned lore, and none of it into trying to breathe life into it. The dialogue is mostly dispassionate, spewing from inanimate faces of wooden NPCs. I can't tell you how many times I heard characters mispronouncing names of things which I thought had already been established as canon. The glitches are spectacular, the autopilot AI makes for some avant-garde scenarios, and all-in-all the game doesn't end so much as it just kinda grinds you down until you anticlimactically stop playing it.

Special shout out to:
[spoiler]
- Paarthunax glitching out halfway through giving me final instructions on how to defeat Alduin, being dragged upwards into the sky like a retarded puppet as his voice trails off into the distance. I could still respond, but had no idea what I was responding to.
- Several tracts of main character cutscene dialogue inaudible because other NPCs decide to walk right in front of them and just strike up a conversation. Rude! Don't even get me STARTED on the mouthy Spectral Assassin.
- I think I googled something starting with ""skyrim bug fix..."" about a hundred times. How come the NPC just didn't open the door when they should? How come Alduin just doesn't show up during the Elder Scroll cutscene on the Throat of the World, leaving the NPCs standing like idiots indefinitely? How come the Hircine quest allowing me to access the functionality of the Werewolf just kinda never happened? It's like they just skipped beta testing and shipped it as-is.
- Why is my wife sleeping downstairs in the cellar on a straw mattress after I decked out our Proudspire Manor to be fit for a Jarl?
- Characters telling me they hate me for ransacking their city and murdering their friends, then inconsistently expressing their delight immediately afterwards when I hand then the gems/book/grapes they asked for and showering me in septims.
- ""Knock it off, follower!"" I yell as I watch them stuck in the horse riding pose, gliding around behind me while glitching thigh-deep in the ground.
[/spoiler]

Oh man I could go on. In the end I would say this game, for all its woeful incompleteness, is really fun when it's just about rambling through quests leisurely without focussing on the endgame. I would recommend:

- Avoiding cloaks! It's so much more immersive if you can see what cool armour you're wearing. I went through the entire game staring at a red curtain, which stunted my sense of how my guy's swag was improving.
- Convenient Horses. If you're a packrat, the game is literally unplayable without this.
- In early game, just ride places. Save Fast Travel for a later stage when you've really opened up the map. It contributes to a sense of belonging within the world.
- Avoid doing all the quests you're given. It's actually a more fun (and less arduous) experience if you decide what kind of person your character is and limit yourself ONLY to that arc. If you're a thief, avoid the Companions or Mage's Guild questlines. Role play!

It's been real Bethesda. Can't say I'm going to sign up for another of your Elder Scroll titles until your vacuous characters have been given some personality, but I commend you for a stunning, sprawling experience nonetheless."
2225,เกมดีมาก
2226,"Skyrim provides a legendary singleplayer RPG experience. Explore a vast world, level up your skills, find your playstyle and take on more sidequests than you will ever finish. I hardly scratched the surface of the main storyline as I found myself constantly exploring new areas and helping the various NPCs with their troubles. There are so many ways to play and so many things to experience."
2227,its skryim... the most famous medievel rpg there is... not much more needs to be said
2228,"Lots of fun--open environment, make it hard or easy, beautifully rendered landscape.  It is calming to just look around at the beautiful mountains, rivers, flora and fauna.  And mods!!!  oh the mods!"

2252,One of the best RPGs I ever played.
2253,nice
2254,Unplayable. Immediately crashes on startup. Clean reinstall with no mods does nothing. Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves for leaving a game so buggy. They've re-released this thing 100 times yet can't fix game breaking bugs. I cannot recommend a game that fails to even start...

2266,"it gets unplayable once i hit 200 in game hrs. what the fuck is wrong with skyrim, its buggy as fuck. always crashes everytime i play it not even in a minute of gameplay on my last save. tried many solutions to fix them on google and skyrim's forum but still haven't got any good results"

2272,"my review for pirate booty and the bukkake buccaneer 🏴‍☠️ 
this sexy hot erotic game just gets my meat stick wangling through the air with pure euphoria, my little wiener snitchsel has never seen such pleasure before, you know when you go to the club and the sexy hot mummy milker lady whips out her pixalted poop shoot and you just go wow, melons, cum, literal cum. that’s it 
i came 
"
2273,"Mods, and more mods...

Unless you are going hardcore, cutting out the dozens of followers, mansions, castles and slick armor/weapons/spells in order to take SKYRIM down to its most basic level. REQUIEM is an excellent mod available on NEXUS that succeeds in presenting a more brutal and realistic game where every move must be carefully planned adding strategy to attack, builds, and alliances. During the early going, you will often be killed. I started in vanilla. Then Modapalooza, then the stripped down hardcore mode, easily my favorite of the three."
2274,Judging this game solely without mods in mind... this game was severely overrated. It's actually pretty awful.
2275,lol Deadric Achemically Buffed Deadric armour with Fortify health by 9865546hp go BRRRRRRR
2276,"its great

2277,KALO

2280,I still play this game
2281,Good Game
2282,"still one of best RPG's of all time, even 8 years later. Cant wait for next chapter
"
2283,sweet
2284,It's skyrim. What's not to like
2285,"The most disappointing game of the series. Strip away all the weirdness, complexity, obscurity, and creativity from the Elder Scrolls series and this is what you are left with. The magic is dull and simple. The world is boring and predictable. The creature design is bland. In contrast to Morrowind, this game has no soul."
2286,"one of the best games ever made.
"
2287,"It's alright, Skyrim Legendeary Edition is a classic from 2011.
I wouldn't recommend it nowadays though because Special Edition is a thing.
Special Edition is 64-bit while Legendeary Edition is 32-bit.
This makes LE a lot more clunky, slow, and also makes crashes A LOT more likely, with or without mods. Get it if you wanna mess around with mods but don't use this for a serious playthrough."
2288,Great variety. Don't have to follow specific paths anywhere
2289,Love it Great Hours of enjoyment.
2290,One of my all-time favs! Can't wait for Skyrim 2 to release in 2094!
2291,is guud
2292,"Fus

Dah"
2293,great game still after all the years !! still finding myself coming back to play.
2294,One of the best fantasy/RPG games that are out there and it's a big one without taking up much space. You always have something to do like a quest from Thieves Guild or Dark Brotherhood. Won't get bored.
2295,O Skyrim. Every Gamer's Love Letter
2296,just started and im having a lot of fun great game
2297,Welcome to one of the most imbued games of all time. An array of colorful environments evolve through seasons as you face complex fast paced combat. Intermittent menu usage opens a spell book of stratagem and RPG elements. 12/10. Frost Trolls are worse than Wompas.
2298,"original game is great, with mods its like a different game even better and updated"
2299,classic
2300,Bad
2301,its a good game but the magic system is a bit basic without Mods still I recomend it
2302,yes
2303,good game
2304,"Well it's skyrim, you know the deal. This game is so infamous A review is pointless but if you have not played this then your a crack dealer living under rock... SO BUY NOW!!!"

2309,One of the best games I've played.
2310,good
2311,Something something Todd Howard
2312,the game is challenging well thought out (almost as good as Oblivion) mods make the game much more interesting and universal.
2313,wow todd
2314,"Came out 11.11.2011 on my 20th birthday :D
One of the few projects what will stay in my heart!"
2315,Great game. I recommend this game. I've played it for a long time and still play ti.

2346,"I played this game on Xbox 360 and then PS4.
I can't stop playing... It's been days now, please help me. 
So many mods... The days are blending together. 
My skin has begun to meld to the leather of my chair. 
I am the Dragon Born, what is real life? 
Sure can't wait for the 30th Anniversary..."
2347,"great game
"
2348,It's Skyrim.
2349,"What can I say about Skyrim that other people haven't said already? 
The game is fun, engaging, and worth the price of admission — hundreds of hours' worth of content.   

The soundtrack is outstanding - undoubtedly one of the best in video game history. It adds to your immersion and makes you feel like you're actually in a medieval fantasy world.  

While graphics have become outdated and the animations are occasionally awkward, they strangely complement the game's charm. I've never been bored playing this game and always find myself being drawn back after a hiatus. 

Skyrim is a must-buy for any gamer."
2350,Endless hours of fun and strong mod support!
2351,dragons fr! lets go dragons!
2352,"For ten years I've enjoyed coming back to this game. The world, theme, and story is compelling. The faction story line is interesting in the way that none of the sides of the war is neither wholly good nor evil. 
That doesn't mean that the game is without it's flaws. The quests gets repetitive after a while and while some bugs are amusing, a lot of them are hindering the gameplay and you need to either go back to an earlier save or resolve it with console commands. 
While sometimes it might take me a year or two between different plays it's always fun to find new places, try new builds, go different routs in the story or try to solve quests in new ways (even though going through the intro has become very boring by now).
Until TES VI comes out I will keep coming back to Skyrim for my RPG fix."
2353,Fun detailed game. Awesome mods
2354,I just doesnt work
2355,it's ok i guess
2356,"Realistic, full of options, surpassed gameplay"
2357,"YEAH SKYRIM WOOOOO
"
2358,This is a fun RPG game there is so much to do so it does get very interesting and addicted and so much fun especially story mode goes crazy situation change on what choice you make and what you choose i highly recommend this game.
2359,Unable to mod anything anymore its been broken for months thanks for killing an old reliable.
2360,FUN
2361,"A brilliant experience with some writing issues but overall a unique experience that still hasn't been beaten for a sword and sorcery ""total freedom"" experience"
2362,"A classic game, I've been playing Skyrim since I was 15 and it never proves to be boring. Each play through never feels the same."
2363,just starting over again enjoying it
2364,Coconut
2365,yes
2366,Still going strong in 2022!
2367,"Safe to say currently at 51 Hours of play time at  the time of this comment, so its obvious how good of a game it is"
2368,"Love this game, allways have, allways will. The story is enjoyable and the quests are fun. Crafting and leveling system works like a charm. Character creation makes the game feel more personal and the fact that you can join a civil war and win on each account is quite cool. The only thing i don't like about skyrim is that you cant enjoy playing the story as much as when you did it the first time..."
2369,I used to be an adventurer like Dovahkiin then I started playing this game
2370,YES
2371,hell yes the replay value with the mods is out of this world
2372,"Its fairly easy once you know how to play, but it does not disappoint and is a load of fun. The DLC's also are great but the game is not as fun without mods."
2373,136h Vanilla+ 621h Modded = 757h playtime
2374,Love it and I have fun with the mods too.
2375,"I love the expansive, beautiful environments in this game. I can create different characters and customize them so that every time I play the game it's a different experience. The music is beautiful, too."
2376,good game
2377,"What can I say that hasn't been said before, it's a great game that's large and immersive even with the glitches. It is entertaining to see 20 security guards spawn 30 feet in the air and fall, and no I do not use mods that is just the game having fun with heights."
2378,Shit game but mods are cool i guess
2379,"Played for a few hours, its a ton of fun. Even when it gets old something always brings you back to play again."
2380,"I love love love Skylanders :D <3

2381,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an amazing pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
2382,the inter action  within the game
2383,"if you like dark fantasy, magic, monsters, exploration, and a lot of lore history, and fictional politics then you obviously have good taste and this is certainly a game for you."
2384,Good
2385,good game
2386,You know yu Love it
2387,Beautiful game. Never finished because it is endless. Cant wait for the next episode
2388,"never ending fun in this game, with a great modding community."
2389,I like the fact that there is a story line and progressing through the game is easy or hard depending on what level one is comfortable playing. I like that there are discussions that if one is stuck you can get help. I find the game relaxing and enjoyable. The enemies difficulty rate increases as one strength increases. There are multiple side stories to take to help increase one's power. I suggest  playing the side games because some of the quest are difficult and it is a good way to gain strength. There are multiple races and attributes to create the perfect avatar.
2390,"Ive played Skyrim before on the xbox 360, a long time ago. and it just reminds me why i love oblivion more. it was jank....but you know what? it had better writing, design and quests. Skyrim is fine for other people but not me, im gonna go play morrowind instead."

Between a large world filled with many quests and different factions to join and all the mods created for this game, there is still so much to enjoy."
2415,"Amazing game, still holds up today. However for anyone who just downloaded it on a new acc or as a new player, there's an obnoxious glitch in the carriage cutscene in the begining, but it's an easy fix. All you need to do is change your computer's refresh rate to 60 HZ until it's over. Make sure your computer and game is on 1920,1080 resolution and you should be good. you can change it back after."

2445,mods are cool ;)

2448,game is unplayable i get a very small scaled resolution which is unfixable i tried everything and nothing worked :(
2449,yes
2450,Its just swag and a classic.
2451,"Best RPG out there, many different playstyles, totally open world and there is a ton of replayablity after you beat the game."
2452,"This is my favourite of the elder scrolls games. Modded or unmodded, you can never truly tire of the game."
2453,"I suggest playing the anniversary edition of this game. That is of course you plan to play a completely vanilla un-modded game.

This game is probably the most impressive modding platform I have seen. If it weren't for the mods or the ability to create your own. I really doubt I would had spent nearly 4k hours playing it.

It should be noted that the original 32 bit version of this game has been flagged as hidden at the request of the publisher. You may have to find a friend to share a link in order to purchase it. If that does not work, it is possible for them to buy it for you as a steam gift.

Other versions of this game can be moded of course. However some mod authors never ported their mods over to the newer versions. That being said, make sure the mod you want is compatible with your game version."
2454,cool
2455,dyno
2456,It's Skyrim
2457,"I mean its Elder Scrolls.  If your looking for a review or don't know about this series by some insane off chance, its probably one of the best games ever made. Nothing else to add."

2472,You know is a good game
2473,Bom demais
2474,I doubt anyone hasn't played this game yet but if you haven't its awesome.
2475,big funny would reccomend downloading the killable children mod had a blast at the orphanage in riften 10/10 would slaughter again
2476,One of the best games ever made. Bought it like 6 times or so. Haven`t regret a single one of them
2477,aughhhhhhhh yes
2478,Mnogo dobra igra bolje nije moglo
2479,its skyrim
2480,"feels almost as good as the first day I played it, sort of like your mom."
2481,I love this game u can do anything and be anyone u can be a master thief or a sneaky murderer that kills anyone in his path or u can marry someone buy a house and adopt kids to just make dad jokes as i said this is great and u can be anything u ever dreamt to be
2482,cannot even start the game. the cart and horse are flying all over the place
2483,"Honestly this game Is why I made a gaming PC. This and classic doom are probably my favorite games and are incredible on PC. Both doom and Skyrim have massive mod support If you get tired of the vanilla experience and both are pretty addicting. Also both of these games have tools that allow you to make your own maps, Skyrim Is too complicated for me but GZDoom builder Is pretty easy to learn and It's incredible what you can make. If you've never played this you're really missing out and should pick It up, even If It's not on a discount."
2484,"This game is just like Chess

2493,using this off my brothers shared library but its super fun and very moddable 9.6/10 would recomend
2494,"Good game, Buy game"
2495,I think there's some skyrim in my mods
2496,"This game excels in replayability, open world exploration, quests, storyline, and has such artful, immersive, atmospheric surroundings , clearly making it GOAL (Game of a Lifetime)   Its had a good run and I dont see that ending as long as people continue to seek qualitiy, enjoyable, masterfully created games like Skyrim V.  I come back to this game over and over as time goes by.  There's just so many ways to play it never gets old."
2497,Your grandchildren will play this game
2498,Still searching for a game like skyrim 2022. Im re-downloading it cause there aint no other games i like
2499,best ever

2501,"Couldnt not play this game for a long time because my sound card was not sophisticated enough to handle it. Have not played it long enough to give full review but i like what i see so far very much. Two things i do not like about the game though, first it doesnt seem to have a stat screen like the other games of this genre. Second The method of hotkeying is inferior to the older game in my opinion. It should allow the player to assign keys directly to spells, potions equipment or whatever. Third they changed the game so much from oblivion they should have included some kind of tutorial. I have had to do so many restarts its ridiculous just to learn the funky new controls. That having been said i would give it an 8 out of 10 and prolly more like a nine pushing 10......."
2502,Because I was Dragonborn into this world.
2503,Own this game on multiple platforms. I have loved this instant classic for years and will play for years to come.
2504,good game. only dont like the milking from bethesda on all the definitive editions.. but i guess its a way to farm money
2505,I bought it for 60 bucks and have played it for 987 hours...so far.  Need I say more?
2506,This is and will remain until TESVI the best game to have ever come out.
2507,gud
2508,"Obviously one of my favorite games. Like all elder scrolls games you set out to save the world from some great evil, from vampire overlords, dragons or even demon lords themselves.

of all versions available on steam, the origional version updated as far as possible has one great advantage over all the others. Mods don't exclude you from finishing off steam achivements, and is the easiest to add mods to from other sources then the workshop.

If none of that matters to you, then feel free to play the newer versions available on steam, they allow better graphic support and a little more vanilla content. In the end, its all skyrim and if you love elder scrolls, then that is all that matters."
2509,"welp skyrim LE (the old 32-bit version with all dlcs) is a great game to mod to your taste if only all good mods were on the 64-bit Special Edition/Anniversary Edition then I would upgrade
issue with the other version is the required script extender is still being updated and breaking mods a lot as the game gets patches"
2510,Skyrim is a classic. Everyone should have played this masterpiece at least once in his lifetime.
2511,"Mods make this game shine, otherwise the game is very shallow."
2512,decent game
2513,YES
2514,"I've been playing Skyrim for years at this point across multiple platforms. It's always a pleasure to become immersed in the world and explore, as well as follow an enormous variety of story-lines and plot points. I can choose to focus on becoming a master blacksmith, focus my efforts into my magic, stealth, or all of the above. If I get bored with it, put it down for a few months and come back to start from scratch. 
5 stars, 2 thumbs up...great game"

2530,GAY LOL
2531,it's skyrim. do i need to say more lmao
2532,cool
2533,Pretty boring without mods idk
2534,Pog game :)
2535,"After a few years of not playing it and coming back, I'm starting to remember why I stopped playing it. 

Out of nowhere, the game just decided whenever I tab out my desktop cursor will sit in the middle of my screen and move around if I move my cursor while also having the skyrim cursor flying around.
The game also, for no reason, accelerates my mouse so I have to turn down the speed of my mouse just so I dont do 3 360's with the flick of a wrist

I've tried mods to fix these issues, but I literally cant find anything online on either a mod that works or anyone talking about it that wasnt from 8 years ago. Literally impossible for me to play with just these 2 simple issues. It's too frustrating to just look over"
2536,peevstinkOGNG
2537,graet game still play
2538,It's Skyrim.
2539,"Skyrim is a game I have played originally on the console since I lack a gaming pc until later on in 2019. First played it on xbox 360, xbox one, ps4, and then on the pc which I mostly play using mods now which I use more here than on the pc version special edition. I really enjoyed playing it when I first started and later to enjoy more after finally having a gaming pc to use the mods it offers since the console special edition did have mods but limited."
2540,"Awesome game.
Lots to do.
"
2541,best game ever enough said
2542,"Come on, it's Skyrim. If a game has been re-marketed with ~100 versions, it must be good."
2543,"Very fun, especially with mods"
2544,ilove open world games and  being able to modify to my liking   i also love oldworld style games no guns etc and thelore behynd this game is great i would recommend evryone try it.
2545,"I...I...


















Help...

Let me go Todd.."
2546,"Needs another remaster 
"
2547,Its good.
2548,"bussin, absolutely"
2549,yea its alright
2550,I shouldn't have to put anything here. Just get the game.

2553,good very good
2554,Ees Gut. Bought offa E-bay.
2555,Absolute Classic. Still holds up. Maybe not perfectly but it never really was; and I mean that in the best way possible.
2556,"Best RPG ever. Endless Mods, Endless fun."
2557,Its Skyrim without guns.
2558,If you haven't played this game. Why?
2559,I played it with mods for 4 hours after playing it legit on game pass and now my achievements look sketchy
2560,it's Skyrim
2561,It's Skyrim
2562,FUUCK GOOD GAME PLAY WITH MODS DAMNN
2563,The game is really good and will give you hours of fun. The problem is that sometimes when your traveling it can be time consuming and long. But its worth it in the end.
2564,"Skyrim is one of the best games to ever have been released. It contains every Open World RPG element you can think of, the visuals are stunning, and the story of the game is so immersive and incredible. The music is some of the most atmospheric music ever composed for a game. If you are looking to start getting into games, or have never played something like Skyrim before, or if you have just never played Skyrim, I can 100% without a doubt say that this game is perfect."
2565,Its all right but way better with 200+ mods
2566,"Its been so long, there are better games yet mods keep it alive. Like some kinda immortal slug asking for its end. Other then the ungodly amount of mods; magic, and enchanting system is gold."
2567,AWESOME!
2568,"Watch the skies, traveler."
2569,Love it
2570,fun game
2571,classic
2572,"It's okay, i guess."
2573,"I feel like I just woke up from a coma or something.
What happened?"
2574,Great game
2575,Amazin replayability due to an extensive variety of mods that can be added but even without then it's still amazing 10/10 game would alway recommend...
2576,"this games been out for how long now ? very replayable its great, mods can be fun even just a few simple mods change the experience a lot"
2577,buy it
2578,Its the best RPG.
2579,"What is there to say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said? If you're looking for a immersive rpg with some fun power fantasy elements, Skyrim is the game for you. Play any kind of build you like, and walk in any direction to find something interesting to interact with. Plus, there's a pretty healthy mod community if that's more your thing. Between all the editions, and consoles I've owned since 2011 I have well over 500 hours, and still look forward to playing my sneak archer again. 2011/10"
2580,This game still holds true. Beautiful sound track and amazing gameplay.
2581,It's Skyrim.
2582,"Amazing game, always something to do highly recomend!"
2583,"The best games ever. Buy it now , its 11 years old , you have missed out on 11 years of the best games ever made."
2584,Amazing physics for an old game. Beautiful world generation and loads of plot. 10/10
2585,Lots of fun over and over and over again.
2586,Great game! Played through it many times.  Change mods out and play again.  Play until bored and put it down.  Pick it up again when I forget I was bored with it and have fun all over again.
2587,gfdhgdfhdffd
2588,"I did not play Oblivion or Morrowind, so this was my first Elder Scrolls game, and my first RPG as well. I loved everything about this game. Great mod community too."
2589,"i like how i can play this over and over again but keep doing things just a bit differently
"
2590,it's really fun
2591,yes
2592,Good game.
2593,Great Game. I wish i got the Special Edition. Oh well. Time to download mods!
2594,how do purchase a Dlc
2595,i love it
2596,Still holds up after all this time and a classic among classics. Great game.

2601,cool BUGS
2602,deez nutz
2603,I have played this game for hundreds more hours on Xbox. Lots of content with the ability to add lots of mods. Would completely recommend with all dlc.
2604,"xD
"
2605,Skyrim has been released 7 times in the last 10 years. I used to blame Bethesda and Todd ...
2606,The best game i have ever played
2607,"If you like narrative, this is your game. With hundreds of hours of quests to discover, this is one of the most content packed titles you can find. The lore is excellently written and so long, you won't reach the end of it before you get bored That being said, I have collected every lore book, just to give myself some extra reading material. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to put that Hearthfire library to use and see them in game for myself. For anyone who is interested in a fantasy game rich with creativity and modern innovation, Skyrim is a an example for what storytelling games should aspire to. It's not as fast paced combat as you would find in other triple A titles but it succeeds in what it always tried to be, an expansive and immersive open world environment full of unique events, characters and items."
2608,Best game ever!
2609,Best game ever...wish they wouldn't make us wait 2 decades for another one ;)
2610,very good very nice
2611,"Moodded with photorealistic graphics, one of my favorite games ever."
2612,I have been waiting to find out how to get my Disc of Legendary edition to download and finally found a way
2613,Fuckin' lit my guy
2614,
2615,"Crashes all the time. Can't alt-tab. Bugs abound. Bethesda's response is to release an entirely new game (Special Edition), and if you own the base game, fuck you."
2616,Better with mods
2617,:)
2618,good game aged well
2619,Fantastic game! Been playing it for YEARS!
2620,Great RPG of ALL TIME!!!
2621,one of the best games ever made

2625,Lydia carrying a lot of my burdens rn ;-;
2626,"Over 10 years old, still super fun and kicks major ass by today's standards."
2627,Best game ever!
2628,"Beautiful landscapes to wander through, engaging story lines to explore, and great quests to complete.  The game expands on the brilliant lore behind the Elder Scrolls history, although it would be great if there was more information about events throughout Tamriel to investigate.  Skyrim is an improvement over Morrowind and Oblivion in many ways, although I can't help but feel the world is a lot less sparsely populated by NPCs than it should be.  The game has been around for many years now, but I still play occasionally (in 2022) when I get the itch.  Would certainly recommend - 5/7."
2629,"holy moly i love this game its sssssssoooooooooo good i spent day's on this game 
"
2630,adventure
2631,great
2632,"A classic game, one of the revolutionary ones from Elder Scrolls. The ambiance and the world are quite amazing especially considering this game came out 10 years ago. The fact that it is still played through the special edition and subsequent mod packs is quite amazing. Great concept art, great story, great soundscapes and soundtracks.

Now this game can get repetitive. Certain fights and achievements can seem repetitive. That would be my one knock, but compared to games of similar genre at the time it was one of the most dynamic, least repetitive games. Also the graphics are quite outdated, and can be fixed by playing the special edition with mods. 

Overall I would say great game, classic, As good as Morrowind. This is a must have of any gamer, but unfortunately only the special edition is available."
2633,hehe funny cat and lizzies
2634,"It's a great game so far. Great story, great characters, great items and pvp, and overall a good game for a open-world game and highly addicting. The only problem I have with this game so far is that it keeps crashing within 10 minutes of game play (most likely because I have a low-end gaming pc) but besides that it's a graet game."
2635,"Pretty much one of the most immersive games ever made. Beautiful in detail, epic gameplay that last for hours... and hours... and hours..."
2636,Great game
2637,"Its Skyrim, enough said."
2638,This game is a timeless classic that everyone should play at least one time in their life.
2639,awsome
2640,"Yes, play it."
2641,This games sheer amount of content is absolutely absurd for a game made over 10 years ago. although the game has a lot of bugs it is still really fun I would recommend. I have 100 hours and i have only seen a fraction of the games content without including DLCs.
2642,If it wasn't for mods I would have stopped playing a loooong time ago.
2643,"400h of testing mods. rather use mod organizer instead of nexus mod manager.

And if you want to know what this game is about, read ""The Lusty Argonian Maid""."
2644,meh
2645,MPEOS
2646,"- rep, this version doesn't have fishing"
2647,"A classic.  The original version will play on older machines.  i own it for that reason.  My laptop's video card sucks, but I wanted to play it anyway."
2648,good game
2649,"Last golden rpg game, they did not need to improve anything just add coop and more stories and you would sell for ages to come but NOOOOOOOO Bethesda had to go and EFFF it up just like they do everything this days."
2650,"So addicting, couldn't stop playing!"
2651,I like it so much I bought it 4 times.
2652,"A timeless classic. Fun open world RPG, Lots of things to do, cool dlcs and a great modding community. 11/10"
2653,"Hours counter on my account can't show the true number of hours I've spent in this endless game. Because it doesn't take into account the time I played without a license.
I used to play Skyrim after school. Then I played it at university. Then I played it after I got the job.
And I'm still interested in coming back to the game again and again.
10/10"
2654,"pee

2655,"Playthrough is phenominal, as well as the story arcs. Plenty of quests to go on, and even minimally, the graphics are stupendous"

2660,"ahh yes, the game we all know and love, skyrim, it's just the way todd howard in visioned it full of glitches, it took me 3 hours to create a character, not because of the diversity in which ways you can make one, simply i couldn't because the cart you start off in glitches out and spins off in any given direction, the more you look around the worse it gets, water flashes rapidly it was so exciting my friend started break dancing on the floor, walking into any item causes it to collide with you and deal you damage, opening doors causes all items to fly rapidly at the player, over all i'd give this game a 10/10 remakes."

2672,"Bought this game a few years ago.
Now did i finally try it out and 26 hours later i can give my review from my experience.
It is a really good game and i can't understand why i didn't play it earlier.
I did not expect this game to be so difficult and challenging since i completed Elder Scrolls of Morrowind and Oblivion.
The menus , skill trees is great but difficult to understand the first try.
The world looks great and  even if the graphics are old and outdated it kinda look really good.
Can't say so much about the gameplay other than  it's great but i really wish there was a button for HP and Mana other than open the menu all the time.

I recommend this but better of buying the newer version which is updated.
10/10 Love getting banged by  big monsters and stealing horses."

2676,"I'm simply writing this out of my appreciation for this game, despite it being unlisted on the Steam store.  Although dated in many aspects, particularly through its flawed combat, poor in-game engine, and average graphics, Skyrim is in my opinion one of the greatest video games ever made.  No other game bestows through its player the sense of freedom and fantasy quite like Skyrim does.  The skill and gameplay progression, while not perfect, embody this freedom.

Want to run through most of the game without killing?  You can do that.  Want summons, followers, or other NPCs to do all the fighting for you?  You can do that.  Want to be a warrior who decapitates his foes, a mage who literally evaporates opponents, or a stealth build with some pretty badass assassination kill animations?  You can chose either or, none at all, or all at once.  You can save the world against dragons.  You can save an entire city from magical calamity and then become the leader of magic university.  You can also become a legendary soldier that liberates Skyrim from a tyrannical empire or saves it from a treasonous rebellion, and you can decide how the lore of the game will push you to take a side in this war.  Or don't and instead lead the Thieves' Guild as a criminal mastermind.  Or join the Dark Brotherhood and literally assassinate the Emperor of Tamriel by the end of that quest-line.  

What makes Skyrim such a special game to me is that unlike other RPG's, you don't need to adhere to one single play-style, such as killing opponents to earn XP, to progress skills such as lockpicking, two-handed weapons, speech, or alchemy.  The actions and play-styles I described in the above paragraph are things you can actually accomplish without the game pushing back at you.  The music in this game is phenomenal, so much so that sometimes it's spine-chilling.  The atmosphere and storytelling for most quests are incredible, and most of the characters you will encounter feel alive.  Skyrim empowers you as individual and transports you to a new world that you can feel like you're living in.

The things I can't do in our real world are the actions and adventures I know I can achieve in Skyrim.  If you're reading this and have never played this game to a in-depth extent, you owe yourself such a magic experience.  Playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim should be on every person's bucket list."

[Skyrim opens with an Imperial wagon driving four prisoners down a snowy
mountain pass. All are seated and bound; the one dressed in finery is gagged.]

Ralof: Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.

Lokir: D**n you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could’ve stolen
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me — we
should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!

[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]

Lokir: And what’s wrong with him?

Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
King.

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if
they captured you… Oh gods, where are they taking us?

Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.

Lokir: No, this can’t be happening. This isn’t happening.

Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

Lokir: Why do you care?

Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home.

Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m…I’m from Rorikstead.

[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

General Tullius: Good. Let’s get this over with.

Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do
with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I
was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

[A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]

Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?

Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub.

Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.

Torolf: Inside the house. Now."

2728,"It's Skyrim, but for those who are curious to try here is some food for thought. This game is medicore at best and comparing to anything remotely new. It's an 11 year old game. She ain't naturally pretty unless you buy a remaster or download mods. However, people coming back to it because it's classic Skyrim fuckery. It's glitches are apart of the appeal. You can climb mounts with horses for crisist sake. People keep restarting and redoing this game not because of the differnt builds or challeneges, but for the random ass shit they'll see this time. 

On that note never pay more than 20 bucks for it IF that. It's skyrim. Wait for a sale and get that shit cheap. Same goes for DLC. The Switch verison comes with all 3 and thats why its 50$. Which sucks but thats my only form of skyrim rn so yeet."

Game isn't on steam anymore. Just the special edition.

Vanilla game: 6/10
-Main story had much left to be desired.
-Side quests wasn't very good.
-factions quests were terrible. Do 3 tasks and all of a sudden you're a professor of Winterhold? Doesn't feel like I earned it.
-Too much repetition. Most quests are just fetch quests. 
-caves and dungeons all feel the same. puzzles don't really spice things up.
-lore is pretty good.
-soundtrack is great.
-combat feels weird and stiff on mouse and keyboard.
-Bugs.
-fighting dragons is a chore. Trying to sell something in Riverwood only for that to be interrupted by a dragon attack gets really annoying.

Dawnguard DLC: 7/10
-great characters. Wish more companions talked as much as Serana.
-New areas are left to be desired. Castle doesn't have much, and neither does the Falmer/Snow Elves land.
-New weapons, abilites, and armor is a plus.

Hearthfire DLC: 2/10
-basically just one big fetch quest to what, build a house? Not worth it.

Dragonborn DLC: 8/10
-Great new location. Solstheim feels alive with people, locations, and quests to do, unlike the Falmer world in Dawnguard DLC.
-However, stuff is still relegated to fetch quests and repetition.
-storyline is pretty good, and the lore adds to it as well.
-call back to Morrowind, though not sure what it would leave for the player.

Game is overall decent. It can be addicting I must say. It's just not as good as the previous entries in the franchise.

2850,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Miner Hog Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them. Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands."
2851,great adventure
2852,Absolute Classic!  one of the best rpg's in my over 40 years of gaming experience.
2853,The Elder Scroll V: Skyrim: Definitive Edition: GOTY: Premium: Special Edition: Anniversary Edition
2854,"Fun game, can be very silly; mods make it fun"
2855,"Its a good game
"
2856,I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took... FUS-ROH-DAH!!!!!!
2857,syrim
2858,"A great game that you can imerse yourself in , with the open world map it's just fantastic . excellent graphics and sound but watch out for giants and dragons they can ruin your day ."
2859,Very good very nice
2860,"a classic, legendary game, a must have and a must play"
2861,big downgrades in all game play areas over Oblivion. More of an action Rpg and not really a true rpg anymore. Very over rated.
2862,I love the game but be aware that it has a lot of bugs and glitches.
2863,great base game . some mods can be great while others can crash the game.
2864,"Amazing game with beautiful visuals, an interesting world and engaging characters/quests. The combat mechanics are a little dated but with some mods it becomes more bearable :]"
2865,"Almost getting beheaded here, avoiding and killing dragons there. . . The game focuses on both story and game-play. As long as you can stand mild blood and fantasy violence, as well as adult-beverage usage (only in the inns), then I highly recommend this game to you. The game is very realistic, yet also fantasy-like. On the first day of this game you'll be craving it and, believe me, you'll be playing more. (I am so impressed! If they made it with the technology we have now. . . Just imagine!) It's one of those games that leaves you restarting a new game every time you've finished one."
2866,"what a game

As soon as I got this game and I played for a bit, I dropped every other game I've been playing. All and only skyrim. It quickly became my favorite game of all time. And I haven't even modded the game yet!

It's overwhelming the amount of stuff you can do in this game.

By all means, get it."
2867,"It's OK    :)
"
2868,Its a world where adventure awaits. Just be careful of the dragons and getting lost in the story.
2869,It just fun there is so much you can do in this game so many mods and stuff totally customizable to you needs
2870,good

2872,Awesome game
2873,"An indescribable classic of all time. Winner of the 2011 game of the year. If you haven't touched Skyrim by now, I ask you, why not? Try this game and I promise you endless hours of fun, a realm of fantasy where you can craft your own character and make your own choices. I implore all of you, try this game and you won't regret it. ;)"
2874,Awesome. No other words needed.
2875,"While it does lack variety in the towns when compared with the previous stories from the elder scrolls series, it makes up for it in variety with the dungeons/caves/everything outside of the towns. I get that everyone is nord but town architecture is typically determined by landscape as well as culture, so why every single home I go into no matter where I am on the map is basically the exact same makes no sense and seems very lazy compared to how much work was put in otherwise."
2876,yaaasss
2877,Good story.  Good graphics.  Good interface.
2878,Man
2879,Dragon these nuts!
2880,"Skyrim is my favorite game of all and I would gladly sink thousands more hours into another stealth archer character any day.

But I do not recommend this game unless you plan on spending some time and energy modding it. The role-playing aspect of the game is nice, though at times underdeveloped and stale. The combat becomes repetitive and bland over time. The bugs are rampant without the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Patch mod, and while it's fun to play and laugh at the sometimes wonky mechanics in the base game, it doesn't hold water after the first playthrough for me. The modding community is the backbone and lifeblood of this game, and if there hadn't have been thousands of content creators providing amazing mods available to download, I would've never gotten into this game. 

Thank you modders for such a wonderful experience playing this game.

(Ian you can kindly put your own copy up yours <3)"
2881,"Dont side with the stormcloaks, they are racists."
2882,Yea its a pretty good game
2883,12/10
2884,"got the dawnguard, heartfire and dragonborn dlcs and i really recommend this masterpiece, not only that but the game is mod friendly with the workshop so yeah, truly a G.O.T.Y. worthy game right here"
2885,"Great game, played on my own time frame."
2886,SOME OF US OLD COOTS ARE WANTING ANOTHER DIVE INTO THIS OLD RGP Classic
2887,"If this game didn't crash so much and have a shit ton of bugs, I would Highly recommend this game, but since that isn't the case, this is another great alternative to the special edition. It is way less friendly to mods, but does work with mods and it's cheaper compared to the special edition and you won't have to worry about the game being updated and breaking all of your mods... This version of skyrim (being the original) is very unstable with modding and can only handle a handful of mods, but still does a good job at telling a story and it's still very fun to play. Even though it crashes sometimes.

Here's some gameplay of me playing:

2888,fun very time good was edition special more worth it think i
2889,It's 2/20/2022.. It's still a Good Game !.. although I've moved on to SE it's still not a complete mistake if you buy this one.
2890,"It is clunky, silly at times, but also one of the most immersive RPG games I have ever played."
2891,"Love this kind of game merely because it is a decent ""time sink"" for our money in terms of value even before you start playing with things like mods"
2892,Amazing game that is full of nostalgia. The mod community is always adding fresh content and if you like adventure it is incredible for role playing.
2893,best game ever
2894,"the game is a masterpiece, the quality is meh, some mods can improve it, other than that, gameplay is the best"
2895,It's Skyrim.
2896,"I love this game but it's kinda not the style of game i like, i know this is redundant but this is how it is. It's a great game you can kill time with and also be free in what you do ! Have fun !"
2897,"everything
"
2898,not bad
2899,Gr8 game I love it
2900,game epic

2903,Hatelove
2904,"This game is literally one of the best I've played. Maybe it means that I haven't played many games, who knows. But one thing I know for sure: nothing beats walking between cities and listening to the ambiance of Skyrim.

Tldr: I like the snow."
2905,a fucking mess
2906,yes
2907,good
2908,"I wanted to write a serious review, but then I got an arrow to the knee. 
Well, honestly why even bother, at this point I’m not going to be surprised that after world ends and next civilization will dig rubble, they would still find traces of Skyrim, that’s how known( and old, and memed ) this game is.
I mean.. I don`t even know what to write about this game at this point..  especially since this is one of the oldest ones of many re-releases. 
"
2909,Great immersive game
2910,A fantastic game
2911,"As someone with 500+ Skyrim gameplay on the Nintendo Switch & XBox, I think the best platform to play this game in is on the PC.
For one, having access to the Console Command is a heaven sent. The bugs that you can't get through and that ruins a lot of moments & quests can be easily fixed here because of it.
I'm now discovering a lot of amusing details and have finished quests that I ended up avoiding in my earlier play throughs.
This is amazing."
2912,so good omg yas
2913,"gud
"
2914,Is good game
2915,"This is perfect, for a game thats now over a decade old it still looks stunning and there are so many mods to make it look even better and you can easily find yourself randomly doing a full quest line just because you talked to a random npc 9.5/10 great game"

2923,"Best Game Ever Made. It will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Words cannot describe, therefore i can only pray to the divines that you take the plunge. You will never look back my friends."
2924,support for controller is a plus. I wish oblivion had it.  skyrim is fun too but kinda hollow. oblivion was better done. but I can't play keyboard and mouse games anymore. only controller based games. limits my choices.
2925,"Not worth buying in order to mod it. It doesn't matter how much effort you put in, this game will NEVER work smoothly."
2926,"Если вы находитесь в поисках изощрённого способа убийства человека, купите ему Skyrim. Пусть он умрёт от скуки"

2951,Nice Game
2952,"good game, but broken"
2953,Do I really need to leave a review on this game? If you don't have it you're either super young or dumb af.
2954,"susy baka
"
2955,its a fun time
2956,Even without mods there's nearly infinite replayability. The new additions of the Legendary skills extends the game into miles of fun.
2957,"yeah, not bad"
2958,Tastes better with mods
2959,"I love Skyrim.
It is not the best RPG, it certainly doesn't have a deep story with remarkable characters, it has several broken features, glitches and exploits; but it is a VERY fun game with a lot of stuff to do."
2960,"For the fact alone they removed it from the steam store, only gave free copies of skyrim SE to LE owners, and removed the option for base game players to buy the DLC... Instant thumbs down alone"
2961,Intruder recomends this game

2966,CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Playing for years never get sick of it.
2967,"Cool game but for fuck's sake please Todd un-hide the DLC, I wasn't able to get it back then because I was a kid and didn't know how digital purchase worked (I got this from my godfather when I was like idk 11? 12? it was a physical copy) and I ain't rebuying Skyrim True Legendary Edition 4k HD Remaster (I probably can't even run that version bruh)"
2968,"I don't even remember how many hours I spent with it.
Most of my playtime was back in the time when ""offline"" did not count into play time.

2987,Still fun after all these years.
2988,So addicting! Love this game
2989,This game is utterly fantastic. Always fun to come back and play a new character in a different way!
2990,timeless classic
2991,Good.
2992,"not to brag, but this is the best review of the best game in the world"
2993,
2994,The game itself is mid but the mods for it literally make it so you can do pretty much anything you want with it so it's a great platform for modders making it a great game

3003,excellent game ...

3005,"Awesome game, I've spent hundreds of hours playing it on console. PRO TIP: The opening scene is a heavily scripted scene prone to glitches. Limit your FPS to 60 and you'll have no problems whatsoever!"
3006,tis poggers
3007,Just play it!
3008,"Does not work on high end PCs, beware."
3009,"Skyrim is a phenominal creation of amazing software genius, cross-knowledge of history, botany, biology, engineering, that if I hadn't already played it, I'd've called you a stinking liar for even dared mentioning to me that it exists!"
3010,This is the first Elder Scroll game I played as a teen and I loved it.
3011,yhe
3012,I love Skyrim.
3013,its aite i guess
3014,"Laggy AF
i understand that this is the oldest edition and you cant even buy it on steam anymore but it was playable at one point and i dont understand what could have happened to make the game worse.
"
3015,It's freaking Skyrim...that's all you need to know.
3016,its good but I would recommend getting the new version. My game is bugged and none of the npcs move at all. I have tried for hours to fix it and nothing works.

hopefully my kids will get to play skyrim VI one day"
3024,Great game!! Check out the mods for unlimited replayabillity!!!!
3025,"Bethesda makes trash games, unplayable without mods. Hilariously bad character design, writing, coding. The company is a scam and a joke. YOU can make this into a decent game if you add hundreds of mods, but please don't do that. Bethesda doesn't deserve a cent of your money."
3026,One of the best single player RPGs ever created in my opinion. I love the game mechanics.
3027,Dosent work anymore since update. Bethesda support is useless so far.
3028,"I like the game, using over 100 mods just use them to enchance the game. Combat is better than morrowinds."
3029,Highly addictive.
3030,"After hours of trouble shooting, deletion of all my mods and mod managers, uninstalling and reinstalling the game and verifying the integrity of the game files, this game is unplayable."

Shortly the game is PERFECT"
3061,"Legendary, nothing more to say."
3062,"Fus-Roh-Da. Lets be honest, we all want Elderscrolls 6 by now. 
Naja ich denke, der Grund, wieso Skyrim auch heute noch zieht, ist die Modding Comunnity. Alleine wegen deren Kreativität sollte man dieses Spiel mindestens 2 Mal durchspielen, 1x Vanilla und 1x mit Mods, welche eine ganz interessante Prallelhandlung erzählen, wie z.B. das Thomas die Lokomotive die Spider-Man Armee auf uns, Rainbow Dash, hetzt um uns davon Abzuhalten, die menschen zu vernichten... Es klingt wie ein Fiebertraum und spielt sich so, aber es ist Fanstisch, Und da wäre auch noch die TC Enderall, welche mindestens soviel Liebe verdient, wie diese Perle eines RPG's."

3071,10011101100001111001
3072,Can I not just upgrade my OG edition to the SE ? wow way to go about alienating everyone who already owns the game
3073,"Look, I'm the first to point out flaws in Skyrim and I will continue to do so, when the game is discussed BUT as you can see with my playtime: The game has a near infinite replayability.

I got to admit though, that I never finished the main Storyline and mostly just did stuff that I modded in.

Mods are the one thing that keep Skyrim alive and will continue to do so, even when Bethesda decides again to change something about the games code that will make everything incompatible.

You will get a load of fun out of this game, even more so if you start to modify it.

Can recommend, even thought the predecessors are imo better."
3074,"fzhm,4a."
3075,This is a game with very good graphics an interesting story line and so many things to do . Love it .
3076,let me guess... some stole your sweet role.

3078,"it's skyrim, what's there to not like?"

Ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent game."

3086,"An absolute classic!
Is it perfect? Hell No!
But is still a fantastic game on its own, and a wide swath of mods to help you tweak the game to your exact experience. Be it more impressive visuals, more content, content tweaks, or lewd shit.....

3089,iz good game
3090,Sweetrolls.
3091,fun. i guess
3092,"Skyrim is still so dam good after all these years, so many fun things to destroy with fire and blood!"
3093,cool  :3
3094,"Very fun open world game, it is very addicting and the storyline doesn't make you bored."
3095,LIT
3096,worst game ive ever played
3097,"""_"
3098,Perfect game 10/10
3099,Really cool game would recommend
3100,"Impressed that small indie studio Bethesda has managed to keep this game relevant for so long. 
Surely one of the best hidden gem of the 2010's."
3101,"Look, it's a Bethesda game. Are there bugs? Yes. After awhile, though, floating plates and wolves asses sticking out of the ground are charming rather than game breaking. 

Play it."
3102,"Overrated as hell, simpler than it's predecessors, and the dungeons are terrible. Still has some really cool ideas more games oughta do, like adding stakes to the main quest like a timer before the final boss kills everyone. Combat/customization is relatively satisfying, and the atmosphere/music is comfy."
3103,Skyrim is always a great game to go back and play. It's a great open world and has a pretty fun story. An epic RPG!

3105,Great game. Imersive and truly open love it
3106,just finished the tutorial can't wait to see what the rest of the game is like :)
3107,The game is fun and Todd Howard definetly does not have my family hostage to make me recommend people to buy Skyrim.
3108,Bill Cosby is Alduin
3109,Fun game with a lot of great mods.
3110,"Pretty good game. 10/10. 
Got the Special Edition after ten years for the tweaks that make it run a bit better and look a bit better."
3111,"your born of dragon, play so you can see the bad dragon (duke lol) be slain"
3112,game fun
3113,Great continuation of the Elder Scrolls series and the mods available are amazing.  Having spent hundreds of hours on the game and still not completed everything there is definitely a lot of content to explore.
3114,nice
3115,nice one
3116,Nothing more to say about this title that hasn't been said already. More than 10 years after its debut and it's still a worthy title. It also helps that my old rig can still run this title a lot better than the Special Edition!
3117,It's sure is Skyrim
3118,"bought for xbox on release 2011, then again on pc 2 more times after.
favourite game for 11 years"
3119,lydia is the only reason i beat the game
3120,This game is so good I recommend getting it!
3121,its really fun
3122,"Well for whatever reason, skyrim no longer works on modern hardware. Using script extender, downloading mod fixes, running completely vanilla install after validating file integrity, nothing quite makes it right. Physics engine freak outs, grey screen flashes where I start swimming while walking around, can't get through the intro screen without the horse leading my cart dying and it's body stretching to infinity as the cart starts spinning in circles at mach 3. Using a 3080ti and i9-9900k for reference. I'm not even sure if you can buy this version anymore but it sucks that I also can't go revisit age old saves. A disgrace that it seems morrowind will run largely issue free, but skyrim breaks completely."
3123,horse go brrr
3124,good game
3125,GOOD
3126,boring
3127,Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun.
3128,"It's a beautiful, fun game."
3129,"The amount of times I've made a new game, played it for a couple days and then got my fill of Skyrim is easily in the double if not triple digits lol. Really fun game for what it is worth!"
3130,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
Many hours wasted way before I owned the game, you know the game is modded to heck when the mods folder is 3 times the size of the game"
3131,BEST GAME EVER
3132,"i got a mod which replaces the guy who gets decapitated at the start of the game with nazeem

69/10"
3133,"very veery very very very very very very veytr vyyvyvyfvfvb 


yeah you get my point man it's good"
3134,เกมดีมากครับขนาดผมเล่นไปแค่นิดเดียวเองยังชอบเลย ซื้อเลยครับ
3135,Duh
3136,Skyrim
3137,dragon man good at yelling
3138,good game
3139,"This is my favorite game of all time. The lore, the environment and the mechanics are all captivating. With mods the possibilities are endless.

I would definitely play this game 50 years later with my grandchildren."
3140,"With nigh-infinite replayability and massive library of mods, Skyrim is an excellent game. As you can see from my playtime - plus plenty of hours on PS3 from before getting the PC version, and plenty of hours on Switch for the novelty of playing on the go - it's a game quite dear to me.
It's definitely not perfect, though; In addition to an abundance of bugs of varying severities (that, after 4 incarnations over 10 years, Bethesda has found no time to fix -.-), Skyrim's magic system is lacking in comparison to previous Elder Scrolls games, and you lack any real way to avoid taking hits since all characters move like molasses in combat. 
Final thoughts: Skyrim's quite an enjoyable game. If you enjoyed Skyrim, though, try also Oblivion; it'll knock your socks off (except maybe in the graphics department lol)."
3141,Lidya is hot.
3142,"aela > lydia

change my mind"
3143,"My favourite game, you can get lost in this beautiful magical world, so much fun!"
3144,my favourite game ever
3145,It's always the little things for me. The fact that you cannot use windowed mode and something else without the game crashing gives this a thumbs down for me.
3146,Haven't played it much but it's a pretty good game.
3147,Veery nice
3148,"If you're not turning this game into a Korean MMO Along with great and glorious lovers Lab mods, are you even playing the game correctly?"
3149,"Undeniably great. 
Should be considered a benchmark for fantasy games and RPGs."
3150,"Amazing console commands, and
cool graphics, with pretty landscapes. I like this game cause' you can choose your path. You can be bad, be good, be dead, be alive, etc. 19/20 cause there is swear words."
3151,needs to be multiplay
3152,<3 c.l.a.s.s.i.c.
3153,It's Skyrim... what else is there to say?
3154,Perfect. Game.
3155,good
3156,elder scrussy
3157,Fun game worth the money
3158,"Glitchy, but still a great game!"
3159,Best game ever..
3160,"Not a gamer but yeah, good game."
3161,only mildly addicting.
3162,I think this is one of top two games ever.  The other being Fallout 4.
3163,great game
3164,"Skyrim is an amazing game, I honestly love it, it's one of my favorite games, it's so fun and has so much to it, not only is the main quest fun to play but Skyrim also has loads more quests to play"
3165,Literally one of my favourite games ever but i'm so bad with PC controls. Usually play on my PS4.
3166,Never get bored playing this!!
3167,perfect solo game to relax to  only bad thing is the elder scrolls 6 needs to hurry up and be done
3168,"The most interesting game i've ever played, the biggest map and amazing plot"
3169,"just bad - even when I think ""Oh I'll use some fun exploits and enjoy myself playing this crappy game, I don't need mods to have fun!"" no, they're actively patching out fun exploits - it's a SINGLEPLAYER game bethesda! you're not trying to protect the economy, if players WANT to fuck with the balance then LET THEM, stop taking skyrim so seriously, it's only making the player's experience worse."
3170,If you've never played this or have never at least heard of it just throw your computer out of the window.
3171,skyrim
3172,"good, very good."
3173,nah
3174,"So many hours of my life have been spent in this game over the last decade. I had a few hundred hours in it on PS3 before I decided that I wanted it on PC. Properly modded, Skyrim can become a second (or even first) home for anyone. If for some reason you have never played Skyrim, stop reading this and buy it, already!"
3175,I probably have over 4000 hours on this game across all consoles. This has been my favorite game since it's release and I still have fun playing this game to this very day.
3176,"Come for the game, stayed for the mods. Seriously, there is a reason Bethesda is known as the company that have players finish their games. The vanilla version gets boring after a few hours but the mods will ensure this game will still have players for years to come."
3177,"I have tried this game numerous times, I have owned it since it was released, and I just don't get the appeal. I cannot recommend, although for as long as I have owned it I have only played 11 hours worth. I had to mod the hell out of it to make it interesting and the funny thing is that the mods were not the source of the glitches. After awhile I would expect a game to be ironed out, it just never improved."
3178,this game is so good i have played for 1 houres and it's allready superbe
3179,Period

"
3181,fus roh dumb
3182,mods make this game a nightmare but even non modded is fun i see my self playing this game for years
3183,"80% modding, 10% fixing mods, 10% playing."
3184,"You use horrendous exploits to boost your stats, just to get launched 4000 miles into the sky by a giant. 10/10 great game."
3185,Endless replayability. Get lost in an RPG. Works with Oculus Quest
3186,The size of it.
3187,"Like many Bethesda games, it is a fantastic epic story about a single person causing great change across an entire civilization and is one of my favorite games. Also like many Bethesda games it has its rough patches, but Bethesda is really cool about allowing mods and such to the point that you can completely customize your experience for every playthrough which is why people are still playing it to this day. A game that can change every time can never get old. 6/5 stars!"
3188,"Morrowind is still the best, Oblivion will always be a nostalgic masterpiece in my own mind, and Skyrim always seems to be the one I play these days..."
3189,"I remember it like it was yesterday. It was November 11, 2011 (11/11/11) when the game released and the holidays were creeping up. My brother was in town and asked if we should buy this game. I slept on it for a while and regretted it eventually. At the time, Reddit was raving about it and that's all I saw on the front page. They were making references to the ""Arrow to the Knee"" meme and affectionately calling the game, ""Skyrim Job"".

I don't like getting FOMO, so I bought my friend's Wal-Mart gift cards off of him because he doesn't shop there often. I used those cards to purchase this game full price ($60). I feel like it was worth it, plus more. One of the few complaints I have with this game is that it got released more times than it should, IMO. The next complaint I have are the bugs and glitches. I'll excuse this one, as the game has soooo much content.

Just sprinting and jumping around the beautiful, immersive areas is super fun. I recommend mods that increase the speed and height for both and the Immersive Music mod. Then you can just simply vibe, haha. The combat for the previous titles was kinda repetitive (block, attack, block, attack, etc), but this adds some new mechanics, such as the kill move. Those are very satisfying and badass to watch. There's so much content, you'll be doing the side quests instead of the main for hours on end. 

I used to think Oblivion was the superior Elder Scrolls, but I think that was the nostalgia talking. I'm more of a Fallout guy myself, but I can see why Reddit was raving about it back then (2011) and why people still play it til this day (2022). Is this a timeless game? You decide!"
3190,good for if you wanna have more freedom in mods.
3191,great
3192,I prefer the older version of Skyrim since there are more mods to add and it's easier to add them I got the special edition for free and tried it out and it's fine for a vanilla game but the SE lacks decent mods.
3193,The best rpg-single player game ever
3194,I LOVE this game<3
3195,Only elite mfs have this version...
3196,wish i had a life like this!
3197,"Skyrim will forever remain one of the most impactful games in my life, and considering there are too many things to be said about this game, I'm going to just point out the things that I had the most fun with.

Quests: Not the main story itself, no no I'm talking about the side quests. There are plenty. some short and bad, some long and good and something in between. Going around beating the living shit out of the innocent in order to prove yourself to a guild, deciding the fate of who will rule Skyrim or simply helping a demon with his sadistic tendencies are some of the few quests you will stumble upon when playing this game. 

The world: Skyrim takes place in the northern parts of Cyrodiil (from my understanding atleast) and you can really feel it when traversing around Skyrim. Wherever you go (For the most part) there are tall mountain peaks with snow covered on them, Mammoths, sabertooth tigers, bears and wolves await behind potentially trees and stones, and of course the name of the locations, which they have done an excellent job on. 

Exploration: Tide sort of in with the world, exploration is a huge part of the game, in fact it is encouraged that the player strays away from the main story, and tries to go where ever they want to go. See a cave with a bunch of dead animals outside? check it out. Find what looks like a tower with bandits hanging out, threatening to kill you if you don't go away? give them a little treat of their own medicine. There are so many locations with their own story, which adds to the overall worldbuilding this game has. 

Mods: I think most people forsaw this coming, but the fact is that if you start playing skyrim, you will after many play through's, start finding the game a tiny bit stale. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. That is where the modding community introduces themselves. After so many years, Skyrim (not special edition) remains (as far as I'm aware) the game with most mods, which you can download and make your adventures more fun and interesting. Don't feel like the enemies give you enough trouble? install a mod that makes the AI smarter, and fights more rewarding, but punishing if you decide to make questionable choices. Want more sides quests or potentially new places to explore? There are plenty of mods that allow you to traverse to new fanmade places, with their own fun story and npcs. Not satisfied with the companions provided, both for adventuring and potentially marriage? You will probably find something to your liking. And lastly, do you want a new game like skyrim? Well, you should know that there are multiple projects in work (some finished, some still in progress) where there is a whole new plot introduced, new world, new soundtrack and much more.

To summarize, Skyrim will remain forever til the day i die a SPECIAL (badum tssss) place in my heart, and hopefully it can charm you the same way it did to me."
3198,Todd Howard says buy skyrim!!!
3199,"Main story is boring
just play with mods
and why are you updating this game I know that nobody wants updates

˜ A friend of mine with 3000 hours in Skyrim"
3200,One of the best games I have ever played
3201,"10/10 would recommend. There's a reason why it keeps re-releasing, and it's a dream for mod-lovers.

A casual glance online - and especially on YouTube - shows that the developers did a brilliant job at creating a world filled with rich lore.

Whether you want to be the legendary stealth archer, an archmage who knows two spells, or a thief who goes all tomb raider, this is the game for you (with added bugs for your enjoyment!)

I highly recommend a casual glance at the lore before diving in (for the Nth time) to understand the politics and attitudes of this particular era in the Elder Scrolls saga.

Hint: Don't kill him, or be prepared to face the wrath of a million angry gamers.

Have fun!"
3202,Just get it already...
3203,YES
3204,i lyk dragon the r cool :~))
3205,Rad
3206,"It's skyrim, what's there to complain about? Hurry up with TES: VI!"
3207,"I personally feel that skyrim is the worst thing to happen to Bethesda and the Elder Scrolls franchise in general. It taught them that appealing to the mass market works, which hurt the quality of their games a lot, and will have lasting consequences. We will never get Morrowind 2, we will never get Oblivion 2. Those games were far less successful, but in my opinion were more true to what an RPG is. All of that being said, I recently started playing skryim again, having a serious sit down with it, and I'm really enjoying it. I can't quite point to why. If you take all of the pieces of skyrim, how janky it is, and how little roleplaying there is, it seems like it would be a shit game. It just isn't though, it somehow overcomes all of it's shortcomings and is still super fun, even if it isn't a good RPG or Elderscrolls game. In that way it's like fallout 4, remove it from Bethesda and the other games in the series and its great, but in context it feels lacking. It's still fucking skyrim though, everyones played skyrim, everyone likes skyrim, if you haven't played skyrim buy it when its on sale, and give it a try... you'll probably like it."
3208,"I absolutely love Skyrim. I first played this game on the Xbox360, and fell in love. Even with its bugs and annoyances, I enjoy every moment and always discover something new. I've only beaten the game once, the rest of the time I just start over and begin my journey once more.
I highly recommend this lovely gem!"
3209,Maybe the last AAA game worth playing
3210,Amazing but could have better fighting mechanics
3211,yews
3212,I love it
3213,"would i recommend it? yes and no.
its effing skyrim for goddesses sake.
but its also old tech
it effs up your screen solution and is impossible to play if you have 2 screens. not even use them, just having them. game dont like that.
I did like playing it. years ago.
not so much into it now, years later."
3214,very gud game
3215,It's basically Grand Theft Auto but with better hand to hand combat
3216,"it's ok, i guess...."
3217,If you haven't modded this game to the point it dosent even work after a reinstall then are you even playing it right?
3218,totalnie przyjemna giereczka
3219,Very good.
3220,"those who enter take a big risk 
to never get out"
3221,"Classic
"
3222,Not as good as Morrowind or Oblivion but the modding community 11/10
3223,Nice
3224,hitty hitty
3225,"Yeah its alright.

Todd made me write this, otherwise I'd be forced to buy Skyrim on the Playstation."
3226,Yeppers
3227,lotta fun to mod
3228,Best Game of always!
3229,"Honestly, this is the best game."
3230,Played this when it fist came out and it was the most beautiful open world game I had ever seen and it's still awesome
3231,honestly if you dont know Skyrim tf are you doing on here
3232,Hands Down Best RPG of the decade.
3233,nehukaj fuuuurt
3234,"what can I say, +2K hours and that is not counting the hours that i played not going thrue steem."
3235,yes
3236,"fun to just mess around in, a tip is to dismiss the story and just go play around"
3237,one of the best i ever played
3238,"uhhhhhhhhhhh better than the remaster because mods work

i recommend skyrim kill-able children mod"
3239,"It has bugs, sure. But the experience of this game, even 10 years later, is like no other. Plus, there's always the modding community to improve your game."
3240,"played it for a bit, its ok i guess"
3241,"Better than Special (Ed) Edition
"
3242,"I played this as a full blown nude Orc rogue with a hanging dick and grabbed myself a Husbando (which in long terms doesn't do anything). Cause... mods.
But I still loved the gameplay. Never would started it without mods though. The graphics even that day were not really ""my thing""."
3243,"I've played this for almost 1000 hours.  I always find new things, and enjoy revisiting regularly."
3244,"Reviewing all of my games
#7
Why you SHOULD play this game:

1. Sweetrolls
2. Fly to the moon with the giants
3. Tomas the train dragons
4. Sacred chicken
5. Skooma
6. FUS RO DAH"
3245,"dont buy this shit made game, there is a change you get a bug with the opening sequence where you just cant progress because the cart wont move and just spaz's out all the time, installed countless mods and looked at an infinite number of guides, yet no fix, 

i hope Microsoft truly screws over Bethesda so they never can make another shitty buggy mess like this 

idiot developers"

3270,"Solid base-game, not to mention an incredible modding community, infinite replayability, you could potentially play nothing but Skyrim for the rest of your natural life. Its been over ten years since the release of Skyrim and its still a strong contender for one of the best Action-RPGs ever made."
3271,Never should have come here
3272,"Who doesnt like Skyrim?

I wish it was Co OP though as single player games like this I get bored after an hour or so.If I was playing this with cool people or just someone who knew the game really well, I think I would like it more but I know some of you would like it less.

I never tried the mods so if someone wants to comment about that to me.I heard about a nude mod.

Still a cool game 4 sure.


If you like Skyrim check out Dragon Age Origins.It is only 2 years older than Skyrim. Buy it on GOG for $5 though as the expansions run better.

3291,"Probably one of the best games Bethesda has ever made.

Great content, long storylines, and excellent combat as well as hilariously funny ragdoll physics (hint: let a giant power attack kill you for some hilarity), this game is rather well built despite a heinous array of bugs within the code.

But that's what mods exist for--this game is ultra-moddable and anyone thinking about getting this game should stop thinking about it and do it! I bought this game on release day back in 2011 and I put in almost 700 hours non-stop before I burned out for almost 10 years. It's got a bit of everything for everyone currently.

Grab it, try it out for yourself, and trust me you won't be disappointed.

I also suggest this version over the ""Special Edition"" variant that Bethesda released--as that one blocks all mods that are not specifically MADE for the ""Special Edition"". The base game will do you just fine."
3292,"I mean I guess I can still play it without the hentai big titties mod, so..."
3293,Amazing game!
3294,It's a fun and time consuming game filled with tones of quests and side quests.
3295,"This RPG at it's hardest difficulty made me kill the end boss with two shield bashes. Quests have only one way to be completed and there's pretty much no decisions made by the player, you're a bystander. The shallowest RPG I've played. Also the story is very basic. Dragons Bad, Stop dragons, you are the chosen one."
3296,"The best thing about this game is the physics engine and all the other bugs.
It's unironically amazing."
3297,yea
3298,"Played the steam version for 800+ hours and I still haven't managed to get all the achievements, that tells you how distracting the game world is. It aged badly, but with some mods its the best there is."

3301,"2022, just downloaded this game and yet WHY CAN I NOT GET IT TO GO FULLSCREEN??? I have never played this game before and i tried to fix the .ini files and do anything else I could find online but still no cigar. i don't have any mods because i'm a newbie at rpgs and even still I tried to download the nexus mod manager to use the fullscreen borderless mod thing and STILL  I get an ity bity screen when I try to open the game!!! What is going on and why can no one help me?????"

3310,amazing game
3311,"Skyrim is one of the best games I've ever played. Good content, good story. You live the adventures on the game."
3312,Skyrim is easily worth your time.
3313,"So I've had this game for YEARS in many forms (the disk, Steam, Xbox 360, Xbox 1) & as I try to get back into the game with the only copy I know the whereabouts' of, it won't do game audio. Not because of some mod but freshly downloaded & installed. Went so far as to uninstall/reinstall Steam & everything with it, by the way the ""Back-Up"" file should stay when ya do all this (hint-hint Steam guys).
Why isn't it working? Don't ya think 4 copies of the same game is enough or you guys trying to make me pay AGAIN... I love this game as much as I loved TES3 Morrowind but I haven't even been able to really grind on TES5 & watching YouTube don't cut it... As a matter of fact that's the main reason I need to dig into TSE5 again, too much TES5 click-bait & years of NOT having time, lack of a copy or life having other plans right when ya get started. I want my Skyrim, a game I should have played already but just couldn't. Don't make me get a new copy of the same game, just fix/tell me how to fix the audio... I'm a stop here, I could go on forever. Love this game, seen much, done little & I only have a passable laptop."
3314,This version is the best compared to the newer versions.
3315,Lots of content to keep you engaged.
3316,"great game but with mods its Legendary, the only limit to this game+mods is your imagination"
3317,game good
3318,"If you like adventure games, you will LOVE this one. It's 100 times better with Mods, But Adding & Deleting Mods will eventually CRASH & BURN your Game, You MUST know what you are doing. Other than that, it's an Awesome Game !!!"
3319,yes

3322,Really enjoyed n modding it is fun.
3323,yes
3324,lol no fishing
3325,"So I found this little gem hidden away, and I thought, hey...let's take a flier on a small indie game company.

You're probably looking for reviews because you've never heard of this game and you're wondering if it's worth buying.  Well, it is!  It's pretty good.  Kind of low budget, involves waking up in a cart, flying lizards, and yelling at things.  You'll get the hang of it.

It's kind of niche and quirky.  There's a few glitches, like your character can accidentally look like a cat or a lizard, which I think just kind of adds to the charm.  Also you can throw fire out of your hands, which is weird.  They'll probably fix that later.  

It's pretty long"
3326,One of my favorites of all time!!
3327,Excellent Mod support wonderful replay-ability. Well crafted classic masterpiece of a game. if you've never played it it's your loss.
3328,Great all-round game
3329,It's ight.
3330,When Todd Howard offers you absolutely remastered very special snowflake edition to milk your money remember classic Skyrim is when the legend begins lmao
3331,It is annoying that the only way to disable this constant irritating prompt is to actually review the game. So I will: IT SUCKS!
3332,This game. Hit play
3333,"من افضل الالعاب اللي قد لعبتها 

الإيجابيات
القصة اسطورية بمعنى الكلمة لكن تحتاج لغة عشان تفهم المحادثات لان اللعبة تعتمد عليها 
نظام اللعب و المهام جبار وممتع مع ان فيه شوية تكرار والمودات موجوده وبكثره وتغير شكل اللعبة وتخليها ارهب من ماهي عليه 
صراحة اللعبة جميلة ومو ناقصة غير واحد فاضي يلعبها لان بتاخذ بالقليل 25 ساعة عشان تخلص المهام الرئيسية بس 

السلبيات
صراحة ما اشوف الاسلبية وحده في اللعبة واللي هي القلتشات مع ان تقدر تحلها ببعض المودات"
3334,"Though I have never managed to complete the main quest line, it was fun. But even with all the official and unofficial patches and crash fixes and whatnot in 2022, the game still struggles with memory management and will crash every five minutes to an hour depending on your luck, so I would recommend playing Special Edition instead of this original release."
3335,Wow open world one of the best games i have played
3336,ok
3337,EVERYTHING
3338,"The only problem with it that after sunking hundreds of hours into it, both vanilla and with mods, you might run out of things to do and get bored. Duh"
3339,"It may be called Oldrim, but it can still surprise with something new."
3340,When mods
3341,great game with whole space to explore.
3342,you can fly with a f*cking bucket. very gud.
3343,Pretty fair dinkum game
3344,Yes.
3345,"Broken, and unpatched. The camera and objects spin and bounce uncontrollably in the opening cut scene, and here and there throughout the game (if you can even get past the opening).  Literally unplayable. 

I simply can't recommend a game that is this absurdly broken for lack of a trivial maintenance patch."
3346,shit game 11/10
3347,its skyrim what do you expect
3348,mod
3349,much quest
3350,"Its skyrim, if you havent played it you should, if you have play it with mods"
3351,...
3352,A game that everyone should play at least once. Definitely a classic.
3353,"good game is fun
"
3354,"great game, has aged very well. Wish the main quest was a bit longer, but otherwise a great game."
3355,Fun game with a ton of re-playability.
3356,"I mean, it's Skyrim. the game so good they made it twice. I own this game on multiple platforms. i've bought the DLC on multiple platforms. My total accumulated time in tamriel  is well into the 10 thousands, ESPECIALLY if you count the other elder scrolls games. play it, you can't go wrong."
3357,"what can you say, 10 years old and still awesome, especially with visual enhancement mods running"
3358,Good
3359,This game is timeless and the mod community keeps it going strong.

3365,"Started this game with a quest to become the dragon born.







Ended my play through with various NSFW mods installed, I don’t think that’s lore friendly."
3366,"Don't know why you're reading reviews for a game that came out over a decade ago when there's 2 other better versions (besides modding, this one has better mods in some areas and a bigger mod pool.)"
3367,"ok but wheres skyrim two???
"
3368,mids
3369,"The first of MANY releases of this game. It’s an improvement in little details (like a normal walking speed lol) to the USP of the shouts. Its fun, fun, fun. The quests are good (some of the Daedric artifacts feel better this time around) the would feels more alive than Oblivion. That said, if you have not bought this before, by the Anniversary Edition (the SE DLC) instead. Or buy this, either way just avoid arrows to your leg areas."
3370,"Classic. 

Get it!"
3371,😀👍
3372,"My partner loves this game. They recently lost their PS3 in a move and with that lost the game, They were so excited when i told them they could play via my computer. Thank you"

3403,Good game. Good mods.
3404,its great
3405,This game feels made out of rubber
3406,"A real D.I.Y. game. Buy this version of skyrim if you want to save $20 and mod the game yourself, instead of letting Todd Howard mod it for you. Game has not aged the greatest and must be modded to fit modern standards."

3408,"The best game still, have played it many times and I still find quests that I haven't completed. Just thoroughly enjoyable."
3409,"If you have a pc and dont use Mods WHY do you have a pc?????
this game IS WAAAAAAAY better with mods. with out its still a very good game.
"
3410,"What can I say about it?!

I put 39.8 hrs in to it, in the early stages I was loving it. By the 39.8 hrs mark I was totally bored and went to another game.

Even know the reviews are quite high. I can't give it a yes or no review.

But because I'm forced to give it a yes or no. I'm going to give it a no."
3411,"Okay, where to begin... The land of Skyrim is a beautiful place but, the combat is brainless, the puzzles are too simple & i feel the character speed is way too slow. I couldnt even tell ya if you could speed up later in the game because i couldnt get that far as my patience wore thin, from what i remember running & jumping everywhere did nothing like the older games for the Acrobatic & Athletic skills. Id spent far more time on The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall & have Morrowind on the OG Xbox. Those games are alot better then this game. I cant help but feel im being called stupid when im playing.

Combat: Swing like a mad man
Puzzles: Simple (They are in the same room as the answer)
Story: Feels lazy at times

Its a very dumb down experience compared to older Elder Scroll games. The new star tree looks awful & i think this is where Bethesda forgot the roots for these games originally being on PC as some things such as lock picking & interface of the inventory screen as examples feels like it favors a controller. I just couldn't get into this game as much as id like to."
3412,WOOOOOO
3413,"Phenomenal game with a great story and a ton of content. The world you run around in is beautiful and the story is well paced and easy too follow. You will feel as if you are in the land Skyrim itself.
Graphics mods are recommended but you will do fine without them as the game already looks good.
Combat is great and travelling is fun (Fast travelling is possible)
The game is definitely not bug-free but very playable and enjoyable. 

If you've beaten Skyrim you will still have exabytes off mods ready too install. (Be careful which ones you download, most are garbage or very cursed.)"
3414,The classic first-person fantasy RPG. Enough said.
3415,"I didnt care for this game at launch. Lacked some features and had many bugs. But now with patches and mod community, its an 11/10 game for sure."
3416,I download 200 big booba mod game crash I donlod 300 secx mod game work proper for 10 minutes I do'nt paly game anymore for next 5 month becouse I wait for more realistic vergina model 4k
3417,[quote=Every Skyrim Player] You'll spent more time modding and fixing it rather than playing [/quote]
3418,kinda shit in 2022
3419,"just buy it bro,its worth it"
3420,"I recently reinstalled the game.  I cant make it past the intro because my laptop runs higher than 60 fps.  If yours does, you wont make it past the intro and wont be able to play the game."
3421,"good
"
3422,good game tho i am having some graphic issues
3423,"Yea, I mean, it's alright... Get it. Or don't, whatever. Casual..."
3424,the best game evers

3426,I don't even know how many times I've given Todd money for this game but I'd do it again
3427,One of the greatest games of the 1st decade
3428,...... its skyrim.
3429,"A top 10 classic, for sure."
3430,It's fine
3431,10/10
3432,"It's Skyrim, do i need to say more?"
3433,tis a fun and rousing game
3434,Skyrim.................
3435,"Though it has it's flaws, between mods and updates, there is so many ways to mess around in this game."
3436,good
3437,"I have played this game since it was first released long ago. It has been a huge part of my life. I enjoy that you can play on PC and add Mods to it. Either way, if you are looking for an adventure and love to explore places, check this game out. There are plenty of quest to keep players busy while the game is filled with surprises. 

The negative part is the fact I cannot kill the mail man and I cannot wipe out all the falmers completely. Never will I forget the death of my husband.

Also, you can be in multiple fights too. For example, a dragon swoop in with giants, wolves, and many more monster attacking you at the same time. This game also has players each health organic food since this is a fantasy type game. 

Take a chance to play the game. Don't do the new release unless you never have played the game or never had it in the first place. Jolly good fun."
3438,Great game vanilla that can turn amazing with mods. Can easily sink hundred of hours into. If you somehow ended up here and don't have the special edition though go get that. It is much more stable and runs better with or without mods.
3439,Always a good game to relax and playthrough.
3440,yes
3441,Its arrousing
3442,"If you haven't at least tried Skyrim at this point... Why? It is an incredible game. Perfect? Definitely not. But it was groundbreaking for it's time and many players are still exploring it's many nooks and crannies to this day. For a game you can usually pick up for 20 bucks or less, it is definitely worth getting, even if just to see why it took the world by storm and how it still has so many players after this many years."
3443,Yes
3444,best game ever
3445,Still one of the best RPG's out
3446,"This game changed my life.
"
3447,got caught lackin by the spider in the first cave
3448,Still one of the best games for spending hundreds of hours on.
3449,"yes good
"
3450,it just works
3451,fus ro dah
3452,This is the only game you need to play and play over!
3453,"Very good game, especially with some enhancement mods"
3454,This game sucks
3455,"Amazing game, it has a few bugs but it's well worth it"
3456,"The game is beautiful, the setting is immersive - art, music, dialog are all consistent with each other. There is so much content and side quests that you'll never get bored. I strongly recommend this game. Maybe get one of the newer versions with better graphics and some bugfixes if your pc can run them. This version is also pretty enjoyable so far.

The only downside is that there are a few bugs here and there, but you can get one of the newer versions where most of those bugs are fixed. The flying objects thing is fixable trough the ini file. You can find tutorials online in 5 minutes. It happens when the game runs with over 60 fps."
3457,"for the first few runs the vanilla game is fun, but once you get bored with the vanilla game the mods created by our community gives you endless possibility. it'd be hard to get bored"
3458,"I don't own Oblivion on Steam.  Here are the points I prefer from that game:
+Better story
+graphics
+Better guilds all around"
3459,Great game. lots of challenges and adventures that will keep you busy for months and years.
3460,Hodd Towards.
3461,GOAT
3462,"When modded well, greatest game of all time, there is no close second."
3463,"this game is terrible optimization for mods. half of my mods i installed didnt work properly.
but for a classic skyrim experience 10/10 top notch
i have maybe 300 hours on pirate version and i decide to bought the game then spend another hundred hours again.
this review irrelevant anyway since the game storepage are hidden."
3464,ITS FUN
3465,I mean.... Skyrim
3466,it's ok i guess
3467,dawg this game is so darn fun. it's an absolute must
3468,not bad
3469,Its outdated but still fun is you havent in a long time
3470,Great game but missed opportunity to not be able to marry Serana without mods :(
3471,i only play this for modded boobs lol
3472,"Got this nearly at launch and it was the first rpg I ever played. It's a bit of a comfort game now, very relaxing to just hop back in every now and again."
3473,yeah its pretty good
3474,Yes
3475,"very good game ,fun and good to look at,the only thing i would change is the variety of enemies,i would like there to be more types of emenies"
3476,"Be warned, you will get lost in this game. Best game I've played TO DATE"
3477,great game
3478,Where is the Skyrim SE potato edition?
3479,"The glitches are funny but when you're on your third time starting up the game and the horse bugs out.
Now that is ridiculous."
3480,good
3481,very good game
3482,This is the greatest game of all time.
3483,its skyrim
3484,"Wish this game was cross save. Has made me less likely to play now. Also, pc doesn’t even have the expansions. I was considering getting it on my switch as well but not worth having to redo everything I’ve already done on a different system."
3485,"who really needs to read a review for Skyrim? This is a top 10 game of all time ever. If you've never played, please give it a try and get lost in it."
3486,qwer
3487,Definitely Skyrim
3488,"Ten years later, the graphics really aren't pretty and the combat gameplay is very outdated. But with mods you can still turn this good foundation into a great game. Just be aware that browsing and researching and downloading and installing (and debugging) mods is a time investment – for me it's worth it, I love the end result, but for others it may not be.

Counterintuitively, modded Oldrim (aka Legendary Edition) (i.e. this version) looks a lot better than modded Special Edition (or Anniversary Edition for that matter) because of the much, [i]much[/i] more powerful ENB graphics mod. The difference in water shaders is like night and day. Turns out upgrading Skyrim to the DX11-based engine from Fallout 4 wasn't an upgrade at all, at least for PC players.

I don't think I need to do a deep review of the actual content of the game... If you're reading this review you probably already know basically what it's like. The world is immersive and vast, voice acting is usually ok, quests can be great, putting a basket on an NPC's head is still fun, Jeremy Soule's music slaps. No matter which playstyle you think you'll use, you'll degenerate into another stealth archer."
3489,♥
3490,i like this game but i dont like modding it and seeing boobies
3491,The game is just fun..Just waiting for the next chapter in the series
3492,Would Fus Ro Da again.
3493,Best Game possibly of all time
3494,"It's skyrim, need I say anything else?"
3495,"It just *Works* :) (15/10, your never gunna beat my 3500 hours on xbox 360, 5625 hours on ps4 and however many the fffffffffffffuuuuc Ill have on steam in but the next couple of days. Get rekt, beta gaemer >:) *Procceeds to snort copious amounts GFuel just like a god gaemear like myself shuld*

(For maximum immersion, read all the text after ""It just *Works* :)"" like your a falmer snorting copious amounts of moon sugar mixed with gfuel in a cave)"
3496,11 out 10. Best game ever made.
3497,it's in slow motion
3498,love this game
3499,"It's skyrim. What do you want me to say.

Worth $15 in 2022 if you have never played an Elder Scrolls game before. May make a good christmas present for somebody on Nintendo Switch."
3500,"Yeah man, it's skyrim eh"
3501,"Great Game, lot of Mods, Fun as it gets"
3502,"The game I keep coming back to. Some skill types are way better than others, so how you spend your perk points makes a big difference. So much to see, do, and explore! Definitely worth playing."
3503,It's a fat W
3504,God Howard
3505,"I can't sing the praises of Skyrim enough, without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time. Now that I'm able to play unrestricted with mods, I love it even more. I don't agree with alot of what Bethesda has done since this game, but I love the game itself regardless. If ES6 is at least as good as this game, I'll be a happy man"
3506,Between the hours of walking en fast traveling there are some genuinely amazing quests and moments in this game.
3507,skrim
3508,"Best immersive RPG thus far, complete with mods"
3509,One of the best RPGs
3510,very buggy
3511,"I genuinely do not understand why /v/ complains about Skyrim that much. In the worst case scenario, the game feels at least as fun as Oblivion. As a matter of fact, according to Steam, as of writing this review, I actually spent more time in Skyrim than in Oblivion, and I didn't even touch any of the expansions yet or fully finished the civil war storyline, unlike Oblivion in which I've also beaten the Knights of the Nine expansion and became the Arena Champion. Maybe the times would be closer if I actually managed to force myself to complete Oblivion's Mage Guild storyline?

Anyways, if you call yourself a fan of modern RPGs, you have to play this. Be sure to read other reviews in order to get the unlisted DLCs as well. Alternatively, you can buy a Steam key for the Legendary Edition on grey market key reseller websites like G2A or Kinguin. Just because you have to play this game does [i]not[/i] mean you also have to be a dumb sucker and buy whatever 2563rd re-release that Bethesda decided to pump out this year."

3520,"What a hidden gem! If you haven't head of this game, it's kind of like a spiritual successor to Oblivion (a great old game that came out on the Xbox). It has a big open world that has a lot of different places you can visit. I liked that I could be some kind of cat-man, so I picked a lizard. Spent most of my time trying to figure out the overly complex melee combat system, but it was worth it in the end to finally fight a dragon! I can't beat him, but I don't think you're supposed to. 7 out of 8."
3521,yes
3522,hn
3523,yes
3524,"It's ok, I don't like how they included options for other playstyles when heavy armor + two handed is clearly the best"
3525,"The base game is good, and with the option of modding it is over the top - at least it was when it came out. The modding community has kept the game fresh with improved graphics, and more importantly with add-on quality expansions - and modding is free."
3526,amazing game
3527,gud gam
3528,thomas the tank engine.
3529,good game

3536,good game just bethesda things happen here
3537,DOVAKING DOVAKING DOVAKING DOVAKING
3538,Never enjoyed the game. Shame. Seems overrated due to its terrible gameplay and combat mechanics. Very weird game honestly.
3539,great game 10 out of 10 would recommend
3540,"Finally got the hang of the game and got out of that helgen cave. Game not for inexperienced gamers, that tutorial is dark souls worthy!"
3541,Hey! that's pretty good
3542,you can hit people
3543,"Immersive How-to-Skyrim guide:
1. get nostalgic, time to replay
2. spend days looking up mods
2. throw too much mods, half of them probably have ""immersion"" or ""immersive"" or both in their names
3. spend most of your time modding and testing rather than playing
4. start playing (for real)
5. oh what's this? more mods to try out??!!
6. keep modding until it breaks for good
7. repeat

Tips:
- don't use quick travel, walk the roads and mountains. You won't regret it because you will discover alot of things in your adventures
- don't ignore the dlcs, they are big and worthy
- have fun, this game won't die
"

3558,"I love this game. I use it as a get away from life, at the end of the day, to relax and take out any frustrations."
3559,Can replay over and over - always a different story. Good RPG  games are hard to come by- this one will remain in my library for years to come.
3560,
3561,good story
3562,"do i like this game? yeah, you could say that."
3563,"Good/Bad Points about the Game :

- The game story is kind of classic ( you are the ''chosen one'' and also the only one able to defeat the big bad guy ) but let's be honest, despite being a stereotype, it's still very enjoyable/epic and even better If you played the two past games, in particularly Oblivion.
- The main quest is quite short mainly because the game got a huge number of secondary quests, so go easy on it.
- There are a tons of playable races with their own cultures, story and appearances in the Elders Scrolls games : 3 types of elfs, 4 types of humans, orcs, c a t s and lizards. They all have their strenghs and weaknesses, and you can also have some differents dialogues depending on your character race. ( and not always some pleasant ones, feel ya my dark elves bros ).
- You can be either a ranger, a warrior ( one-handed or two-handed ) and finally a mage. Your race doesn't make you unable to become any of those classes, but for example, a mage orc will have more difficulty than a high-elf so keep that in mind ( yes I have an orc mage, yes we exist ).
-The graphics were really amazing at the time the game came out, but after all these years we can easily find way more beautiful in the video game industry, but Skyrim is still a beautiful game, I've got tons of screenshots of some amazing landscapes ( mostly, northern lights ).
- You can become the leader of all the guilds ( mages, warriors, assassins and the thieves), yeah, even if your khajiit warrior never uses spells you can still become Arch-Mage lol
-The NPC's are the best and the worst, you can love deeply some ( Katria <3 ) and sometimes you interrupt a quest, then quick-save, just to punch Nazeem and Braith in the teeth ( downloaded the ''killing children'' mod just for her <3 and then uninstall it cause my kids died because they tried fist-fighting with giants cause … puberty, I guess ? :c ).
- Bethesda is a a video game company well known for their bugs, some are really funny and you can have a great time laughing at them, but you might be unlucky and have the kind of bugs that are really annoying ( the kind that makes you take your most recent save, until you realize that it was almost an hour ago so your just there with your own misery).
- Every kind of ''gamers'' can play it, it's not hard at all to play or just to learn how the game works.
- Skyrim is the best game in terms of mods, the community was and is still happy to provide the world with some incredible ( or sometimes some really weirds ) mods. They can completely change your game experience, making you feel like playing a whole new game !

What I personnally love the most in Skyrim are the random events you may encounter while traveling, like : meeting an old orc who wanders around seeking a worthy death, a crazy person who implore your to taste the Wabbajack ( a magic artifact who do some random funny/dangerous things, nothing else weird ), an headless horseman or just some cute homeless doggo.

I also really enjoyed some secondary quests like the guilds ones, but mostly the daedric ones. Mainly because the daedric princes are in my opinion one of the best thing ( if not the best thing) in the Elder Scrolls lore.

The DLC's :

I loved the DLC's but have a high preference for Dawnguard because of the Volkihar castle theme, the new places : the Forgotten Vale and the Soul Cairn and the little lore part about the snow elves ! But the Dragonborn DLC got Miraak, new shouts, a new type of dragon and Hermaeus Mora the most interesting and mysterious daedric prince ( but not the best, sorry spot taken by Sheogorath followed by Sanguine ).

The Hearthfire one is good but it just add the possibilty to adopt kids, have three houses ( who take some long a*s time to build and that you can arrange to you own desires) . Your kids can bring at home a pet : a fox, a rabbit, a mudcrab or a … skeever. I have to admit as a khajiit dad I was highly disapointed to see my son bringing back a fricking rat home, like, the little dude forgot how the food chain work.

If you want tarts, bread, wine, kiddos, houses and wasting money on your cow and chikens dying every hour because of bandits or giants.Then Hearthfire is a good DLC for you. But if you have to make a choice take Dawnguard or Dragonborn instead, because who needs a spouse when you can ride a dragon or become a Vampire Lord ?


Conclusion :

Anyway, if you hesitate about taking the game or not, don't think. just. take. it.
If you don't, Todd Howards will be under your bed tonight, whispering in your ear about Skyrim 45th release : The Special Anniversary Legendary Edition.

And you don't want that to happen. Do you ?"
3564,"1400 hours and counting, still not bored.

Ps: fuck todd howard"
3565,Was feeling some Skyrim after not playing for a long time. First three attempts bugged the cart and didnt let me proceed. first cave I keep falling through the wooden bridge. Completely ruined the experience. Garbage game filled with garbage half coded garbage. Would not recommend.
3566,THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3567,"I mostly played the mainplot. ´
It is by far not perfect or the best rpg. But Skyrim has such a big suction force, which dive you always deeper into this nordic Kindgom.
+ Epic Flair
+ Can you play through ?! (Playtime)
+ Nice Landscapes
+ good german Voiceacting
- Combat mostly Hectic & simple
- technical not the best game"
3568,good
3569,"The legend lies here and still always be, looking forward to the sequel maybe in the next 10 years."
3570,"It was an old game when I started playing it.

Like most of Bethesda titles, it's the ability to mod that game that give it a lifespan past a playthrough or two. 

Modding a Bethesda game IS playing a Bethesda game. Yo! Bethesda! You paying attention here?

I think I've been in every cave, dungeon, nook, and cranny. Worth it."

3578,"Its Skyrim.

The game that keeps selling new versions.

While that last fact may be shit, its shows this game is very much worth playing.

Haters gonna hate but Bethesda, as shitty as it is, makes some of the best games with the most bang for you buck one could ask for,

So if you don't somehow already own a version of this game do it. 
You wont regret it."

3596,Good Game
3597,"Skyrim was one of those games everyone played except me, because I was poor as FüCk and didn’t have the hardware back then. 9 years later I bought it on a cheap sale page with all the dlc’s and gave it a try whenever I was high. +100h later I can say this:

Pros:
-	It’s as fantasy as can be. You are in a magical world with uncountable options of being whatever you like, a mage, a master-race dual-wielder, a role player… doesn’t matter, this is finishable for almost every choice.
-	The story is well thought out and has amazing depth. It also makes references to other titles and the overall story all the time.
-	You can marry, have (adopted) kids that will annoy you about the same as the real life counterpart does, with the same dialogues and for the same reasons.
-	Uncountable amount of side quests and often different ways to approach them.
-	 Awesome music.
-	A whole language invited for it.
-	The dlc content is defiantly worth it. You can have a new map and new shouts and you can build a house for your rotten kids and their mom.

Cons:
-	We are in 2022 and this game is a little over 10 years old and it shows. The Graphics are outdated, so is the engine and the physics that come with it.
-	Having played Fallout 4 where there clearly was more budget for voice actors compared to Skyrim I still must say it’s a shame that there are like 3-4 voice actors for males and 2-4 (?) for females, especially given the fact that they don’t really do that good of a job with it. The average voice actor can do about 4 voices minimum, here you hear nothing of this art.
-	There is a code that lets spawn dragons outside of “closed” cities (about 4 hours ingame or so after not having seen a dragon elsewhere) that really can ruin your trips between merchants in different towns since they may or may not permanently kill relevant NPC’s. Hated that more than it gave me any benefits.
-	Personal Note: In terms of game-intern atmosphere it painfully falls short after Fallout 4.

Summation: Rarely have I seen a 10 year old game that kept me playing for more than 20, let alone 100+ hours. Still worth but please don’t buy Todd’s “newest” version of it since that’s the reason we are not getting Elder Scrolls 7.
"
3598,"Hours of entertainment that's never the same on a second run through and there will be a second.

3599,Beautiful. Wonderful voice acting. Great story lines. Intuitive and exciting combat.

3604,"Legendary, One the all time games you must play"
3605,A*
3606,It's a good game to waste time
3607,"yup
"
3608,Great exploration & combat aspects
3609,"This game is way too difficult; not in game play, but just because it be broke as all hell. 
The game starts with the horse screaming like a tortured pig and the cart I'm in bouncing around and defying gravity.
I can't even get past the cut scene before my horse runs itself over, spinning the cart and my poor fellow prisoners into a mini hurricane. 
Or the clumsy horse gets tangled in the ropes and begins pushing us backwards. Towards freedom of execution? No; towards starvation by way of staring at rocks for all eternity.
Or maybe after my horse of manic energy has gambolled us at high speed towards the gate and aggressively headbutted it demanding we be let in for our imminent doom, it then runs over a crucial executioner. Leaving us to forever stand around waiting to die, while being condemned to a worse fate; an eternity in an orderly line.

The horse making angry pig noises as it literally wraps around a rock and begins stretching across the map, and the cart ahead stretching out into the sky where it hurricanes itself among the trees is... amusing at first, but soon becomes sensory hell. Sometimes the spinning motions are so fast the screen is just a flickering mess with inexplicable pig noises and calm dialogue of the prisoners considering their fate while ignoring their present.

All the while Skyrim proudly displays its name as sober music plays, unabashedly displaying it's utter bug infested game (or is this just a video at this point?). 

I was hoping to at least get to walk around in this game but I've wasted nearly two hours on it and will have to try getting a refund before that time is up."
3610,"this game is a game i've been searching for! Its has all my favorite things, free mods, medival backstory, free play, and game cheats. if your desperate, you'll use the cheats. you can also level up! i would play this all day if i could.

       for people searching for games, you can stop here."
3611,very fun and make me lol
3612,Great modern rpg
3613,"not bad

3619,"One of the most satisfying games when it comes to combat.. I'm kinda, totally, addicted.."
3620,still holds up even today good game
3621,It's Skyrim
3622,"This game has now been released on absolutely everything including smart toasters and fridges, though the community fixed it and added features with mods, so it's quite good, but buy it on sale if you haven't played it yet, otherwise just ask Bethesda to get non buggy games for a change.

Buy it on sale only,"
3623,"Game does not function on a modern PC.  Intro goes insane with me spinning all over, water nonstop flickers and all troubleshooting (aside from changing my graphics card FPS) doesn't fix it.  I shouldn't need to play on a 10 year old PC just to play this game."
3624,game of the year every year end of story

3626,It just works

3630,todd why did you unlist skyrim
3631,"You didn't know it's good? Thanks I'm here to tell you! Look at my hours played, it speak of replayability."
3632,v good
3633,I hate nazeem
3634,"skyrim is thge best game ever made
"
3635,"Skyrim is a fantastic game, even with all the bugs. Having basically single handedly ushered in the age of open world games it has kept up with time. To be frank the combat is completely unbalanced and is either unfairly difficult, or god mode one shot anything that moves easy, but I don't play Skyrim for the combat. I love Skyrim for the lore that the world has set up. The quests with epic and tragic backstories, and the few times where you're faced to make a choice. I like exploring the world and finding small things like fairy circles that are never mentioned or hinted at, but someone in development thought would be fun to reward those who look through every nook and cranny. With Special Edition and Anniversary comming out I can't say that I would rebuy it over and over, but if you've never played it then it's worth the price."
3636,"This game is so immersive, complex, deep.  I love the story and the huge detailed world!"
3637,it skyrum.
3638,"Probably the game that I have played the most in my entire life. My time recorded by Steam doesn't fully grasp the full-on days that I have spent in this game, since I played a non-Steam copy for years.

I like this game. I'd go as far to say I love it. It also sucks and it's garbage."
3639,It's simply classic
3640,My dumbass bought this game twice for switch and on PC. I enjoyed it twice regardless.
3641,"I wonder what god thinks of the people that play Skyrim as an interdimensional sex simulator powered by a fucking necromancer,"
3642,hahaha skyrim.
3643,It's Skyrim. I don't need to describe why this is recommended.
3644,"FUs roh dah is wel nog cool ofzo
"
3645,"This game will excite even the most basic of nords or wood elf. The vast expanse of knowledge gained when one plays this game is what gives us hero's a will to live. It is this essance that a hero must vanquish all evil from this realm that gives this game its weight in gold. Many travelers have sought its power for evil, but it is up to you to weild it with a heros might. Godspeed spiderman."
3646,10/10
3647,"Skyrim never gets old. With so many mods coming out all the time, it feels like a new game through every play through."
3648,"Fun game, But I would recommend special or anniversary editions more than this one."
3649,"fun game with mods, you dont need to buy all the new versions, the original is just as good"
3650,this game is super  good i can become a werewolf too that is cool the most thing i like about the game is dragons and and werewolfs.
3651,"auuuuu to much hours but great game
"
3652,Very addictive.
3653,addicting
3654,It's Skyrim. It's big. It's buggy. It's fun.
3655,"Skyrim, you'll buy it again and again. You won't learn your lesson, because it is Skyrim. Now become a stealth archer once again."
3656,I've played it modded and I've played it vanilla no matter which you prefer Skyrims honestly great even with just a couple of texture mods
3657,Love this game.
3658,A classic among classics
3659,"Delphine frustrates me to no end. Selfish bih out here talking as if she a main character.. I had to google search her name ffs. So frustrating. Can somebody make a mod to skip all her dialogue and maybe make one to fix her witch face, I mean I know Bethesda not that great at 3d sculpture but DAMN SHE UGLY AF . The game is good"
3660,"I didn't pay for this game. But it's great

It's like those cringy fairy tell stories but ur the main character and its actually kinda fun and interesting n shit.

If you've been thinking about getting it, get it. You will not regret."
3661,"An absolute bug-fulled mess, but that being said,"
3662,fun
3663,Best game
3664,Alright
3665,"You will play this game again and again and again.. It really is a gaming masterpiece. First run I was a heavy armour hack and slash, 2nd run i was a stealth archer, 3rd run i was a destruction/restoration mage and ive only touched the surface."
3666,"If you are looking for a sandbox fantasy game that you can mod till your computer breaks, this is the game for you. And to be fair, some of those player created quest mods are FANTASTIC."
3667,10 arrows in the knee / 10
3668,"Hundreds of Builds and Huge world, now that i play for 10 years i still fell like a new game with the moods."
3669,"this version, is the only version."
3670,"better than oblivion vanilla, unstoppable if modded.

but still boring af without mods"
3671,Anyone here in 2022? :D
3672,"I got it in 2017 and lost interest at a part in the story where I got confused. I just came back on and figured it out, 4 yrs later haha. For the most part its understable, but for some parts youll need tutorials or fandom pages online to help you out. Overall dope storyline n lots to do"
3673,d
3674,"its skyrim, what else is there to say?"
3675,A gateway RPG game. lol
3676,it gud
3677,Greatest game ever!
3678,"a simple way to put it, tis gansta."
3679,"Its skyrim, what else can you say"
3680,"The best RPG ever made. Limitless role playing, best modding community, great DLC... This game is a timeless classic to me that I can always come play when I get burnt out from other games."
3681,I hate it but I cant stop playing it.
3682,"Only leaving a negative review since they force people to buy the special edition nowadays, the game itself is okay, its refinded but a bit boring"
3683,"Like the fool I am, I buy and play this game every time it's released. This is a game I can always turn to for comfort."
3684,Can't say enough..
3685,"This is the most enjoyable immersive game I have ever played, you can explore a vast world and go on quests, adventures, etc. this game never gets old. Graphics and game play are both Top Notch. The music is amazing and really add to the drama during the game."
3686,"I spent 200 hours looking for content, and found none."
3687,good game i think you shouldnt play with mods at first on your first play through.
3688,
3689,e
3690,An absolute must have game
3691,"The original classic. Unfortunately not for sale anymore, you have to get the ""improved"" versions, which really have improved very little. You still need to  mod  the new versions to fix bugs. It holds up well for as old as it is. A truly classic game. With mods you can overcome it's failings and have a great experience."
3692,not better than oblivion but its still good depending on how much you mangle it with mods.

3708,It's Skyrim. That's all there is to say.
3709,This game really makes you FEEL like the Arrow is IN your knee.
3710,Try it with the Ultimate Skyrim modpack if you're looking for a challenge
3711,"yes
"
3712,A really amazing game-would not recommend for people who like perfect clean games! Soooooooooo many bugs and exploits!
3713,
3714,best game
3715,"Definitely worth the money. Although at this point you're going to want to get the Anniversary Edition if you haven't gotten Skyrim already. I've been playing since release, put in many thousands of hours (Steam counter isn't accurate), and have explored all kinds of builds, mods, and expansions. I believe that this is one of the best games created so far."
3716,"it's Skyrim
"
3717,"Skyrim is awesome. It was released in 2011, so I think we all know why it's awesome by this time. If you still didn't know, it's awesome. Just play it. You'll get it."
3718,Yes. I would recommend this game to other players.
3719,good
3720,Best Game Ever Made in my opinion.
3721,Prophecy Man/Woman saves the world from Dragons while Yelling at things to death.
3722,They have this really cool donkey called Lydia that carries all your stuff! definitely recommend!

3729,best game ever. i saw tits for the first time here
3730,Amazing game. Favorite of all time.
3731,Good Game
3732,"Entertaining story-line, unique side quests, addictive... The one complaint I have would be the absolute nightmare that is trying to place/move an object in the world. It doesn't effect the gameplay at all, but like... w h y  is it like that?"
3733,good game
3734,You know it's a great game when half of what people share in the community is how they turn Skyrim into a harem sex game filled with beautiful women.
3735,Some of the old mods don't work and it's kinda sad. Also wish that the FOV could be made wider / adjustable. Still a classic though.
3736,"The actual game is kinda buggy, but there's plenty of mods that can fix it up real good. Also, on the topic of mods, there are a looooot of sexy mods if you know where to look >u>"
3737,it great
3738,nice
3739,"It's good
Just good
Try it
There are bugs but that's what makes Skyrim ""Skyrim"""

3746,Good.
3747,"No, it isn't a good RPG and it is a HUGE step down from Oblivion in that regard, but man is this game fun. It's one of the best open-world adventure games ever."
3748,"The definitive version of Skyrim. It is fun though nothing special story-wise. It is a large game with a lot to do, once you finish all that, mods will be able to extend and enhance your experience drastically. Still not as good as Oblivion."

3753,"Notice: At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search.
Thats sounds weird... Dont buy, save your money for something else."
3754,"This game's quality isn't so much about the game, but the community around it. There are so many high-quality mods to this game that it not only holds up graphically to modern games, but also has a wealth of content even for those who have played for a long time. I can't wait for Elder Scrolls 6 in 2050!"

3757,Very Funny
3758,yes
3759,Haven't spend much time on the game but its wonderful so far
3760,Game crashes.  Can't get it to play.  Crashes every 3rd or 4th time. Can't figure out how to install USEEP which will supposedly fix the problem.
3761,WOW this game is really good
3762,"Yes the game is good, but just go buy the whatever new fancy edition that they are selling now. ugh"
3763,"You start as a prisoner, become the hero...and somehow end up having sex with dogs. 
Great game! Bendy 10/10."

The first line of one of the greatest adventures ever created. If you are a RPG gamer and have managed to avoid this game for so long, you are something of a legend yourself..."
3769,best game of all time. you can't change my mind
3770,Whats not to like a whole world to play in and experiment with just a great game *****
3771,"So old, but has definitely earned it's place in the halls of legendary games and with good reason."
3772,i've played this game for hours on end and it still never gets old <3
3773,best game
3774,Played it for a little bit. It's ayyyyt
3775,Probably one the best games of all time but why has it been 10 years since you released a good game bethesda? Just do skyrim 2 you morons.

3783,"No other game I've found is like it.  I've played over 16000 hours and have never gotten tired of it.  I'm running about 400 Mods.  The totally open world environment, non-linear game play (You don't have to solve quests in order to move on to other quests.  You can resume any quest whenever you like.)  Switch from first person to third person view at will.  It would take a book to describe it in detail."
3784,"one of the greater games of its time, will be forever marked in history"
3785,After all these years it still is (with mods) a wonderfull game
3786,While I don't personally love the building part of the game there is enough other content to keep me interested.
3787,The game that started it all.
3788,This is one of the best RPGs of all time
3789,"Actually a terrible game, weak characters, terrible story, dull combat, dungeons don't feel unique, overall a buggy mess and I can't stop playing. SEND HELP"
3790,it is the best R.P.G. since Everquest before Sony ruined Everquest!! & I should know. I was playin P.C. games on the first multiplayer R.P.G. Meridian 59.
3791,It's Good.
3792,"This is quite possibly the best open world game that they've ever come out with in my opinion. If there's one thing Bethesda got right pre 2020, it's how good their open world games were. In my top 3 games, two of them are open world Bethesda titles. This is a timeless, limitless game, where the entire world is as your grasp. You skill up to become the most powerful being in the world, and can do whatever you want. I remember seeing this game on sale at Gamestop for the 360, and I had to get it. I've bought this game, along with a lot of the Fallout titles, more than I'd like to admit. I've beaten these games more than I'd like to admit, and I think that really shows just how good of a game that they've created. Anyone who knows about games after the Super Nintendo knows about Skyrim. Who hasn't played this game at this point? You even see grandmothers who are in their 90's over here with 100 destruction just clearing out Riften. It's a game for anyone, with such a vast variety of quests, and other intriguing interactables. It's in an age of dragons, magic, swords, shields, and bows. Of course, you could mod the hell out of this game, giving you an actual endless amount of content for you to discover. This is a staple in the open world gaming industry, and should be praised as such. Now if only Todd would stop trying to sell us this 10 year old game again and again, and come out with a new one for us to drool about for another 10 years."

3837,Interesting game - I hope it gets the attention it deserves someday. Would recommend.
3838,It's skyrim

3847,"Listen, I've got nearly a thousand hours and that's just the hours Steam could actually track.  What do you think I think of it?  It's Skyrim.  It's good.  If you haven't played it yet, try it out.  Don't ask me for mod recommendations because I'll give you a horrible ball of chewed gum and tape with mystery wires sticking out that will melt your PC and require like eight things that were discontinued in 1807.  

Does it work?  No
Does it look nice?  Also no.  

Just cram it full of mods like the rest've us and go to town.  You'll be all right.   Actually, if you're doing a new experience, go right to Special Edition.  It's closer to functional and you aren't already attached to any OG mods.  Don't wait for me; save yourself!"

It's been re-released half a million times because it's such an enduring cultural touchstone, our grandparents play the games now, I've been playing this game since it first released on console, I don't need to tell you why you should play it. I'll be 87 years old on my deathbed and Todditron 4000 will be on the brainspan telling us about the Skyrim VR theme park opening next year with realistic death simulators for players/guests. Actually, are you sure you don't already own Skyrim? You probably do. Probably you should, too."
3854,"fun game

3855,Honestly this is one of the most monotonous games out there I think it’s only really popular because of nostalgia they’re literally way better elder scrolls games like elder scrolls Morrowind and ask if you buy this game or/play this game you are a redditor

3876,"This is one of my favorite, maybe even my favorite, RPG experiences. I just love the setting of Skyrim's harsh and grim landscapes along with it's lively towns, cities and villages - whom each carry individual identities.

When it comes down to the core-combat mechanics The Elder Scrolls - inc. Skryim - can be seen as an incarnation of the phrase ""less is more"". You've got more or less three main buttons (incl. mouse clicks) to either strike, block, stun or shout. But yet it still requires some tactics when going after a singular strong enemy or a group of multiple enemies.
And since there are so many different ways to play this game - be it as a spell casting mage, a single wielding warrior, a double wielding warrior, etc. - the core-combat mechanics just scream and carry ""role playing"".

In order to keep this review short I'll just scratch the surface about the lore this game build. While playing this game, I did not even had the slightest experience of distaste. I love everything about the lore it build, and Skyrim's way of presenting it. It is told by NPC's, shown during quests and written in in-game books which are placed almost everywhere. The latter I liked the most since it greatly enhanced the role playing experience in my humble opinion. (It are mostly, if not completely, some of the finer details of the lore which can be found within the books. All the general information is either shown in quests or told by NPC's)

And even though the massive open-world can carry a grim tone (I personally love that setting) because of Skryim's harsh, rocky and cold landscapes - since Skyrim is based on the Nordic Region (Nords are based on Vikings) - you often find yourself intertwined with NPC encounters along the road, which soften the grimness, and adds live.

While playing this game the game did falter (lag) from time to time - it rarely happened, but I do feel obliged to notify it - but this may just as well be caused by my pc, since my graphic card might not have met the requirements. So take this with a grain of salt. The fault most likely lays with my graphic card.

*Thank you for reading my review*

3884,"Skyrim has got to be the best game that I have ever played! Sure, there are some quirks, but all things considered this game is fantastic. In my opinion, you don't need to Mod the game in order to enjoy it, but I do love that there are so many people making mods for texture and graphic improvements, as well new weapons, armour, etc."

3910,"I liked this game quite a bit, but like similar games, it has too much of everything: too many of this and that type pf potion, too many of this and that type of bow, etc. And though I love sidequests the problem is that the way they are organized, you find yourself heading too far in the wrong direction, not knowing which should be done first or which will prevent you from doing other quests"

3915,Its pretty neat. Wish companions didn't suck ass.

I originally played Skyrim on Playstation and had there 1000h+ ingame time.
I just came here to try out mods, that were completely new for me at the time - and still the game just sucked me right back in again and I got lost in the world.
After knowing every quest, every secret, every tunnel, every character/ npc, every ... - i can say that this game is just one big virctory for and to the Gaming Scene."

3955,"I love the fact that you can build anything in this game and if you don't use the cheats, you will give yourself an awesome experience in the economy of the game."
3956,I can't really give a bad rating to a game that I've played for nearly 200 hours. I like the main story of oblivion a lot more than this story but the gameplay is a lot better in skyrim and the story is still really good. There are a lot of immersive side quests and its fun to chose whether you'll be the hero or the villain.. or something in between. I've always loved the titles and privileges you get from completing storylines in the elderscrolls games. No matter how you play you always end up having a string of powerful titles and groups dedicated to you.
3957,Been playing off and on since release. It has become standby for RPG itch
3958,Just an overall great game with many challenges to overcome.

4008,yasssss
4009,dope shit
4010,you know why
4011,"number one ,but it has challenges . Every corner you turn! Awesome game"
4012,"This is a really great game in my opinion. It has a lot to offer. I love the fact that you can play by yourself or with others. I love that you have the option to spend hours on your home, decorating, etc. and not have to fight or do quests only. There is a lot of variety."
4013,One of the best games of our generation!
4014,SO FUN WOW.    COULD PLAY THIS FOREVER LEGIT
4015,"I still remember when Skyrim came out- it was easily the most hyped game in my area, everyone wanted to play it, my friends and I would even have shared game nights where we'd go to someone's house and take turns with the controller deciding what to do with our character. It's a fun and enchanting game, super easy to spend a lot of time in and actually feel accomplished. I will say that the open world is GORGEOUS but also leaves a lot of room for improvement in that some parts of the environment are kind of buggy (which is hilarious) and some parts take a long time to fully render (which is also hilarious unless you need to see your surroundings to solve a puzzle or something). Other than that, I definitely agree with the statement that this game was the game of our generation and it still brings me joy all these years later. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a little adventure in a world where they really can be or do anything."
4016,"Godly game. Can't stop playing it. The lore, textures, NPC's, glitches, exploits. Everything in this game is just fantastic. It just works."
4017,"As generic, average and soulless as it's only possible. I totally don't get the hype. Daggerfall had interesting technology of auto-generating world/quests, Morrowind had immersive atmosphere, Oblivion was disappointing but had some interesting quest here and there. Skyrim? It has no positives at all.

The most uninteresting story, the most mundane quests, the very limited character progression and skills, completely irrelevant inventory, not a single NPC that I can remember... total trash."

4019,Gane is only good with mods. I would recommend Oblivion instead. This one fails to offer the same level of charm. It was cool at first but got boring quickly.
4020,Is Alright.

4024,It's good
4025,Good Game!
4026,"Best RPG ever made, HANDS DOWN"
4027,"Immersive game that can steal a lot of your free time if not careful.  Yes, it's a bit dated.  Yes, it has some bugs.  Still an awesome story.  The bugs mostly are patched with mods.  Do a little reading.  So worth it if you want to burn time."
4028,"Do anything you want, wherever you want, regardless on how you want it. The game will answer. 

With a certain armor set, it even enacts you to roleplay a certain person on theological mention by walking on water surfaces.
It also enables you to re-enact, or rather a prophesized foretelling by doing it before she does, game age wise - climb up on a fire spitting flying lizard, control the beast and wreak havoc on your surroundings. 
If the base game restricts you on doing the thing you want, there isn't a single action that hasn't been covered by the modding community. 
Except for going prone. I like going prone. 

Aside from not being able to go prone, this game is life, death, heaven and hell all in one.
Quite literally. 
Fun? I'd rather mention it as a way of life at this point. 

The age of the game isn't a factor because: 
- the fanbase is enormous; 
- adaptations such as cartoons of the game have been released; 
- the modding community quite covered anything missing, restructured existing game files and objects or added map expansions to the base game;
- creators of the game released a Legendary and a Special Edition, with all official expansion packs and a re-enhancing for newer gaming systems;
and so forth. 

Needless to say:
Would I recommend?

The most absolute of Yes."

4030,Best open world ever? Maybe

what's there not to love?"

just kidding lol.

The game really has become my favourite elder scrolls. Although it's character customisation wasnt as funny as oblivion this game is still pretty gud. get this game if u havent eva played it, if u have stop fucking rebuying it idiot"
4033,"Skyrim is Skyrim, and Skyrim is good"
4034,:)
4035,"Strong single-player RPG. Mostly open world. Does not flow like a modern console game, some pausing is required to get the right actions at the right time. The pausing mechanism also makes it a good choice for players who get interrupted."
4036,"There is no reason why they should have this game updated just for consoles.
I have Skyrim and the legendary version from years ago, they should have given us a free DLC or work with Mod creators, in fact they should compensate them for years working on their game without pay and make their other Elder scrolls games free anyway for doing this I guess.
"
4037,"I ran across the map with swords and potions, swinging like a madman into the air to establish my dominance. Then a mammoth showed up and humbled me, sent me sailing into the sky with one stomp. Solid 10/10"

4039,it r gud
4040,This is what the cool kids play
4041,haha this version is unavailable now
4042,its one of the best.
4043,This game was my dads favorite video game and this was kinda what got me into gaming.
4044,Along with this game i installed the mod '' Hilga the big booty dragon maid'' it made the game really enjoyable and the scenes were REALLY good. recommend the mod and the game.
4045,skyrim
4046,Skyrim good
4047,Very good love it thumbs up
4048,"Earlier this review was positive and scored a lot of likes, BUT Bethesda and Microsoft, you don't want my money? Ok, I will never buy anything from you again."

Anyone who has yet to experience this game, better late than never."

4080,"This game saved my life.

I am 24

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

4091,"At the time of Skyrim’s release, I was neckdeep in Azeroth, bought the game off hype and played it a little bit, got shrugged off because that’s just how much of a black hole WoW was at the time. Ten years later in a bout of indecision I ended up picking this as my “in-between” casual adventure… and holy hell has it been anything but an in-betweener. First off, being recommended Ultra settings made me feel pretty good about myself to start, don’t judge me and just let me have my moment okay….

Nothing about this game feels lazy, it is beautiful and mysterious… an inviting mysterious, not the one that feels like too much of a headache to figure out. This is my first Elder Scrolls game, so when your only UI is a rectangle compass and some icons it can feel almost too open ended, no sir, not here. I went in with no agenda aside from maybe what I wanted to do combat-wise; little did I know my choice was OP (sneaky archer).

 I started stopping in every town and every cave, I would happily do the most mundane of tasks and just go wherever the wind took me. I don’t mind linear, most times I actually prefer it, but this is a prefect representation of what life could be without it – and it’s beautiful. I never felt pressured to progress the main campaign, hell after awhile I felt like newer storylines were the main campaign.

I learned the cities, got a feel for their politics and issues, and just generally bumbled my way around the world. One night I engaged in a drinking contest that left me traversing the world; I didn’t complete the questline in one sitting (because I AM THE PACE CAR) but when I did, I literally clapped upon completion. Like a weirdo in the movie theater… when The Dark Knight came out a group of guys cheered when the motorcycle ejected from the batmobile… it was like that, yet I was not ashamed.

I can see where people might feel models or concepts get repeated, but it never once bothered me. Each dungeon was engaging and felt different in its own way, I enjoyed all of it. I played on normal settings and don’t have a desire to go to hard; the combat is only a piece and simply changing your dominant skills in a second playthrough will scratch that itch. I look forward to playing a Stormcloak caster next and I seldom replay games.

In my first few hours I said it was an easy 9.5/10, if only there was a roll mechanic…. Until I found it sitting in the rogue skill trees. One of the easiest 10/10s I’ve ever given, can’t believe it’s taken me 10 years to get here. Oh and yeah, unlimited carry weight mod always – I am currently seeing how many cabbages I can collect. Cheers!"

4116,"Skyrim is a good game, but it isn't anything like Morrowind.  Yes, it continues the story of the Elder Scrolls, it develops the same game world, and it avoids the pitfalls of Oblivion.  In many ways it is a magnificent game in its own right.  Just don't expect it to recapture the feeling you got from Morrowind.  Skyrim makes the same mistake as ""Star Wars The Force Unleashed"" by making the player too powerful too quickly.  After a while, the game is no longer a challenge.  In fact, the player kills a dragon really early in the game.  To keep things difficult, the game throws in some ""escort quests"" in which a weak NPC must be safely brought from point A to point B.  These are not fun.  Neither are the various ""fetch quests.""  Skyrim is fun though, and it does have an engaging story, which is why you will keep playing.  Most of my playtime is from repeatedly playing the game again to try out different endings to different storylines.  There is a lot of replay value.  The music is great, the graphics are great, but...it isn't Morrowind.  The main place where this becomes apparent is when you level up and choose new skill upgrades.  The skill tree is really more like something you would find in a platformer.  It is overly simplistic and some branches of the skill tree are way too useless regardless of what kind of play style you use.  There is literally no reason to use medium armor once you see the bonuses conferred upon heavy armor in the skill tree.  It basically leaves everything too streamlined.  However, if you want to feel unstoppable, you can do that in short order.  You can have full dragon armor pretty early and never have to upgrade to another set.  Or you can go stealth and never be in danger of actually fighting anyone ever.  Just snipe the entire world to death.  The choice is yours."
4117,"Overall a great game. A reasonably huge open world to explore. The dungeons are pretty fun and each one is unique in their own right. Great soundtrack. Good visuals for it's time of release. The leveling system doesn't really suit my playstyle, but I got no major qualms about it either. Overall a must play open world RPG."

4121,"Don't play this game, you already have on 3 other consoles and your phone"
4122,"I love this game so much. Every moment in it is so incredibly glitchy and awkward, but something about Skyrim just sucks time away. I love being let loose in such an open world. There's so many unique and memorable quests."
4123,Please.. It's Skyrim! No recommendation needed ;)
4124,its a pretty decent games.
4125,tight
4126,"good
"
4127,nice
4128,"Best rpg game out there. 
The freedom that you have in this game can be overwhelming so better have in mind a roleplaying build in mind before starting. 
Limiting yourself to pick all the skills and paths in the game would make it more fun.
In all my gameplays i try diferent builds: a simple hunter trying to survive in the world, an alchemist trying to find philosophical stone and become the richest one, but most of my playtimes was to make over and over again a magic thief."
4129,the god of games
4130,its skyrim
4131,"skys rim belongs to the nords
"
4132,9 years old and still a good game.
4133,Awesome game that can be played over and over again
4134,Great Game!
4135,you all already know its good
4136,4564566456456464546456456456456546456456456456456456456456546546456456456456464564564565646465464565466666666666546456
4137,Simply the most epic CRPG created to date. Every few years I get a hankering to replay it as a new character and experience it from a fresh perspective. Replayability is supported by the huge wealth and diversity of community mods which have evolved in ambition and scope as the power of PC's have to handle their demands. No title outside the Bethesda stable of games comes close to the escapist lure of this legendary game.
4138,Hours worth of gameplay and lots of secrets to discover
4139,"This masterpiece of a game has the best story line and has just the right amount of difficulty. it is slightly buggy but that gives it character. If you don't own this game, please buy it as it is so close to perfection. I applaud you Bethesda."
4140,Just good
4141,"Ten years later and I still find myself coming back to this masterpiece when I need an escape. Utterly immersive, timeless, and the only issue is that it can be SUPER glitchy at times (but that honestly just adds to the experience). 

Heartbreakingly hilarious game play experience: Aela turns me into a werewolf, we get married, build a beautiful home, adopt two daughters, and are living our best life. I gift our daughters flawless daggers that I forged myself. My daughters start pestering me ALL the time, adopting multiple wild animals and filling our home despite me always asking them not to. 

One day, I return from adventuring to find my wife and children in our yard, tending to our livestock. Suddenly we are surrounded by an Elder dragon, a group of bounty hunters, and a troll. I turn into werewolf form to protect my family. Aela, who is THE ONE WHO MADE ME INTO A WEREWOLF IN THE FIRST PLACE, screams ""MONSTER!"" and starts attacking me alongside our daughters. My children un-alive me with the daggers I had gifted to them. As I die I see Aela overtaken by the dragon. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A TERRIBLE WIFE ):"
4142,suiiiiiiiiii
4143,"Simply great. I didn't play in your game at the time, man. You enter the game on a mainland. Even though the bugs are annoying, you don't have much time to bug them one after the other. This game is a masterpiece and I think I will bury 1000 hours in this game. There will also be a game in which I will easily bury and break 2000 hours in total, considering that I will play in offline mode on the device I will record this record on. You definitely won't regret it. :)"
4144,Great game. you have to play it yourself to understand the greatness
4145,guys this game is good trust me
4146,skyrim shuffle
4147,good
4148,"I've killed at least one graphics card playing this thing. I guess that must have been hour 580? I'm hoping I can run it on my new low end laptop. I needs mah survival and climate mods...

About the game. Skyrim has been around over a decade because it broke ground on immersion and hasn't been matched since in it's genre. If you want to live in a sword and sorcery world, play Skyrim."
4149,"very addictive, but the real fun is customizing the game to your liking by installing hundreds of mods available for free"
4150,pp
4151,10 years on and its still the best game in this genre out there
4152,"I played this game for 2,469 hours now, so i'm rather pissed about that in of itself."
4153,"You like adventure?
you like cheese?
you like buckets?
you like dragons?
you like risking your life for a single quest?
well this is not the game for you go to a different one
but if you like;
wacky shit
weird shit
Koocy shit
dumb shit
or anything else that ends with shit that isn't the word shit itself
You've come to the right place!
Don't like how you can't kill the children of Skyrim? 
there's a mod for that!
wish you could become a crusader?
There's a mod for that!
wish you had guns in skyrim?
believe it or not this game has a mod for it!
you think it someone has probably already made it!
if they haven't you wait or someone to make it or you make it yourself!

but yeah good game 10/10 would fight a thomas the tank engine dragon again"
4154,Very immersive experience.
4155,"Pretty Poggers, able to play the original mods. Sadly Bethesda being the corporate dumb ass company it is. Took down the public searches for skyrim and it's dlc. You can only access it through links now."
4156,its pretty good
4157,Still enjoy this game
4158,bleh
4159,poop
4160,i like trains
4161,One of the best open world games I've ever played!
4162,"One of the greatest video games of all time. For me, second only to The Witcher 3. Incredible game, incredible mods, incredible DLC's. This game is over a decade old, and still fun to play. Highly recommended."
4163,"awsomme 5 stars 
"
4164,"This game was my childhood and is still relevant to me even during the exit of childhood. The way the story falls, the freedom to do whatever you want and the modability of the game makes it (almost) perfect."
4165,"The game's fine and dandy, there's been a lot of work put into it, like voice acting all the dialogue, streamlining the skill trees whilst trying to retain as much of RPG as humanly possible, etc. etc. etc.

Once you get to know the ins and out of the game, you start experimenting, role-playing if you will. And it all goes to shit around level 20-30 because of the way the game works. You may try to run the most efficient build, equipping the best armours available, using your crafts and all, but one day you'll realize that Bandit Chief will two-shot you in melee or that Forsworn Plunderer mage can reduce your 240 health with two hits of frost bolt. 

Unless you abuse the living shit out of the game by exploiting the unholy trinity of Enchanting, Alchemy and Blacksmithing, you stand little chance to actually progressing through the game. 

Yeah, you will eventually  oneshot regular bandits and wolves, why wouldn't you. Maybe even a regular dragon. But not anything higher than that, not a Blood Dragon, or a Giant, or a freaking bear. 

I've spent the last couple of hours circling around towns to buy stuff so that I could level my skills so that I could sell that stuff for gold to buy more stuff and realized that all my role-playing and immersion have been dispersed by this brain-damaging mechanic. 

The game is good, but some of the bad in this game makes it unbearable."
4166,good game
4167,Best game ever
4168,"fun game yes die stab
"
4169,This gane is absolutely amazing! 7/5 would play always!
4170,"Yup, it's Skyrim."

4180,is good kids
4181,Wow. WHY DIDNT THEY USE THE DRAGONSREACH FOR ALDUIN A LONG TIME AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4182,"Jokes aside it's a good game.  If they'd just stop selling it and make the next one, it's been 10 years."
4183,"fun sometimes, but i also hate this game. one of the most boring, least offensive, least challenging experiences. everyone builds the same character, everyone does vaguely the same things. feels like if you wanted dessert so you poured sugar into your mouth. awful. you could hear more interesting stories by just asking random people about their day to day life."
4184,add sex
4185,Literally thousands of hours on this game back in the day from Xbox 360 and I can safely say this is one of my favorite games of all time.
4186,I still don't know how enchanting works. Good game.
4187,one word: epic
4188,"After 390 hours of playing all the way through (multiple times), I still sometimes discover new areas, quests or lore. Great with or without mods. Just watch out for the occasional glitch, though it's usually nothing the right console command couldn't fix."
4189,"Number of serious buggs = infinite + 1
Probability of dismissal = 1*100/(infinite * infinite)"

4193,1.4K hours in.  Finally got past character creation!
4194,"Come on, it's Skyrim!"
4195,you know ive beem playing this game for many moons and many have passed as i have seerched to find good sex mods but allas i have found a sex mod ment for me this mod has all of the people of skyrim selling there body for a price of a human heart 10 out of 360 no scopes
4196,pretty and exciting - high quality adventuring
4197,"Nice game, and the mods weren't broken by anniversary edition. . ."
4198,Outstanding game. Stands the test of time. Many mods to inhance.

4201,Thank you Todd Howard
4202,One of the best RPGs ever !
4203,Great solo game
4204,it's like Far Cry without guns
4205,"I've been playing Skyrim for years now (currently at my 3rd character, I think), so it's quite hard to find the proper words for a review.
Well, first of all, the complexity of the world, of the quests and of the game mechanics, is stunning. If you want that and a lot of tweaks, fixes and enhancements, I recommend playing with mods. It adds a lot of juice to the gameplay. 
Mine is an immersive - survival - dark horror one (and I'm improving it constantly) - but yeah, it's mine. If i break it somehow (mods do that, happened to a lot of us :) well, I have to deal with it. Modding is fairly simple and with all the guides out there, you can easily find the one you need.
But beware! 
It seems Skyrim has a mind of its own... It occupies so much storage in my brain, that I started making whispered videos, telling the story of my Skyrim characters. So, there's the gameplay, the whispered role-play and the video editing. It's so damn much, but I can't get enough of it. 
Now, I'm a dwarf warrior... 
(even though there are no dwarfs in Elder Scrolls)"
4206,Slaps a full decade later.
4207,"Just waiting for the gameboy advance port,"
4208,Chad Howard's finest creation. Skybabies will never stop.
4209,"Genuinely one of the most absorbing game experiences you can possibly have.  Atmospheric, lore-rich, and satisfying."
4210,"It doesnt ""just work"""
4211,"Yes its a very good game
"
4212,good game
4213,good stuff
4214,best modding engine ever not a bad game too
4215,Love this game but would love ES6 news more
4216,With mods it looks good
4217,yes
4218,Fus Ro Dahhhhh
4219,"I have never beaten this game. Regardless, this is still an absolutely wonderful experience. I mean, there's gotta be a [i] reason [/i] that it's been ported to every console made after the 2010s, right?
Don't bother with any of those console ports, though. The PC versions have what you [i] REALLY [/i] need:
Mods.
It is no secret that Skyrim was made by Bethesda. I have now justified why mods are necessary.
If, by some miracle, you live in an era where that sentence doesn't make sense, I would like to take a few minutes to describe our ambitious, vice-ridden civilization so yours does not fall victim to the same sins that plague ours.
1) Global warming. Don't do it. Coal makes extra greenhouse gas and that's not good.
2) Stay away from any nuclear weapons we left behind. They can easily level a whole city.
3) Bethesda makes broken, bug-ridden games. It's not as [i] immediately [/i] obvious as it is with something like Fallout 76, but trust me, it is.
Of course, a buggy game can be fun in and of itself. I mean, that's why people like Sonic '06. But if you don't like bugs, grab an unofficial patch. Scrub this thing clean.
Once you've properly bloated both the game and your hard drive with mods, Skyrim is a wonderful experience. It's an enthralling world and it's MASSIVE. I don't think I've even seen a [i] fraction [/i] of the province! And that's not even counting all the stuff on Solstheim, which I haven't even [i] been [/i] to! Solstheim, by the way, is from the Dragonborn DLC. There's two other ones; one adds a vampire questline and related items and the other adds buildable player houses. Again, barely even SCRATCHED these, and look at how many hours I've sunken in.
I think that's telling enough."
4220,"yes
"
4221,"Almost been out for 10 years and the game still kicks ass, esp with mods makes the game way more fun. If you havent played Skyrim yet you really need to."
4222,"Good fun, can't stop playing."
4223,So i just picked this up Yesterday and i played for 2 hours and then it got boring. Too many glitches. 10/10 would recommend. Thank you
4224,.
4225,"One of my most favorite all time games! I have this game on not only my pc but also my nintendo switch, ps4, and psvr. If you havent played it then your missing out."
4226,"Everyone knows Skyrim by now. I got over a 1,000 hours on the game and I still play it, what more is there to say?"
4227,Just re-downloading this because i missed playing it.
4228,Great game
4229,Literally the best game I've ever played! 5 Stars all the way!
4230,A classic work of art that still to this day puts most modern games to shame.
4231,are you kidding ? this is the greatest video game of all time every week there is something new to do
4232,have played for 10 yrs cant get enough
4233,"Obviously Skyrim is a good game; it's been released like five separate times over three console generations in the last ten years. I know that's a lot of numbers, but trust me, it checks out. It also goes on sale all the time, you could pick up the base game + DLC for super cheap and already have a couple hundred hours of content to go through if you wanted to peruse it all, or you could dive into the modding scene and add a ton of stuff to the game, weapons, quests, armors, better graphics and textures, all of that. There's also weird sex stuff if you're a degenerate, but no judgement. Actually strike that, if you're gonna download that stuff, big judgement, go outside instead."
4234,This game is a wonderful world to lose yourself in.
4235,get gaem
4236,"amazing game
"
4237,No issues here! ;)
4238,goob
4239,"Needs a little more TLC to mod but way better than Bethesda killing not only loads of mods but a community on SSE in order to try and force us to buy the trash ""anniversary"" version they just added and how it's still riddled with bugs after 10 years or re-releases and remasters causing more updates and messing up not only more mods but any updated mods...

I feel like this game the OG version of skyrim is gonna be were any modders come to make mods and keep the game going seeing how this even has steam support. That would be the case if old rim wasn't taken down and only people like us who own the original copy can play it."
4240,Still one of the best games ever made
4241,This game is a classic!! Super fun lots of good quest lines.   with the right mods and a good computer to run them it looks great and plays awesome!!
4242,"10/10! I got this game years ago and enjoyed every second of it, and since getting it again its just as better then before! Love it! Loved by Thousands and If you've never experienced this game Defiantly RECOMMEND!!!"
4243,"This game is fun as hell, I own it on my PS3, PS4, XBOX 360, XBOX ONE, and my XBOX ONE X, on my PS3 ive spent like 1k+ hours and I am level 300 and all of my skills are level 100 except for destruction"
4244,"fun with mods. like WeMod. WeMod is a free modding program for singleplayer games.

4245,fuckin goated
4246,"As a gift that was from a friend, it's pretty clear how important this game is. If you don't have this game, then buy it!"
4247,"i mean it's skyrim, what else is there to say"
4248,"best rpg
"
4249,"Its Skyrim. It doesnt matter if you are a vanilla player or a vet. You know what Skyrim is, why else would you be in the reviews? I aint got no candy for you."
4250,gay
4251,Legit the best game ever. Would buy it 10 times.
4252,I liked stabbing random thieves
4253,"I hate that this version is unlisted, it's still the best one overall to mod."
4254,i like the game play
4255,It will steal your time faster than a dragonborn slamming back dragon soul ramen
4256,"Don't know how many times I bought this game for different platforms since release, but I am still enjoying it even though I never finished the main story line. b"
4257,"If you need to escape into a different world and spend hundreds of hours living a fantasy life, this is the best game. The mod community is huge and there seems to be almost an infinite number of ways to play the game."
4258,"lol
stormcringe
"
4259,always have loved this game
4260,yes yes very much
4261,its a bit basic but any game i can play for 818 hours and still find things to do has to be worth it
4262,It's cool.
4263,i have mental illnesses and this cures them (a lie) but it makes my life less painful to live
4264,gg
4265,...........
4266,"Despite being a Bethesda game, and thus prone to glitches and bugs, the game is quite good. It also has some semblence of a story element, which is appreciated."
4267,"Well, you can't really buy it normally anymore with the release of SE but I'm tired of being asked of I would recommend it so here I am."
4268,awesome
4269,Buggy but a classic
4270,i fus roh dah'd ur mum last night
4271,"good game man horse neigh
"
4272,Dogshit
4273,"Hey, so been 2 years since i really since used steam... this is one of those games i think of on nights like this and remember how grateful I am for the memories the mfks at bethesda left me :) thank you. Merry Christmas bs"
4274,"Do we even need to review this game anymore? We all know by now that its amazing, right?"
4275,it was a good time. ME and my conjoined twin really enjoyed it. WE ate lots 0f bread. Kinna racist tho. Lil bit. Think about it.
4276,FUN
4277,"Skyrim had such wonderful potential, unfortunately Bethesda is the absolute worst software company I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing from.
227 hours played and can’t even progress through the main quest without the game becoming unstable and unplayable. Constantly crashing, having downloaded every fix mod I could find to try to get the game stable enough to be playable to no avail. I have even tried the re-releases of Skyrim but Bethesda being too lazy to even apply the fixes the mod community has created keeping a very broken unplayable game and people still pay money for this garbage.
I have to say the modding community is awesome, a lot of mods are more stable and playable than the base game.
Don’t waste your time and money on anymore garbage Bethesda makes…"
4278,Mostly played on xbox some on switch had to buy on pc. One of the g.o.a.t.s of video games. If you don't like this game you probably don't play video games. Get submerged into a great story with tons of side quests and infinite slaying. Rob some people get married go to jail(kill them all) and just enjoy the lands. Dlc is some of the most phenomenal dlc known to man.
4279,good
4280,The oblivion walker achievement can be damned to oblivion! Just use console commands for that shit. >:(
4281,good shit
4282,Most detailed games I've ever played.
4283,"its skyrim?need i say more
"
4284,This game used to work on Linux. Not anymore for some reason.
4285,"I hate bethesda so much I want their entire studio to implode.

Recommend it though"

Steam does everything by automatic computer with no reviews by humans I think.    Steam is beginning to become more hassle and trouble than its worth."

If you're like me you certainly are gonna like the game, 11/10 and also i reccomend playing morrowind and oblivion if you liked skyrim and don't have a problem with worse graphics."

4337,best skyrim game since skyrim. really immerses you in the world of skyrim not seen since the likes of skyrim. i rate this a skyrim/skyrim. skyrim should be an example to all skyrim games in the future. i hope the best for skyrim and i hope a new skyrim game can surpass skyrim in its ability to immerse you in the world of skyrim.
4338,"Skyrim's awesome! Still holds up, too."
4339,Skyrim is one of those games that you will always come back to. A timeless classic.
4340,"Skyrim is pretty schizophrenic.  On the one hand it's like all Bethesda games, requiring you to wantonly slaughter thousands of women in order to complete any and all quests.  This attitude towards women always puts me off in Bethesda games; killing women is not my idea of a good time.

One lady in Whiterun you have to beat down with fisticuffs ... at which point she'll agree to be your wife!  Bethesda has a very twisted approach to the sexes.  If a player exhibited the Bethesda attitude in the Skyrim forum, they'd likely get banned.

Yet unlike earlier games this one is filled with gratuitous female authority figures.  And a general habit of women speaking disdainfully of men.  Schizo.

It becomes so tedious there's a mod to shut NPC's up. Or you can reduce the greeting radius with Wrye Bash to make it go away. Since the game is also as poorly voiced as every Bethesda title this kills two birds with one stone and I highly recommend it.

The story is unremarkable, the radiant questing is tedious .. particularly the Thieves Guild line.

It's an alright game and I recommend it, but it's more a marker of Bethesda's decline than anything else."
4341,"I loved this game, but I really wish I could install it again so I can experience the original again."
4342,no Fisto
4343,"Vanilla: 4/5 - Very good
Modded: 5/5 - Masterpiece"
4344,MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOU SETTING SET TO 60FPS anything higher then this will send the game crazy but its still hit close to the hart even like 15 years latter love it
4345,"Overrated and boring.
Skyrim is a shallow experience that suffers from an endless supply of design problems, bugs, glitches and lack of polish. I've tried five or six times to get into this game and see why people love it so much but every time the game ether brakes or I get so board I can't bring myself back to play it anymore.

Basic features such as using Alt Tab will cause the mouse to miss Aline from each other. NPC's will often bug out and walk into walls. Object collision in places can cause clipping and in some cases lacks collision. Crashes are also pretty common. No the crashes are not my PC as I've tried it on multiple machines. These are just a small sample of the many technical problems you will find. 

Visuals are very dull and grey. This is meant to be a magical world but with the colours you may expect it to be post apocalyptic. Whilst there are mods that can overhaul the look the core game looked dated. Even compared to other games from 2011. 

Story and voice acting leave a lot to be desired. The intro section introduces you to characters who play a very limited role in the later plot and character. This takes away from the experience and manages to make even a dragon attack feel so lifeless. 

The worst part of the game however has to be the game play. In a word it's dull. Using melee feels under powered and at the start of the game you don't have enough magic to experiment with. Using any kind of sword on an enemy just feels awful. On top of that the game really lacks balance. One enemy group I hate is when a bunch of characters appeared in the first town and said ""This will teach you a lesson lord"" and attacked me unprepared. I tried multiple times to beat this encounter but hadn't had chance to get any good weapons at this point. So I tried everything to get away from them. These enemy's however followed me to the end of the map unwilling to ether leave me to look for other equipment. Eventuality a friend of mine suggested going into a dungeon to get away from them. The Golden Claw Dungeon is really where things get bad. 

The level design is so bland. It's just a group of corridors in a line with the same few spiders and skeletons.Plus this is where many of my crashes happened. This has to be one of the most tedious levels I've played in a game. It's not even a hard level it's just so boring.  

I get this is a beloved game but I can't understand why. I found it to range from broken to unbalanced to boring. I've tried so many times to find why people love this game but I can't bring myself to try and get into it anymore. I know that anything I hate about the game can be fixed by mods but in terms of the core game it's just not something I can ever get into it."

4368,"gooooooodddd game , loved it oin myx samsung fridge"
4369,"its still fun to play even though this game is old 
"
4370,"Get mods but dear lord this game has so much room for fun roleplay and running around and just good old fashioned fun.

I mean we can talk a lot of shit about the bugs (and we should) and the re-releases (and we should) but at the end of the day, there's a reason it's one of hte most popular games of all time, and it's that it's fundamentally a fun, modular game. Have fun with skyrim."
4371,"I mean giving this game a rating is unfair since it isn't really a game but rather a mannequin for mods. If you like messing around with that shit and trying to break games beyond recognition then this is for you. 


 But yeah the base game is pretty boring by today's standards. A literal cockroach could beat this game because of how basic it is. Id recommend it if you never played a video game before. This is somehow both the most normie and neckbeardish of games. Todd figured out the formula and f0cked industry standards in the ass. 

However the relaxing sound track, charming visuals, and amusing quests are worth playing for if youre the smell the roses kind of person."
4372,"This is my favourite game of all time, I haven't played a game that has sucked me in for anywhere near as long as this game. I've been playing since probably around 2012 and still to this day I come back too it. Now most of that time was spent on console so my hours aren't really doing this game justice. But I played that game like crazy on xbox 360 and xbox one. It's definitely my most played game of all time.

The main quest line is pretty decent, the first time around, but it's really an after thought, for me atleast. I remember my first play through I got to level like 50-60 and I still hadn't finished the main quest line. That's because there are just so many other stories throughout the world and just so much to explore you get lost if your not actively trying to focus on the main quest line.
I don't think I've played any game that has so much diversity to the quest lines and world that you walk around in, and for some there basically whole new campaigns. The thieves guild, dark brotherhooh and college of winterhold are a few of the very extensive stories that are technically ""side quests"". An espeically memorable side quest is the Foreswarn story that happens in Markarth, or the quest in I think it was Dawnstar where you go for the daedric artifact dagger.

Speaking of daedric artifacts theres plenty of those to collect, and often they have their own story line to get them. The wabbajak and the Dawnbreaker are 2 very good ones for their story. Now despite the amount I've played I've never actually collected all the daedric artifacts c:

(this isn't including any dlc so far btw)

Not only is there an absolutely insane amount of things to do you are given a beautiful world to explore it all in, obviously graphically it's a bit lack luster on the older version but a few mods and special edition will fix that up real quick.

As if all that stuff wasn't enough your also given the ability to have 2 new main quest lines, Dragonborn DLC and Dawnguard are absolute must haves in this game, despite the amount you can do already but these stories are soooo good and theres also perks to them (like being vampire overlord and being a werewolf :D) aswell as new armour and weapons. Hearthstone is also a cool DLC, adding marrage and children and even pets (that u can use your children to get) and the ability to buy land and build your own house, which is a bit of a quest in it's own right and is also very fun. I don't think I ever got around to refurbishing and entire house either lol

Games pretty buggy tho but there wholesome bugs for the most part and sometimes their sort of gameplay elements, like the hidden chest under the map for some places like white run and theives guild (which act as merchant inventories, but you can just go in there and steal everything from them lol, legit free stuff and free gold thanks to the thieves guild taking stolen items)

Look just buy it and you'll see what I mean, you won't regret it and you WILL love it, no choice c:"

4389,"This is a nice open world, you can pick sides or not.   Personally I enjoy escaping into this and adventuring however I choose.  Definitely replay value, and the mods out there for it are great, too."

but that's good"
4397,I can't say anything about this game that hasn't already been said. I own it on everything because I'm an idiot.
4398,"If my name didn't give it away, I love Skyrim. I grew up with the game since launch, and have played it on all sorts of platforms, starting with a half-dead Xbox 360 which scratched the disk every 10 minutes. 

Modding community is as strong as ever, plenty to do, replayable as all hell (might do another run through with a fresh batch of mods at some point), and oh boy, now that I've got the new setup (rtx 3070 etc), I have to limit my damn PC so the game doesn't freak out from being made to run at 240fps. 

Honestly I hope TES6 lives up to this one's legacy. I was worried when ESO came out and trashed the community with vast empty DLC and terrible launch, but in the swarm of bad games? Let's hope and play that Bethesda (or Microsoft now) do the right thing. We need singleplayer TES again, who cares about microtransactions."
4399,Bethesda is garbage and Todd Howard is king of garbage mountain.

"
4408,good game. very based.
4409,"A fully immersive open world game. Where you decide where you want to go, do what you want to do. Several major story-lines that can be done separate from the major quest or intertwined with it. Each has a gripping and rich story that bring context and clarity to what you are doing and why.

The game has unlimited replay-ability, and not many games have that these days. But the biggest and best aspect of this game is the community that surrounds it and supports it. Thinking of making a build, role-playing in a certain way? Then there is always someone in the community to help you.

Done everything the game has to offer? Think again, the modding community of this games will add years more of replay-ability to the game!"
4410,childhood
4411,"Skyrim has been my favorite game of ALL TIME, ever since i played it. If you can get past the 1 liners, and reused voice actors, then this game will be at LEAST on your top 5.

This game has so much vanilla content that i played this game on different consoles (Xbox360, PS3, PS4, PC) and only started modding recently. This game not only has insane replay value but also has different roleplay value.

I would recomend, before buying that you watch a lets play. And i would also suggest buying this version, before buying the remastered version. This game is a huge game for its time and i would say its one of a kind.

Even though it says i have played 106 hours (at the time of review) I have played over 1000-2000. Starting on xbox360, going to ps3, getting it on pc, then ps4. I have countless hours on this game and i really suggest you give this game a try :)"

4431,"When Skyrim was initially released, it revolutionized the open-world RPG genre. Skyrim is a masterpiece of gaming. The main thing I love about Skyrim is how virtually everything is interactive. There are also numerous approaches to situations. You can earn your way to riches and glory, steal your way, or even massacre your way. Overall, Skyrim is an excellent game because the story is compelling, the gameplay is entertaining and the game itself is absolutely amazing. One critique is that it can be rather difficult to maintain a sense of direction in terms of the main storyline of the game, but that itself can be resolved if you have photographic memory. Overall, good game."
4432,yes
4433,Skyrim is a very addicting game to play. There is so much to do and while I personally do like to play in the workshop to occasionally make mods this game does not require any to make it fun to play. You have so many options in the open world of Skyrim that you have endless possibilities and hours upon hours of entertainment and game play..

As a former Oblivion player, this game was right up my alley.  When you see 250 hours of gameplay, keep in mind that was during a time in my life where I worked 80+ hours a week so this is something I have repeatedly gone back to for years.

Unfortunately, I guess I am burned out on it, even the anniversary edition doesn't hold my attention anymore, but if you haven't played this and you are into fantasy stories, I would grab the anniversary edition and try it out."
4441,Great Game I Love it
4442,It's so good
4443,I'm not sure.
4444,Ace game
4445,"Love everything, dislike nothing. Also i have 100% special edition and am now going for it in this one too. I have never modded my skyrim and I never will as I have found no reason to necessitate doing so. 8/10 overall as there are some bugs occasionally but I save often so I'm not too worried about bugs."

4464,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. 

Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. 

We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. 

Shut up back there! 

And what's wrong with him, huh? 

Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.

 Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?

 I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.

 No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.

 Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? 

Why do you care? 

A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. 

Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.

General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. 

Good. Let's get this over with! 

Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. 

Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I
was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?

You need to go inside, little cub.

Why? I want to watch the soldiers.

Inside the house. Now.

Why are we stopping?

Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us."

4488,I love this game
4489,Purgatory.
4490,"I replay Skyrim every 5 years or so, because it's a great way to kill a large amount of time. While I loathe the game's politics and it's barely functional even on modern hardware, mods can make it a playable experience enough to enjoy the relaxing snowy landscapes, the gorgeous atmospheric soundtrack, and the delightful alchemy collection system that makes wandering around generic caves and forests to pick flowers while hiding from monsters actually kind of fun.
It hasn't aged all that well, and it crashes with distressing regularity, but if you save constantly and find something you enjoy doing in it, it can still be an enjoyable and fantastic experience.
Main issues: extremely unstable and buggy, horrible politics, boring characters, repetitive and grindy quests, and barely-functional mechanics
Positives: music is stunning, world feels expansive and beautiful, you can gay

If you haven't ever played Skyrim, I don't really recommend it, but it's better than the constant worse re-releases.

4514,"it cool.
"
4515,"If you haven't played Skyrim yet; stop everything you are doing, divorce your wife, let her take custody of the kids, quit your job, stop all other hobbies and/or side projects, because playing this game takes precedence.

Seriously though, amazing game 10/10"
4516,.

4518,meh
4519,Love this game and will never stop playing it.
4520,Despite the occasional frustrating bug (even without any modding) this is the best single player game of any genre on the market in my opinion. It's an essential game to add to your collection.
4521,5.1
4522,"You've heard of Skyrim before, you know its great."
4523,"Nice little game.
"
4524,"My favorite game of all time.   An amazing game right out of the box, however the modding community makes it an even better game by constantly releasing new content.   You cannot go wrong with this game.   Buy it now."
4525,fun to play mods on
4526,made me horny

4528,One of my favorite games and it runs just as lovely on the PC
4529,One day I'll beat the game...
4530,A game that I have wasted a decade modding and haven't even fought Alduin yet.  10/10 for the Excellent mods though.
4531,"Classic
"
4532,Great open world game. Great community support.
4533,Love it but where is 6
4534,КУПИ СКАЙРИМ
4535,I am still just in love with this game <3
4536,Good
4537,"It's Skyrim, what else could you want?"
4538,awesome!
4539,"love it still in 2021
"
4540,yes
4541,best game to exist
4542,"I GOT ADD, SO I GET TO JUMP AROUND TO DIFFERENT QUEST ALL THE TIME, ALSO ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE SUCKS BALLS I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR OTHERS TO COMPLETE A QUEST, I GUESS WANTING A GOOD STORY LINE IN A GAME IS TO MUCH FOR THE ONLINE ELDER SCROLLS."
4543,"What i like the most about Skyrim is that freedom that it gives the player is priceless. Wanna be a battle mage like myself, no problem. There were so many ocasions where I was doing some quest and them another unrelated one, it is a massive world. Some radiant quests are a little bit annoying, the early bugs seems to be solved, either by the community or Bethesda itself. Speaking of community, there is a lot, thousands of mods, you can change the dragon for a locomotive, it is insane, in a good sense, of course."
4544,An icon of its time
4545,"Skyrim is a game quite like no other, it got me into the Elder Scrolls series as a whole. The frozen northern lands are a setting I never tire of and feel I can always come back to. Sure it may not have all the bells and whistles Morrowind had, or the meme capability Oblivion had. Skyrim will forever be however my favourite game of all time."
4546,skyrim
4547,you cant stop us todd also your game made my wee wee go boing
4548,nice game good
4549,"Its Skyrim. Its a good game, you'll have a much better time than playing on consoles due to much faster loading times and the use of mods from the steam workshop. I first played Skyrim on the PS3 and half the time I spent looking at loading screens. That no longer being a problem on PC makes the game worth revisiting imo. Always fun to walk around and get into random adventures."
4550,been my favorit game for years love it both on console and on pc cant wait for elderscrolls 6 whenever that comes out
4551,An all time favorite.
4552,"I bought this game on the PS3 back in 2011, and I was blown away by everything; the size of the map, the environment, plot, and the soundtrack is one that I've spent countless hours listening to over the years.
When the Special Edition came out for the PS4, I bought that, too.
And to round it all off, I thought ""why not buy it for PC as well!""

I AM biased, but I don't think I'll ever get sick of playing this game (more so this version where the Dragonborn and Dawnguard DLCs aren't built in - tired of NPC's getting killed by vampires)
I've lost count of how many times I've started the game from the beginning just because I love discovering everything for the first time over and over again."
4553,I'd say don't pay money for this but it looks like Bethesda is making it unavailable. So I'll say just don't ever pay Bethesda any money for anything.
4554,It only gets better
4555,It's Skyrim. Skyrim is badass. It's so fun to just FUS-RO-DAH everyone off a cliff though it can break some battles a little. Everyone should at least give this game a try.
4556,Great sandbox game.
4557,"Rightfully the most influential RPG of the decade, still a must play. The game that pushed open world games to the forefront definitively."
4558,Yeah it’s alright
4559,GOAT
4560,Yes.
4561,ty tom howard #workingasintended
4562,fish
4563,I heard good things.
4564,"Only Thalmors would dislike this game.

Just don't make the mistake of rebuying it every time Todd needs some extra cash.

Skyrim for the Nords!"
4565,10/10
4566,"you can get a wife from wearing a necklace ;)

10/10 

"
4567,its great
4568,Awesome game! the game is similar to fallout 4 in which it has a main story as well as many different side quests.
4569,twas good
4570,"works only about 20% of the time

10/10 will never get old"
4571,nice
4572,"Played Skyrim on console for many hours and did basically everything. Now on the PC, I can extend that with mods to change the experience and makeshift a remake that even to this day still remains mostly the same when re-released."
4573,"I played it on the 360, don't know why i have it."
4574,Bueno.
4575,"(Quicksave) Me In Whiterun To Mass Murder, Start Murder And Found Out I Had Saved So I Cant Go Back, Go Back To River Wood at Level 21 (i did sneak Glitch) get pissed because i lost my wooden sword with fire damage 6686676566% and my Ring of health with 34567765%
get sad"
4576,"One of the best open-world games. Loved everything about it and have played through a few times. The only downside is that it could really do with a two-player co-op option. I don't think it would take too much to add that in. Overall, a definite win for anyone who loves RPGs."
4577,Perfect for older hardware that can't run the special edition.
4578,dvdafvfav
4579,nice

4584,"If you want to play it on a modern pc with a 144 or more hz monitor you can just forget about it, played it before but now its a broken mess, beginning sequence is buggy and makes you vomit because it is broken at high frame rates, uncapped framerate makes the water jitter and shadows render in as lines, with an annoying sound constantly playing. tried looking up forums, discords, and other threads for fixes and i need to mod the game and use some third party software just to be able to play a game i got gifted. I hope from the bottom of my heart that someone sends a nailbomb to the studio or the developers, i've seen roblox games better optimised than this overrated badly put together messy lumpy excuse of a game. if you want to buy a game this holiday season get a hentai adult game for 79 cents, you will have more fun with that than you can ever have playing this. Alhamdulillah."
4585,yaaaaasssssssssss
4586,gemminggg
4587,"no cus this is literally the most fun game ever, it can be a whole new experience every time to u play depening on the mods u got
never gets boring"
4588,"
a good game with a storyline and history built in that is interesting and well thought out the base game is a little tedious but the workshop provides all the things you could want to make the game replayable and allow you to have many hours of fun"
4589,Legen... wait for it... dairy
4590,"no anniversary upgrade for  legendary edition owners, disappointed.."
4591,bing bong fuck ya life what do you wanna tell joe biven right now hey baby take me out to dinner
4592,haha fus roh dah go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
4593,"Don't mind me, I'm just here to re-purchase this year's edition."
4594,Always Crashes After the Bethesda logo! Can no longer play!
4595,epic
4596,"great story line quest also many side quest fun never ending,and the fact that it can be modded ur way play ur way and have tons of fun yes highly recomend"
4597,Very fun.
4598," I have played this game for a long time and never get bored.
There is always things to do and with the mods it seems to get better and better.
I never get tired of killing Dragons, Bandits and any wild beast that gets in my way.
I've even used the creation kit to build my own Castle, Great fun I can't praise this Game enough!"
4599,The original version. Still useful for mods that were never made for the Remaster.
4600,boobz
4601,"I remember the first day, when dad bought this game for us. He picked nord and we wandered through a lot of adventures that evening, and when he was done, he told me ""Bet you wanna play too, isn't it?"" The spark in my eyes answered for me. But I could play under one condition, no argonian character. I have agreed and waited him to leave. Guess you know whom I have picked. When my dad came back home, he simply forbid me to play, because argonian is a gawddamn furry. But soon he realised, that I love that game too much and my dad allowed me to play. Sooner, I've changed my character to the khajiit and I had the best game experience in my life. No game is better than my little, precious Skyrim c:"
4602,everyone should experience one play through
4603,I love this game
4604,Skyrim
4605,"One of the all time classic RPG's that companies are too cautious to invest the time in these days. Even without any mods, Skyrim is awesome, but when you mod this game - it outclasses anything on offer today."
4606,"just play it 
"
4607,best game ever
4608,This game is over 10 years old and people still play the hell out of it. What more need more be said?
4609,"Where TF is 6?
"
4610,"1000+ hours. Never get bored. Still playing this game. I have no idea what keeps me drawn in. This game is either my life, or a horrible addiction. Either way. Here I am... still playing..."
4611,very good game
4612,fire
4613,"I absolutely love this gem of a game. Crazy after a decade I can still play and immerse myself completely. Im obsessed. Only thing, please fix it as I cannot load into my game any more. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen :{
"
4614,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim gives us a very, very big game in many aspects,
To start with the map, like Skyrim's predecessors, in addition to the thriving outer world, there are also a bevy of dungeons at various depths and interiors of buildings, each worth exploring as well,
what Skyrim has in store to make the exploration area bigger are all 'vertical' areas thanks to the many mountains and mountain regions.

Watch my run through the map with Exo Knees on My Legs here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUxWnn5wT8Y

What's also striking about the dungeons, compared to the dungeons in Oblivion, is that there is a lot more variety in terms of environments in the dungeons, despite the fact that you can find many unique items in underground areas this variation makes looting and exploring dungeons much more interesting.

It is difficult to make a review ten years after the release, in the end everything has already been discussed several times in reviews and it is generally known worldwide that Skyrim has gone down in history as one of the best games ever, we can only imagine how beautiful and finished The Elder Scrolls VI will be.
What is certain is that the replayability in Skyrim (or other TES games) after 10 years still gives impressive results on the gaming experience and this will undoubtedly remain so for years to come."
4615,anytime anywhere oh yeah

4617,I marriage the sweaty ugly murderclown with mod. Bethesda put main game . Now
4618,Very good game!
4619,pdf
4620,yes
4621,best game of all time
4622,"The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition.

I have played total of +1000 Hours on this game in PC,  +100Hours in PS4 and +100 on Switch. Full Modded (Over 1500 installed), and with no mods.

Being honest, the Anniversary Edition is a decent presentation of Bethesda, the new content works quite fine, and its very immersive, hunger, thirst and sleep, no fast travel (problem here they should have added more destinations for the carriage, boats, ships, etc., so it feels a little more annoying to have to walk all the way.), reduction of capacity (I heard a lot that its a bad thing, but I think the way to play it is simple, just grab essential high values like rings, collars, etc, and avoid weapon and armor unless they deserve to stay).

I have only get one crush, when you exit the first cave, it will ask you if you want to activate survival mode, click ¡NO! And then walk up to River wood and activated there from menu, rest have works fine to me, at the time (haven't played history, direct to the top with minimum effort this time).

The last thing to say about this games, it's that if you are a Mod user, and know the deal, keep up with the Modded Version, its fine, better, and at your own like, 100% Winner. Nevertheless, Anniversary Edition is totally recommended for those who are beginners or intermediate to the game, and for the ones that doesn't know how to mod, or don't want to, because it takes a lot of time.

Overall Score:  8.8 / 10
"
4623,"long excellent game. Will keep you occupied for hours and hours. Over 400 hours for me so far, lol. Enjoy"
4624,Best game EVER!
4625,fun
4626,"My all time hero so far. If there was just one game to get burried with, it's got to be SKYRIM.

pro: modability; fus ro dah; immersion
con: time spent modding > time spent enjoying the actual game (basic disease carried over since OBLIVION)

Wish I could spend more time in these frosty nordic lands... maybe some day I'll return from my nexus mods trip... hope so"
4627,good
4628,This game no needs introduction.
4629,Is gud
4630,"Skyrim is eternal and my 5 different purchases of this game greatly pleases Todd Howard. It is said that Pong was the first virtual game ever created, however this is incorrect. ""Pong"" was merely a representation of the Stormcloak rebellion against the Empire, incorrectly named to Pong. Skyrim was and will always be the only video game. All hail the great and mighty Todd."
4631,"It's Skyrim,what else you need to know"
4632,.
4633,Very good!
4634,:D

4643,Good game.  A little dated now.  But very fun
4644,Yup.
4645,Very good spent alot of time in this game It was worth buying it.
4646,Yeah its pretty fun.
4647,"At this point, I'm probably not going to finish the game. I just never really got into it, but it was still impressive, so I'm not going to down vote it."
4648,"This game is fun, I think there's a dragon."
4649,Best PC game ever made
4650,best game
4651,"Get the dooting skeletons mod, then you'll experience true Skyrim."
4652,"have barely played it on PC but have put over 100 hours on it on xbox
its skyrim, its a classic"
4653,You have commited crimes against Whiterun and her people. What say you in your defense?

4656,It's Skyrim!
4657,good
4658,fun
4659,I love this game.
4660,"They did something to break the game for high end systems. This game use to work perfectly on a 960. Now it struggles using 1650 and 3600 ryzen. It's 60fps but so unstable microstutters and dips for no reason. Running off an ssd.

They broke it to force you to buy the SE."
4661,"Have loved this game since it's release. Had to leave it now and again over the years due to life commitments but every now and again I fire it up just to see my character still standing there looking back out of the screen at me with sword in hand ready to do battle.

We will I am sure of that, just need the toddler to leave home first. LOL"
4662,It is very good
4663,OPEN WORLD - Multiple ways to play. Good Lore . STRONG MOD COMMUNITY.
4664,It's Skyrim :))
4665,.
4666,The next level from Oblivion and think the story-line has improved and cannot wait for the next installment.

4673,"Not as good as Oblivion, but still good."
4674,"And even after 10 years, Skyrim remains unrivaled in TES series and one of the best in the RPG genre. 10 of 10 forever and ever!"
4675,"this game is without a doubt one of the best, the game world is beautiful, you can stand for a long time and admire the beautiful world and listen to beautiful music at the same time"
4676,Game is broken and that is why it's good.
4677,Immense RPG. Brilliant story
4678,just clasic
4679,"been playing since 2011, love the robust modding community
"
4680,"Eh, let's be honest, people mod the living shit out of this game. So much so in fact that's it's more mods than Skyrim, but you have to admit it is the most FUN to play. It might not be a better game than Morrowind or Oblivion, but I had the most fun with it, even without mods."
4681,"Nobody's gonna see this so I'm gonna just post an embarrassing secret from waaaaay back in the day lol












Bush faked 9/11"
4682,old but gold

4685,Still Looks amazing!!!
4686,"do not buy this game unless you are from the past because bethesda re-released it in a shameless cash grab so just get that one

if you're in the past, this is a great game made by a publisher that is warped by the pressures of capitalism"
4687,"gaming
"
4688,"i've been playing pirate Skyrim since 2011. I only bought it becouse it's worth the money.

4702,Still to this day the best game ever
4703,"Shortly after the release of Skyrim in 2011, my countryman, Mr. Vávra (the creator of Kingom Come), has published a venomous article about the imperfections of TES 5, in which he panned the game for its alleged lack of medieval toilets and excessive thickness of castle walls (yes, you read correctly). Now, exactly 10 years later, in the light of Skyrim's still very active community, we can see, how terrible wrong he was, as TES 5 is more lively than many brand new games."

4733,"i'd say any review of skyrim in the year 2021 is for people who somehow havent played it yet. 
and if thats you, i envy you. the game is amazing, and i wish i could experience it for the first time once again
it holds up well after a decade
amazing soundtrack and art design and sound fx
cool story, cool side quests, lore and world building
tons to do and very immersive. 
even if its your first time id say use some quality of life or graphics mods
wait till another playthru to add thomas the train and light sabers to your game"

Left behind, not getting the big anniversary update, but I guess it is cool that it is still here, though unlisted at the publisher's request. I suppose that means that the only way you can find it, outside of having it recommended to you by a friend, is to see a review for it like this one."
4739,best game in the world

Even 10 years after premiere is nice to play. Still lots of content. Still lots of fun. If You are fan of RPG, You won`t be disapointed.

4751,"If I were to keep 5 games in my library, I would choose first of all Skyrim v.
Why?
It is a all around good game, that offers the most exquisite open world experience I ever encountered in any game.

The graphics can be modded, the gameplay can be modded, the music and audio can be modded, the story can be modded, everything can be modded.
It has also a very powerful command editor that allow to mess around when you have nothing else to explore.

Its replayability is one of the best of every single game on the world.

I rarely give a game such a good review, but Skyrim deserves it.
It is a shame developers unlisted this game, I think it can offer all what any new version could do."
4752,It's Skyrim. You know the game by reputation now. Either you love it or you don't and that's just fine.
4753,I am at over 500 hours in this game. It is over a decade old now and I still find myself coming back to Skyrim. Each playthrough I see something new. It's crazy how much Bethesda squeezed into this game.
4754,"This is, in my eyes, the last good game Bethesda made. The amount of detail and intricacy put into this world feels so good. The later games pale in comparison to this masterpiece. Sure, it's outdated in some regards (namely graphics and combat), but this game still holds up as a masterclass of story telling. This is 1 of the 6 games I consider 10/10. If you are even remotely interested in this game, pick it up ASAP."
4755,cock
4756,cul
4757,"Listen. It's Skyrim.  You don't need reviews, you already know what you're in for."
4758,"Weeks of great gameplay if you have all the DLCs.  If not, not so much.
"
4759,"This is probably the best entry-level RPG out there. Great soundtrack, world design, graphics (for its time) and leveling/upgrade system.

Sadly, the RPG elements are quite shallow or even non-existent at times. Oblivion had more choices and subtle ways to go about each quest, but it seems with Skyrim they wanted to expand the target audience. It's still quite impressive, and it was a blast to me when I had basically no experience with open world RPGs.

It's pretty buggy even today but usually nothing gamebreaking, just the occasional Bethesda(TM) corpses having seizures inside the ground or NPCs rotating their neck 360 degrees etc.

I can't wait for Elder Scrolls VI, but my expectations are being kept relatively grounded if Skyrim is any indication of where the series is going.

So if I'm giving mixed signals: I believe people who want to get into this type of game for the first time will enjoy it, but people who want something deeper in the genre will find it superficial and lackluster. But when I experienced it for the first time, I was the former category, and I enjoyed it immensely."
4760,Fus Ro Dah
4761,"I do not know what to say. Great game, You can use mods. Skyrim has so much to offer in its huge open world and the DLC packs just add to it and even with all the small bugs scattered everywhere so many others have given this game some great reviews, I am sad to see it ""hidden"" from the steam store because Skyrim Special Edition and its many updates is not a great place for doing a long play-through with 100 or more mods, Though I am not saying it can not be done. I just do not understand why this has been removed. If this is ever put back on the store and anyone sees my review, This is totally worth buying no matter if you want it to use the mods or not, Get this before it goes away again. Though I have a bad feeling this game will never see the light of day again. (Still works on Windows 10 64 bit at the time I posted this review)"

Yes you can spend time grinding improving various skills, but you can also do large quantities of side quests and exploring to build your character, which is for me, much more enjoyable than the daily grind in most MMO games.

Was good for what it was when it was released, though nowhere on the level of Oblivion in terms of story-line & lore IMO. The only way it is playable for me at the current date, and after years of playing this game, is heavily modded, which as an older game adds to the experience of it entirely for me. Will always be a legend of a game tho. 8/10
"
4790,"I played this game on day one. I've revisited it several times. It doesn't have the deep story and complex social structure that Morrowind had, but it's still a fun game. Maybe one day we'll get another game like Morrowind. 

NOTE: at the time of this review, I had 608 hours of game play. I beat the game the first time without internet = without Steam. So it's more like 1500+ hours played. It's a good game."
4791,"I played the game when it first came out 10 years ago, and I'm still down to play!!"
4792,"\m/,"
4793,"skyrim goated
"
4794,"The best RPG of all-time when it came out 10 years ago and still surpasses most modern iterations. As an old-school fan of the Morrowind series and Oblivion, this game is a definite must own. It updates all the in-game mechanics and lore from the previous games and delivers a full open world for players to discover and explore.

Fans of Oblivion will appreciate fixes to the two major issues with Oblivion: 1) combat is now less clunky and more forgiving, 2) fast travel is now available for every discovered landmark.

Befitting of the franchise, the entire game world is at your whim and you can do whatever you like. This pretty much translates for me into avoiding the main quest line and mucking about with everything else. Climbing peaks, discovering landmarks, delving random dungeons and strongholds, shooting everyone in the knee with arrows, picking every lock and stealing every item and fencing it for gold.

Lots of fun deviations in deep side questing involving pirates, dragons, werewolves, vampires, secret societies. All the good stuff from the past games now more accessible and fully voiced.

Coming back to the game 10 years later is a welcome change. The Skyrim Nexus modding community is huge and there is a mod for everything for the base game now known as ""Oldrim"" (Skyrim 32-bit). Way back, I only got the Dawnguard and Hearthfire expansions, but these alone are enough to make use of most mods. Oldrim with all 3 DLC were re-released as Skyrim LE. These days, Skyrim SE is its 64-bit successor. Skyrim AE is pretty much the 10-year anniversary cash-grab, bundling SE with Creation Club which is Bethesda's way of in-housing mods and selling new content.

I'm perfectly happy staying with Oldrim and cherry-picking all the best mods from Skyrim Nexus and Steam Workshop. Instead of a boring solo hero-versus-the-world expedition, I now travel with 5 followers each on our own horses and enjoy the random banter, singing, healing, and assists that they provide. This transforms the entire game into something more immersive and enjoyable."
4795,"My favorite game of all time and a childhood memory. Although this is my opinion I would recommend instead buying the special edition version or mod the hell out of the game using nexus mods as otherwise I do not think the games mechanix and graphics holds up in todays standard. Still a must-buy for any real gamer

Just use dragonrend and flame or other range attacks and Alduin will be easy to defeat, but apart from that the game is actually fun.

Quests are fun, NPCs are actually well programmed that makes you not feel as if you are the only person there, they are actually impressively programmed. Combat is also great, I love this game."

4848,"Might be the best game on steam. Open world, cheats, hacks. This is how it should be done."
4849,"This is more of an informational review than anything, so I guess to get my opinions out of the way right now I'm really enjoying the game so far and am glad I'm finally getting around to playing through it. I've never played through Skyrim, I played some on Xbox 360 and later played more on Switch, but it was never more than 5 or so hours, decided I wanted to play it and properly get into it this time, figured I'd go with the PC version with mods this time and decided on the original for the best mod compatibility. The DLC is not listed on Steam but if you have the URLs for their store pages you can still buy them, all of it adds up to $65, $25 more than if you were to just buy Special Edition instead. However there is one other option and it's actually cheaper than Special Edition, just buy a physical copy of Legendary Edition, as of writing this it's currently around $30 on Amazon and that's how I obtained the original version of Skyrim and all its DLC so if you're looking to do the same, Legendary Edition is the best option:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CJ7IUIQ

This should go without saying, but obviously if you do this make sure you're getting a new copy or at the very least one with an unredeemed Steam code, only saying that because there were some negative reviews on Amazon from people who didn't know that, but I assume if you're using Steam you probably already know how this works. When I got mine it was a European copy but that wasn't an issue so the codes are seemingly not region locked, it's also possible you might find it cheaper elsewhere, but Amazon is where I got it."

Hours worth of content, years worth of fun, and highly customizable and modifiable gameplay that can be brought to the game thanks to Skyrim's outstanding playerbase of developers and modders alike."
4914,"The freedom to play just about any way I want. I also like the mods to fine tune my experience.  I feel like Skyrim is a classic game, great for any gamer or someone first getting into RPGs."
4915,"an old game but still very good
"
4916,"SO, at this point, I'm pretty well obligated to affirm that Skyrim is a classic. The only times I've been dissatisfied are when mods conflict and cause me to spawn inside the cart every new game attempt. That was an easy enough fix for me. Still play, probably won't ever stop."
4917,Fuck bethesda. All my homies hate bethesda.
4918,When tf is todd howard going to release skyrim on the toaster 360?!?!?!?
4919,when the scrolls are elder
4920,"Just completed the game after 1550 hours trying to make THE character.

Game's k. Life spiraled out of control. Would still play."
4921,"It's skyrim, a buggy mess, but an awesome buggy mess!"
4922,Topovecka
4923,Not without mods
4924,hell yeah
4925,yes
4926,So much better than the Special Edition its sad that Bethesda has to be a greedy money hog and made this game unlisted so people will buy the more expensive and overall worse version.
4927,"good game, iconic"
4928,You know what this game is.
4929,kinda ok
4930,ok
4931,This game I can't start a new one or anything it starts glitching out immediately.
4932,"48 hours in, and i still haven't gotten past like the first 7 story missions lmfao"
4933,"You already know, Skyrim is just epic."
4934,>:] nice
4935,"Cool (chłodna)
"
4936,"Love, Love this game!"
4937,Great game. does glitch sometimes but they are hilliarious and normally wont affect the game play.
4938,"Saw a dragon
Shouted at said dragon
Dragon visibly mad
proceeds to wreck my shit

10/10 would shout at dragons again"
4939,It's good
4940,"TL;DR - This game made my 20's worth it. But make sure you add mods!

I just want to say firstly, A BIG THANK YOU to everyone in the steam mod community for making this ugly base game into a beautiful piece of art. Y'all the real MVPs, adding amazing texture pack upgrades, weather/lighting boosts, better voices and dialogue, and even freakin whole new lands. Bethesda should compensate every one of you guys for improving their game beyond measure, and definitely beyond the ""updates"" and ""anniversary"" packs the company offered.

As far as the game itself goes:

PROS
**The world is awesome. So much to explore, just dick off and not do any quests for so long. It's just fun to be in Skyrim and run around. Jump up a mountain on a horse. Shout an enemy into a glitch in the matrix. 
**The political bit is a good add to have contention in the world among the NPCs. Join the different factions and just fuck shit up on both sides. 
**Leveling is relatively easy and painless, you'll just naturally blow through most of it through quests. Enemies level with you for the most part so you'll rarely have too much issue with one on one/two combats. 
**Endless side quests until you're hundreds of hours into a game and still not even 10% of the storyline. There. Is. So. Much. Stuff. To do. 
**You'll really get invested with some of the NPCs and parts of the storyline, your followers are crazy pack mules, and help out a ton if you're in it for story more than fighting. 
**MUSIC IS SO GOOD.
**Horses, fast travel, Vampires, the Dark Brotherhood, a good number of cities to loot, weapon enchantments, different dialogue based on your race choice, glitches, & mudcrabs -- all the good things of a classic Elder Scrolls game. 

CONS
**This game is really only good looking with mods. Playing the upgrades without them, or the console versions... Oh boy, I forgot how ugly this game is at the base. 
**The Dark Brotherhood - Yeah ok, this is still a pro too, bc it is a beyond necessary side quest and returning NPCs.... But this storyline failed so badly imo. Weak ending, especially compared to Oblivion's AMAZING DB quest line. 
**Speaking of Oblivion, the whole story of Skyrim really pales in comparison. I loved, loved, loved Oblivion's story. Skyrim... way less so. It's pretty boring and you run through it way too quickly. Oblivion was much beefy-er in terms of good characters, main quests and ending. Now the Skyrim world is WAY MORE FUN to just dick around in the game, but Oblivion wins hands down regardless.
**Farkas from the Jorvaskr / Werewolf sidequest - I hate him bc I had a crappy boss with the same name. Thanks, Bethesda. 
**The fucking intro wagon ride.
**Cave / Dungeon maps. Yeah I know they can't all be super different, but more than like 4 models would have been nice.

VR gets its own section of cons, as there's no pro's imo:
**VR in this game is a huge joke and disappointment. Mods didn't work at the time I played it, and not sure if they do yet, but oh boy returning to the ugly game IN SURROUND VISION was... nope. lol - But the main issue is its locomotion. Way too jittery and fast, and as someone who -does not get motion sick ever- I got super motion sick in ~30 minutes of play. You can easily cheat by just slashing so fast your enemies have no real combat ability. Jumping was awkward, some things were crazy out of scale compared to your character height. It's just.. clunky and lame. Granted, I haven't played the VR version in over a year, so I hope any of these things are fixed. Please correct me if it's worth playing anytime!

Overall, I'm still gonna play tf outta this game. :)"
4941,DIS GAYME ISH AWESUME! yiff Daddy
4942,"Fun fact: Jeremy Soule was brought in to compose music before the game was developed to inspire the team. Great game, one of the best of all time and with modding it makes this goated game timeless."
4943,"It's Skyrim. What else do you want me to say? This copy I have doesn't even have the other DLCs, it's still great!"
4944,"Because it's Skyrim. If you haven't played LE or SE... What are you doing with your life? Skyrim...Fallout...Play them. Mod them. I've played these games for over a decade now, and they still hold up."
4945,This is the game i hear so much good stuff about. And that after years of owning still can't get past the opening without being bored!
4946,It just works
4947,ok game
4948,Classic
4949,"awesome
"
4950,hjnl;hh
4951,"It's a good game, it has a massive open world with a ton of content, and I am nowhere near done with it. I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting an open ended RPG with an interesting storyline.

Unfortunately however, this version is unlisted on Steam and as of such you will likely need to get the Special Edition. Still a great game though."
4952,"sum good ahhh shittt
"
4953,Good
4954,"A very good game, both vanilla and modded. Been playing for years now, it's my absolute favorite."
4955,"Why not? When Fallout '76 is absolute shit - THIS is the game! Then again, I really don't care what you play, you like F'76? Good for you, I don't fucking care anymore... FTW!"

4957,It's Skyrim duh! Install rape and bestiality mods for extra fun! :D
4958,I wish I could enjoy playing this game as much as the developers enjoy releasing it.
4959,Games aight
4960,It's good.
4961,GOOOD GAME GOOD SERIES NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS GAME
4962,"Haven't played this version for like 3 or 4 years but since SkyrimSE got updated, my mods are buggy as all Oblivion. This game has been around for half of my life and I'm glad that it played such a big role in it. 10/10 killed Nazeems, for sure."
4963,love this game
4964,"So The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This game is a rpg fantasy game set in the Elder Scrolls universe, obviously. Controls and everything are pretty good. I just dont know how, but this is the sort of game, that is repetitive as hell, but is still one of the best games I have ever played, for example Far Cry 3, 4, 5, or CoD. The game is just so repetitive that its fun to play. So basically overall gameplaye is awesome. But one aspect of game that I think isnt that awesome is lore. The story is really straightforward and not too iconic. And story missions were boring as hell, side missions are the ones I loved. The leveling systém is fairly good in my opinion. This review is hell of a mess but still it took me some time to type. I Give this game 8/10.
Ps: tip, if youre low level i suggest you going to giants, they will give you op stuff, I swear they are friendly, they wont yeet you to space at all ;)"
4965,The kind of game you play every year for a bit
4966,"An excellent game, which is very easy to sink multiple hours into. While Skyrim is very good I would only recommend this version if you have a lower-end PC or you are trying run mods that are only compatible with this version. If you want Skyrim and have a decent PC go for the Special Edition which is also here on Steam, you'll get everything this game has plus higher quality visuals and all the DLC that has released for this game."
4967,"This game... is not as good as oblivion. If you haven't played oblivion yet, play that. It looks old, but you won't care after 30 minutes playing oblivion.

This game doesn't have the powerful storylines that oblivion has. The ones that make you feel like you were part of something awesome. Every mission in Skyrim is the same, or not that different.

They removed the birth signs and classes that Oblivion had... take that how you will. I'd say it's a negative thing.

No one recognizes your feats like Oblivion. When you closed the Oblivion gate, people knew. People respected you. In Skyrim, you could kill the biggest bad guy and you'll still get treated the same.

However... Skyrim isn't a *bad* game, per say. It's still enjoyable to play. It's combat is fun, everything looks very nice... and I found it worth playing 210 hours apparently. So I do recommend you play it... after you play Oblivion."
4968,You knows you played one of the best when you played and loses the sense of time.
4969,I like the idea and mechanics of the game. The music and story is also very good.
4970,Best place to become a werewolf and tear up bad guys
4971,This game is the definition of timeless. Never gets old
4972,Played for over 1200 hours. The secret to it's longevity? Mods. You can play without but you will miss out on much of what it has to offer.
4973,Amazing Game
4974,meh
4975,the best release of this game
4976,it b fun af
4977,thought id give it a fair chance and tbh its just not for me.
4978,"It makes me forget im alive, good game :)))"
4979,"spent a week modding for 38 hours of gameplay, of which 30 hours were just fixing crashes and infinite loading screens

worth it"
4980,It good.
4981,"Todd Howard, you've done it again..."
4982,"Engaging, Open world, infinite quests."
4983,Good
4984,"For those of you wondering, this game is great, BUT, if you are using this on bootcamp, do not buy this, you will have tons of sound fx issues that are unfixable so its better if you are using an actual pc."
4985,"MAD
"
4986,I went way out of the area I should have and died to an elder dragon. Fun times.
4987,dig bick energy
4988,One of my favorite games to play and never finish the main story lol. So much fun to explore and see the random things that happen in it. Plus the mods people make great it makes it 10 times in it would recommend for the people who still have not played it.
4989,
4990,"What can i say? it is skyrim, so its good."
4991,do i really need to review this game
4992,E
4993,"Feels like coming home.

Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but the Creation Engine is a work of art. I don't care how buggy it is. You can fix most of the bugs you encounter with a few console commands. You can mod out the rest. You can't say that about all the buggy, undercooked games coming out of any other studio these days."
4994,"never have more than 1 account on one computer, unless you have a high end computer."
4995,"Its Skyrim, need i say more."
4996,Still awesome after 10 years. Now better than the latest version.
4997,"Without a doubt a great game, yes it does have some glitches like random creatures falling from the sky from time to time among other faults. But you'll have a ton of fun playing it.
The modding-community is large and active so take a peak in the workshop if you wanna spice up your experience!"
4998,Better
4999,Its Fallout but without guns.
5000,"Great RPG, Great storyline, tons of side quests to keep you busy. Tons of mods so you never get bored. 10/10."
5001,"Personally for me this game is 10/10, but the current copy I owe is absolutely garbango balls, million of bugs, I can't even finish the starting cinematic of the game as my carriage is flying of to jupiter that's how bad it is. The game itself is amazing, just not the Steam version for some reason."
5002,game
5003,"I live here in SkyRim, nough said !"
5004,fun
5005,mods took this game to 10/10
5006,now broken and cant make my own mods anymore.
5007,todd howard u succ
5008,epic
5009,"nice
"
5010,hehe good game hehe
5011,What is there to say? It's Skyrim.
5012,"The game is an open-world, RPG classic. If you have never played it, then you had a pretty boring childhood. Purchase Skyrim. Download Skyrim. Play Skyrim. Even if you end up not liking it, you can at least say you had played one of the best games of it's time, and of all-time."
5013,Welcome to the 10th time Skyrim has been released.... If you have not played this game; what are you doing?
5014,30/10 I Played this game on 3 different console's and now PC. Even tho the Legendary edition was a bit buggy on some Quest to the point where I had to make a new save i still enjoyed getting all the trophy's again even if I had to cheat to get like 5 of them lol I still at least had a Great time and Hopefully if you get the game you will too but ps Special Edition runs wayyy better in my Option so if you don't wanna crash as much or run into abit of problems Newer Vision Runs better. Plus if you do get the the Special Edition you can get Free Easy Mods that Install the Moment you Active them in the game's Main Menu Itself which is Nice minus the Fact you don't get Trophy's for having the mods Enabled. But anyway if you made it this far and you feel like listening to Me id get the Newer Vision.
5015,Very Fun
5016,Nom nom!!
5017,"I hate this game 











































































no"
5018,"One of the best best games of all time with all the mods, amazing experience"
5019,"Skyrim's reputation precedes it. There is always something to do.  You can focus on the main story line or do your own thing and continue to level up. A great time killer, and the graphics still hold up today."
5020,Yay!
5021,really great and addictive game
5022,E
5023,"Honestly I can no longer allow this to be one of my favourite games I have bought several iterations of this from it original release to psvr to special edition supporting a company I once admired. Fallout 76 should have been an eye opener to Bethesda about what happens when they get cash hungry at the cost of the fan base. But no now they have taken what was working (nexus modding) and disabled a decade’s worth of peoples hard work to then charge us to be able to use the mods and then charge on top of that for each piece of mod they allow to be accessed. Wave good bye to what we love and hello to corporate greed. No longer will I pander to Bethesda, they like call of duty will never see another penny from me."
5024,GREAT GAME
5025,SKYRIM IS LITERALLY THE BEST GAME TO EVER BE CREATED IN THE HISTORY OF THE MULTIVERSE
5026,1
5027,"great game

5028,its best game ive played it help me through my childhood
5029,"Greatest game in their series, was sad when next one was a online one til I played it."
5030,2nd best game of all time after magic the gathering.
5031,Challenging with beautiful scenery. I love exploring the map. It's a fun and beautiful game to immerse yourself in.
5032,"One of the best open world RPG games I have ever played. If you haven't played this yet you've been sleeping under a rock your whole life. You WILL need mods to improve your experience while playing this game, mods can be found on the Nexus."
5033,"Not as good as Valheim, but ok!"
5034,"One of the best games of all time.
"
5035,"Absolutely love this game, one of the best open world games ever made by far"
5036,"A great game although compared to Oblivion the colors are muted, drab unless in direct sunlight. This includes what you are wearing. Unfortunately the engine does not differentiate between landscape, fauna, flora or you when it comes to light and coloring. Also I think the map is too small. An open world like this should be bigger, or as the kids say these days, EPIC!

Still I recommend this game for anyone looking for sword & sorcery adventure."
5037,How in the 9 realms have you not played this yet?
5038,Its Skyrim. Enough said.
5039,10/10 game of the decade
5040,Good game

5042,My favorite game EVER!
5043,everything
5044,"One of my favorite RPGs of all time. I've put in 200 hours just on PC alone (I have it on Xbox and Switch as well) and I've been playing for 10 years.
Even base game with zero mods gives you at least 100 hours of game-play. 
If you want a game to play for a long time this is your game."
5045,"It's Skyrim. If you don''t know what this game is like by now, my review isn't going to help much. Just play it, it's fun."
5046,"yeah, its good, i like it when i see a women and she says wow you are a handsome adventurer... i say yeah im pretty cool,. did u know im a dragonbord, yeah like tiber septiem u heard of him, well hes my dad,,, yeah, well sorta, we both go ahhHHH and shit does stuff, you know what i mean??"

5050,It is quite enjoyable.
5051,"Best game ever, no debate. Saw the anniversary update, fucking came out of my little dick and saw some hoes crying over them re-releasing Skyrim a million times. Made me laugh ngl. Ofcourse you re-release a 100/10 game over and over again!"
5052,very good

5058,"Launching enemies off cliffs with your voice never gets old. That, and there's so many ways to outfit your character, and lots of ways to change your gameplay mid-playthrough."
5059,Love this game! One of my favorite mods was the destruction of the thieves guild - it rocked.
5060,"Skyrim is years ahead of its time the biggest game of the 2010's, truly an innovation i recommend to anyone who has not played if you've played and are on the fence about a replay, PLAY AGAIN. True masterpiece 10/10"
5061,"10 years, migrated from PS to PC, for mods, the game is still fresh and new thanks to all the modders."
5062,"I mean, it's Skyrim, one of the best RPGs in existence, bugs and all."

5064,"Free world exploration, great immersion, great customization"
5065,YES!
5066,Its Skyrim 1.0 bro
5067,5/10 dungeons that all look the same
5068,"Absolutely a classic, even after 10 years and a day."
5069,"Good that the developer console and creation kit are available to the player.
Nowhere near enough games do this."
5070,fus ro DUH!! ftw!
5071,Spent 250 hours installing mods into the game. 10/10
5072,best game out update with mods is wonderful
5073,Do I need to review it?
5074,"its THE game
"
5075,"Here we are, 10 years and over 1000 hours across multiple platforms later, and I can still recommend this game.

Not the other ones, the cash grabs and the tinny audio can all go to hell. No, I’m here for this one, the original, the game that was so good gamers actually kept buying it when they shoveled a new version out across the next two console generations, VR, and even for the privilege of paid mods.

Say what you will about Skyrim, but the fact that it managed to sell enough to justify all those different versions that it (rightly) gets crap for says a lot about it’s nature as a game.

Skyrim isn’t necessarily the most “quality” experience, not without a dozen or so mods, but it’s definitely a playable one.

And GOD DAMN is it playable.

Skyrim is the video game equivalent of a hearty potato soup on a cold day. A casserole that you only get at the best potlucks. It’s not a steak, it’s not a Michelin starred dish, but holy fuck does nothing else quite capture the same feelings that it gives you.

Very few games have so easily invited a player in to just start playing and doing things their own way. It’s graphics are dated at this point, and the quests all feel a little rushed, but that’s part of the appeal.

In Oblivion you had to collect recommendations before you could even start the main mage’s guild quest line. Skyrim throws you right into the action. Is it unrealistic? Yes. Does the story suffer for it? 100% Is it fun? Absolutely, especially in an “I’m a busy adult and don’t want to grind just to get to the cool bits of my game” kind of way. 

This is repeated in almost every faction and sure the story suffers but honestly after playing this game to death I get it. It’s no fun doing chores when you could just get promoted to werewolf after a few romps through anti-werewolf bigots.

I was a high schooler with tons of time when i first got Skyrim on its release date. Having revisited and 100%ed it as an adult (after revisiting Morrowind and oblivion, no less) I absolutely understand it’s appeal, and how it has refined the Elder Scrolls formula. Sure it’s not the best entry for lorebeards, but there’s still plenty there, and at the end of the day, you can sit down and *just play.* with relatively little frustration compared to other titles in the series. That’s not to say it’s the best (I’m hard pressed to choose a favorite when it comes to TES), but it’s definitely the one I find myself returning to, time and time again. Because, as someone once said:

“It just works”

"
5076,It's a fine game.
5077,its ok
5078,"I woke up in a snow-covered pine forest. There was fog all around. I realized that my hands were bound, and I was in a horse-pulled carriage. There was another carriage ahead of mine. This guy sitting across from me, also bound, said that I was trying to cross the border. I don’t remember any of that. There was a thief to his left. He said that he and I shouldn’t be there. I noticed that there was a fourth member who was gagged. Kind of weird, but apparently he was the leader of some sort of rebellion. The Stormcloaks.

I hear a gate open. We had made it to a village. We passed a couple of wooden buildings with thatched roofs. One was a house with a porch, where a boy was playing on it. His father told him to go inside. That couldn’t be good. We stopped in some sort of courtyard. My carriage and the other were emptied of its prisoners. A scribe read out our names from a list. That thief tried to escape, but an archer shot him. I wasn’t going to try that.

Apparently, I really wasn’t supposed to be there, because I wasn’t on the list. But one of the officers told the scribe to ignore that fact. I looked in the middle of the courtyard, and there was a chopping block. Yep. This was bad. Saying I was nervous would be an understatement.

While this one Imperial General was yammering on about how the leader of the Stormcloaks guy was a traitor and whatnot, there was a weird noise. I didn’t care much for it. Too scared. But the Imperials were ready for executions. One rebel soldier seemed to be much braver than I. He volunteered to go first. And before I knew it. Plop! The executor chopped his head clean off. They pushed his body aside.

But then I heard that strange noise again. This time it caught my attention. It was like a roar. Everyone else noticed it, but one officer said to ignore it. And apparently, I was next. I was wondering what excuse I could make up. I mean, what was that noise? I had no idea what to do, as I walked to the block, got on my knees, and put my neck on the stone. I looked up at the executioner, as he was raising the ax.

My jaw dropped when I saw something huge fly through the sky. It landed on the tower right next to us. Then someone yelled, “Dragon!”

(See the rest of the story in my profile-artwork)

Happy 10 years Skyrim!"
5079,"AYE, WHO STOLE MY SWEETROLL!?!?!?"
5080,10 years of yes! Mods keep the game fresh and alive.
5081,Everyone has there own adventures. But this one is mine!
5082,"Still, even after 10 years since original release, Skyrim is well worth playing."
5083,"Amazing game, more RPGS need to use this one as an example"
5084,.
5085,"Gretchen, stop trying to make Skyrim happen. It's not going to happen."
5086,An excellent game that I thoroughly enjoy.

5088,skyrim anniversary edition is a complete joke.
5089,"¡Happy 10th Anniversary Skyrim!
This game is a masterpiece, one of the best open-world role-playing games of all time and a must-have for any gamer. Super fun to play, a lot of quests to do with fascinating lore and secrets to discover, many hours of gameplay and so much more by adding mods.
Best game."
5090,"Before I start, I must say something. I actually recommend this game - modded - it's pretty decent and if you don't own it, pick it up on sale. But it's not a masterpiece as so many have claimed, nor did it do much special, and that is the reason for this review. 

Skyrim overall is a mixed bag, but I would use the term 'wide as an ocean deep as a puddle' to describe this game. I'll give it to them, the game world is awesome at initial glance and it can very much immerse you - but the closer you look, the more things start to fall apart. First, the world - it's static and very much unchanging. Sure there's plenty of locations to explore, and much in the way of visual storytelling, but you'll soon find yourself fighting the same generic enemies in the same type of dungeons for the whole game to the point I dread seeing another Draugr. How about the story then? It's okay, kinda lazy at some points, but the worst thing is the game offers you little to no choices apart from certain meaningless side quests. Sure there's the big bad civil war, but really there isn't much there either - really it boils down to choosing whether you like red (the Empire) or blue (the Ethnostate) better. There are just no lasting consequences for your actions, no deep plot hooks that you can pull on, just the same never changing story. 

Then there are the repetitive radiant quests which are a neat gimmick at first, but become stale fast. Instead of writing interesting quests to make their game longer, they begin throwing these in right between the notable ones, which usually boils down to them making sure you're exploring enough locations in the world. If not, go here and kill generic enemies, come back. I don't know how many times I've gotten hyped for the next Companions quest, just to be given one of these and lose all hope. Speaking of companions, which could have been a redeeming factor, are just generic bodies that follow you around and hold your things. Sure a few might have had interesting backstories, but as soon as you hire them, they just fade into the background. No unique quests, no story comments, nothing. No wonder when the community was thrown a half decent one in the form of Serana they started to go wild over her. What about the combat then, surely a saving grace if everything else is bad. Honestly it's passable at best... There's little to no depth to it, and while at the beginning you're able to do a small amount of character building, in the end you'll come to master all skills, and fall into the meta of stealth archer. This is over a problem with all modern Bethesda games it seems, and extends past the skill system. By the end of the game, you'll have leveled up all skills, become the master of all guilds, and all but in name will rule the world. 

In my opinion, this game is barely an RPG, and is more of a semi-linear power fantasy. People praise this game for being revolutionary for the entire genre, but I have yet to see much in the way of proof through my hours of gameplay to back up these claims. Sure the game is fun, and I don't think differently of you if you like it, but I don't see how this is a modern masterpiece."

Seriously though, this is a great game. Even a decade later it's still highly playable and a lot of fun. Happy Birthday Skyrim.

5101,"So many heartwarming memories. 
Game of my childhood."
5102,"Back to this gem, after Todd fนcking kill SSE. Oh, I mean SAE."
5103,"10 year ago a game redefined the RPG genre. And even today, 1000s of people are still playing it, making mods, YT videos and much more. Not many games managed to keep so healthy community for so long. If you haven't played this game then you missed one of the greatest moments in gaming history. 

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is easily my favorite game of all time taking almost every aspect it has to perfection (world full of quests and mysteries, many diverse locations, unique story and even today the graphics are breathtaking. And if you don't like something about Skyrim, simply download a mod that fixes it and believe me, there is a mod that fixes it. You can also create mods yourself in one of the easiest mod tools I've seen.

Skyrim became a legend and a living proof that running an open world RPG game in year 2011 (and even in 2021) on engine from 2002  just works."
5104,love it played a lot an still discovering new places doing quests ive never done b4
5105,this game is older than the average ugandan
5106,"I got kicked out of university due to fail 2 important exams - I've played this game almost the whole time. Still, I enjoyed every moment in Skyrim. I would fail those tests again."

5113,amazing made even better with mods

5115,HOW COULD ANY ONE NOT LIKE THIS GAME?
5116,"Don't forget to buy Skyrim again, lest you want Todd come a-knockin'"
5117,"Bethesda, shame on you for even making people jump through hoops so you can resale the same fucking game for the 5th time. You may have noticed the dlc is missing from the store page. Don't panic its merely hidden .Links probably aren't allowed but google ""was all the original skyrim dlc removed from the steam store"". First result should be a reddit post from someone named Sometrashperson with links leading to the store page of the dlc. You're welcome. And sincerely f*** you Bethesda."

5120,"[h1]Skyrim still going strong[/h1]

Horrible game,  terrible game,  bad bad game.... Have only played through it 5 times now and even bought the VR version.
Skyrim is as addictive as (choose your poison).  Vanilla is cool, but if you can grasp the modding, there are a ton of mods to crank it up.

This OGD (Old Gamer Dude) has this one on the top of my list of favorites and recommend it to anyone who enjoys open world / story driven / choices matter adventures... and if you want the true immersion, go for it in VR!"
5121,"excellent game, huge exploration and events"
5122,One of the definitive and best open world games from the Powerhouse Bethesda Soft works.  9.8/10
5123,"Got 30+ yrs of gaming under my belt, in my opinion nothing can compete against the awesome freedom, beauty, storylines, so nicely interwoven in a fabric that immerses you into another realm of existence. ESO, and the Elder Scrolls special also lacks. Biggest function, the ""console"", to debug/recreate/kill or become god mode has virtually dismissed any help required to  finish this masterpiece. To this day i still re-install and get lost for a few months. Only needed a few mods, glowing unread books, where the 24 jewels are to collect and an updated map. Of course high res graphics. To see the stubbles on a warriors chin, the aging marks on his face, snow blowing across a cliff under stars with the aurora borealis, while holding his vampire sweetheart in his arms....yeah, wish i was there. Some Nexus mods are useful but not required. A must have game for your library. Worth every penny."
5124,Ultimate Murderhobo Simulator.
5125,Still better performance than special edition.
5126,Why are you reading this? The game has been out for like forever! Buy it already!
5127,"Love this so much. It brought me into the Elder Scrolls universe, and I can't count how many runs of this game I have done. I will admit I do mod this game. I have played it through unmodded on my first go around, but since modding it I can no longer play it unmodded. I mostly do immersion mods that fill in the gaps. I still love this game."
5128,I love this game amazing to play whenever
5129,"One of the best, most immersive games I've ever played.  Got it year ago, and I keep coming back to it over and over again.  So many different ways of playing--different decisions and character options made can change the experience in unexpected ways.  And it's still just GORGEOUS to look at."

I return to this game once in a while, each time remembering why I loved it in the first place: atmosphere, ridiculously good skills, TES world, and my favorite among everything else – archery. Main quest isn't very interesting tho imo, but the game definitely worth playing."
5157,This game has almost limitless replays for those who dare to venture off the beaten patch (which is almost all of us.) With all of the mods available it becomes even more outstanding and a MUST for those gamers who like to just let go and roam

5180,its a legendary game that should be played by everyone
5181,Its Skyrim sure you've heard of it
5182,"An absolute must-play for RPG fans!  Played it before on the XBox 360 and loved it. Rumor has it that this game served as the inspiration of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, my all-time favorite game!"
5183,"All I have to say is look at the time I've played. Now take into account that I also have played about 800+ hours on my PS4. Oh, I should also mention MODS! If you want thousands of hours of Skyrim you'll need to go through the mods of Skyrim Nexus. 

Pick the mods you like. I stick with quest, item, creature, and other immersion mods. For players that like to have female avatars there are a LOT of mods that will interest you. Not so much for the male avatar players, though. All depends on what you want from you game. Skyrim is one of the best games ever, so have fun."
5184,"very good, sometimes buggy but still good. just remember to save allot"
5185,classic game. love it

5201,"Skyrim - a must play for all gamers. 

What to Expect for Skyrim :
1. Huge open world full of quests (some repetitive) ,but still enjoyable
2. Roleplaying - if you are into it (made special by modding) , you can go on for years just playing Skyrim (I AM SERIOUS!!!!)
3. Exotic landscapes , good combat and levelling up
4. Very realistic surroundings and interactions , good graphics


What not to expect : 
1. Elaborate cut scenes
2. Big and Complex main story line - some optional quests have good short stories though
3. Memorable characters like you will find in Witcher , Warcraft etc.

If you play on and on , Skyrim will become a way of life , an integral part of everyday life rather than a game which you will hurry to kill bosses and complete. 

DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER PLAYED."

5208,"I don't write many reviews, but with this game being released for the 10,000th time I thought I'd hop on and get this in writing in case I die or something:

Skyrim sucks absolute, unadulterated shit. This game should not be played. It is bland, broken, requires more mods than stars in the sky to not be the former (which generally only exacerbates the latter), and was hype at the time only because Oblivion was fun. Please do not purchase this game."

5217,"We all have our passions in life. Since I was born, I've always loved travelling and I've always played videogames.
And so I did. Now that Skyrim it's about to turn 10, I just turned 44 and I've spent my life enjoying this wonderful planet of ours and at the same time I've played a hell of a lot of videogames.
I'm writing this review 10 years late, because these words of mine have been stuck in my mind just few hours after playing Skyrim for the first time. I will never forget the first time I arrived outside the city walls of Whiterun at dusk, the first time I met Cicero, the first time I lost myself in that world... And then the soundtrack, Malukah, all the funny memes, for a moment it seemed like the entire world was playing Skyrim.
But I have to say that the majority of the criticism towards Skyrim is... well let's admit it, the writing is not that good, the combat is floaty and without impact and so on... yes, those are all true. But what is Skyrim for you? What are your passions in life? For me, Skyrim will always be what life should be. The wonder in approaching an unknown place. An endless discovery. An adventure."
5218,"Very immersive game, SO well thought out. You can do whatever you like... Go on the quests, pick flowers, kill dragons... Anything you want!!"

5236,"I mean, it's Skyrim, what else is there to say? I'm not sure how this is only at 170 hours, but I had probably 3x that on my xbox 360 back in the day. I'm still enjoying it all these years later and have never installed a single mod. That's a testament to a good game."
5237,good yes get
5238,To many years
5239,"I mean, it's Skyrim, if you don't know what this game is then you must be living under a rock. Outdated graphics and controls, that much is true, but find the right mods and mindset and it's a game that will always stand by you."

5246,Довакиииииииииин) Так и не прошёл до конца ахха
5247,"Despite me never porperly having finished the game, I love it.
But the reason for not yet having finished is by modding it sooo much, i did too many sidequest before every finishing the main quest :D
But for anyone who likes an open world game with awesome story and the possibility to mod the hell out of a game, thats definately for you.
Love it still to this day and keep replaying it, it never gets too boring for me."
5248,Nice
5249,it gud
5250,"it's skyrim, yes it is getting old. but it's amazing fun, get it when there is a sale and enjoy it all :)"
5251,SKYRIM WAS GREAT YEARS AGO WHEN STANDALONE . NOW IT SUCKS ON STEAM. I SPENT 2 DAYS TRYING TO GET IT TO RUN WITH NO SUCCESS. SCREW STEAM!!!!!!!
5252,it's skyrim

5255,"if not play, play now"
5256,"I'm 8 hours away from hitting the 1600 hours-played mark. The mods keep this game going, and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I highly recommend this game."
5257,Great mighty game!
5258,"Skyrim is a vast beautiful piece of eyecandy, any traveler can enjoy the awesome mountains and evergreen woods of this amazing Nordic realm.
The same cant be said about the population, who have all the charisma of a wet napkin. They constantly moan about their various problems and getting shot in the knee. Try to avoid conversation at all cost, or you will be doubtlessly be conscripted for some mundane task or busywork. 
The accommodation of Skyrim is mostly alright, the inns are acceptable and the food is decent, even if a bit bland.
If you're looking for a great time, be sure to visit Markarth, it's the latest tourist spot for all the true Daedra-worshiping, debauched, cannibalistic psychopaths. (Remember to bring an extra pillow, the beds are horrible)
For your general sightseeing I would recommend Solitude with it's Neo-Imperial architecture and Whiterun with it's fantastic vistas.
Be wary of staying in Riften for extended periods of time, pickpockets abound, and getting the smell of raw sewage out of your clothes is downright nightmare. 

So here's the big question:
Can the weapons be calibrated?
Yes! - Upgrading and Enchanting weapons took up entirely too much of my time during my stay in Skyrim.

Squeal Review Score: 8.5/10
Would recommend!"

5273,"Todd Howard? More like Todd Cowfart...I mean just look at all this mad dollah the beast of a man is juicing from a 10 year old game. We tend to value things like dragons and swords, because our brains go oodiddly doodaa when we slay those flying wizard lizards, and this guy single handedly developed an open world epic adventure with multiple choices of who to kill when your cheese rolls get infested with yo mama deez nuts and other possible curses. Blaming a god for doing gods work? I dunno. Blaming Todd for your own sins? May I laugh. XD. All in all, just shut the fuck up, buy doritos and flush it down your big fat gamer belly with some gamer juice. 
Rise up, Toddlers."

5286,"Great classic openworld game. I remember spending so much time playing this game and enjoying it the whole way through. If you think the look is a bit outdated.. no worries because the amount of mods is insane. Dragons, warriors, assassins, monsters.. its a 10/10 from me."
5287,honestly a pretty pog game
5288,"A revolutionary western RPG in its time, but the gameplay doesn't really hold up.

Even at release it was obvious that the mechanics of Skyrim were mostly unchanged from earlier entries in the series, going at least as far back as Daggerfall. The paint job was good enough to make up for it, but it was all just uninspired and kind of bland.

Today it's hard to play an RPG with a main quest this bad, almost no variety in dungeons or environments, awful writing, repetitive voice acting, stiff animations, plastic facial expressions, etc. Virtually every RPG that has come out since puts it to shame."

5307,"One of the best games, even better with mods!"
5308,"Its a fantastic world to be in, it´s free gameplay and a lot of very good Moods to game also"
5309,"There's nothing to say that hasn't been said already about Skyrim. I much preferred the setting (and scale!) of Morrowind, but the mechanics, quests and so on are much better here."
5310,"Bah negão, que jogo, recomendo pra todos, da pra voar em dragão e os caralho"
5311,"fun, good story

5316,hehe dragons go brrr
5317,"I played for a few days five years ago and then quit because I was bored. Came back to it today to discover that some update in the interim's completely broken it. The game will not accept any keyboard or mouse input because it insists on using my ""Xbox360 game pad"" instead, which is not plugged in, because it does not exist. Had to kill the .exe in task manager to quit. Yes I tried disabling gamepads in the skyrimprefs.ini, that doesn't do anything. In short it's a Bethesda developed product; spend your money on anything else instead."
5318,"Still probably the best game I've had the opportunity to play, It's been out for 10 or so years now and I'm still finding new things to do; alongside mods this game could hold up the test of time."
5319,"Links to the unlisted DLC's in case you don't want to buy Skyrim Ultimate Special Supreme Edition for the umpteenth time.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/ 

Anyways, the game is good just Bethesda is too lazy to update the first Skyrim and would rather make a slightly changed 40$ version instead."
5320,Better than Arena.
5321,great game
5322,It's ok
5323,i accidentally killed a chicken so the automatic response of the guards was to kill me. wth guys
5324,"Do I.....even need to explain why you should get this game? PC is the definitive option to play Skyrim and if what I'm saying holds, the older version is going to be superior to SSE, because of the Anniversary update. Yes, probably not as many mods available, but that's not the point.

Also, if you get into using mods. Get Inigo. Do it. You need that cat in the game."
5325,This game has everything I like in a game.
5326,yes
5327,10 years ago this game came into my life... what a blast :D although it keeps gettin re released this version is best
5328,I liked oblivion better.
5329,Gods be praised!
5330,its skyrim what isnt there to love?
5331,"Unfortunately I have not played this for a long time.  I dont remember the basic movememt skills, lucky for the Internet"

5340,Cmon...
5341,yes
5342,"This game, after so many years, is still the only game I prefer to play. Moreover, the modding community keeps if fresh. I find other Open World RPGs are too limiting. The excellence of Skyrim V is in the ability create a unique character for oneself and to play through the game in almost any way that suits. I prefer to add in lore friendly mods to enhance my gaming, but, others can choose to add mods that suit their roll playing goals, lore friendly or not. Honestly, Bethesda has done such a great job with Skyrim V that not even ESO offers as much. I am wondering how they are going to top this game with their version 6 release. This is an all around great game."
5343,"The game

5344,"The game is very very fun...the story, the feel, the games is just so full...When i say full there is so many things to do and so many ways to play the game, every race and character build such as stealth archer or just axe flailing lunatic or a mage just feels good. There is honestly nothing bad i can say, just give it a go and you will love it."

5363,"Vampire lover? Werewolf Lover? Fight ancient dragons? be a dragonborne? want to use mods for LITTERALLY ANYTHING? want to use magic? a bow? a sword? Want to be evil? want the story to be completely revolve around YOUR choices? then this is DEFINITELY the game for you, There's romance and with some mods even more :P honestly its one of my best purchases ever made. Buy It. Try it. Love it. If not? Refund it. But honestly its one of the best games i've ever played especially considering i have like 300 games in my library for.... pretty much no reason? Yep. Thats it. but hey i guarantee its good, unlike the other 299 i have. ;)"
5364,"Skyrim is simply put one of the greatest masterpieces of all time. Personally I was always more of an Oblivion fan, but there is no denying just how addicting Skyrim can be. The Elder Scrolls as a series is nothing short of sensational, yet when it is all said and done this will be a game people are still play another 10-20 years from now if not even longer."
5365,"Though the game still has irritating bugs, it's very much fun."
5366,It just works
5367,good
5368,I'ts F'n Skyrim
5369,Special edition works works better with mods and have more mods than this version this version is still really good though but has lesser mods and it has worse compatibility with mods
5370,good for forgetting reality
5371,You can play this forever.
5372,one of the best games I've played - returning to it now after several years and being playing off and on for 10 years. Lots to do and with the modding community plenty of things to add to the game.
5373,"On the one hand I recommend this game for several reasons..... Large play field with (to this day) good eye candy, wonderful mods to choose from (no shortage of those), good skill tree even ""out of the box"" compared to most other games, the list goes on.....

The ONE thing I can't stand about this game (and it's really the only thing) is that it really should be called 77 Thousand Stupid Ways to Die. More than once I have stopped playing this game for MONTHS because in this example ""one more time time"".....I'm a twenty-third level character after HOURS of play and five guys show up. I'm running away in LIGHT armor after refusing to pay their ""toll road"" tax and with half or two-thirds of my hit points left, one of them (in heavy armor) catches up to me and ""one-shots"" me dead. HOURS of play.

REALLY???

If you can stomach that and want to WASTE healing potions throughout the ENTIRE game to stay at full health....be my guest. I might play this game again-- maybe in a few months."
5374,"Great Game! Definitely one you need to play at least once, if not more. My only problem with the game is the random bugs and crashes! If those didn't exist, this would be the perfect game in my opinion!"
5375,i have 5 copies of this game
5376,"free world to explore, endless adventures"
5377," Hey, you. You're finally awake."
5378,This is the top RPG.
5379,"This is literally one of, if not the greatest game ever created. I have played time and time again as I have moved from Xbox 360 to Xbox One to PC. NEVER gets old. 10/10."
5380,if you have not heard of skyrim you're not my friend
5381,a staple for every gamer
5382,bad rpg go brrrrrrrrr
5383,is skyrim everyone has it
5384,gud one
5385,"Best game ever.
"
5386,its a good thing they dont have my 4000 hours over 4 different consoles clocked into steam or people would know i have a problem
5387,"Coming back to Old Vanilla Skyrim to feel the same happy feelings i had first playing this back on ps3. Feels good man, if you loved skyrim when it first came out, glitches and all, it still holds up."
5388,skrim
5389,"this is the best RPG game i've ever played, sure nothing playing long time ago , but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, i love everything about it"
5390,"I guess everything there is to say about Skyrim has already been said. Let me just say: I love it. I see the flaws, but I don't dwell on them. It's full of silliness; but it's also full of good sense.

For many people, The Witcher 3 is the high-point of the genre, and it's easy to see why. Compared to TW3, Skyrim looks rough, even amateurish: the writing, the character development, the story, the graphics and the emotional depth at which it engages you are nowhere near that level. 

Yet I maintain Skyrim is the better game. It works *as a game* in a way TW3 never quite does. For all its meme-able silliness, Skyrim is more fun to play and replay. Fun isn't something complicated. It's charging into ancient crypts and smashing skeletons against the walls with a war-hammer; it's sneaking into bandit hideouts dagger in hand and taking out the unsuspecting chief; it's bashing a dragon in the face with a shield, finishing him off, then eating his soul for breakfast. 

Skyrim might not offer much in the way of sophistication. But that was never the Nord way anyway. What it does offer is fun, and lots of it, on tap."

Amazing game I'd thoroughly recommend it even know"
5402,God tier game. It's THAT famous for a reason.
5403," gREATEST SINGLE PLAYER GAME I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF PLAYER IN MY 65 PLUS YEARS  OF USING A COMPUTER FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN WORK.  1217 HOURS  SHOULD SPEAK FOR ITSELF.  i GREATLY APPREACIATE THE SUPPORT BY STAFF,  THE NUMEROUS RESOURCE INFO MADE AVAILABLE AT THE CLICK OF A KEY.   WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE AVERAGE PERSON PLAYS THIS GAME.  JUST CURIOUS AND GLAD MY WFE IS PATIENT AND SUPPORTIVE (SHE CAN WATCH ALL THE COOKING SHOWS SHE WANTS TO.  PLAYER WOW UNTIL IT GOT TO PRICEY AND I STARTED GETTING TOO SLOW TO KEEP UP WITH THE KIDS, GRANDKIDS, AND GREAT GRANDKIDS.  THANKS FOR GIVING ME A GAME I ENJOY SINCE I HAVE BEEN RETIRED FOR 20  YEARS.  LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT  RELEASE FOR PC."

5408,'skyrim is a terrible game' - nobody ever in the history of time
5409,its decent
5410,It's Skyrim...well duh you should buy it!
5411,"You know, after you figure out that the game is unplayable unless you switch your 144hz monitor to 60hz- it can start to become pretty pleasant."
5412,"[h1]TL;DR: RPG fans, what are you waiting for?[/h1]

Look at how many hours I've played.
I played hundreds more on my brother's account.
...And there are STILL quests, locations, and NPCs I've never experienced before.

This game came out 11 years ago. It's dated by today's standards. The graphics USED TO BE impressive. It has plenty of Bethesda™ Bugs. However, the modding community is insanely prolific and there's bug fixes, HD texture packs, and entire quest lines out there created by players and free for you to use. Most of the mods I use only make mild tweaks to the game and I still enjoy the hell out of it!

8/8 Divines, would (and will) play again."
5413,Just a classic. Nuff said
5414,Never should have come here...
5415,Great

5423,"Very Good game played it in PS 3 when i was young on novice difficult without expansion. Bought again on steam with all DLCs and really enjoyed it .Especially with great mod support by workshop and nexus.Only complain is vampire on legendary are way to difficult and end up always killing half of Riverwood and Whiterun. The frequency of attack seems way to high.

5424,It's skyrim
5425,Top games of all time right here
5426,good

5429,too many pandas
5430,"Mod it! Base game is ~ok~, but MOD IT!!! Music I awesome!"
5431,Whats not to like? Its Skyrim. Its open world and epic and can be revisited. My only sadness is this is not the special edition.

5435,I used to play Skyrim. But then I took an arrow to my knee
5436,Virtual Cocaine
5437,lol
5438,"I love the open world, the vast options available to follow whatever kind of character you want to make. its classic in its time and a staple for rpg gaming. The world is enormous, and you can literally play forever without progressing in the main quest if you don't want to, there are so many side quests you can do, guilds to join- over-all, even with any and all bugs (thx Bethesda) its still a fantastic game."
5439,"It just works! 
A masterpiece of a game from back 10 years ago when it's immense open worldliness will keep you engaged for hours to steal that Troll Thumb so you can make that nice potion that makes you create that nice potion, that makes you create that nice potion that makes you create that nice potion....
"
5440,"this is an amazing game that still has play value a decade and more after its release - it gets a thumb's down for the very reason that it has such play value:  mods.  the very thing that allows the player to customize play experience is the vulnerability of the game's operating system.  once you make any change other than one mod at a time, you'll spend days turning mods on and off the determine which mod is giving you the dreaded CTD.  play at your own risk."
5441,nice
5442,BEST
5443,It's Skyrim.
5444,"9.999/10. Possibly my favourite game of all time, and the only reason why it's missing the 0.001 is due to the fact that I find myself comparing other games to it, and it is hard to live up to the new standards."

It was my first ""real"" game, as in, a game I wanted for myself that had nothing to do with the kinds of games my older brother was playing. It got me into RPGs and is the first game I've modded. There's something magical about Skyrim. I wish I could give myself amnesia just so I can experience it again for the first time."

5486,I've been playing this game for about 5 years now on and off and it always feels like a brand new game every time. You can do pretty much anything imaginable and there is so many side stories and open world to do whatever you want. The scenery is still breathtaking to this day and the story is intriguing. I highly recommend anyone to play this game.
5487,"Honestly, I've been playing this game my whole life. From 2011 till the current game(Probably busy installing mods). It's been an amazing ride and I would highly recommend this game! Tod...you once again charmed me to buy this game <3"

5498,this game has carried me through a lot of pain and sorrow. makes me very happy. cat person go brrr.
5499,DONT DO IT.
5500,it's aight
5501,its the rim of sky whats not to love
5502,hatalarla dolu leş oyun
5503,It's Skyrim
5504,"good game
"
5505,it skyrim so yeah
5506,"It's Skyrim dude, if you don't know..."
5507,it is okay
5508,good game
5509,THE BEST
5510,"Very good, had a lot of fun with this and it easily met and surpassed my expectations. Although, my experience has been heavily influenced by mods since day 1 and I have so many mods installed that I'm not sure I can speak for the quality of the base game lol. Either way I had a great time."
5511,fus-ro-download this fucking game if you haven't already
5512,the greatest
5513,e
5514,Highly addictive at the time but didn't age well at all.
5515,Skyrim/10
5516,this game is totally addicting. I have modded with extra locations and maps. 800+ hours in game and I still want to play all day long.
5517,I refuse to take simple path when I can climb rocks
5518,"I've only played a few hours, but so far so good!"
5519,if you like killing elves and taking their clothes this is the game for you
5520,Far more user friendly than Morrowind. Kids these days have no clue about the struggle!
5521," You can steal a wooden spoon. OP by Helgen. Seriously, this is the best open world RPG's since Oblivion and Kingdoms of Alamur in my humble opinion. The amount of content is staggering, and if that isn't enough, there are STILL no less than stellar Skyrim fans creating quality of life mods and additions to every aspect of the game. I usually avoid mods, as I like to enjoy my games as the developers intended. At least the first playthrough. Skyrim is a different beast somehow. These mods only add more items, content, fixes to an already incredible game and they don't take away from the original aspect and beauty at all. Skyrim started the whole ""If you can see it, you can explore it"" standard, and that is something we all can appreciate. Especially us OCD players that scour every corner to every mountain. Thrice. Look through the community posts and you can find the link to the original Skyrim, because the Special Edition is too expensive for a decade old game (no matter how good it may be) and seems to introduce more issues than it fixes judging by reviews and comments. The original version holds up better on it's own...it's that good."
5522,They just made Special Edition obsolete with the release of Legendary Edition but it's just an update to the original Skyrim? So why make Special Edition in the first place?  ( $$$? )
5523,No subtitles for one of the largest gamer communities in the world.
5524,https://twitter.com/BethesdaBrasil/status/1450141372296617989
5525,nice
5526,a true masterpiece innit
5527,argonian maid boobies
5528,amazing
5529,afdg
5530,Nice game :)
5531,game good yes
5532,"I've played for a little bit, def recommend. Not a masterpiece but enjoyable and fun to mess around in. Plenty of ways to play the game and almost ten years on I still find new things."
5533,e
5534,"Just buy it, you won't regret it! If you have VR, get that version instead."
5535,its awesome
5536,idk seems kinda chill
5537,"You can play the quests or chase butterflies, did you find the ants? Making potions, dragons, characters everywhere. Explore and you can find stories and clues about all sorts of things. Giants are hard to kill. 
Magic s useful, Stay sharp with frost magic, it can kill. Beware loading screens."
5538,Skyrim's biggest boon is how many mods there are for it. Its like you can change the game to suit your style of play.
5539,The game is enough to playing alone or with friends (mods) and laugh from time to time. It is really enjoyable.
5540,bark bark!
5541,One of the true classics of RPGs.
5542,Its one of best games ive ever played
5543,wen juego
5544,U There Come HERE
5545,"Pretty cool game, needs anime mods tho."
5546,Owners of 2011 Edition unite!
5547,"Skyrim is a masterpiece. Everyone should try it out at least once in their life. Immersive and fun gameplay, overall wonderful game"
5548,FUN
5549, .
5550,This game never gets old.
5551,"Skyrim is a timeless classic, everyone should have played it at least once"
5552,mooooooooooooooooo
5553,Good
5554,"One of the best, if not THE best adventure game out there. Full flexibility with customizing your character, a great main storyline, and a lot of sidequests and other ways to explore the map. Also a very extensive (and not too complicated) skill and crafting system."
5555,"Game good
"
5556,Yes
5557,"Cart glitched 15 times but worked the 16th time

but game good"
5558,"I call Skyrim Home. What will it bring you, i do not know. Happiness? Sadness? Either way if you play this specific version of Skyrim your a Legend! Epic Journeys, and memorable adventures await you my dear player ;)."
5559,It's everything you thought it would be (& probably more).
5560,"You already know what this game is, while buggy it is still an OG and holds a special place in my heart. Maybe get a graphics enhancer before you play it in 2021 but still a solid game."
5561,It's good.
5562,skyrim
5563,It is very good
5564,fun game
5565,Loved it
5566,It may be buggy and whatnot but you know what? The gameplay outrules all of the bad parts about it and there's so much to do
5567,"Not the best game ever, but an amazing game to toy with and immerse myself in nonetheless
"
5568,it's ok
5569,"This game is very good, good good it is."
5570,"sick game
"
5571,good
5572,keep coming back to this game year after year.
5573,"It might be a ten year old game but it is still amazing and the graphics are very good! I can run on older PC's and if you have net issues you can play offline. 
You can change your tactics and go down many different paths. You can custom mod the game to your liking. 
"
5574,"Modding aside, I always enjoyed this game completely vanilla. The story is easy to follow, side quests are fun, and some stupid voicelines make it better; like Jenassa asking ""Why the hurry?"" when I'm robbing the house of a guy who's key I just pickpocketed.

Though I only have 16 hours on pc, I've easily played at least 400 hours on ps4. As a mainly fps-player, Skyrim is one of the few singleplayer games that I thoroughly enjoy. There's always something to do- whether it be completing side quests, modding the game, etc."
5575,its a pretty fun single player experience so if your bored and you want something to play this game has what your looking for
5576,Good game.
5577,it's still fun.  Nothing quite like it.  Haven't you all played this by now....why are you reading my worthless review?
5578,A magnificent work of art. One of the rare story-based games I've actually finished. It is highly recommended to buy the legendary version rather than the special edition if you want value for money.

5612,wonderful game. cant wait for 6
5613,Good game and really fun with wide variety of mods
5614,There is a reason that people are still playing and modding Skyrim ten years and a thousand versions later.
5615,It is good game
5616,cool gam
5617,everythiong
5618,I could play this forever
5619,Awesome game
5620,"incredible
"
5621,I'd only recommend buying this version of Skyrim if you need access to some of the legacy mods that haven't been ported to Special Edition yet.
5622,tis fun.
5623,good
5624,"one of the best rpgs you can play hands down bar none
"
5625,soothing to the soul and makes you feel special
5626,"Praise talos, death to the thalmor"
5627,beautifully immersive open world rpg. one of the best games of all time.
5628,i spent a lot of time years ago playing this game. i love it still to this day. it helped back when i used to have a big masterbating problem. now i dont masterbate as much but still do on a daily basis.
5629,"An awesome open world experience filled with a great story line, and endless side quests that keep you captivated as you traverse hostile waist lands and dragon filled mountain peaks. Fantastic scenery and easy game play makes this RPG one of my favourites . . . . . A must for the adventure type player that enjoys magic and mystery, friends and foes, and easy character advancement with a realistic feel in combat . . . . . . Become a werewolf, a husband, a wive, a mother or father . . . . . The hero of the legends . . . . . . A Dragonborn . . . ."
5630,bruh its awesome i love it and if u dont love it u r commiting a crime.

5636,another awesome bethesda game
5637,"425 hours in, played it to different endings different ways (all steam cheevz). Then mod it till it breaks and back it off a hair and play it again (and again). Vortex mods are nearly endless and some add lot content."
5638,"This is an oldie, but a goodie.  And since the next game is coming out, it's pretty fun to revisit Skyrim after downloading a bajillion mods.  I'm not saying Thomas the tank engine may attack you, I'm just saying you can ride away on a giant hamster when things get hairy."

Played on PS3 / PS4 / PC

Bethesda my great love i love the games from bethesda
Most love Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Rage

FO4, FO76, TES (Legendary edition, Special Edition), Over 1000 hours ^^ (PC, PS3, PS4,)

Skyrim is just awesome. The game tells an incredibly captivating story and also offers a lot to explore and some exciting side quests, so it never gets boring. The graphics are inherently nice considering that the game is a bit older. If the graphics are not enough for you, practically all doors are open thanks to the multitude of available mods. With the right mods, Skyrim can graphically keep up with current titles.
Character creation offers a ton of options, so almost every character is somehow unique. The characters that can be found in the game are also very varied and lovingly designed.
The game world ""Skyrim"" is gigantic and very lively. Often you meet wandering NPCs on the way or unintentionally get into an event. In addition, the game world is very detailed and equipped with a wide variety of terrains. There are also tons of optional tombs, forts, and the like to explore. Completing Skyrim one hundred percent seems almost impossible to me.
The available DLCs are also extremely worthwhile. All of them are very successful and offer even more new things to explore and sometimes tell other good stories.
Skyrim has me personally completely under its spell and I love to play it then as now. Sometimes you can just ""go for a walk"" in a strange world and enjoy the beautiful impressions and views. 

Per:
-Good story and above all a long story and nice side quests
-Graphic is out of date but still very nice (with mods it gets even better)
-Always replayable
-Many Mods Non Nude and a lot of Sex Mods
-The atmostphare is great, the npc are not unnecessary and have an effect on situations
-Later updates Added an in-game mod menu of its own
-Super DLC's

Cons:
-If there are too many mods or script mods, the game becomes a bit unstable
-Small bugs that are mostly funny but NPC bugs

Conclusion:
I recommend it to everyone who is into knight and medieval games
It is a lot of fun to explore and random encounter can take you away and keep you busy in a different way"
5647,is good
5648,"stands up to the test of time.
"
5649,FUS RO DAH
5650,Even after 10 years still my favourite game ever made
5651,comfort game
5652,I mean hack slash is relax and the story line is dope. That's all I got.
5653,"highly recommend this game if you haven't played TES : V what are you doing, game is amazing, has enough lore to keep you busy and entertained for years, every play through will be different because you will be drawn by meeting new people and new quest lines, wtf are you doing."
5654,i love the story arc and adventures it offers but be careful of the vampire virus
5655,"There's a lot I could say about Skyrim, but I'll try and keep it short. I first played Skyrim on the Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and now on PC. This is the ONLY game I've bought this many times and that's because I love this game so much. I play this game again every year, not only because of love and nostalgia, but because I keep finding new things to explore. Good luck adventuring! :D"
5656,"Stealth Archer OP, 10/10"
5657,holy fuck YES.
5658,MASTERPIECE
5659,YAAAAAAAY
5660,"A great game when it came out; you'd think that all of the bugs that have existed in the game since its release might be ironed out by now, but you'd be thinking wrong."
5661,"I am a Dovakin. The last dragonborn. The only one to whom the Yarls of all cities can turn in the matter of a dragon that threatens them.

I am a born assassin. Just ask me and I will fight my way through hundreds of bandits to finish off their leader. I will kill the emperor himself for a good reward.

I'm an excellent thief. Are you interested in the diamond ring that the Earl's wife never takes off? I'll bring it to you.

I'm the perfect mercenary. I can do anything. I'll crawl up any arse in the world for an ancient tablet.

Even the gods and Daedra trust me with important matters. They know I'll do anything to stop that damned task badge from washing my eyes.

I only have one flaw. If you ask me to do something, I'll do it, don't doubt it. But when it will happen, not even Hermeus Mora knows."
5662,s good
5663,i like it
5664,All around still relevant and awesome game......
5665,great rp game
5666,Fantastic game ! It's the first time I'm playing it (in 2021) and I'm really impressed !
5667,"I am now replaying the open-world rpg game with newfound joy. Love the hearthfire expansion with the ability to build homesteads and raise my own family, getting married and adopting children. Hours of awesome joy from a game which is a decade old. :)"
5668,"Alot of fun,  but heavily modded is how i play"
5669,old reliable
5670,Literally the Best Game ever
5671,great music
5672,yeah it's pretty good. 10/10 would buy again.
5673,its awsome.
5674,Not much else to say other than it is sky rim.
5675,The power should belong to the Khajiits.
5676,Great game Great graphics Beautiful open world Fun story line and side quests
5677,Still good. A classic.
5678,Great open world to explore
5679,fuck you todd i still bought it in 2021
5680,best game ever
5681,What is the music of life?
5682,"0/10 Too much fun things to do. I keep getting distracted.

Edit: I no longer have a reason to go outside."
5683,Pls stop todd howard
5684,It's fun everyone already knows
5685,I just so happened to notice that I've played this game for 69 hours as of writing this. Nice.
5686,"After many years of playing this game, I finally decided to write a review. 

If you need something to keep you preoccupied while also completing little side quests that are useless to evolution of the main story, then this is the game for you! :)"
5687,"Something of the charm was lost, from Morrowind to Oblivion, and then from Oblivion to Skyrim. 

I have always complained about how much bleaker the world of Skyrim is. It's beautiful, but bleak. I don't want to be there. I would rather be in Tamriel. 

But as the years go by, this was the last game that I was ""in"". So that's saying something. Great game."
5688,good
5689,penis
5690,"My favourite game ever made of all time! Played continuously for about 10 years now. Absolutely incredible and still find new nuances to the game and the whole lore of the Elder Scrolls in general every time I play it. Impossible to ever get bored of, and I love making new files to approach the game from different ""angles"" and skill priorities, etc. HIGHLY recommend"
5691,best game ever
5692,Why i didnt play this Game Before ! its Amazing
5693,One of the best RPG's i have played! Definitely worth a look!
5694,"With an wonderful world full of dragons, bandits, cities, keeps and talking cats that are most definitely not telling a lie and have absolutely been inside a soul crystal before you can chose who you want to be as the Dragon-born and wield magic to defeat mighty foes or use large swords to cleave at dragons or use bows to kill with precision, you decide what you are on this adventure in the land of Skyrim, would recommend

- yours truly, HueGho"
5695,"Game is fun, if not a stripped down version of it's predecessors. However I can't recommend this buggy mess of a game. You would imagine that 10 years on, they would be able to fix the corrupt save-file, crash to desktop errors that completely ruins your playthrough. But to quote the immortal Todd Howard: ""It just works!"""
5696,Upset I can't play it on a toaster.
5697,hours and hours of modding only to see Thomas the tank engine in my nightmares
5698,its good
5699,it just works-Todd Howard
5700,"I've bought is on so many platforms it's not even funny
"
5701,dragon boobs
5702,"I'ts friggin Skyrim, bruh! If you're a gamer, and you haven't played it, what are ya doin? Go play it!"
5703,There's not enough hours in my day to play this.
5704,Good Beans!
5705,"I don't have much of a memory so even after almost 5000 hours of play, it's still fun."
5706,it is one of the best games know to human kind
5707,I enjoy this type of formatted game.
5708,"The game is great, don't get me wrong. However, this version of the game does not have any of the DLCS. I actually bought the legendary edition in physical form (as a CD in July, 2017) from a shop, but it was removed from steam shortly before that. So I don't have the expansions or the other benefits of this edition. Because of this decision by steam, I will probably have to buy the special edition in the future to own the complete game with all the expansions, which is a shame."
5709,"Yes - it's simple... Mod the ever loving f$%@ out of it, and enjoy; of course do it as right as you can. This game holds it's value, and playability due to mods at it's age. Again - mod, and enjoy. Simple. The game for it's time is good, but mods make it oh so much better. Take it from me - I've been modding Skyrim (LE) for the last 9 years roughly (still am time-to-time), and I'll never play without them again. Mods are a must to fix, and improve the game. Just a heads up. Modding Skyrim LE, and SSE are oddly different. I got LE looking rather amazing for a game released back in 2011. Now I tried to do the same thing with SSE on several different occasions, and could not get the same exacting results I've come to love in Legendary Edition. When the switch from 32bit to 64bit happened the way mods work changed quite a bit as well. Just keep that in mind. I personally feel LE has the most solid, and easy to install (user friendly) mods once you get everything figured out. Until I give SSE more time, and figure the modding out more (which I might do again here soon out of needing something to keep my mind busy) - LE is my pick. It sucks that people can't purchase it on Steam anymore. Thankfully I own The Elder Scrolls Anthology, and can reinstall Skyrim LE whenever I need to. I rambled enough."

5752,"This was my 1st play of any Elder Scrolls game and to be honest it's not bad, the stories are a bit simple and the characters a bit dull, the voice acting is terrible but the sheer number of things and scope of the world they've put together is amazing.

The literal hundreds of hours I poured into the game was actually adjusting it, being able to actively change every aspect of it to suit you was a real game saver, just a shame the game couldn't be more polished it would've been a time saver."

5761,Its skyrim cmon cant tell u more about the game ... its just the BEST game ever.
5762,"I like Skyrim though its not aged as well as Morrawind and oblivion , these games have character and you can fix the potato graphics with mods if you desire.  Skyrim is good and i will always come back to it for the odd play through but like most modern games they are dummed down for the mythical wider player base and with that become a little hollow.  
one thing i have noticed on these modern Bethester games is all objects in game seem like they have been painted with a coat of gloss or something, everything shines and reflect too much light,  MATT is OK you know lol , small thing i know but all the new games have this now and its kinda strange , enchanted items is ok.

i know by now everyone has a copy of this game it will probably be issued with your birth certificate when your born, so sayeth TOD ,   PRAISE BE TO TOD ! 

will we ever see these kinds of games again...... probably not for many reasons so enjoy the nostalgia and enjoy these games.

some random stuff , thanks for reading"
5763,yeeeeeee
5764,Yes.
5765,"Great game, spent hundreds of hours playing it on my school years(I played around another 100-300 hours not counting the one I have listed on my steam profile).

I just wish that Bethesda doesn't delist the DLCs for Oldrim in Steam, I can't complete my Oldrim DLCs collection now... and lots of mods that are up-to-date currently only support a full DLCs for Oldrim.

Sadge."
5766,"In this game you got to save Cj from grove street for you to be respected in the hood again

5782,Best Game Ever
5783,The storyline and world of Skyrim is gorgeous. I love the NPCS and the overall mechanics of the game. Married Scouts-Many-Marshes on my first save and I'm absolutely smitten. Already considering to be one of my favorite games.
5784,Good
5785,good game
5786,If you haven't played it what are you doing?
5787,Great game loads of quest and a great story line.
5788,FUN AND ENJOYABLE
5789,very good
5790,"This Game is the best game ever
"
5791,The game is buggy with degenerate gameplay but I am totally addicted. Good work Bethesda.
5792,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there."
5793,Great game. Tons of mods to play as you want. Highly recommend
5794,Good game
5795,Great game. Really makes you feel like Skyrim!
5796,"It's got so many bugs,...
... many plot holes in some quest line, ... so many unreasonable game crashes/errors
... boring melee combat mechanics, ...lack interesting magic spells, ...No character development
... so many dumb NPCs [spoiler](Delphine and Esbern being brainless duo, Astrid being daft, Savos Aren is idiot, and Thalmors/Nords being racist)[/spoiler]

.. But still,[b] It just works[/b]
Though not a perfect game, It's fun... It's so meme...
So fun to role-play in this game...
Not to mention, this game communities is impressive, so many mods to choose from to improve your game (Whether to fix vanilla's bug; Improve quest/game mechanics/graphics; Improve/change NPCs to satisfy your fetish or desire )
[b]Highly recommended !! One of the best game I ever played !![/b]
"
5797,"""If you don't know it by now...""  This game is 10 years old and, with new mods every week and thousands of mods on the Nexus, still fresh and enjoyable.  Replayability is limited only by your imagination.  ""When this old world starts gettin' you down..."" go up on the roof in Skyrim.   it's a fine place to go."
5798,"Great game, story and game play are really good. Can play this for hours and loose track of time. Very immersive game."
5799,"I broke it with too many mods, 5/5, would mod again"
5800,Good
5801,"Honestly, fuck this game."
5802,yes
5803,"always come back to it
love this game"
5804,"It has been ported to every system and resold multiple times by Bethesda for a reason....It is a solid RPG that literally let's you go almost everywhere on the game map.

Multiple towns, builds, npcs and quests to keep you busy for hours.....and that's even before you hit the main quest.

Then when yer done, once you think you played almost all you can and done almost everything there is, you install mods and it changes the game completely (Especially alternate start), flushes it out, adds more companions, more lands to explore, dungeons and in some of them, completely changes the game itself.

It is worth a try and often on sale."
5805,If you like modding a game into oblivion (full pun intended) then this is a good one for you. Very easy to mod lots of freedom. However be careful your modding doesn't get too out of hand.
5806,Nice hair
5807,Gotta get this back to Overwhelmingly Positive.
5808,"Great game, but you have to download it every time you have to reinstall, be it new computer, new windows or computer crash and burn. Total waste of time and data. Gaming was tons easier when you put in a disk and install, WITHOUT the bloody internet."
5809,S'fine. Mod it cause its old and it shows.
5810,classic
5811,"Literally the best game ever. I have been playing this game since it came out and honestly I can't stop, even now. I enjoy this game a lot and yeah it might be old but you should try it out! Or Todd Howard will find you."
5812,"No matter how old it gets or how many times you play through the game, there are so many mods you can get that completely change your play style or add entirely new storylines, which kinda gives skyrim endless replay value."
5813,good game
5814,It's Skyrim.  I don't need to say anything else
5815,Wish the dragon had nudity.
5816,"Does this game even need new recommendations? If you haven't played it, play it."
5817,"When they sell the same damn game for ten years, you know its good."
5818,Its good. Legendary campaign.
5819,never fully got into it
5820,Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. AMAZING if you consider it's a 2011 game. Consider buying it.
5821,Old but Gold

5830,"If you aren't a follower of the Elder Scrolls series, I'll simply say this:  Skyrim is a fun, awesome game and you will probably love it.  It may even get you hooked on the Elder Scrolls franchise and have you delving into its past installments.
If you are a follower of the Elder Scrolls series and you haven't gotten around to trying Skyrim, I highly recommend it.  There are some problems with it, yes, but very small problems - mostly to do with incredibly minor lore issues and a few playstyle restrictions in some of the storylines.  But overall, it is the pinnacle of its genre and the best-feeling Elder Scrolls game to date.  I started on Oblivion, so there were certain things about Skyrim that felt like downgrades and certain things that definitely felt like upgrades.  For example, spellcasting.  You have to equip a spell to one or both hands, whereas in previous Elder Scrolls games you could use spells while holding a weapon and a shield,  It's all little things like that - you will notice these little things and at first you may be worried that Skyrim won't be as good as others in the series, but in time it becomes clear that the experience as a whole isn't better or worse, only different.  Much like there are differences between Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, but they are all enjoyable and have the same general format.  If you love the Elder Scrolls games, you simply have to try Skyrim.  You may find one or two small things you don't like, but I'd be willing to bet it won't stop you from loving the game."
5831,Greatest games of all time! Must buy!
5832,"What's not to love?  The gameplay is smooth, combat isn't overly clunky, endless modding options through the Nexus, and there is, of course the lore.  This game was so beautiful at release!  I have never been disappointed by this chapter in the history of Tamriel!"
5833,Too much police brutality. 0/10
5834,"""I don't know how to write reviews"""
5835,Is very good
5836,
5837,Excellent game!
5838,"I loved how free you are in this game. It's like living in a different world where you are free to do as you like with magic and weapons. The story was very immersive as well on how you try to figure out the story for your own. As someone that's playing this game for the first time, not knowing what to expect, this game has been a pleasure."
5839,its skyrim speaks for itself
5840,Really fun. Even better when you figure out the console commands.
5841,"mods, lots and lots of mods

5844,BUY IT NOW YES
5845,Pretty pog
5846,Great game still to this day
5847,Timeless classic
5848,"One of the best games I've ever played in my life including TES:Oblivion. Great storyline, NPCs, Weapons. The only thing is that it has a lot of bugs in some quests and that drives me nuts 'cause I have to use the command console. Skyrim with all the expansions introduced me to a perfect RPG world with vampires,werewolfs etc etc and you can choose whatever you want to be."
5849,"2 second load times, 4K looks pretty good...this game is still incredible in 2021!"

5854,It's Skyrim.
5855,With 531 hours of gameplay I´ve just realized I havent written a review about the game.
5856,"This game holds such a special place in my heart. The soundtrack, the gameplay, the way my entire soul gets wrapped into the storyline and the lives of the characters makes this game a lifetime favorite. Yes, of course there are bugs and honestly it's one of the perks of this game. The mods in conjunction with the DLC brings so much more life and playability to your overall experience. 11/10"
5857,kerchow
5858,"Let's be honest, you've played Skyrim. If you haven't, you know enough about the game that you've basically played it and don't want to buy it from the 12th time because Bethesda is being slow about releasing it or you don't want to wait top buy a Xbox.
It's Skyrim, its better modded. Its fun."
5859,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Need I say more? Has been rated one of the best games ever, and I must say that you can't call yourself a true gamer until playing this.
10 years now and still unbeaten, sure it takes a long time to complete, but every sweet minute of it is well worth your time."
5860,"this is the best game i've ever played, sure its buggy, but holy shit, i love everything about it"
5861,"Great game, so many hours of content"
5862,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is probably the most famous open-world RPG, and one of the most popular and well-received games of all time. It has seen numerous re-releases for different platforms and a remaster, but this one here is the first Skyrim. Unless mods or Creation Club contents are installed, there's no difference in content between any versions of Skyrim. Graphics may be better in some versions, and some minor bugs may be fixed, but there's really not much difference from one version to the other. Like the title, the game is set in the province of Skyrim, a cold, mountainous region mostly inhabited by Nords.

In Skyrim, you play as the Last Dragonborn, a powerful individual who can absorb dragon souls and destined to stop Alduin, the harbinger of apocalypse. Those dragon souls you absorb provide you with the new ability to Shout. Each Shout requires a dragon soul to unlock. There are many variations of Shouts, and some have different functions, like slowing down time, throwing enemies, etc. The rest of the gameplay is greatly similar to previous TES games, and by extension, the Fallout games as well. You can choose your character's race, have many weapons, outfits, and learn magic spells, allowing you to be whatever kind of character you want them to be.

While the main story for Skyrim is cool, you should also play through the faction questlines. There's the warrior-like Companions, mages of Winterhold, assassins of Dark Brotherhood, a Thieves Guild, and the Civil War questline. Each of them has unique questlines that will greatly extend your playtime, so do them even though you do not need them to finish the main story. I recommend doing them early to make the game feel more ""realistic"" since you start as a nobody, while also gaining skills and gear for later on. However, I must say I'm not a big fan of the Civil War quests as they are repetitive and kinda boring, no matter for the Stormcloaks or Imperials.

There are plenty other sidequests not associated with factions, so do them as well. An interesting type of sidequest are the Daedric sidequests, where you do tasks for a Daedric Prince (basically some kind of god) to get good-looking and powerful items. Due to the nature of the Daedra some of these quests can be cruel, however there's an achievement for collecting all their items.

Skyrim is an amazing and beautiful open-world game, it still looks good even a decade later. However, it is not perfect. The game is famously known to have many bugs. But worry not, some of them can be hard to trigger, and if you get one you can use the tilde (~) key to open console and type in commands to resolve it. Bugs aside, many of the sidequests are boring ""fetch quests"", where your task is simply ""go here, get item/kill enemy, go back for reward"". TES IV: Oblivion has better quests in my opinion.

My personal problem with this version of Skyrim is the fact that the publisher chose to unlist the game and all DLCs, making  it hard to find and never be on sale again, making the complete game very, very expensive. Which is a shame, because people with not enough money to buy or run the Special Edition would turn to piracy or third-party key sellers to get this version. Bethesda, please make this game easily available again. 

If you're a fan of Elder Scrolls and/or Fallout, Skyrim is a must-play since the gameplay mechanics are mostly similar. If you're an open-world/RPG/fantasy game fan, you would love Skyrim, and by extension all TES games. Despite being the most recent main TES game, I think Skyrim is a great entry to the franchise as it introduces many of the gameplay elements in a simple way, compared to the more complex Oblivion and Morrowind."
5863,Spent 400 hours modding the game
5864,This game is so engrossing that I actually feel cold when I venture into the mountains.
5865,people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like
5866,its alright
5867,There are millions of things to do in skyrim. You can progress as slow or fast as you want! Quests have different outcomes depending on what you choose!

5906,"This game was the first big, single-player story game I ever did. To this day no game has ever beaten it for me. The stories and characters are great. The glitches are pure and normally hilarious. Not to also mention mods are feel nearly infinite expanding the game even more. I've played Skyrim on nearly every platform I own. And on all of them it still feels great. If I could play the first time again I would take it in a heartbeat."
5907,"All round exceptional game with so much replay value to it.  Great challenges, gorgeous graphics and a great story.  Side quests give a lot of options to extend the game play.
Well worth purchasing, even years after release!"
5908,"It's Skyrim. You probably own it. You've probably played it before. I mean, it's Skyrim. It's shitty in the best ways, and could be so much better, but it isn't. You know if it's for you or not."

5910,IT IS SKYRIM! MUISC<ACTION<SINGING<ADVENTURE<DRAGONS<CHEESE!<AND MUCH MORE.
5911,"This is an enthralling single player game, with tons of quests and npc stories.  Different races or genders do not change the quests, but they change the behavior of the npc's you interact with, giving you a different feel to the game. Los of mods available to change the environment, appearance of npc's, to add interesting followers, and even add more quests."
5912,Gorgeous. A game I will always remember

5926,this game is a open world insane
5927,This is the best game that has ever been made. Period.
5928,"How do you not recommend Skyrim, I'm a cynic and a skeptic and for all my complaints you should totally play Skyrim."
5929,"To this day I hold Skyrim as the greatest game of all time. Nothing has surpassed the quality of the stories, the mechanics, and the atmosphere. This game is so large that after years of replaying it on different systems with different mods, I have probably still missed something. There are an incredible amount of stories that are captivating and mechanics around them that keep them interesting and keep rewarding you. One of my favorite things are unique items, and finding them through quests that you discover. The DLCs are incredible, with the vampire one being my favorite. The transformations are amazing and so fun to discover, and the shouts are also super fun and interesting. Overall this game has exceeded every expectation that I have had for it, and it is a true masterpiece."
5930,A good game even after a decade
5931,"Broke my leg a few months back, and a friend texted me the steam code for this game since she figured I was going stir-crazy, and she was right!  I've had this game for just under a month and I've already put over 100 hours on it, and I'm pretty sure I'm not even halfway through the main plotline yet!  I just can't believe I never got around to playing this sooner!"
5932,"So, I have 100% this game for some reason."
5933,"Skyrim (or now as it's called ""Oldrim"") is almost 10 years old. Of course, most people have moved on to SSE -- an upgrade to the this 32-bit version. I still like going back to it though. It reminds me when I first stumbled upon it about a year after it came out. As many others have said: ""it's one of the greatest RPGs of all time""."
5934,ive never enjoyed a more objectively mediocre game more than this.  damn you todd
5935,It's good and fun especially with Mods.
5936,skrym
5937,"Wonderful game, everyone deserves a few hundred hours in their lives."
5938,"The game is absolutely outstanding! The graphics are amazing and spectacular. I love the interactions with characters in the game, but i still do feel that there should be a greater variety of communication between the townspeople and the dragonborn. The quest lines are great and definitely interesting to the point where you're just absolutely hooked! The combat, weapons, and armor are astounding and amazingly magnificent, great work on the entire game.I've had an amazing experience playing the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and I still am. I would definitely suggest anyone to play this game, for it is so good. It keeps me on the edge with the multiple challenges you have to face, and sometimes i just want to step into the game, which would be a dream come true.I am in love with the game, and i am proud to say that so far it is probably one of my favorite games I've played yet."
5939,The game speaks for itself
5940,"Skyrim is the turning point for open world, RPG fantasy games. The amount of game here is astounding. You will not regret playing this."
5941,"fav game, mod it for better experience"
5942,"I'm the asshole who keeps buying this game every time Bethesda releases it, making it seem like players want this instead of ES6. Sorry fellas."
5943,The best game to ever come out.
5944,I spend 1.600 hours just to mod the game and 44 hours just to fix it and 3 minutes just to play it
5945,DOVAHKIIN!!!!!
5946,I haven't seen the sun in three days.
5947,Old but still amazing
5948,good
5949,SKYRIM IS SO GREAT. 10/10 WOULD BANG
5950,Best game in the last 10 years and always will be.
5951,"Clunky controls, generic gameplay, Bethesda staple terrible story, boring world design, and so much more. Not even mods can save this travesty of a game; whose legacy aged just as well as every other Bethesda RPG; like milk without preservatives."
5952,"When Bethesda Releases this again for PS6, I,m gonna buy it again"
5953,good
5954,"The original! No DLC's, just straight Skyrim.
Sadly, the Unofficial Patch is no longer available, so it's got that Bethesda wonkiness."
5955,Its ok I guess still not as good as Garfield Kart Furious Racing
5956,between all platforms logged at least 500 hours.  58 on PC alone.  Always enjoy.

5963,"i WAS ADVENTUER ....TILL I GET AROUW IN KNEE...
STILL BEST GAME EVER.....MOOD WILL MAKE THIS GAME LIVE LONGER"
5964,Good game.
5965,Fantastic RPG experience. Depth of immersion and engagement I have seen in very few games. Accompanied by an iconic soundtrack and well voiced characters to make a game you can keep coming back to.
5966,"I mean, it's Skyim."
5967,Must play game for any gamer.
5968,haha yes.
5969,"Amazing Experience, very immersive. but buggy af"

A fucking MASTERPIECE."
5971,Secunda
5972,"This game is epic and immersive. It puts most games to shame. 10/10, would take many arrows to the knee."
5973,"quite possibly one of the best games of all time, despite thousands of bugs, glitches, exploits, etc."
5974,pretty fun I guess
5975,"Only around 60 hours of my playtime is actual playing, the rest is struggling with mods and crashes every few minutes
Still one of my favourite games, haven't beaten it once since moving from PS3 in like 2014"

5995,"Yes, if you don't own it and have never played it on any console.

 YOU are missing out on something amazing. 

 If you have played it on Xbox its better on PC enjoy the community mods skin, textures and so on. Its a classic,

don't forget to pick up the DLC's when they are on sale...   
  
at 208 hour with three character play completed.                    
 
 One is an utter rouge/thief GOD  with full time invisibility with insane bonus critical hit for the sneaks   

Conan barbarian style Two handed and One handed with a shield all brute strength with the ability to call on the beasts on the wild 

The last is a mage I have dabbled with and played on and of for a few years so its was always kinda eh to get back into the character cause its not my play style but I just wanted to try and go threw it with a wizard main. 


                                                                       Anyway the games a blast a the HYPE was always real

5997,OISUHDIUSGIUDGUDYG IG SKKKKKKKKKYYYYYYYRRRRIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5998,It has the workshop because it does not ride the short bus like special edition.
5999,"Well, it's Skyrim. What do you expect? Everyone knows Skyrim by now. 
However it's not a good game but not a bad one either. Also thanks to the modding community to keep this game still alive. It's been almost 10 years and it's still worth playing. 
Not the best TES game because it lacks certain things the previous ones did better like story, fame/infamy system, birthsigns etc. but overall it's solid. I recommend playing the agme without mods as a first time player to the main story end and then head over to nexus mods to get the best out of it. Also if this is your first TES game and you want to know more about the overall lore of this series I recommend playing the previous two games Oblivion and Morrowind as well which do have lots of modding support too if you don't like the old graphics. 
In additional words as this game turns 10 soon I say this beforehand already: Happy Birthday Skyrim! Thank you for so many hours of fun, immersion, adventuring and sometimes hilariously funny moments caused by your many flaws, bugs and glitches."
6000,So you're finally awake?
6001,show
6002,Ich feier das spiel sehr stark auch wenn mich das Modding bisschen Fertig macht
6003,"prob my fav game of all time
"
6004,"Con +915 horas es un buen juego y aun no completo todo los logros, 101% recomendado"
6005,"Best RPG out there.
The game itself is not that GOAT, but the modding community made it one."
6006,"I like the free play and you are not hassled to keep things to a timer, plus there is always something to do. I haven't completed it yet and i would love to try."
6007,Yeah it's alright
6008,"da best game
"
6009,"amazing openworld game
"
6010,nothing to dislike
6011,"I've bought this game for multiple platforms, I've restarted it so much, I've modded it til it breaks... I've never finished it.  I've gotten enough out of this game that I haven't even wanted to gotten around to beating it yet."
6012,"This version of the game is preferable to me, over the newer shinier version."
6013,I do what I want
6014,.
6015,"A timeless classic that i learn something new about every single time i do a play through, near endless modding possibilties absolutely one of my top 3 favorties games of ALL time"
6016,this game gives me anxiety and lumago
6017,"A classic that will always be remembered by true gamers who played it when it was  still new, as the game that set a new standard then. Today it was sold to new owners who have so much more talent and technology at their fingertips but sadly lack the talent to create the legendary atmosphere, the rich fantasy tales created as in the original. The voices, music and characters were more real and beguiling and intriguing."
6018,Still fun
6019,578 crashes in and still playing. I'd buy this game 10 more times :)
6020,Good.
6021,Simply one of the best RPG ever made.
6022,"Ah, classic skyrim. The fun characters, the beautiful scenery, the terrifying falmer caves and dwemer ruins... And who could forget the fantastic bugs and glitches? Never change, skyrim. You have a special place in my heart."
6023,if your reading this review and don't know yet...just buy the dam game..
6024,Game Completion: ✅
6025,Very nice.
6026,Great graphics and gameplay.
6027,Endless world of exploring and joy. You could get lost in it for years.
6028,this is the best game ever created and we should all bow down to our lord and savior Todd Howard!
6029,One of the best RPGs of all time. I would highly recommend purchasing the Special Edition of Skyrim rather than this version as a lot of internal workings have been updated and noticed a lot of issues were fixed.
6030,god tier
6031,Its epic
6032,very fun you should buy it
6033,10/10 would buy again
6034,Growing up on this game i think it is the best. I feel like everyone should play this game!
6035,Good

6038,"Could not recommend this game enough!

6045,old school game that is still the best
6046,"ABSOLUTE BEAST GAME 10/10
"
6047,bueno
6048,This is a wonderful game for single players with multiple quests and situations where the player has  decisions to make that will change his/her future.  The graphics are amazing!  Highly recommended!
6049,I am going to play this game to my grave
6050,fun game
6051,Best Game Ever
6052,Not a fan really. Not a fan of the story at all. I liked the gameplay at some moments but if I had to rate the main menu music 10/10
6053,Skyrim eternal.
6054,"The story? Slow and unengaging.
The combat? Clunky and mindless.
The mechanics? Dumbed down.
The quests? Largely predictable and formulaic.
The faction questlines? Have bizarre progression and, with few exceptions, aren't very good. 
The dragons? Y'know, the main selling point of the game? Exceedingly easy to defeat and painfully sparse.
The civil war? Y'know, the main conflict of the setting? Half-baked at best and easy to forget.

And yet, for some reason, I keep coming back to this game. Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome, maybe it's the endless supply of spectacular mods that transform it into something worth coming back to, maybe it's the well-crafted open world, but whatever it is, there's some sorta secret sauce going on here that makes Skyrim worth playing despite it's many, many, many flaws."
6055,I'll give this a real review when I buy it for the last time in 30 years.
6056,Skyrim will always be my ultimate open world fantasy game. The community keeps this game alive years after this game is release.
6057,"one of the classics of gaming, years in and I still find ways to entertain myself for hours, along with new things I never discovered before, keeping it nice and interesting.
"
6058,The best game i have ever played.

6061,Funny number
6062,great
6063,horrible game. wasted several hours. greatest time of my life.
6064,This game has much to recommend it but what I like best is my ability to mod the game and make it a new experience each time I play.
6065,Best most immersive most re-playable game ever made.
6066,yeet
6067,"Waiting for the new game... its been 10 years!

6074,"Its Skrim. 

est. 11/11/11

Fact: Bethesda put out a throw away challenge back then: Before the release of Skrim, Bethesda jokingly said the first parents to name their new born baby Dovahkiin, they would get something special. So, a couple did it and shown the birth cert. and everything. Baffled and stunned, Bethesda held up their end. Now, the family gets every game Bethesda makes for free for life!"
6075,How can you not like Skyrim?
6076,i have basicly 26 hours still have no idea waht im doing my main playthro has only 14 hours and still noob good game but u need to have 5 moths free if u want to finish it i think its  a veary good game just long tahres 100+ caves 1 cave takes 1h or more. i love this game just dont have time sorry fans

6078,"Perfectly balanced, utterly bug free."
6079,"This game fucking sucks

"
6080,Great game so far! definitely have multiple hours to put in
6081,"come on they have flying mammoths
how can someone say no?"
6082,I don't care how long you play it or how many different races and builds you make....  If you get bored playing this game then you need to take your meds.
6083,"The original skyrim is completely bugged. Can't start a new game, always stuck on a glitch in the opening sequence. Go for SE or Legendary, that at least have some workarounds."
6084,"my favorite game to date, definitely worth buying if you are into open-world fantasy RPG's. Easy to get into and there's so much to do. I've been playing since like 2013 and still find new things in the game from time to time. Really immersive when you get mods."
6085,good game you can even add mods you know XD
6086,duh
6087,"[h1]Popular Game[/h1]

Unreal number of mods downloaded for 'Oldrim' - a very fun game modded for sure: the only way I would play it. I have to admit my first playthrough was strictly vanilla and would recommend everyone try the game that way once."
6088,"Do you want to experience ego death? I know you do. This game, is so good and so deep in world lore and gameplay. It takes a dive into the inner realm of your soul. That's where the game starts. Don't take LSD, play Skyrim and make the dragonborn take LSD through mods. 10/10"

Its a very big world to immerse yourself into and don't even mention mods, I have dear friends we go through the mods like most people would do clothes at store XD. Great, love it."
6116,"my favorite game since about 2016, the character creation is interesting and diverse, open world has so much for me to do, and so many stories and characters to get hooked on. plus, once those base quests have gotten old, there’s tons of mods nowadays to keep me interested."

"
6129,"i recommend you get the remastered , still a great game but what holds me down from calling it a masterpiece is that if you want the best experience you have to download mods , than it is a master piece  , the quests are good but not as  good as oblivions the combat is enjoyable , the main quest is preety goodand the dlc are really good , i hope bethesda fixes some of the mistakes they made in skyrim on the next one"
6130,good
6131,Excellent game that I have played many times before! Highly recommend!
6132,"""Inca no mezame potatoes"". You deep fry them straight into cooking oil without any batter. You don't boil the inca no mezames... once the deep frying is done, you toss them into a stew. You peel and cut that variety of potatoes, that is the recipe I use when I make cream stew. I've been living at an apartment I rented nearby, so I brought a full pot of cream stew I made over."
6133,"Probably so few gamers by now are unfamiliar with this classic, one of the most popular and beloved games of all time, that a  review in 2021 is redundant.  But perhaps my perspective will help someone else considering it.  I came late to the experience and almost gave up at the very outset because it was so different from anything I had played before that I just couldn't understand what I was supposed to do.  The game starts off with a bang and the learning curve can be steep.  When I was still learning to move my character around in a tower to escape from a dragon, my rescuer in the game said something about jumping onto the roof.  I thought he meant the roof of the tower, and I couldn't get to it.  No, he meant the roof of a lower building reached through a window of the tower.  Once I got past that little hurdle thanks to a Youtube video, I was hooked!  Two years later, I'm still hooked.   

Such is the beginning of the game, but there is no end. As a player, you can set your own goals, make your own rules, and develop your own style-- whatever you find you enjoy most.  There are hundreds of possible quests taking you to hundreds of locations in the world of Skyrim, but you can follow them at your discretion or even ignore them.  This great flexibility, further enhanced both by optional modules from the original developers and numerous optional mods produced by others, is part of the genius of the design, widening the appeal and giving the game almost inexhaustible replay value.  You can even speed up or slow down the passage of time in-game by means of the ""console command"" ""set timescale,""  with which I'd recommend everyone experiment.   The effects of changing the default are subtle and surprising, because in some respects slower is actually faster.  

I was pleasantly surprised that my fairly low-end computer, which was not even built for games, can run such an elaborate program featuring such detailed and beautiful graphics.  

The one thing that everyone hates is the many bugs and glitches that Bethesda Studios never bothered to fix in later releases.  I suspect that Bethesda welcomes modders partly because they do so much of this fixing.  Many of these bugs are unpredictable, affecting some players or play-throughs and not others.  These are just one reason why, given that you have tried Skyrim and found it to your taste, you should soon peruse the mods at nexusmods.com and install a few that will make your life easier.  I'd call Sky_UI, for instance, an indispensable improvement over the original menus.  ""Vortex"", the mod manager now generally used, makes modding much more trouble-free than it used to be."
6134,Still kickin'.

6164,2021.. still spankin' out another playthrough. fus roh dah bitch
6165,Skyrim is a great game a logical follow up to Morrowind and Oblivion
6166,"Skyrim is truly the only video game that I adore. Bethesda has created something fun and allows for some new experiences with every game play. I have completed this entire game three times! There is ALWAYS some new content and much of it has a sens of humor.  I have over two hundred fifty mods and that also makes it even more fun. The following of Skyrim is absolutely a devoted people with an age range of twelve to one hundred!
"
6167,Insanely laggy on parts of the map. Horses are lagging looking like they are jumping in place. Character running around with his hands flapping up and down. Spells are not castable during at this time. This happens mostly in the open world and some other places. Ive to 3080 rtx and it feels like im playing the game on a laptop
6168,its skyrim

6186,This game is just awesome
6187,"Highly recommended to those who like medieval style games. With fantasy features such as magic. Unfortunately, I am a casual and have not finished the game. Ever. And I've been playing a WHILE. Back on the Xbox 360. Always quit for awhile, forgot what each character/save was, and eventually made new ones. Hundreds. BUT THAT'S OK NOW! I CAN READ! Again highly recommended to those rpg players. This game always throws new things at me. Sometimes not so good things... like flying children hitting me on the head and then i have to roll back 17 hours of precious goofing off because i forgot to save and now is a good time to actually get back to the story... ooooh chest.. shiny. Anyway, this game has hours upon hours of gameplay, not including all the goofing off you can do! Have fun! By the way, do you come to the cloud district often?"
6188,Great gane

Best part of this game
Highly Recomend. Stay safe, subscribe, and hit that notifacation bell, to get updates on Guru Lary dumbass"
6201,"tis but a scratch

"
6202,"Skyrim. play as cat person, take drugs, climb mountains, slay dragons."
6203,game?
6204,All about the side missions and running around!
6205,dude...
6206,"Skyrim is probably the one of the best RPGs out there. The detail is far beyond good. Having enemies that scale with your level is brilliant. The story and background behind the game is pretty good, far better than most RPGs. I love the fact that you have control over the characters development and that skills improve with use. One of the most important aspects of the game is that it is not truly linear. You can veer off from the story line to a large extent."
6207,I've already preordered my copy for the Playstation 6.
6208,yes
6209,I like this game very much.
6210,"After around 300 hours playing this game and getting every single achievement, I decided to write review for it. Finally.
Journey was quite lenghty and enjoyable, even with bugs and some, ehemm, exploits. This game was my way of escaping reality, and it felt good. For a game this old and broken, I still enjoyed what it had to offer.
And dragons. Yes, dragons. And to feel even more badass [spoiler]you can get a shout, that bends the will of dragons and ride them[/spoiler]."
6211,y
6212,gut gem :)
6213,The graphics are great and the open world concept is huge. Dialogue and story are good.
6214,It's alright.

6216,Need something?
6217,yes
6218,"what do I gotta say, its skyrim, fucking buy it"
6219,"This is my third time buying it, and Todd would easily convince me to buy it again."
6220,"YOZA, seig fuckin hiel"
6221,"I like the story,  variable story play,  environment and sandboxing
"
6222,"There is remastered version of it, but amazing game for it's time and still holds today."
6223,the best
6224,Is Skyrim. Is Good.
6225,when is call of duty 2 coming out
6226,its good
6227,.
6228,Yes
6229,It's Skyrim.
6230,I really love this game with or without mods something about has a breath of fresh air to it
6231,"Elder Scrolls V is one of the best selling games of all time for a reason. The game's interesting side quests, straight forward game-play make this the perfect open world RPG for beginners.
The only downside is that this specific version of the game doesn't allow the additional purchase of the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, or Dragonborn DLCs. Which is annoying if you are an achievement hunter because the achievements that correspond with the DLCs appear alongside the original achievements and will prevent you from being able to complete a perfect game, achievement-wise.
So if you want to access those, you need to purchase The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition."
6232,"great game, worth the price"

6235,even after 10 years there is always something new to do or learn about this game. its endless!
6236,I love this game and will never let go of the good old days
6237,this is one of the most amazing open world games made. i probably sound like a broken record at this point but i adore the work bethesda put into skyrim. yes theres alot of things that could be fixed but honestly i love it in both vanilla and modded.
6238,"2nd fav game ever. Love the story lines, open world, options for game play. Very engaging."
6239,skyrin
6240,this game is one of the best games ever!!!!
6241,Need something?
6242,"While I can't claim to be a Bethesda die hard as Skyrim was my first Elder Scrolls game, I still really enjoyed playing through and sheer expansiveness of the world and story. The modding options are amazing, and the community is vibrant. I look forward to playing through the entire game again in Special Edition. The reference content is endless."
6243,"this is my favorite game, i can always come back start a new game and loose days

6255,Bored old 77 years aged fool going to keep me replaying whilst trying to remember the landscape from 4 years ago
6256,yes
6257,Greatest single player role playing game ever made.
6258,"old but fun rpg game. you must be living under a rock not to hear about Skyrim. Very bland without mods but on it's own, a slow-paced rpg that holds your hand every time you do something new. not grindy."
6259,"still a great adventure
"
6260,a good
6261,"I mean with as many copies of this game as there are, do you really not already own it? It's just a shame you can't get the base game and have to get the special edition since they messed up sprinting with a controller on the special edition."
6262,Timeless game
6263,"The Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Witcher 3 of 2011.

10/10."
6264,fun
6265,"I love that Skyrim can be played through life. 
I love how my skyrim wife told me for the first time that there was something in the cellar making noise. 
It turned out to be 3 rats."
6266,"This was my first time playing. I knew nothing about this game apart from it is popular. I purchased a game key from some website for only £5. So far this game is great value for what I played and is enjoyable. Pick nord as your characters race. 

Update: I just finished the main story quests. 9/10"
6267,Great game of course. Lots of things to do and see. Almost limitless possibilities.
6268,Nice.
6269,"So, we have a game with potential, a nice soundtrack, pretty good graphics, and definitely lots of potential. Is it good on its own? Yes, Bethesta made a nice buggy game with the best glitches you can find. Without the bugs, this game would not be the game i know and love. It is like the cherry on top of the ice cream.
Also there are DLCs which improve the game quite much.
However, the best part of this game is its community. Without those amazing people this game would not be as relevant and as amazing as it is now. Skyrim is no longer Skyrim, it can be whatever you want...
and you can even run it on a cabled potatoe...

Overall, decent game"
6270,"this game i have been playing for 7 years and every day i still find new things to do, every re-start of a new race to play(though i main khajiit) i find new things!"
6271,Fun with and without mod

6274,Skyrim

very skux high reccomend chur"
6276,"After so many years, this is still a great open-world game to play. I cannot wait for the next release."

6280,"Just a fun game to mess around on, with or without mods."
6281,yes
6282,"Great game, great story , much more detail and intricacy compared to Oblivion, the previous Elder Scrolls game. The graphics are impeccable in addition. Highly recommended."
6283,"At the time of writing this the game is no longer on the steam store, rip old skyrim my friend. One day todd howard will grace us with more elder scrolls and more copied assets from you like in F76."
6284,Probably the single greatest RPG open world game of all time.
6285,"a game i'll most certainly still enjoy in the year 2050, play it vanilla or mod it to oblivion and back!"
6286,love the game but can run it on linux
6287,It'll do
6288,Starting playing this in 2017 and it's still my favorite video game

6290,not very good

6293,"Yea dude this game is amazeballs. Really gets my goat, ya know?"
6294,"The Scenery is awesome and you really get a sense of exploration as the map is huge. Plus you can ride a Dragon, become a Werewolf and a Vampire what more do you need!"
6295,Can't wait for elder scrolls 6 and I hope the infinite alchemy exploit is finally fixed.
6296,This is the best game ever. It's the reason I love video games. I will love it forever and you will too.
6297,One of the best 3d games of all times.
6298,"Fun, tons of mods which can add new experiences even if you've beaten it before."
6299,"Can't get enough of this game, haven't stopped playing  sense it came out in 2011. 11/ 10 would recommend  playing it sometime."
6300,Bury me with my money.
6301,"I am a table top RPG gamer, Elder scrolls is one of the closest games I have found to simulate the experience."
6302,One of the greatest games of all time.
6303,"Crashes often and doesn't include DLC.

Stick to Special Edition."
6304,nice
6305,AWESOME
6306,A-mazing
6307,"Skyrim is and always will be the best game to introduce someone to the game series.

I remember when it first came out and watched my cousin play. It was always fun and hilarious to me. We all know the game has it's bugs but despite those it's still so fun to play!"
6308,dragonborn
6309,NSFW modding potential is clearly limitless
6310,i would recommend to everyone very great game just waiting for the next in the series
6311,Its Timeless
6312,Its Skyrim. Its the best
6313,I've played this since 2013 and I can not stop.
6314,This game will destroy your perception of time on the outside world as you sink more and more hours into playing it. It's just THAT good.
6315,Endless replayability
6316,Best game NA

6327,Great game
6328,Great game. I have played over 150 hours

6336,amazing game to get lost in
6337,Why play anything else for the last 10 years?
6338,Mod it for the best game
6339,skyrim is pretty pog
6340,I've been playing Skyrim for as long as I can remember; it's an amazing game that speaks to me on many different levels. Any adventurer's soul will surely find a calling in the beauty of the stories.
6341,So buggy. Can't even start the game
6342,dope fucking game. hyper chad moments when yuou get high enough lvlel to behead dumb fuck virgins in combat
6343,"I remember this game to be fantastic. However, after reinstalling nothing seems to work anymore. Flickering water, bugged NPCs and my character constantly flicking back and forth as if he's swimming. I have no idea what sort of update happened to make this unplayable but it has made me uninstall it. It's a shame as I remember this game so fondly. 

10 years ago (Thumbs up!)

Today - Absolutely not. 

I'm heartbroken."
6344,It's aight.
6345,"excellent, fun"
6346,Jut perfect (including scaling cliff faces on an average pony)
6347,in Nov 10 this year it be 10 year old! i still found myself coming back to this game!
6348,A game you can sink hours into without realizing it.
6349,Very easy to forget yourself in it. And that's without mods.
6350,pklp
6351,"Why am I still playing this. ... ?
"
6352,"This game is basically like The Office, but instead of being a salesman you are a badass nord, elf, lizard (whatever your want really) killing giant firebreathing dragons and getting killed by bullshit glitches."
6353,"it good
"
6354,I FUCKING LOVE SKYRIM
6355,"It's Skyrim, is there any other reason?"
6356,amazing game brings back so much memories
6357,"Step1: buy skyrim to not read books.
Step2: read books in skyrim"
6358,It’s pretty good
6359,good game
6360,A must have for all Gamers.
6361,"been almost 10 years 
it's my whole personality"
6362,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King"
6363,mooooodddddssssss!!!!
6364,highly underrated cult classic from 2011.
6365,its aight
6366,"classic
"
6367,The mods you can load makes this game a bit different when you choose and you can also travel to new lands with many new adventures>
6368,I have played this game since it came out in 2011 and i love it
6369,dragon go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
6370,I love traveling other worlds. I like modding. But I don't like the hours of having to go through fixes.
6371,gud game
6372,"Ah yes, Skyrim. The game that is loved by many, modders as well. 

Unfortunately, Bethesda made it hard to buy the game as they want newcomers to buy Special Edition. If you want to get the original Skyrim experience, get a steam key for the Legendary Edition instead, or if you wnt to buy it on Steam, you might as well follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmCPPRSfjDg"
6373,.
6374,I'm in it for the Macho Man
6375,Yes.
6376,"Its either you are subconsciously becoming a stealth archer or crafting 1000 iron daggers down the line with the hidden chest found in Dawnstar, regardless you will be stuck in the continuous loop of playing Skyrim."
6377,Amazing game
6378,"I totally love it. There's just such an amazing atmosphere and experience. This game is so much fun, so I definitely suggest you should buy this game! It's amazing!"
6379,"Very immersive, constant challenges, a plethora of mods availible...potentially my favorite series."
6380,Just brilliant. This game has stood the test of time. I have played across so many platforms. Still go back to this game time after time
6381,GOOD
6382,Great classic
6383,"Even my grandma likes this game. 10/10 buggy as hell, but would totally recommend."
6384,"an awesome game that i still return to since the games made since this one to 2021 have been crap at best, fallout4 and kingdom come excluded."
6385,"A very immersive open world RPG with many choices to be made and guilds to join, combat has improved over its predecessors along with the levelling system, being possibly the best that Bethesda has to offer. However as all Bethesda games expect to encounter bugs, so save often and if you see a dragon flying backwards, or you get sent to one of the two moons by a giant, just accept your fate."
6386,If a game can keep you having fun for 15hrs and for you to only do 3 main quest steps - it must be a pretty decent game
6387,"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee"
6388,It's alright.
6389,got like 20 day playtime on xbox
6390,x
6391,So good
6392,dragon go vroom
6393,love it
6394,"Game wont even start, keeps getting stuck at first cut scene. For some retarted reason you had limited time to get new version for free, even thou you can get better graphics w mods."
6395,denfnatly
6396,There was a funny chicken.
6397,great game
6398,"So what can I say that has not already been said about this game, honestly I do recommend it both vanilla first as there is plenty there then add mods to enhance it further, if you like action, adventure, and a decent story if you care, then I highly recommend this lovely game~"
6399,its been okay
6400,garbage doesn't work on modern PCs without tons of tinkering around...
6401,"This review is pointless, of course you already have several hundred hours of gameplay already."
6402,I like Skyrim :) hope this helped.
6403,"One of the best games every, only supersceded by The Witcher 3."
6404,To be honest you can do whatever you want as long as you don't go on rampages. but you can do that too so get the game and go wild
6405,I am Vampire Assassin Dragonborn Companion Blade College Student in both the Imperial & Stormcloak Armies.
6406,"Yes, I'm finally awake"
6407,playing this while enjoying breakfast hits different
6408,I think Ill get addicted to this
6409,A new hand touches the beacon

"
6411,truely a great game
6412,it just works
6413,"very, good lots of content, fun to mess around."
6414,"Pretty good game, not many people have heard of it though. Hope it catches on at some point!"
6415,"There's not much I can say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said, it's a great game with tons of content that keeps you hooked for hours. If you haven't already played this game, play it now! you won't regret it."
6416,good game
6417,this game is stupidly awesome
6418,A classic.
6419,yes
6420,"It's Skyrim...Do I really need to post a review? We all know it has bugs, but we all bought it like 4 times on various platforms...Just admit it...."
6421,"With all due respect to Bethesda, fuck Bethesda"
6422,nice
6423,bread
6424,r8 gd
6425,Great way to kill some time. Would not recommend for short session play.
6426,I played it for 69 hours and enjoyed myself the whooole time
6427,This is Skyrim.  It needs no further recommendation!  Ten years later it is still going strong!
6428,fhgfdshsgsfggvafgafgfaag
6429,amazing game!
6430,a
6431,"Yes, what else is there to say?"
6432,Last played 2 Sept 2018...and now back to download it again :)
6433,wide as an ocean deep as a kiddy pool.  It has an amazing world very emersive just wish the quests and characters were better
6434,"I've tried 4 times to start a new game and each time either my horse is spinning or there is 2 carts of the exact same prisoners on the road alongside mine. Unplayable, gonna be installing the special edition. Sadge."
6435,"you bought this for one out of three reasons:

you were interested in skyrim or brought here by youtube

you wanna install CBBE and SoS to have your own porn game

or

you're literally here just for the arrows in the knee"
6436,terrible game
6437,"game is not optimized for high fps monitors. Many people across the internet experience physics glitch during the game play. Trying to fix it by reading and implementing different solutions from the internet, but didn't found one that work for me so far. 
This is sad"
6438,I like to loot
6439,lit
6440,Still Good
6441,goat
6442,yes
6443,Dragons? Ancient tongues? Thieves guilds? Murder cults!? What's not to love!?
6444,"pretty fun
"
6445,"I'm old, it's old...it's a perfect fit!"
6446,can't really get it anymore other than on 3rd party websites but this version has a lot of mods special edition doesnt have
6447,YES!!! Every gamer must have at least one version of this game in their library or they are not really a gamer.
6448,"It's pretty darn awesome, I keep coming back to this game again and again almost 1000 hours played now. It is becoming slightly tiring but there is a lot of variety to be found in it."
6449,i love it graphics are unbelievable
6450,"is good gaem
"
6451,"mod it, only thing keeping this game replayable"
6452,"Yes, hey, treat yourself to Skyrim, you won't do anything wrong. The mod selection makes the game still worth playing even for today. Better graphics, objects, environments and missions. Buy it."
6453,"Amazing, I kept dowloading it after I bought it...and mod it."
6454,"One of my favorite elder scrolls, tons of quests to do and you can play stealthy or just bust in every door and fight, its a game i just keep coming back to play, if you love rpg games i highly suggest you check Skyrim out"
6455,its lit
6456,"great game, great time killer"
6457,good game. fight dragons. feel badass
6458,I hacked steam to buy this.... He he he he he he he he.....
6459,you can do what you when you want
6460,"I have played this game previously to an horrifying extent and let me tell you, the freedom of choice and action is marvellous, you don't have to do a quest just because. Farengar can go pick that damn stone himself for all I care. The world is huge and alive, changing little details depending of your choices in some quests. But the real cherry on the cake that is Skyrim is modding. Once you start to install mods you will spend more time searching and installing mods than playing the actual game. But play the vanilla first, at least a little bit before you turn it into your personal harem or whatever floats your boat."
6461,"Skyrim is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good game :)

just be careful uninstalling mods... it can break your game"
6462,"Although the world doesn't get affected by your actions as much as I wish it would, you can build your character and play however you want. Weapons, magic, armor, quests, lore, are all pretty awesome and the replaybility is pretty good."
6463,Yes
6464,"yes
"
6465,goat
6466,One of the literal best games on the planet I enjoy it very much and have never EVER heard anyone say that it is a bad game. I've played way more on my consoles.
6467,good game

6471,"It's Skyrim.

You allready own Skyrim.

What, you don't? Check your account again. There. You own Skyrim.

Also you probably bought it more than once. Because there are a metric fuckton of editions with minor changes or features that other games (*cough* No Man's Sky *cough*) offered for free. It's Skyrim. You inevitably own it and contribute to the decline of our species.

It's fun with mods though."
6472,"This game is as addictive as it is when I first got it. I have it on almost every console it is being republished to.

The game is very re-playable as getting your hands on mods is easier than ever which will completely refresh your experience over and over. You will get so side tracked doing stuff for other people that you realise you've been leaving everyone else to defend against dragon attacks whilst you, the dragonborn could have done something instead, you are selling vegetables to the farmer.

I couldn't reccomend playing it more."
6473,my favorite part is the murder and the robbery of the corpses
6474,"Daddy Todd doesn't know I've been seein Mista Kirkbride on the side, getting my nexus fix, scratching that itch with 30 weapons mods. God damn can bethesda make a solid half of a game, Lore so deep that touching the bottom is touching the other side of the planet. Gonna just CHIM out here and get the dreamsleeve tattooed on my arm while Urag Gro-shub recommends additional content in the Form of enderall. You can get the god head sure, but the real squeeze is Enantiomorphing at the college of winterhold, where the resultant cripple is this game's ability to adhere to its own vision to the benefit of its lore. 5/7 perfect game despite Bethesda's best efforts. 

Troll on the path to High Hrothgar was a great last boss"
6475,it great
6476,Much good
6477,"well, i mean, yeah. legendary game"
6478,There's a reason that Bethesda hasn't bothered trying to make another proper Elder Scrolls game. This is the epitome of the series.
6479,So good I've bought it repeatedly
6480,fus ro dah bitch
6481,Open and free to do as you please with neverending mods.
6482,just a good game with a great communiuty behind it.
6483,great game. fun to mod. great story otherwise.
6484,I mean I'm pretty sure most people have played this game at this point even some of the Amish. When are we getting number 6?
6485,Khajit got your back
6486,its ok
6487,"Sometimes when you kill people in their sleep, they stand up before dying"
6488,it is fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6489,yessir
6490,best RPG of all times
6491,Greatest epic fantasy RPG ever made.
6492,Nearly 30% as good as Morrowind.
6493,it just works
6494,it's skyrim
6495,Very immersive game. Definitely one of the best RPG's ever created.
6496,love it
6497,IT just works
6498,A classic.
6499,very cool and fun
6500,yup
6501,Yes

6504,"I use to have a family, friends, a life... but then I took an arrow to the knee"
6505,Todd Howard snorts moon sugar with our money and one day we'll stop giving him it. Today is not that day.
6506,GREAT
6507,"It's a good game. I've been playing it ever since it came out in 2011. It would've gotten old for me on console, but with all the mods on steam for Skyrim the game is still fresh 10 years later."
6508,One of the best games I have ever played
6509,such a fun game and even after nearly 10 years it still holds up
6510,AMAZING GAME!!!! SO MANY MODS TO ADD AND ALL WORK AT THE SAME TIME!!!
6511,Hey you! You're finally awake!
6512,LIFE TIMES OF FUN
6513,amazing !!!!
6514,It's Fallout but with horses and more glitches
6515,the best game i've found yet to mod til it's barely recognizable. who needs re-releases when you've got ***style***
6516,GOOD
6517,This game is awesome i played it since it released on ps3 then i got it on pc i abosolutely love this game :D
6518,"I've been replaying it for ten years straight, so what do you think?"
6519,great
6520,gg
6521,Who doesn't know skyrim by now?
6522,excellent.
6523,One of the best games ever made.
6524,Best RPG I have ever played. I have beat this game several times and have many thousands of hours just trying different things.
6525,"The best fantasy RPG game ever made.  Quests are pretty linear, but the attention to detail in building this world, it's lore, it's inhabitants and their races and factions is a labor of love.  They even created a dragon language.  One decade later, people are still playing this same game, and hobbyist developers are still creating mods to add even more experiences for this game.

This was made during a time when Bethesda wanted to make great games .... a very far cry from what they've become today."
6526,"No matter if we're talking about Legendary Edition or Special Edition, it was the game of the decade all the way to the end."
6527,I wish i could marry with serana
6528,10 of 10
6529,game good
6530,"Liked - Everything but below, especially the RPG elements . . . I'm not big on combat related games, so if you are, this game will probably feel outdated to you but for a combat noob who's not so interested in combat elements in a game it's more than enough
Disliked - Textures and a few forced quests/quest outcomes . . . easily fixed with mods.  Most things that one can find to dislike about in this game probably has a mod or some dozen to change it."
6531,Probably the best game Bethesda has ever made
6532,"good game

"
6533,"yes very good game play it
"
6534,the big gay i am
6535,Fun
6536,great graphics and storyline
6537,Skyrim
6538,great game still
6539,its fun
6540,everything about this game is perfect! i love to explore. i still have yet to finish the game because there is so much to do :)
6541,Skyrim is awesome ton's of stuff to do
6542,Epic
6543,"One of the best games ever made.   The definition of open playstyle.  Do a quest, do all of them, kill folks for asking you to do one.. it's all a different play path."
6544,Do I even have to say anything...
6545,For the nords.
6546,"It's Skyrim. You don't need a review, you already know it's good. My only gripe is that the decision to make this series streamlined for console play has made the interface pretty clunky for PC users."
6547,"great game should get
"
6548,With every playthrough I usually find something new. Would highly recommend this game.
6549,It's Skyrim. If you haven't played it you should.
6550,"Got this edition because i was told it was better for modding, almost every mod i download says missing masters because i haven't bought the €45 of DLC that SE comes with.
Honestly i recommend special edition over oldrim if you're thinking of making that decision, you can port mods from oldrim to se super easily.
Only thing i'd say is better about this edition is that it's cheaper.
The Game is still absolutely amazing and i definitely see myself sinking many more hours into it and as far as i know, i definitely still recommend it because i haven't player or modded SE."
6551,"a bit aged now, but still a great game, the user addons make it even better"
6552,"This is an amazing game, great sandbox, do whatever you want, but the main story is also amazing!"
6553,what shall I say?
6554,"Dope ass game. I wonder when the new ES will come out?

cant wait for them to add more to this game tho! like 500 pieces of content. that would be dope."
6555,fghhsgfdhdfg
6556,Skyrim
6557,fun game
6558,I think the only reason i found out about skyrim is because it was the easiest way to look at full blown nudity on youtube at one point. greatest goat
6559,"Thanks, Todd (and all other devs, indeed)."
6560,"Hard to top this game, even after 9 years of playing it.  Game of the Year, every year."
6561,fun to play
6562,"I have bought this game 3 times. 

I dont know why.

"
6563,scrofum : )
6564,"This game is absolutely amazing, been playing since it came out- have way more hours on console tho. I love it 100/10. Definitely recommend."
6565,This game continues to be a treat. its hands down one of the best RPG games ive ever played
6566,Been playing since childhood and still doesn't get old.
6567,Don't go to Shearpoint.
6568,One of my favorite games of all time. Especially with mods. I’ve probably played over 1000 hours including console playthroughs.
6569,"
This is my fourth time buying this game so that should already let you know it's worth the money.

keep in mind though, once you mod you're trapped you'll find yourself spending more hours modding than playin!
still a good game though."
6570,Skyrim (without guns)
6571,Just buy it. Wont regret!
6572,"I've tried this game multiple times on both PS3 and Steam. I just can't get through it. I think it comes down to the sameyness of the dungeons and the enemies within. Also, when there isn't a story to bolster the events of these far flung locations (only for the main questline) it really takes away from the feeling that you're actually doing something worthy of your time."
6573,Still worth to play and mod on 2021
6574,Best game ever lol
6575,Mods Make America Great Again
6576,This game aged well.
6577,"no upgrade option, shit"
6578,Great game but has many glitches so its hard to really start
6579,"fav game of all time 
"
6580,Awesome game !
6581,"beautiful graphics, many quests, many items, all and all a fun game"
6582,Best game
6583,Todd will force you to buy it 30 more times at gunpoint after purchasing this one do NOT fall for his lies
6584,This is one of the best games of all time.
6585,Yes
6586,its skyrim
6587,"Skyrim really is the pinnacle of what the open world rpg genre can be. It's glitches may be numerous, but hardly ever make the game unplayable, and even then if you add patch mods, many of those issues are fixed more or less for free. Speaking of mods, that is really where this games potential shows. This games ability to be altered and added to so much gives the feeling of an endless world created by developer and fan together, and that really makes the game wonderful in many senses of the word."
6588,One of the iconic games. Shouldn't be missed.
6589,"nice
a good game
worth to play
"
6590,Great
6591,Used more time modding than actually playing the game.
6592,"Yeah worth it, nothing close to  ES$ but good all the same. Fun adventure."
6593,"old edition that you cant upgrade. buy it if you like wasting your money, otherwise go for the special edition"
6594,I mean... It's skyrim. whats not to like?
6595,Simple yet a fun game to just get drowned in all the possibilities
6596,"It's Skyrim what more do you want me to say. Dragons swords and magic. Also has access to the portal mod that all other versions lack cuz lack of steam workshop for them.
Also 100% a bethesda title bugs bugs and more bugs that can be a pain and  sometimes a good laugh."
6597,pretty fun now dlc time (done)
6598,"It's a big game without mods, it's a game of limitless size with mods."
6599,epik
6600,"Walking simulator 2011. Lore is obscure and unexplained, too much empty dialogue. Playing this game consists of walking to a marker, speaking to all NPCs because there's no marker to tell you someone has a quest for you, walking some more, entering some dungeon you don't even care about, kill all baddies, get stuck searching for some stupid shit, walk again, speak to an NPC. Repeat at nauseum. That could be passable, but the combat loop and the controls suck too bad for this to work.

Levelling skills sucks. To level for example magic, you have to spam cast the same spells over and over to see a fucking bar fill, you don't even need to be doing anything meaningful with those spells.
Also, combat really sucks. You can't block with a one-handed sword, which means you can only use it to spam R1 in close combat. For mages, you have to be constantly swapping spells in your pause menu (which feels obstructive and stupid), and because of how much the combat loop sucks some enemies destroy you no matter what you do (only cheesing works).

Also, Bethesda is a shit company with scummy practices."
6601,Amazing game and still is better then most games that come out today. Nostalgia and everything.
6602,nice]
6603,"How is Skyrim not at 100% recommended? It's Skyrim, if you really need to look into the reviews, just buy it already."
6604,sneak op
6605,"always something you can do and the fun never ends 
"
6606,Buy Special Edition instead. There are 0 reasons to still buy Oldrim unless you are some extremely picky mod purist and need mods that are not getting updated anymore.
6607,"Want a nice game? Buy Skyrim...
Want a great game? Slap mods on Skyrim...
It is a fun game and has a lot of potential for replay."
6608,Still a great game after 11 years.
6609,Great game
6610,A beautiful looking and open form game that keeps you coming back again and again.
6611,yues
6612,10/10
6613,Its Skyrim. Skyrim is king of all games.
6614,get the special edition instead!
6615,"the only way you can make this game fun is if you install mods, and that really tells you a lot about the game"
6616,"One of the best of all time
"
6617,"I named my dog after Barbas....
that is all have a day :)"
6618,Character builds and play.  Mostly like ranged weapons.
6619,Love this game. Looking forward to my new PC arrival and getting it all set-up so I can play once again.
6620,Skyrim

6627,only thing good in the bethesda
6628,good yes todd well done good boy todo you made me proud
6629,Classic Open World Game that set the stage for so many others!  Very replayable!  I would love to see somebody remake the game with Unreal Engine 5!

6631,s'aight
6632,"Been playing since it first came out, nuff said :D"
6633,i just want her back bro
6634,"To me, this still is the greatest open world RPG to date."
6635,"Obsolete, as the Special Edition is available. Ignore this version, SE has everything all bundled into one package, and I think some minor improvements."
6636,There is a reason this game has been re-released over and over and over again. Definitely a must play.
6637,"Skyrim is not just a game, this is the whole universe. If you haven't played it yet, then what are you waiting for?"
6638,one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing this game since 2013 and I am still playing. Its so much fun... Honestly the mods make it 100x better to have fun with.
6639,"the game has more than 100 reasons for beeing the worst Elder Scrolls game
BUT
I love the lore of Elder Scrolls and its playable 
They created whole world with everything that can be imaginable 
(perhaps, not everything)"
6640,"I took an arrow to the knee 
"
6641,vewy fumm
6642,this game slaps
6643,Dragon killing should be in the Olympics.
6644,"I LOVE this game. 

For your reference, I have The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim along with 4 DLC (Dawnguard, Dragonborn, Hearthfire, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim High Resolution Texture Pack).

It is so immersive. On top of several main side quests (which are very exciting and I really enjoyed), there's an immense amount of side quests as well (which you can get by talking to NPCs). You can switch up the gameplay in so many ways too - your race, your area of expertise (i.e. archer, mage, etc), whether or not you get involved in some ""bad"" groups (i.e. Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood), your followers, and so much more!  Not to mention, there are hundreds of amazing mods on Steam workshop for free! I know some people prefer the vanilla version, but I love the mods that enhance Skyrim (i.e. more realistic mountains, more realistic blood, better forest & dungeon sounds, etc). 

Yes, there are a couple glitches in the game every now and then, but I honestly think that adds a humorous element to the game and I rather enjoy it. These oddities are few and far between for me, and I don't feel they affect the gameplay negatively.

All in all, this game is very creative, adventurous, nice graphically, and so easy to spend hours upon hours playing. Elder Scrolls V is the best one of their Skyrim-type games in my opinion. I highly recommend it!!!"
6645,10000000/10
6646,"This is not a review. Plenty has been written about it since its release. These are just my thoughts. I came back to Skyrim recently as the 10th Anniversary of its release draws close. I have lost count of how much time i have spent on it across different platforms. It is so easy to get lost in its world. Forget the main quest line and just roam its land exploring and discovering. Each time i have restarted the game, it has felt like new. Despite its numerous flaws (Hate the UI with a passion) and bugs (now occasional), i can't help but be drawn in."
6647,Great game!
6648,"I started playing the game in 2012 on playstation 3. It was the greatest game I'd ever played
9 years later I can say I was a damn fool. The game is shallow and its main qualities are the main questline (which you'll rarely do) and the environmental storytelling.

Thankfully the modding community is a saving grace and fleshes out the game, so it's still worth something i guess"
6649,;'khjbj;nlk;m
6650,Esse jogo me fez perder minha namorada 10/10
6651,A game you can come back to for years.
6652,this is a very important review
6653,bad rock textures
6654,"The story is this game really isn't something amazing but worth seeing through if you're interested enough. The DLC story lines are more interesting especially when you go to Morrowind. Combat is straightforward and easy enough to pick up for mostly anybody, although magic is pretty weak. Plenty of content in the game and if you're itching for more there is basically an infinite index of mods for this game that can change basically any aspect you can think of, including making magic fun. Oh and stealth archery is pretty over powered but is always a good time regardless. 20$ is a good price for this game but getting it when it's on sale is probably the better option."
6655,Very kek. Thank
6656,"Not sure if I can buy the DLC for this version.

So I'm most likely forced to pay for a copy of this game just for DLC.

Edit: I could buy the DLC thanks to links from one of the reviews on here. Yeet."
6657,Description unnecessary
6658,best game ever
6659,./
6660,"don't buy it anywhere else, please"
6661,"I'm till enjoying Skyrim in 2021 and will likely continue to do so for many years to come.. Truly a masterpiece. Speaking of 2021, interesting times these are, but fret not, Truth and Love will prevail. MAGA"
6662,it just works
6663,"Masterpiece of TES universe, a shining pillar among RPG games and just a beloved story of Northern land."
6664,"Best game in history. End of story.

10/10"
6665,cool
6666,its good
6667,Yassss
6668,its ok
6669,When Skyrim 2?
6670,"Even after 10+ years the game still stands on the shoulders of Gaints thanks to the mod community and the memes of Bethesda never making another game. but if you wanna waste 1000 Hours and still have not played a Bethesda game then what are you even doing with your life?  
10/10 Would buy a 9th time."
6671,"What can I say about Skyrim that hasn't already been covered in the last decade?

Skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits. It just works."

6691,Great Game
6692,"Even though I was born in the USA, I didn't become free until I bought this game."
6693,I enjoyed this game for a long time. I haven't played it in awhile because of how busy I have been but I will be playing it again this week. It's always fun to pass time.
6694,"It's Skyrim what else needs to be said, lol."
6695,Still got me coming back to it!
6696,"Skyrim is one of those classic games that I think everyone should try out. You can never go wrong with this game, and I always find myself coming back to it time and time again. Endless fun, and if you get bored just try another play style or download some mods!"
6697,i mean its skyrim need i say more
6698,LOVE THIS GAME I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE !
6699,Yessir
6700,OLD but always cool
6701,A Great game even on it's own. But even better with community mods and addons. Endless customisation and replays. I like making the game into a survival sim :D
6702,"Overall, it's an enjoyable adventure for years and with the mod community keeping it still alive, it's truly a game worth buying. ""It just works"""
6703,cracking quests and vistas. combat is really good to. enjoy the dungeons.
6704,"Ralof: Hey you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there. Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks... Skyrim was fine until you came along! Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you I’d have stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. Looks at Dragonborn You there, you and me, we shouldn’t be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now. Driver: Shut up back there. Lokir: looks at Ulfric What’s wrong with him, huh? Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion... if they’ve captured you... oh gods, where are they taking us? Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits. Lokir: No, This can’t be happening! This isn’t happening! Ralof: Hey, what village are you from horse-thief? Lokir: Why do you care? Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home. Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m from Rorikstead. Hadvar: General Tullius sir! The headsman is waiting. Tullius: Good, let's get this over with. Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh! Divines, please help me! Ralof: Sees Tullius Look at him! General Tullius, the Military. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves, I bet they had something to do with this. notices where they are This is Helgen... I used to be sweet on a girl from here. I wonder if Velod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in... Funny, when I was a boy Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe. Child: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going? Father: You need to go inside, little cub. Child: Why? I want to watch the soldiers! Father: Inside the house, now. Child: Yes papa... heads inside Driver: Woah... pulls in reins Female Captain: walks up to cart Get these prisoners out of the cart! Lokir: Why are we stopping? Ralof: Why do you think? End of the line. stands up Let’s go, we shouldn’t keep the gods waiting for us. Lokir: No! Wait! We’re not rebels! Ralof: Face your death with some courage, thief. Lokir: You’ve got to tell them we weren’t with you! This is a mistake! Female Captain: Step towards the block when we call your name, one at a time! Ralof: Empire loves their damned lists. Hadvar: Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm. Ulfric: moves towards block Ralof: it has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric Hadvar: Ralof of Riverwood. Ralof moves forward Lokir of Rorikstead. Lokir: No! I’m not a rebel! You can’t do this! runs Female Captain: Halt! Lokir: you’re not going to kill me! Female Captain: Archers! archers shoot Lokir: hit in the knee Aaa..! Female Captain: glares at rest of prisoners Anyone else feel like running? Hadvar: Wait... You there. Looks at Dragonborn Step forward. Dragonborn steps forward Who are you? Dragonborn: Dragonborn Long-Shadow. Hadvar: Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim. Captain, what should we do? He’s not on the list. Female Captain: Forget the list. He goes straight to the block. Hadvar: By your orders, Captain. I’m sorry. We’ll make sure your remains get returned to Valenwood. Follow the captain, prisoner. Dragonborn: moves to stand next to Ralof Tullius: steps up to Ulfric Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero doesn’t use a power like the voice to murder his king and usurp the throne. Ulfric: growl Tullius: You started this war, flung skyrim into chaos. And now the Empire is going to put you down and restore the peace. Alduin: distant roar Hadvar: looks around What was that? Tullius: It’s nothing. Carry on. Female Captain: Yes, General Tullius! turns to priestess Give them their last rights. Priestess: As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the 8 divines upon you- Stormcloak Soldier: For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with. marches forward Priestess: hesitates … as you wish. Stormcloak Soldier: Come on! I haven’t got all morning! kneels at block, looks up at Captain/Headsman … My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?? Captain: steps on his back Headsman: beheads soldier Stormcloak Soldier B: You Imperial bastards! Townsfolk: Justice! Townsfolk B: Death to the Stormcloaks! Ralof: ...As fearless in death as he was in life. Female Captain: Next, the wood elf! Hadvar: There it is again... did you hear that? Female Captain: I said... Next. Prisoner. Imperial Soldier: to Dragonborn To the block prisoner. Nice and easy. Dragonborn: moves to the block, kneels at block Headsman: moves to swing axe Alduin: lands, roars Hadvar: What in Oblivion is that!?! Female Captain: Sentries, what do you see?

Jump through the roof and keep going! We’ll follow when we can! Dragonborn: jumps"
6705,We're gonna keep buying the re-releases.
6706,shock nahui
6707,fun :)
6708,"It is a great game. I love how you can battle dragons, be a thief, or explore taverns."
6709,"i have like 1000 hours on console, this game never gets old and has countless hours of game play to become the ultimate dovakiin"
6710,"it fun,i guess
"
6711,can't wait to buy this game for the 9th time
6712,"Time well spent, and i'm probably still not even halfway to knowing all the quests one can do"
6713,"its skyrim, everyone knows skyrim"
6714,"BEST RUSSIAN AND CHINESE EXPERIENCE IN A WHILE
I LIKE TO KILL RANDOMS AND GET KILLED AT RANDOMS TIME WHILST LITERALLY JUST SITTING IN MY CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET"
6715,.
6716,Yep
6717,"Garbage game, fantasy holodeck with infinite customizability."
6718,"I do not recommend this game. After 10 years Bethesda did not nothing to solve the problem of ""Windowed"" problem. I tried all methods. Before this problem I played on old pc without any problems. Now I changed a monitor to 144Hz and GPU. After this I got ""Windowed"" problem. Changing Power management mode, screen size, ""disable windowed screen"" setting  in launcher, ""bFull Screen=1 iSize H=1080 iSize W=1920"", game reinstall(many times), updating driver and Windows 10 did not help."
6719,GOOD GAME FOREVER I LOVE THIS GAME
6720,"A true classic for open world RPGs. Also, a very active and robust mod community."
6721,you will lose yourself in this game. Play at your own peril
6722,One of my favorite games of all time. I remember back in 2011 really wanting to like this game but just not understanding it. I would keep going back every few months until it final hit me. IF you haven't tried this game give it a shot. It make take you three tries but man... there is so much effort and genuine detail put into this game. I'd recommend it over all the Assassins Creed games. Now i am just ranting. Thanks for reading.
6723,Cheese.
6724,very good cannot kill child unfortunate
6725,"One of the best games of all time. With the mod community the game continues to evolve, change, and build new content. If only Oblivion and Skyrim could merge then ...
"
6726,h
6727,Honestly one of the best open world games I have ever experienced.
6728,"For an older game, it is still visually beautiful.  The story line is immersive."
6729,"Worth every last penny (and taxes, lots of them - cries in argentina XD)."
6730,"Some may say that the graphics are dated, but I don't think so personally. As far as Elder Scrolls games go, this has the easiest-to-learn system, but in all honesty the story lines don't quite live up to the legacy left by Oblivion and Morrowind. The story is still easy to get lost in though, and the map is absolutely packed full of things to do. Plus, there's always mods if you want more!"
6731,"the more i play the more emersed i get just wish they went back to the morrowind leveling system
"
6732,do the dlc's not come in with the base game no more?
6733,fưck you bethesda for hiding this great game
6734,"I've spent hundreds of hours playing this game on Xbox 360 when it first came out, hundreds more here on steam, and even hundreds more on the special edition. There's almost infinite play-styles you can go for with each character you create. Still one of the best open world rpg games I've played to date and I keep coming back to it when I find myself in a rut with other games."
6735,I guess it's not bad.
6736,"Even after beating the story line there is so much else to do 
"
6737,japierdole dobre
6738,"Over 1500 hours on xbox, and 2000 on ps3. Highly recommend"
6739,"It will suck you in for hundreds, if not thousands of hours of gameplay. So much replayability its almost worth the ridiculous times its been republished. nevertheless, incredible game, 10/10 worth the money 5 times over"
6740,Diverse world that is easily modified to suit your wants.
6741,good
6742,"good
"
6743,dd
6744,great game play
6745,Hated every moment of it. Would not recommend.
6746,"Look at my game hours. Realize most of them are counted from when my game was alt+tabed and my computer was left on. Now, realize still an amazing amount of hours were still spent playing the game. Did I have fun? Yes. Kinda. Mostly trying to recreate my Oblivion moments.

There's no real need for the 10,000th review but mine would say.... Even at the time this came out it felt underwhelming. So many repeatable quests with no purpose to them, a story that doesn't matter in the slightest, an open world that is barren but still full of more content than games in 2021...

I have always slammed this game for being a static world but while it is static, there's a lot of stuff here an it resonates with a lot of people. If you want to just invest time in something and have a mediocre time at worst, this is it. Play this game and feel like part of something you can talk to other people about and be like ""yeah, I did the reddit thing"" and then have sex with your cam girl wife. 

NPC's, you found your home."
6747,"Yes
"
6748,Its skyrim. fucking great game
6749,Skyrim is a classic open-world sandbox game. I have played it through more than once and keep finding new areas to explore and quests to complete.
6750,is skyrim
6751,such an awesome game but its nostalgic and gives me ptsd <3
6752,"ok, but buy the special edition when its on sale it is just better"
6753,gud gam
6754,You already know this is the Best Game Ever! Whoever Lydia in real life is tell her from Wisconsin USA that there is a man here that says she is Beautiful!!!
6755,"Its open world, its so captivating and you just get lost in the game. Most games force you to stick to one story line or one area but the moment you leave the tutorial mission this game lets you go. Your free to roam free, fight what and who you want and just live the life you want your character to lead. There will be points when you have 30 misc missions waiting for you just because you have come across 30 random people in need of help. There are so many routes and choices for you to explore the world and become engulfed. The way each character is so different and diverse you never get bored of coming across a traveller or inn owner and hearing what they have to say. Just give the money and spend hundreds of hours in a never ending journey of fun, frustration and festivities."
6756,"its good 
"
6757,fun
6758,Great Game
6759,.
6760,"A great game, with lots to do and a great sense of adventuring. Still playing after so many years!"

6765,ahaha u so good skyrim but please stop crashing every time i walk through a door
6766,made roggi knot-beard a blade warrior. never been more happy
6767,Is good
6768,"This version is broken, stuck to usage of 4gb ram and stutters terribly. Dont touch if you dont plan to use mods or buy special edition instead."
6769,More than just a game. This is a historical account shrouded in prophecy. This shiiii is life changing on some multidimensional make you see visions from the lives of your ancient ancestors typa stuff. The lore parallels true history; the history that has been rewritten and hidden from us.
6770,"Great game with real depth, rewards exploration"
6771,Tons of fun even 10 years after initial release!
6772,N/A

6789,It is a Legend and there is nothing to add.
6790,Skyrim pre water update

6792,NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE
6793,Still holds up after all these years! One of the all time classics.
6794,aaaa
6795,"The ultimate game, the legend, all time classic. 10/10"
6796,skyrim is god
6797,idk how to explain the mindrot that is this game but I think it takes up 30% of my chilldhood
6798,Whats up with all the glitching?  Audio glitches and visual glitches.....  Unplayable in this condition....
6799,Lizard tits :)
6800,"Nice open world.  ""Gee, I wonder what's down this trail?"""
6801,I've been addicted to this game on and off since I started in 2011... If you know what's good for you and haven't yet been introduced... Don't Start!
6802,"i cant even play the game for 5min without being launched into the stratosphere, it took me 2h just to get through the first cutscene cuz of the bugs its simply big buggy mess and waste of my money and time"
6803,I've played a few hours.  I'll play some more.  Enough said.
6804,mufaka its literately skyrim.
6805,good game :)
6806,best game ever.
6807,"14,000hrs in total over multiple releases still playing and modding.Can't wait for elder scrolls VI: Skyrim II."
6808,"V.Good and amazing game, clearly one of the best games of all time"
6809,"Do people even see these reviews anymore besides just us who bought the game originally, people that don't own the game can't see this anymore"
6810,i turned a dragon in to a chair          grate game 8 out of 10
6811,stealth archer
6812,fight the dragons simulation
6813,How could you not like this game
6814,What's not to like
6815,This should be automatically updated to the Special Edition.... super confusing and dumb.
6816,Skyrim is a good game With alot of stuff to do and alot of mods to make the game more fun Dlcs Feel like a Requirement these times.
6817,"Big time sink, not worth it"
6818,c'mon! it's skyrim.
6819,Skymrim gud gaem
6820,Yeah sure get it.
6821,this game aged well
6822,"[h1] Skyrim is still one of the best games i've played and here's why [/h1]

I don't think it matters if someone says the game is bad or tries to point out one of the ""bad things"" in the game, if you do have something to complain about instead of pointing things out about the game, you'd be better off knocking down their front door and telling Bethesda to improve the game, but a game is just a game if you have fun that matters, if you don't then just play another one, instead of pointing out facts about whatever that makes ""Skyrim"" a bad game

The fact that Skyrim is an Open World/RPG Game, it's still worth playing but with mods installed, that makes it more ""fun"" to play regardless no matter what anyone says about the game. I'd say that playing the game without mods wouldn't be as much fun as it is if it were just me, but i don't think that's the only thing i have to point out about the game anyway

If you were given a choice and you say that you want to play as whoever you want to be like the ""main"" character of your own story, i don't think you'll even be given an option to do so as you were forced to be in some ""plot"" and not be the main character of your own story but instead you end up being a Dragonborn where you have no other options but to save Skyrim and all that, but i think it barely matters at all and it doesn't affect much of your own free will weather you want to continue where you left off with the main story or just do whatever you want like grinding xp, doing some side quests and maybe perhaps get stronger while you're at it but it doesn't make much a difference if you should bother deciding if you want to play the game as it is or just be frustrated that you can't have the option to play as who you want to be but it's not really that much of a big deal if you can't help feeling that way honestly, it's just a game in my opinion so yeah... 

But despite all that, i still love exploring, going to new places, fighting hostile creatures and NPC's, marrying a follower and getting my own home, i can keep going on about what i love doing in the game other than just messing around like an idiot but there's no limit to how much fun i can still have in the game and that's what i value Skyrim as a great game no matter what anyone still says about it, but nothing would ever change my mind about how i feel about the game after all that. If you want to play an Open World/RPG Game then Skyrim is the best game to play but don't let anyone else tell you otherwise if you end up thinking of it as a bad game in terms of bad reviews or facts being pointed out But like i said before a game is just a game if you have fun that matters, if you don't then just play another one"
6823,Love this Game!
6824,"Covid is a hoax
"
6825,a mans man game
6826,"yes.  been playing this game for a very long time, and it
is a lot  of fun."
6827,Very good game *thumbs up emoji*
6828,"I think between this account, my old one i lost access to years ago, and my xbox account my played time is nearer 3 mill hours XD  It's one that you binge, burnout, stop playing, rinse and repeat.. for years.  If you're considering whether to get it here or on console..... definitely get it on steam.  I think you would have access to more mods although idk now, and if you absolutely need a console command to fix a bug in a save game you can only use those cmds on PC.   And I heard the fancy pricier Skyrim is a waste of money since you can just use gfx mods to get the same results"
6829,Possibly one of the best games ever made. It's good with mods or vanilla.
6830,Skyrim belongs to teh Nords!
6831,"It's motherflipping Skyrim, what can I possibly say that hasn't been said before in a million different ways? Fork you Todd, how dare you rerelease this game 8 different times and how dare I be such a dumbass to have bought it like 6 times. This is bullspit, I'm gonna go play more Ultimate Skyrim and go back to pretending like I have healthy consumer habits again."
6832,"It's been 10 years. It's Skyrim. You can mod it until it breaks, but you can never change the fact that it's Skyrim. You already know whether or not it's for you."
6833,It's Skyrim.
6834,"I'm not one of those folks that thinks this is a perfect game, but to say that this game is not legendarily fun would be to lie. I have always loved playing this game and I doubt I will ever get bored of it. There are so many different ways to play and nonsense that you can do that you can almost always find a bunch of new stuff to do."
6835,"This game saved my marriage. 
My wife speaks dragonborn."
6836,"Even though its not as good as the previous enstalments in this franchise, it is still a very beautiful and fun game with lots to offer to even the most casual players that love fantasy settings."
6837,"I played Skyrim since 6 Years ago, and its still one of the best games, I have ever played.
Its just super fun to walk around and see, what is going on in this world... 

Big thumb up for this game, I hope The Elderscrolls VI will be better, even its hard to top Skyrim.
Absolutly love the game <3"
6838,"Very good game, but not better than yo momma sitting on me."
6839,I've played it for a bit. I've done almost anything there is to do. Haven't finished the main story yet. And i never will
6840,yes
6841,"If I could get past that fucking cart glitch at the beginning of the game I'd have something fonder to say about it, but even without that it's the worst Elder Scrolls game in the franchise. Just play Morrowind or ESO instead and don't give Bethesda money for this trash."
6842,yes
6843,One of the greatest adventures that compute games have to offer - unparalleled
6844,yeah its good
6845,Love this game!
6846,Its Skyrim just buy it if you get bored drop some mods on the game and play it all over again
6847,"Sadly they hid this from the store, but this is a lot better than the special edition and is where the modding community is still to this day"
6848,its not bad
6849,fun
6850,hey. it is pretty okay. i marry lizard
6851,"It''s Skyrim, what else to say?"
6852,its fun I guess
6853,"Good job todd howard, a perfectly balanced game."
6854,So good I've bought it three times!
6855, it very much fun play
6856,"Best open world game of all time, and i'm saying this a decade after it was made. Probs the best game to ever exist"
6857,you know you want to give Isaac Newton nightmares just for 1000 septims with this game
6858,The best RPG ever
6859,cant go wrong with skyrim
6860,"Pretty good so far, might start the main quest soon :)"
6861,Good Game. Play it and see.
6862,When i first discovered this game I played it for about a year. Game is re-playable. In it's vanilla state it's decent but I usually play with 30+ mods to improve it's graphics/gameplay.
6863,yes
6864,the best background and graphic and atmospheric role playing game on the market
6865,"The fact that this game is still thriving almost 11 years later just goes to show you just how legendary Skyrim really is, not to mention, the community is absolutely incredible. The modding community has completely reinvented Skyrim adding endless possibilities to an already outstanding masterpiece. It's your destiny to become the Dragonborn!

Will always be one of the greatest games of all time!
10/10 Skyrim"
6866,Yes.
6867,bro you get to kill dragons and marry lizard ladies whats NOT to love
6868,One of the best open world games of all time.
6869,excellent dungeon and dragons style game.
6870,"Too bad the Elder Scrolls VI is coming out anytime soon,
so lets just stay in Skyrim for a while longerrr."
6871,"If I need  to write a review for anyone at this point, contact me...I wanna know what it's been like finally emerging from your y2k shelter."
6872,fun game with lots of stuff to do and great dlcs
6873,"should never have smoked that skooma...

6876,"If nothing else, Fus Ro Dah a goat off of a cliff."
6877,Shallow story and uninspired combat. It's like Bethesda didn't really try at all with this one. Great for modding tho
6878,"What can you say about Skyrim that hasn't been said? It's a great, immersive game with an excellent modding community to tweak it to your liking. You can always come back to Skyrim and never be bored because there is always something to do."
6879,"I mean what can I say about this game. The amount of hours one can put into this game is absolutely unreal, thousands and thousands of hours can be poured into this game without losing any interest in it whatsoever. To add on to that, the bugs that come from Bethesda games gives it such character that no other game has. BUY IT you will not be disappointed."
6880,Actually I have a few thousand hours like I have on SE.
6881,There is always a reason to restart Skyrim.
6882,It's Skyrim. Duh.
6883,"Fun game with great gameplay and modding capabilities. At this point I would recommend the Special Edition, though, as it has caught up in regards to modding and is much more stable."

6885,"Drinks for the thirsty,food for the hungry.."
6886,"this game blown my socks off.. in fact i dont think ive ever worn the same pair of socks since. i might have lost my socks, the same way i lost my mind, because in fact this game blew my mind away. this game isnt in the right direction, this game has reached the destination. If you want to keep your socks on i dont recomend playing it."
6887,sex
6888,"Its one of the best games of its kind. An almost endless supply of adventures and challenges, with all sorts of rewards for completing them as tasks. And the vastness of the world its set in is unreal with just how much territory there is you can go within the game, where you can claim little pieces of your own as a citizen of a township in several cities within the entire realm."
6889,"TBH i'm only here to pick flowers, hoard cheese, and court the love of my life. Pretty chill game if you let it be."
6890,it just works.
6891,"It's g0d da3n good, all I can say. I love how damage is visually appropriate to weapon type too."
6892,Keep coming back to this one after so many years!
6893,skyrim
6894,"if you take the heavy armor perk to do gauntlets defense in damage and put the pugilist enchantment on ebony gauntlets and play a khajiit, you can max out unarmed damage without mods and that's p cool

you can begome werewolf and set up shop in an abandoned shack and run around chasing deer and terrorizing bandits and ignore quests and that's also p cool

my dog likes the whiterun night soundtrack and goes to sleep when she hears it and that is the best cool"
6895,"It ages badly, but other than graphics (mind the game came out in 2011, that's 10 years ago) this is simply an RPG classic. First time I played it I was so sucked into the open world of Skyrim and its hundreds of sidequests and possibilities for your own character. It's still playable with mods, thanks to the very active modding community - so if you still haven't played it yet, it might get a little difficult to get into it, as it's so old, but I think it will be worth it."
6896,Fantastic game
6897,There is nothing else like it
6898,Best computer rpg ever made.
6899,Best game
6900,A bit hard to figure out what to do but otherwise amazing game.

I reccomend this game if you get it it is very good.

Mr Howard was that good enough? Can I have my family back?"
6904,Awesome game.
6905,ITS GREAT AND WITH A GREAT STORY
6906,"An over hyped gamed.  Good, yes, however I am giveing this game a no, as a test of time.  I forsee in the future people will join my side.  So here it goes.

Without the modding community, this game would have not gone as far as it has.  Hell Bethesda would not have gone as far as it had too.  This game Killed Bethesda.  Well it was killed earlier, but people will point to this game in the end.  If you want to prove me wrong, list how many games Bethesda's main studio made before Skyrim, and after.

Ya most of their games are now made by 3-party.  Even the tie in online game.  

As for game-play.  I say it is less of a RPG and more of a Open world.  Best fun is just messing around and looking for new things to spend a hot min looking at, after which you move on, and forget.  That sums up Bethesda's mind set for game over 20 years now."
6907,L***** L** ftw
6908,awezome
6909,Nice
6910,"One of those games that becomes a part of your life. Almost my favorite game, if not my favorite."
6911,It;s a fantastic game still years after if's debut.
6912,its alright.
6913,"This game never gets old. Play vanilla or with mods, you will have a great time."
6914,"best game ever made,on console i have more then 300+ hours now i am playing on pc"
6915,Wanna buy more burgers?
6916,"This game, in tandem with the Special Edition version, allows us to play all 4 character types.
Archer, melee, Destruction, other mage.
Playing a bit of several is frustrating. Returning to play the original game is refreshing.
Vampire in this vanilla game is a lot different to Vampire in Special edition.
Werewolf in this vanilla game can be a bear in the Special edition. I recommend having both versions."
6917,Good game
6918,Great Open World
6919,It's just Skyrim
6920,o
6921,the replayability of this game makes bethesda rich. let them take my money i just want lydia

6931,"This game created a career for me and changed my life. My playtime isn't accurate since I played this on PS3 first and repurchased it on PC for modding purposes.

My Nexus username is/was djekmiami and I was known for marketing other modders' mods with my characters. They would send me their unreleased/WIP mods and I would essentially have my characters ""model"" their mods and send them the screenshots of it. They would then later use the screenshots in their mod pages and adverts.

10 years ago I was 29, now I'm 39. This game created an avenue of art that I had never explored and because of it I now work in the 3d development industry. I am proficient in 3ds Max, ZBrush, Substance Painter and so many other 3d softwares that I use in my career.

I support my family because of it and will be able to do so for years to come.

It's definitely not common to be able to say a ""video game changed my life"" and thankfully, I am one of those who can say it.

fus ro dah for life

The story line is the best one out of all the games that i have played so far!
I just purchased the 3 DLC's and i am hoping that it will be even better!
I also love the graphics not to realistic and not to not realistic.
overall a awesome game.
would recommend!!

6956,i played this game all of my childhood and every time i went back to it it was always so fun sure it was a little buggy and crazy at times but with the mods and all it was fun
6957,I have literally played this game forever and have thousands of hours. Probably favourite game ever.
6958,Great game for green lantern
6959,"Skyrim sets a new benchmark at its time of release.  This is an undisputed open world as the player can choose where to go once outside the tutorial area.  

Exploring the Skyrim world is the core fun of the game.  There are plenty of non-auto-generated quests, charismatic NPCs, interesting stories and beautiful scenes.  The main story will not take long to complete.  To fully explore the Skyrim world could easily take hundreds of hours.

Each of the different play styles also provides unique game experiences.  Sneak archer, Wizard and Sword man have different strengths and fun.  It is also very free to build the character in whatever way desired as there is no character class concept.

Achievements are not difficult but will take many hours to complete as the game contents related to the achievements are huge.  The only missable achievement is to get sufficient number of Daedra artifacts.  DLCs are required for full achievements."
6960,people who play vanilla skyrim are weird but also 100 mods later ulfric showed me his pp and that was also weird
6961,Better than Skyrim special editien in my opinion. :)
6962,Simply a perfect RPG!
6963,"With mods, this game is 10/10
Vanilla? somewhere near 6/10
 Only my opinion though"

"
6969,one of the greatest games ever made
6970,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the most overrated, intolerable games in video game history. The community continues to boast this game as if it's some kind of masterpiece while simultaneously engaging and speculating it's inherent flaws. To put it simple: Skyrim is dog shit. But beyond that, the likable, more respected aspects of the game often fail to engage the players in anything worth spending more than 5 minutes on. Really - it's boring. For example, the open world. It's an ""open world RPG"" after all, right? Well, marketed - yes! Execution? Not even fucking close. The world is boring and often swallowed by the horrible mountain placements. 99% of which have no reason to even fucking exist outside of aesthetic purposes. This leaves a player with more than 60 IQ wondering, ""Why even have a map this large if 90% of it is the same boring field surrounded by lifeless mountains?"" And that sentient human would be asking a valid question! WHY are we being marketed an open-world as if it's some kind of second life experience? You could cut Skyrim's map down to 5% of what it currently is and the game would only then deliver what's been marketed. The story is by far the worst aspect. It's somehow the longest-shortest story I've ever played that has been successful in making me vomit, fall asleep, and uninstall 4 times before completing. Oh, and the difficulty? It's piss water. The game is much too easy on EVERY difficulty so the only way to make a boring game have some kind of entertainment would be to make the game at least challenging, right? right??? No, Bethesda does not think so. Weapons are often bland and overpowered. Magic is cool but absolutely too strong and over-prescribed, and nearly every other combat mechanic can be summed up to dog shit baby mode. I can't continue to relive the sad time that I had playing this truly egregious game. I am feeling a very light 2/10 on this shit can game. With a final message of, this game is ass."
6971,This game is legendary!
6972,Glitchy as a game can be while still being a solid 8/10. Streamlined gameplay and soulless graphics take off roughly half a point each. Looking forward to trying Morrowind!

6990,It's Skyrim. The best thing that came of out Todd Howard fantasy wise.
6991,yeah cool even after a few years
6992,one of the all time G.O.A.T RPG/video games.
6993,Have you heard of the High Elves?
6994,"Game stutters everytime it loads a tree, but it's cool."
6995,"I wanted to toss in a review on the original, since the special edition does not reflect my playtime with Skyrim as a whole. While janky, the game itself offers a significant improvement over Oblivion's mechanics and playstyles. Leveling is very straightforward, and it is especially easy to ""roleplay' your desired class if one choses to do so. I think my only real beef with the game as a whole would be the story telling. Guild quests end up the same, and the main story is pretty basic. The quality of the game really shines when presented the amount of content you have available. Doing a full 100% playthrough will take quite some time, and is a big plus for many people. Being on PC, you can usually fix quest bugs, but they are only here and there. I do recommend the unoffical patch though, as Bethesda has abandoned fixing the game (for some time). Highly recommended, though grab the special edition if you can."
6996,SKYRIM or nothing
6997,decent zone out game for me. I enjoy hunting the guards for sport as well as foraging for rare alchemical ingredients for my own nefarious purposes.
6998,"gud game
"
6999,this game is so much fun to play on steam
7000,"Game is so hopelessly bugged that you need to install multiple addons to run it, and then the game crashes because you have Addons! Classic Bethesda."
7001,"Will not launch no matter what I do. Thanks but no thanks Bathesda. You've turned into trash.
"
7002,"Been borderline housebound off and on for years (anyone who lived through 2020 has had a taste of how maddening that can be) and have used Skyrim to cure my boredom more times than I can count. It basically saved my sanity. I've played for over a thousand hours now and I'm still discovering new things in-game (admittedly it can get old playing some of the same quests over and over, but I find a certain amount of repetition and predictability comforting, and there are plenty of great mods out there to shake things up if that's what you want). 

Also, I don't have the budget to get a machine that can run the latest games, but I can still run this one, at least on low/medium graphics settings (while the Special Edition is a no-go). So if your rig is a borderline potato like mine and you love RPGs and Choices Matter gameplay (and, like me, tend to be waaaaay behind the curve in terms of checking out popular titles), this might be the game for you."
7003,"Say uh I been trying to play the Special Edition and the Legendary Edition but for some reason they just won't work. After I pass the Logo screen for Legendary Edition it crashes and Special Edition won't even run. Am I the only one dealing with this issue or is this some kind of bug that's happening without knowing it's there? 

But before it happened I will say I love The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim but I do wish there's a Skyrim Together mod that would work well with Steam Workshop and NexusMods and not just Harbor. I will love to keep playin this but it won't let me play this game which kinda makes me sad that I can't play my favorite Game."

7019,Great game still after 10 years.

This is a interactive rpg game, with everything your childhood version of yourself would love. Dragons, vampires, werewolves, trolls, magic, DRAGONS, and more to see then you've probably imagined. It's really interactive and allows you to speak for yourself a little while at the same time making sure you don't do anything stupid. You get to customize yourself in here, adopt kids (who adopt pets, which is random so keep that in mind). You can also marry someone in here, man or women and they can either be a companion to you or stay at home and run a store while you are out fighting. You can buy houses and kill people (if done carefully). So many things to do in this game"
7068,It's Skyrim. If you don't know what it is just from talking to random people in the world by this point then move along.

7089,"I started my journey, full of excitement. Then I took an arrow to my knee.

Undeterred, I carried forward into the dungeons aplenty. Alas, I took an arrow to my knee.

I learned shouts of power, amazing as they may be yet once again, I took an arrow to my knee. 

Valiant and grandiose with moments of repose, startled I had taken another arrow to my knee.

Finally I had conquered, pillaged and and laboured - strength with no limit, no dragon lived could match it.

Peace at last, nay - the guard shot another arrow in my knee.


Across all platforms I couldn't tell you how many hours I have in this game. I originally purchased on release day as a physical disc purchase for PC. Then again on PS3. I was a sucker for the enhanced edition on PS4 and here we are once again rounding the platform content to a new medium.

The game... Well, it's frankly stale. 

The sandbox aspect can still yield some fun, some time killing goodness. But the game feels far more broken then I ever remembered it - however that's simply the age of the game showing itself. It made the RPG scene relevant again, in a time when every game was FPS and multiplayer, and thanks to it The Witcher series spread it's wings to starve this world of life.

Mods have taken over the core of the game, and again there will be fun within that way - but all that aside the reality is this.

The story, is short - boring and is essentially a series of fetch quests. The dialogue is not intriguing, nor is the premise of the game in itself. Oblivion did better, and Morrowind takes the cake narratively speaking. Lines are repeated, encounters feel janky, and the system feels like the product of a game that's a decade old nearly.

Is it worth playing? 

Yes. If you've never experienced Skyrim, or a similar genre before then go for it! If you've played this game before, save the 'experience' for how you remember it. 

Besides, wait for a few more years for them to come up with a Skyrim HD:VR in 8k..... After the next four releases come out."
7090,Best and most replayable game of all times
7091,Everything
7092,yes
7093,Mod it till it crashes. 10/10
7094,"Wow. I mean, really. I have over 2000 hours clocked on this and is one of if not the best game i have played. there is so much opportunity with this game and replay ability. Even if you get bored this is the most modded game out there. 10/10"
7095,Sweet game.
7096,I dislike how we cant get good!
7097,wizards are sexy
7098,What can you say about this game that hasn't been said. Greatly immersive and the modding capability is epic
7099,voos ro deez nuts
7100,DND but FPS. Pretty sick.
7101,I find Skyrim boring but it's still a good play.
7102,"Much more to like than dislike, while not perfect many parts are amazing and fun."
7103,Skyrim belongs to the mudcrabs!
7104,The Best RPG ever...
7105,skrim :)
7106,"If anyone hasn't yet played this game you either hate games or just blind to the religion that is Todd Howard, 

There's already way too many reviews, blogs, and people recommending as there are mods for this game, which is a lot..to say the least. 

The story: As per Bethesda tradition you wake up a bound prisoner. Caught by the Imperials while ""trying to cross the border"", and are about to be wrongfully executed when suddenly a dragon crashes the tea party. You manage to find escape from its assault, and enter your first dungeon of the game where you are introduced to the two main factions of the game. You fight through the dungeon, pick your first lock, encounter spiders that are way too big, sneak past a bear(or fight it cause nothing can stop you) and find the exit. You emerge out and get your first view of Skyrim. The sound of the wind, the snow covered trees, vast open sky gives the feeling of being inside your house on a snow day. You are now free to embark on your journey to find out why the dragons have returned only to uncover a bigger role in the events of Elder Scrolls Universe while exploring the detailed and mystical world of Skyrim.

7107,"one of finest bethesda's work
memorable game 
10/10"
7108,Didn't see too many Redguards
7109,i enjoy
7110,yes
7111,Bruh it's Skyrim. What else is there to say? It's one of the best single player rpg experiences ever unless you are real hard core and like oblivion. Modding this game is incredible.
7112,"I love this game.  With all of the mods that can be installed every new game is a little different.  I play ESO as well, but keep coming back to this game."
7113,OOOOOOOF
7114,"I got my first real gaming console (my PC) about a year ago. One of the games I wanted to play at the time was Skyrim. I got it a little over 2 months ago. It did not disappoint.

The first thing in this game is the character creation. It's fun and in-depth with plenty of races to choose from. The game lets you fight in pretty much any way you want, so picking the right race for your ""class"" is important, but not mandatory.

The combat is simple. I have a lot of fun with it. Swordplay is a simple slice, block, and power attack system. It's definitely not extraordinary in any way, but once you get the rhythm down it's pretty good. The magic attacks are also very simple, mostly just throwing flames at people or summoning things to fight with you.

There is no real class system; which is fun and boring at the same time. Want to make a heavily armored brute who just swings steel? Pretty easy to do that. Want to make a mage who obliterates everything in its path with a high damage output? Pretty easy to do that. Want to make a heavily armored wizard who summons magical weapons for a high damage output? Pretty easy to do that too. My biggest problem is that the progression for the skills in the game is too simple. Everything is just boosting damage, protection, or effectiveness of magic. There are no NEW skills to learn, new magic spells are only exciting for a little while, and combat is about the same at level 30 as it is at level 5. I think that this is a common complaint about this game: it's not a TRUE RPG. But that's OK with me; it's still fun.

The story is alright and gets the job done. The lore is interesting and there are lots of cool places to explore. My biggest complaint is that, once you've finished a quest, you've seen about 5 other quests. Most quests, aside from the main story and a handful of side quests, are similar: Go to a cave, beat up some bandits, come back with *thing*.

The music is fantastic. 'Nuff said.

I'm not sure what else to say about this game. There is nothing that I think Skyrim does THE BEST. But it's GOOD at everything it tries to do. This combines to make a very enjoyable experience. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time."
7115,"Truly one of Bethesda's greatest works to date. I would place Skyrim in the top 10 greatest action RPGs of all time. Like all of their games it was mired in quite a few bugs when it was initially released. However, provided you are open to modding, most everything, if not at least the critical game breaking bugs, have been fixed. This is the first review I have done for a Bethesda game and I think it bears saying that the modding community should be applauded for their efforts. Bethesda games quite literally would not be as good as they currently are if it were not for dedicated individuals that do a great many hours of work with no promise of pay whatsoever.

If I had to use a metaphor to describe the game, and this one gets used a lot, both in a postive and negative way. It is as if Call of Duty had a child with Oblivion. As if an FPS had a baby with an RPG. This description has been used in a negative light. That argument usually centers around the idea that Skyrim is too casual for an RPG. Many times when a game is called ""casual,"" it simply means the game is simple to understand. There are some gaming elitists who, for some reason, think that is a bad thing. I respectfully disagree.

Skyrim's gameplay is very straightforward. The skill progression is meaningful, with most advancements bearing a direct impact in gameplay, and they are easy to understand. This is a very big game with a great many ways of playing. The replay-ability is through the roof. I truly think a big reason for Skyrim's continued success is because it is a game that has a little something for everyone. No matter how you would like to approach this world's problems, you will likely find a satisfying path forward. Some call the game too casual or easy. There are a several difficulty levels to choose from and they can be changed at any time without affecting achievement progression. I consider myself a Skyrim pro with over a thousand hours, dozens of characters, and I still find the game challenging at times. Legendary difficulty is no joke.

Skyrim's graphics have aged incredibly well and I still, on occasion, find myself just staring out over some scenic view. It is easy to become immersed and really enjoy the fantasy. Skyrim's story format is very scripted. You will have your share of choices and some of them will shape the very political spectrum of the land or the fates of some races or the temperament of the gods... So save often, because unless you're going to look everything up, there is the chance of a decision you make have long-term repercussions you may not enjoy.

Summary... Great game but in order to reach its full potential you're going to need to become familiar with modding. Gameplay easy to understand but challenging. Graphics are good. Story is good but save often cause your decisions might bother you later."
7116,"May be an old game, but it is still fun to play and mod, despite crashes and bugs from time to time"
7117,"Got stuck at a cave where it was just going around the checkpoints glitched and couldn't fix it neither with mods.
But I love the game and lore would recommend Nexus Mods for it."
7118,Is gud
7119,10
7120,"game speaks for itself. mods make it even better
"
7121,"Ive owned this game for quite a while and have recently upgraded my gaming computer. When I tried to download this game from my library, a file seems to be missing... I just want to play this game which I absolutely love... AND ALREADY OWN.."
7122,Swagy
7123,"This game is truly timeless and you discover new things each time you play it. Memorable characters, the wild landscape, the armor and weapons and the music are positively splendid."
7124,"Skyrim is probably the most overrated video game ever made. For some reason it's marketed as this epic RPG even though there is zero rolplaying to be done here.
It is also immensely shallow. This game was made with the player as an afterthought. None of the choices you make in Skyrim matter. YOU do not matter. You could replace the player character with generic guard #1143 and it would still be the exact same. 
Unless you're a fucking baby who enjoys looting the same copy pasted dungeon over and over again, I cannot recommend this game"
7125,skrim
7126,good
7127,I LOVE IT
7128,"I think Skyrim is one of the most captivating role-playing games this generation. Each setting looks amazingly special and the artistic side of the game is just brilliant. This game is deeper and bigger than anything that we expected. Thanks for the community, there are TONS of mods, if you already bored the 100+ hours of gameplay. 10/10"
7129,cool
7130,this shit says i have 206 hours but imma keep it g real i got over 5000 spread out across all platforms and i can confirm this game is goated.
7131,This is my go to one player game. I can get lost in the barrows and catacombs for a long time killing mobs. I just wish there was more...
7132,"Where do you start with Skyrim? I mean, do I start with the iconic opening? The Scenery? The STORY?! Skyrim is one of those rare gems, where you just get lost in time. I have bought this, on every single console, and everytime I play this it's a whole new experience. If you've already played before, switch up the race before you default to Khajit again - Don't get me wrong, BUT this is my fifth Skyrims play through and the first on PC and I tell ya, College of Winterhold, Destruction magic...worth it. Absolutely Worth it. 
If your reading this and considering whether or not you should buy it - Yes, you should buy it. The scenery is breathtaking, the combat invigorating. And don't get me started on the frost trolls, those fellas come at you out of nowhere, tough buggers. Buy the game, enjoy the frick out of it, and slay some dragons!!

It might only say that I've played 99 Minutes on PC, but trust me when I tell you, I lost entire weeks in school holidays playing this, It is worth every penny you buy. And don't get me started on all the Modding Capabilities...
Enjoy guys!

7146,"Let's take a journey on why this is one of the best games that I've ever played.

Once in a while there is a game that changes your life. A game that allows you to indulge yourself in a world full of wonder and fantasy. Now as a keen RPG player, the Elder Scrolls series has long been in my heart. I only started on ES3 Morrowind but since then, I have always felt an unbreakable bond to this series.

ESV Skyrim has been the one game in the series that has claimed most of time. My hours played on Steam are nowhere near my total hours played on Xbox 360 since its release in 2011, so bear that in mind when you're reading this.

Skyrim is beautiful.

Being one of the most anticipated games of its time it's not difficult to see why. If it isn't the geographical setting of the world that blows you away then it has to be the soundtrack. Jeremy Soule rose to be one of my favourite composers of all time, equalling the sheer brilliance and majesty of Hans Zimmer just because of his soundtrack for Skyrim. The OST personifies fantasy. If I was to think of a score to play during any fantasy board game, tabletop game or even another fantasy video game, I would pick Skyrim any day. It is frequently played on loop whenever I do other hobbies too, it's just perfection - In fact I'm writing this review and listening to it...

As I previously mentioned, Skyrim's geographical setting seats you in the world of Nirn, on the continent of Skyrim to be precise. Now imagine a land of mountains and dark crypts, marshlands and lush forests, raging rivers and frozen ice wastes - Essentially think what Iceland would be like on fantasy steroids. Skyrim encapsulates the beauty of the natural world and fuses it with the magical elements of the fantasy genre, essentially creating the ultimate fantasy immersion machine. To say you can get lost for hours in this vast and vibrant world is a massive understatement. Not only is the overground absolutely stunning, but the locations that the story can take you in the undergrounds are also equally breathtaking. Seeing the dwarven ruins of old in the deepest depths of the world will always remain a fond memory, and it never gets old with a new replay.

As a role playing game, Skyrim allows you to free roam across the land, picking up quests and encountering quite the plethora of weird and wonderful beings. All this is accompanied by a skilling system that allows you to focus on particular abilities to help you along in the world. What the game does offer you is the ability to try everything, which seems a little OP but at least it allows for a completely open game. Now certain skills will definitely not be as effective as others, especially late-game, but you can still have fun with them nevertheless. This also opens the replay value right up, trying out different character builds and play styles.
Gameplay-wise Skyrim has an intuitive combat system that is more familiar with first person combat games, making it easier and more digestible which allows you to pick up the game very easily.

In comparison to its predecessors, Skyrim does lack ever so slightly in lore and storytelling. I believe Skyrim to be more of a consumable game than Oblivion or Morrowind. That being said, it is still a very deep game with plenty of lore to read up on and immerse yourself with. ES 3 + 4 both had incredible depth to them and ES 3 was more about the storytelling than the nitty gritty of swinging a sword, however it did build a platform for RPGs that completely revolutionised how they were made and played. It's clear to see with Skyrim just how far we've come with RPGs and it's wonderful that it's a part of the same series. 

The story of Skyrim is fantastic. I understand that there are a select few that find it tedious but I've never understood why. The DLC also really add a lot more to the game and fleshes out other aspects of the Elder Scrolls universe that you may not know even existed. One DLC in particular, Dragonborn, has plenty of nods to ES 3 that just provides a beautiful heartfelt emotion for fans of the series - Hearing that Silt Strider call shall forever be etched into my memory and was not something I expected to hear whilst playing Skyrim.

I honestly could write for hours about what this game means to me. Some of the stories I've heard from other players such as being saved from suicide because of how much they were able to escape from our world to this fantasy world; it really makes you think about what an impact this game has had on so many lives.

I would absolutely say that this is probably the best game I have ever played. Despite its (now) 10 year age, Skyrim doesn't feel badly dated. I would however recommend modding the game's graphics and overhauling the general look of things such as trees and water to bring it closer to modern day graphics (just for extra immersion).
As much as I am eagerly anticipating ES6, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will always remain installed on my playlist, and I will fondly return to it and enjoy every second of gameplay. This is purely not a title to brush aside.

10/10"
7147,I mean...  It's Elder Scrolls...  What more should anyone have to say?
7148,I got some mods and it wont  launch it crashes before it says load continue and new please help I want to play skyrim
7149,only good thing todd howard has done
7150,this game sucks ass
7151,Go fetch me something simulator
7152,Not bad
7153,"I honestly play this game to mod it to play like a another game another game, oldrim is goated"
7154,shits boring as fuck
7155,Will forever be one of my favorite games.
7156,wafvdfs
7157,Literally the best game of all time.
7158,"Have played the game through several times now, so easy to return to and re play. Fantastic game mechanics, excellent skill progression, and story lines that will entertain for hours, no matter your style of play. The modding community is incredible, with some amazing game-extending mods or just silly changes. Would recommend to anyone."
7159,"To be clear, I love Skyrim. This game can be a lot of fun with [strike] MANY [/strike] a few mods, and I have had hundreds of hours of fun with it, but as a vanilla experience I cannot recommend it. Sure, the lore is interesting enough if your into that, but I found this game's story to be sorta bland, at least in comparison to earlier games in the series (such as Morrowind). This game feels like it wasn't made for PC, and the menus can be kind of annoying to navigate. Gameplay-wise its just not that deep. Magic is in my opinion really boring as the spells don't feel very distinct, and different kinds of weapons feel mostly the same as well. Of course, many of these issues can be fixed with mods, but as a vanilla experience I just can't recommend it."
7160,yes
7161,LEGEND STATUS
7162,A little glitchy but still excellent.
7163,Endless game play with mods.
7164,"Its one game i enjoy playing, fairly easy to understand how play."
7165,"Nobody needs my thoughts on this game at this late date.  But if I were to go back in time and advise the Bethesdans I would say, ""You know what this game needs?  More Draugrs.  More twisty crypts of draugrs.  And bandits.  Later falmers.""  But seriously, it's a great game - more like a second life.  I've started carrying a pickaxe with me wherever I go IRL, JIC I find a rich vein of Moooooonstone.  Creamy, delicious moonstone.  I can stand in dragon's breath and kill them with ease but I can't improve magic items even though I'm up to my keister in leather armor - and boots - kiss the shiny shiny boots of leather.  Just don't enchant them before you improve them.  Such a game - hunting for magic walls, gawking at ale house wenches, knifing terrible bards (in my mind), wondering why the same bi-gendered sassy kid is everywhere I go, accidentally selling 74 flawless amethysts to a broke old lady for 20 gold - if only real life could be this rich.  If only I could shoot flames from my upraised hand into the faces of my friends and family for minutes on end and do no damage - so useful those flames.  If only I could fast travel to all the places I've ever been, only to be greeted by a charging polar bear for some reason and discover that I've equipped a healing spell.  Those were the days.  These are the days.  Killing dragons and stealing their souls in the service of ventriloquy.  What a world."
7166,I've played this game across different platforms since it first came out in 2011 and still to this day it's fun to open up and get lost in for hours. Playing on PC with mods adds to the fun.
7167,"Why are you reading a review for Skyrim? It is Skyrim, one of the greatest games of all time with one of the greatest modding communities of all time. Just buy the game and play it. It has stood the test of time, and if there is something you do not like you can just download a mod to fix it. I love this game and you will too!"
7168,Fus ro dah!
7169,"Always been a fan of TES series and while I only started with Skyrim I have gone back and played Oblivion and I also played ESO when it came out. I enjoy the lore of the TES universe and Skyrim is still one of my all time favourite games. Its always fun to jump in and immersive myself within the world especially with mods which help drive my own unique and designed experience. I lose myself for hours within this game completing both base game and mod quest lines. While this game has always had it's fair share of bugs nearly all are solvable with mods making the game practically sound. I always preferred the LE version over SE however in the coming future it is more than likely that modding will be on the same level as LE. 

Fus Ro Dah!"
7170,boobs
7171,j
7172,"The modding community carries this game hard, but the base game is still fairly fun. The original visuals look extremely dated these days, so modding is definitely required to update the look of the game. I do wish it had more interesting combat rather than just hold down the mouse button and do damage, but the exploration aspect of the game is still very fun to do.

I don't think there are any real benefits to playing this version of the game rather than the updated ""Special Edition."""

7174,its ok
7175,It's pretty good

7181,I think moto moto likes you.
7182,good gem
7183,"open world, some hack and slash, skill trees, rpg, story line, easy controls, whats not to like? too many items to interact with that don't do anything"
7184,"This is a strange one but here me out - Skyrim is quite easy to dip in and out of.  You can clock on for half an hour, have a good time clearing out a dungeon, and then go to bed.  The story isn’t at the heart of the game (unlike most RPG’s), so you can put it down and pick it off at any stage and not feel too much like you’re missing out.

I suspect this one works better if you’re familiar with the game already, I doubt you’d have time to get into it if you haven’t played before.  I’d suggest setting up three or four characters of different races and specialisations, and then seeing where things take you (as opposed to focussing on a specific storyline or outcome)."
7185,"Big map, nice story, and the mods are endless."
7186,"I love wandering in open worlds because there are so many things to discover for the first time even though you have finishedthe game many times before.   Skyrim is well-balanced when it comes to defining your character, role playing, exploring, fighting, and casting spells.  You are free to do all of it or none of it."
7187,The version Todd Howard wants you to forget about.
7188,Best game ever!
7189,"Have always loved this game so much, Don't start modding, you will NEVER STOP!! Trust me XD
Great game, and still is after all these years."
7190,good
7191,"Very big immersive world, you can play for a long time."
7192,"Fun to play, has a bug where the scroll function stops working every so often, requires you to restart game to fix."
7193,"Games is old, but super fun. I have purchased it on Xbox 360, PC, and Switch. Switch is by far the best for portability to play. but the Mods on PC can completely change the game, which is what I use my PC copy for."
7194,I have almost 5000 hours into this game. There is always something new to find or do. Mods or no mods. This is my favorite game. Right up my alley.
7195,"Been around so long, this game... Still discovering new things years later! If you like magic, if you like fantasy, even if you like picking flowers, this game is for you! You can relax and get lost in the wonderful Nirn land of Skyrim."
7196,"""Skyrim is life, Skyrim is love"" - the words of a drunken imperial"

7200,"I mean it's Skyrim.  Vanilla game alone is 10/10, DLCs aren't 10/10, and then once you add mods, it's even better.  I mean I'm playing this game a decade after it came out and it's still fantastic and I still haven't seen or experienced anything.  And the modding community is top notch and you'll find amazing mods that will just add even more time into the game."
7201,"Game wont even start up properly, i start tumbling down the mountain."
7202,thomas the dank engine must have mod
7203,Ale
7204,this game is great just play it
7205,"This game was extraordinary – in those times. Today it appears so shallow, bad dialogues, clumsy controls. I feel a bit nostalgic, but that's all, sorry."
7206,"Dont forget to name your character or it'll auto name you Prisoner. Anyways good game, so much fun, it still hasnt gotten old to me, I cant wait for the next Elder Scrolls to lose myself in."
7207,Hands down one of the best games.
7208,Love the graphics
7209,Absolutely love this game and the mods only make it better
7210,Buying this game will be the best decision of your life.
7211,"Ever since I purchased a used Nintendo 64 system, over 25 years ago, with the game Ocarina of Time, I became a hooked and addicted gamer. Since playing that game along with many other exciting ones, 

I wondered why were in cartoon format. That is, until The Elder Scrolls V Sky-Rim game was created. I wanted a game that was sophisticated and had realistic people with an appealing realistic story, and real looking scenery. I liked that it was an open world where I could travel wherever I wanted and collect herbs to make potions, and gather metals to make weapons to use and sell.

There is an occult element in the game that some might not appreciate.

The scenery in the game is so realistic and breath -takingly beautiful!

The Elder Scroll V is my favorite game which I have played over and over again since it first came out. It is one of the most comprehensive and exciting game with many quests. Still waiting for the next Elder Scroll addition...?

7224,"As a introvert, this game provides a repetitive comfort for me. I was in a bad place in high school. Severely depressed, lonely, and questioning my sexuality (and eventually gender). Skyrim provided a safe haven for me to keep coming back to. With lovable characters and ones that are easy to hate, this is somewhere I can have a noticeable impact on the world, even if it is in a video game. I literally have a Skyrim tattoo on my arm, to commemorate it. Without Skyrim, I legitimately don't know where I would be today."

7230,"[H1]What can I say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said?[/H1] Steam did a wonderful job at stopping the constant freezing and glitching issues that seemed to plague this game for console gamers leaving nothing but the beautiful story and experience we always wished we would have when this game was first released. This game is PERFECT for anyone looking to revisit a favorite or just starting out in the gaming world. You have hours upon hours of leveling and adventures ahead of you with characters you'll love, and..... some you shall absolutely want to kill. This game draws you into a wonderful world of magic and adventure with several difficulty settings that can make it a challenge for even the most experience player. If your looking to stare at a screen and waste hours upon hours of your life away then look no further, this is the game for you :D 5/5"
7231,5 stars perfection
7232,"If you've seen the Harry Partridge animated short about the teaser then you basically know how obsessed I was when this game was announced.

I still play this game 10 years later, and I still sing that song in my head."
7233,"There are exploits, there are glitches, but it has fewer glitches than ES:Oblivion did (and I loved that until I couldn't get rid of vampirism because the NPC would not show up). I love the range of ways to play (though I think they nerf archers by allowing enemies so much speed over rough terrain to close) and the vast number of side quests. If you don't push the main storyline quests along, you can dally through many side quests. It has replayability given the paths you can take, the things you choose to build into a character, and so on. It's fun to try to read all the books and see text, book, and vocal call backs to prior ES settings/games (references to Tamriel, etc). I'd like to figure out a faster way to change weapon combos that 'items -> weapons -> set my bow/arrow or sword' then 'items->apparel-> set my shield active' and then return to the fight. Seems like there ought to be a quickbar or some such thing but maybe I just missed that. Still prefer this version to the MMO version... seeing idiots hop through town or ride their horses into markets is just not satisfying.

I think this game is a good value for all the hours and hours it can absorb and the relatively decent storylines and colour in the world."
7234,"Skyrim, it just works."
7235,"Good
"
7236,"Skyrim is a classic for a reason. You'll sink hundreds of hours in, download some mods, and sink in a few hundred more."
7237,"Great game, although like a lot of Bethesda products, it's a mile wide and an inch deep. It'd be nice if it felt like all the things you're doing had more actual impact. Like maybe if you become the archmade of the wizarding college, some stupid court wizard shouldn't get all snarky with you.

Eh, go play it. Then install Enderal and play that too."
7238,If you haven't already played this... do yourself a favor and buy it! Still my favorite rpg ever.
7239,"Until I can play this on every gaming platform post 2011, I will not be happy."
7240,"Uh I can't believe I never wrote a review 100/10 unironically favourite game played at least 800 more hours on a modded client :)
There's even (now) still more things to this game that I haven't done, I highly recommend it for almost anyone."
7241,Great game
7242,good game
7243,"It's a classic. Even 10 years later, I can still have fun wandering Skyrim and tinkering with the various mods available. It's become my happy place over the years."

7248,nice game if workshop is better
7249,i mean its skyrim
7250,Of course I love this game. It came out when I built My first PC. PLays smooth. it is on the older side now but just as fun to me.
7251,The best GAMING EXPERIENCE.
7252,"Skyrim is a great easy-to-digest Elder Scrolls style game, even if it s a bit of a departure from the past games. While I feel Oblivion is a better balance between accessibility and RPG depth, Skyrim is still a blast to play and an easy recommendation for players new to the genre!"
7253,"its a throwback ,and it is fun , but its too old to be running on modern pc's i always have to lower my monitors refresh rate to play it without it crashing or creating some game breaking bug , its sad to say but just buy special edition"
7254,Excellent game.

One of the best games ever made."
7270,skrim
7271,"I recommend the updated Skyrim Special Edition, along with SkyrimVR. This version is extremely outdated and mod support for this version is becoming obsolete, with Special Edition grabbing more sales and obviously having the DLC, which many mods rely on. I do not have the DLC. I have finished the the main storyline to this version of the game, but I still keep it around for a personal lack of owning Special Edition as well as the few mods I already have installed."
7272,ไม่ว่าจะกลับมาเล่นกี่ครั้ง ก็ยังสนุกไม่เปลี่ยน สมัยนี้มีม็อดเยอะแยะ ตกแต่งเกม ทำให้สนุกไปอีก อิอิ
7273,play it
7274,"Overall a great game; my only critique is that a lot of the story and mechanics don't have obvious direction or tutorials for, so I often have to switch to a wiki or walkthrough. I would like to say that it's just me, but I've heard this from other friends who have the game as well. Slightly breaks immersion, but is a small loss in the grand theme of what is an otherwise well made open world game."
7275,"Between the modding community and the sheer absurd amount of stuff to do, Skyrim rivals Minecraft for replay value. Now if only Todd would stop re-releasing it every few years ;P"
7276,decent
7277,"game that will never get old, the best"
7278,oNE OF MY FAVORITE SINGLE PLAYTER GAMES OF ALL TIME.
7279,"I recommend playing through the game at least once, as you'll find a lot can be enjoyed from the game if you don't spend too much time with it. Maybe you'll entrench yourself in quests of honor and find enjoyment in helping others you find in the game, or maybe you'll enjoy playing as an assassin that goes around slitting throats. Maybe you'll even cast spells to freeze or burn those that would stand in your way to greater knowledge. Regardless, you can very easily find enjoyment in your first time playing this game.

It's when you come back to it that becomes a problem.

Don't get me wrong, I like certain things about the game. I really enjoyed the Thieve's Guild quests the first time I played, and some fights feel challenging and rewarding when you get through to the other side of them. But I can't lie and say that everything about this game is good. Visually, the vanilla game doesn't look too appealing, at least to me. That isn't to say that the graphics were bad for their time, but the art style and coloration just looks ugly or bland most of the time. The entire area of Skyrim feels like it's been soaked in a washed out gray, not helped in the least by the amount of area in the game that the many snowy mountains take up. But even the greener pastures tend to look ugly. There are certain spots that look lovely and pop with colors, but most of the time when playing it feels almost as if everything blends into a smudge of gray all over your screen. The combat needs work too, melee feels fine for the most part in my opinion, and stealth is a high risk, high reward style, but magic feels utterly useless the further in the game you go. Starting out may work fine or even feel overpowered. Soon, though, you'll see that there's only 3 real types of magical damage, and only one worth mentioning. The land of Skyrim is home to many Nords, who all have a 50% resistance to frost damage meaning an entire element is largely out of the picture in most situations, and the shock element is only really effective against other magic users who make up a minority of enemies you'll be facing, leaving fire as the only element with consistent damage. But there's little to boost any amount of your damage with magic, resulting in prolonged battles on higher difficulties spent juggling between all of your player resources (health, stamina, and magicka) while you spam spells, run from incoming enemies, and try not to die from any ranged attackers or fighters that get too close. If there were enchantments that boost magic damage, or perks that could bypass resistances for the element you use, that would be fantastic, but unfortunately that doesn't exist in the vanilla experience so you're left with the bad time of feeling like you don't do much at upper levels. 

And then there are the bugs. Now it isn't any secret that Bethesda games are riddled with bugs, glitches, exploits, and unintended experiences, but the amount and severity that exist in Skyrim are the stuff of legend. My first time playing, I was on console and met with a few bugs here or there but nothing major. Until a random dragon gave me its soul while the skeleton became invincible and kept fighting me. PC though has been a much worse experience. I'm pretty sure since playing on PC I've had a bug that breaks every major faction's questline at least once, including bugs that break the main quest and the DLC quests (though I will say that the DLC has oddly been less buggy for me than anything else). I'm writing this after finally getting the last achievements I'd avoided in the game, and just to get them I had to fight a DLC boss that kept glitching out by becoming invincible and ""ethereal"" in the middle of his boss arena (solved by killing nearby dragons before fighting him) and couldn't get the final achievement for getting all the daedric artifacts despite looking at all of them in my own inventory, because a glitch causes one not to count (solved by inputting console commands to redo the final step of the azura star quest and also getting the black star to count as an additional artifact). 

Just stepping outside of my in-game house, I'm lucky if I don't see a small child glitch out and get flung at the speed of sound into a wall. It's funny, sure, but sad that the game is so broken. Because it wouldn't be such a pain to play if everything worked, just an okay action rpg with somewhat imbalanced combat and dire need of color."
7280,the best game the world has ever created
7281,"I love this game. Dozens of playthroughs, many different styles to play. I enjoyed the main storyline and there are plenty of side-quests to keep you busy, and hours worth of adventures/locations to keep you exploring."
7282,amazing
7283,giant club go brrrrr
7284,"worth it, fun and the modding community is amazing."
7285,"The Greatest Game of its time, and somehow manages to reach beyond. Few games have a place in my heart, but Skyrim does. Cheesy, I know... But It's that Good."
7286,game is better then 80085 <3 love it dawg
7287,"it took me too long to get the dlc, now they are at an insane value. finally i'll try to play the remake

demorei demais para pegar as dlc, agora estão em um valor insano. enfim vou tentar jogar o remake"
7288,definetly recommend amazing game although you find some bugs my most recent is when delphine will not speak to me (I think it's because my character is really ugly).
7289, A Master Collection of Story telling to Epic game play . Still The KING of RPGs !
7290,Most amazing game in the series so far!
7291,heck ya
7292,What is not to love about skyrim?
7293,I prefer Morrowind for the plot. I don't suggest installing more than 50 mods though.
7294,If you don't know what Skyrim is by now... I don't think you ever will.
7295,"The most fun I have ever had wasting 400 hours of my life. Seriously, though, the game is a blast, especially if you know about mods."
7296,"A vast, sometimes confusing open world where you can be what you want and make of yourself what you chose. Sword fighting, magic, owning a house and marrying someone, life in Skyrim is bloody and varied, so go kill some dragons and steal some sweet rolls!"
7297,a shallow experience
7298,It's my favourite games. Spent countless hours playing it and modding it. It's an awesome world to get lost into.
7299,"get the special edition instead even if it costs more, this one have too much bugs sadly"
7300,Awesome game 11/10

7302,GG

7304,nice
7305,"Todd is still pushing it, but we keep buying."
7306,Топ игра
7307,"I have played this game for over 1000 hours I think that speaks for itself lol

My favorite parts are the thieves guild questline and all the little side quests to do with being jarl of everywhere and my least favorite parts are that the dark brotherhood quests can take out useful people and sometimes two dragons spawn at once but you only get credit for one 

Also one time I married Farkas and he was annoying as hell lmao"
7308,"My sons birthday is November... He'll be 10... hes growing up so fast, Im so proud of him:("
7309,yes
7310,"I didn't play it much, but it seems good."
7311,great game for any gamer even non gamers
7312,kill dragons with forks
7313,One of the best games out there!
7314,Best pc game i have ever played 5*
7315,best version of skyrim
7316,GOAT
7317,Q
7318,I am god
7319,"Skyrim is like one of those happy memories for me. It held my hand through high school, up into my mid 20s, and while people hurt me, Skyrim did not. Is it a well-made game? Sort of. Would I recommend it? Yes, absolutely, if you play video games you should play Skyrim at least once. Maybe try your hand at modding it, because Skyrim is 200% more fun with mods."
7320,Even though the game is old its still amazing
7321,"Before i played The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, i had a small wee-wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression,and absolutely no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good."
7322,oh Tod you thought you could hide this. you underestimate this community
7323,"E.
"
7324,I cant build like in fortnite (my favorite game) (sus)
7325,"I got this game by my mother on Christmas 2011. I started playing on XBOX 360 and was able to get my savegames on my Computer. This game modded is another experience. Everything is just insane, what the community is doing it mental. Skyirm is to this day a much better experience than Elder Scrolls Online, and I don't think they will further improve. Skyrim has a very special place in my heart, the music gives me goosebumps. If there is a chance on living afterlife in this game, I wouldn't ask twice. This game is so insane, it aged like fine whine. Mods are the next level, go get them and enjoy the game again, it is an absolute must to play this. TES 6 will be massive, but can it be better than skyrim? We will see. in like 10 years XD"
7326,Amazing game
7327,it good :)
7328,i enjoyed this game for years then i discovered mods and OH MY GOD. so yeah its pretty good
7329,I is like the game very much
7330,"best game ever, when I feel the need to slay some orcs or dragons, skyrim is my sword, I lost the count of how many time I played this game"
7331,With or without mods one of the best games made.
7332,Cool game bro
7333,"A lot of people's favourite game of all time for a reason. Spectacular world, amazing voice acting, so much to discover and explore. Brilliant soundtrack (best of all time imo). I think the story is a little weak and the interaction with NPCs compared to say Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't great, but I also think that the vagueness is what makes this game so replayable, you can fill in the gaps with your own story and really make the character your own."
7334,This is my 7th time buying Skyrim. 10/10 would do again
7335,the amount of boots here is truly astounding 11/10
7336,nice
7337,Best game ever! Absolutely huge game with so many quests to complete. Been playing this game off and on for years...it just has so much to offer.
7338,pretty good game.
7339,yeah its a good game
7340,"I don't know how to feel about Skyrim. It's a very beautiful world, like a dream, and when you wake up you can't remember any of it."
7341,"Bought this game when it was on sale with two included expansions. Now I don't have access to them so my primary weapon, my house, and everything in it (everything I have accumulated playing the game) are all GONE. Feels like being held hostage for $25 forcing me to pay for access to content that was part of a deal already made. I don't know how I can retroactively be disallowed content that was part of the deal before, seems kinda shitty."
7342,"cool
"
7343,"An amazing adventure for lovers of rpg games, with a massive modding community and near endless amounts of gameplay! While the main and faction quests sometimes fall a bit short compared to the previous game in the series, the exploration and gameplay will keep you hooked!  My one issue with this game is that many of the ""unique"" weapons have the same skins as their normal variants, however this can be fixed by using player made mods."
7344,I LEK IT
7345,"Became Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, found all 15 Daedric artifacts, became Arch mage of the college of Winterhold, destroyed a clan of ancient bloodthirsty vampires, joined the Companions, owned multiple houses in different holds, killed Alduin, eater of worlds and still my character gets made fun of by the guards.

9.5/10
"
7346,"love
"
7347,"Very nice
"
7348,"This game got me into PC gaming. As a new gamer, I put almost 400 hours in and learned SO much. This game is rewarding, and it is fascinating to learn how everyone plays differently, and finds interest in different aspects of the game. I truly believe there is something for everyone in this game. I had so much fun learning the lore, adventuring, and basked in the excitement of wonder. This is a gorgeous game, be sure to purchase three DLCs (Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn), and if you really want to have fun look up additional DLC like other fun designed armor people make in the community and download them. I enjoyed this cool white attractive warrior priestess one haha. Learn, adventure, and most of all have FUN my fellow Dovahkiin!"
7349,ah skyrim. this is a great and at this point iconic game. nothing bad to say yet. once you play you'll learn what makes it great. only prob is that it may seem too easy. but that's kinda minor.
7350,highly reccomend
7351,"Best game ever made
"
7352,"Theres one thing i gotta say 
MODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I liked this game. I disliked not playing this game."
7359,"i played skyrim for years you never get bored theres so many choices to make so you always can make a new dragonborn i would reccomend this to anyone who like rpg i play as a true dragonborn im no milk drinker what will you decide.


i think this is the best game on steam
"
7360,"So, where's Skyrim 2?"
7361,"Pros, everything
Cons, no remake."
7362,"game hidden, i review game - it isn't hidden."
7363,good game get mods
7364,"This game is a buggy mess and unplayable without mods. If you want a good fantasy RPG, play Witcher. This shitty game has never been patched by Bethesda, all the release bugs are still there."
7365,Didn't like it much at first but now fun.
7366,"fun game, i liked oblivion more but i still need to dive into this one a bit further"
7367,Best game of all time?  Still holds up ten years later.
7368,yeet
7369,Hell yeah
7370,"great open world game, and modding takes it to the next level"
7371,suck my bollocks
7372,"Skyrim is by far, the best game I have ever played, counting only singleplayer and counting all games! The immersion is crazy, ESPECIALLY if you install extra mods that you like in PC version, and even in classic it is such an amazing game. This has HOURS AND HOURS of playtime, and by hours & hours I mean I have been playing it since it came out a DECADE ago and I am still having fun, playing it all the time, and discovering so many new things! I could not recommend this game higher. If you have any doubts, TRY IT. Especially if you love roleplaying fantasy games, and ESPECIALLY if you love The Elder Scrolls game series. Best game in the series besides Oblivion in my opinion. Absolutely crazy amazing. 10000000/10!!!!"
7373,great game
7374,.
7375,It's 2021
7376,Skyrim is fire.
7377,yes

7380,love it
7381,"eskiler bilir......yeniler de bilebilir? hAHA! 
dragon!"
7382,if you want a romance but cant get one irl this is the game for you.
7383,Easily one of the biggest rpg's out there and well worth playing but be aware that the game has many bugs and a fair few that are game breaking (I would recommend creating a new save atleast once an hour so you don't lose too much progress in such an instance).
7384,skyrimjob hahaa
7385,great game with fun free mods in the start up
7386,kinda boring
7387,Just forget about your real life.
7388,"I hate myself for not finding about this game sooner.

This..is..the best RPG game to ever exist and it will continue that way.

The OST.
The Ambience.
The Mechanics.

Everything about it is so good that it makes ppl question how this game came out in 2011.

Honestly if ur thinking if u should buy this..WHY ARE U THINKING? JUST GO ON AND BUY IT AND HAVE THE TIME OF UR LIFE!"
7389,bro its skyrim. fucking play it
7390,This game i truly recommend the style of the game is so jaw-dropping ive finished the main quest storyline and there is always more to do there hasnt been a day ive played where i thought this is boring if you do this get this game i would also recommend getting the dlcs which adds just as much life as there already is so thank you for reading this but do play.
7391,horse go up
7392,"My Best Friend got this game for me as a surprise gift - along with a BUNCH of other games!

If 193 hours does not tell you how much I LOVE this game, nothing will. And, I still haven't beat it! I've had to start over a few times due to new computers and such. Not sure if my last attempt was saved in cloud or not, we'll see! I do really love this game though! My issue is trying to balance side quests with main story. I tend to have so many sidequests that I loose track of wtf is what. I also need to stop forcing my poor horse up and down mountains that we probably shouldn't be climbing. I kill too many horses that way.

Game some times does randomly crash...(it does this on my PC, or has in the past, not played it on this PC yet...and also on my Switch. It's really..really..really irritating and I have no idea what causes it.)

I like to shoot shit from long distances with my bow.
I like to pic locks, no matter how difficult.
I like to pick-pocket everyone and steal all their gold.
I hoard things....like lockpicks HA!

Really bummed that you can't woo Farengar though. He's always my top choice. So I tend to go through the game and find the most handsom alternative that shares the same VA lol."
7393,poggers
7394,is good
7395,"Good Game for the most part, tavern girls are unrelistic no paying for b**bs"
7396,"Yes.

"
7402,"I like this game because I can do almost whatever I want (within reason, of course) and just have fun in a fantasy world. Bugs, you ask? yes, they happen, and they are some of the best parts of this game. (laughs in Dragon Tongue)"
7403,good game
7404,"As always, this Elder Scrolls installment is a beautiful blend of sandbox and quest-based play, with absolutely ZERO limitations on character development... level any skill, use any weapon (albeit sometimes poorly) and cast any spell (well, attempt to anyway)... all you have to do is put in the practice time.  

Great FPS that works very well for players with long periods disconnected."

It's one of those you should play at least once in your life. If you're hesitant about the jank of these old Bethesda games, wait for a sale, it's dirt cheap being such an old game"
7416,Its Skyrim.
7417,Very open world to roam around in with lots of replay value.
7418,"Quite possibly the greatest RPG ever, a game I have 500 hours on on PS4 and Still come back to time and time again to make new unique builds"
7419,The Eder Scrolls series is my all-time favorite games. Bring back levitation!
7420,A legendary game made even greater with its outstanding modding community. I'll absolutely remember my adventures here for a long time.
7421,gud game
7422,It's Skyrim.
7423,All-time classic. Just downloaded to play again.
7424,"Funnn

7425,pogger the lesser give thubm ups
7426,timeless classic
7427,gd game
7428,"I've played this game for who knows how many years and i still love it, never get boring."
7429,Just amazing
7430,It just works.
7431,for me this is a childhood memory
7432,I played up to level 151 in vanilla then modded it until it wouldn't even open anymore. It took many laborious days to fix the problems I caused with mods. Be careful with your mods! The game really is fun enough on its own.
7433,JUST PLAY ITTTT
7434,yh its pretty good
7435,shneak 100
7436,oblivion is like  totally 6000x better
7437,"Its good.
Can't hide it from me though."
7438,yay very cool very nice we all like skyrim we want skyrim mod put skyrim mod on game f*** up game start cry do dance use game cry use money on special edition happy happy happy not satisfied buy oculus quest buy skyrim vr mod the s*** out of it happy again
7439,"Ulfric did nothing wrong

10/10"
7440,I have a love-hate relationship with this game. It is both fun and frustrating. Fun when the game works and annoying when the bugs ruin it. Have a ton of mods installed and I am not sure if this is what causes my lag (probably is) or it's due to using a crap mod manager. Maybe one day I'll take the time to install the mods properly if that is the issue or just buy Skyrim Special Edition. I'm sure Todd would like that.
7441,has juice
7442,"Skyrim, Oh how this game is amazing. I really enjoyed this game over all the years that has pasted. I'd played it since middle school to now College and honestly I still enjoy it. Overall if you want a really good game that is worth every single penny, Then this is the game to buy or fallout 4. But I do hope when a new elder scrolls comes out, that I want to have better graphics and honestly a really good story."
7443,Thumbs Up
7444,Overrated
7445,god Howard. enough said.
7446,"There's not much more that I can say other than, well, its Skyrim. In its sometimes buggy, glitchy, out-dated-by-todays-standards graphics, it is still the most fun I can have roaming around and throwing spells. Unlike others of its ilk, like Dragon Age, you are not bound by a class system, which is a massive positive for me. That alone keeps me coming back year after year. Not to mention the modding community that has sprung up around this game. Whatever your little heart desires to see in the game, there is most likely a mod for it."
7447,"Mod it until it crashes.

Not suitable for raw consumption."
7448,10/10
7449,Skyrim more like Skynut
7450,"What can I say that hasn't been said, this game's been out for 10 years, give or take a few months. I've had it since 2013, but I wasn't able to play properly because my system was under spec. I saw it languishing in my steam library a few days ago and decided it was finally Time. And while it's a 10 year old game, it doesn't disappoint me at all. 9/10 only because I wish I could've played it when I bought it."
7451,good
7452,one of the best games ive ever played
7453,i like old school
7454,"One of the best games ever made and the legendary edition is cheaper
"
7455,Still better than Oblivion
7456,"stabby stabby go brrr killy killy dragon, but a bit buggy."
7457,You should not need to read reviews. Just play. Its a must.
7458,It's Skyrim.
7459,if you want to add 7 inches this is the game for you
7460,"I smash shit like RAGNAR LOTBROK

Why can't I get DLCs ? :("
7461,This game makes my balls quake.
7462,One of those breakthrough games that you cant help but go back to every couple of years!
7463,Everything. especially the dragons!
7464,"One of the greatest modding communities if not THE greatest of all time.

Nuff said."
7465,its the greatest rpg of all time
7466,"This game sucks. First of all, the horse doesn't work. This makes the game extremely difficult to start. The best way I found of fixing this is killing myself, in real life. Nonetheless, I persevered. The game starts and immediately you get talked to by the cops. I hate this. What the fuck? If you are about to be killed by the cops, and you decide to follow one anyway, you're dumb as shit. I hate you. The racists are right. I love them... <3 ;-). Okay, besides those issues in the beginning, I think this game is pretty well made. The animals are wrong. But otherwise, everything comes together pretty well. You get to talk to the vikings, which aren't very historically accurate, but are interesting nonetheless. It's a really amazing game. A true achievement, and a pinnacle to the everlasting quality of good art. Except that it's shit. Did you really believe that this game was good? You fooled yourself. you fiddled yourself. You clown. You played the fiddle on yourself. you played yourself like a fiddle. You jokers bitch. I love you so much. Thank you for reading, and I really hope you enjoy your time with The Elder Scrolls: Fifth Edition: Skyrim: Dragonborn: Skyed Rim by Todd Howard brought to you by Todd Howard a Todd Howard Production from Todd HOward Entertainment. Fuck you.
P.S. Did you know if at the start of the game you go back up the road you came in on, to the south, and you use noclip to go up the wall, but you don't use free camera because that makes it fucking disappear, you can sort of see something that looks like a pillar that might look like the tower in Oblivion, or whatever? I spent one whole hour of my life to learn this. I am so sad. I'm so fucked up about this fucking tower. I hate this game and everyone who likes it. Nonetheless,
I really hope you enjoy your time with Todd Howard's Todd Howard Presents: The Elder Scrolls Nine Skyrim. You're welcome, and I love you. I wish you good luck. No I don't. I hate you. HOw dare you"
7467,this is great
7468,"Why the fuck is the civil war story so unfortunate. Side with the nords of the north, and you get the most self-righteous, racist prick on the throne. Side with the empire and everyone gets oppressed by scheming, unreasonable, hoity toity elves that firmly have the cowardly imperials by the balls. Both sides suck ass. I wish we could New Vegas this shit and get the Blades, Whiterun and all your allies together and be like ""Okay, I have people everywhere. Literally. I am King."" Like, seriously. The game is amazing besides this. Sure there are probably other issues I'm not remembering, but far too few to impact my enjoyment of the game."
7469,great
7470,became so addicted i started calling my wife by her in game name
7471,Game is good . I just hate the AI its garbage...
7472,awesome game....plenty content

7480,Like it neva left.
7481,"Is good, but

Morrowind is better.

(Just wait for the Legendary Super Duper Furry Pride Ukraine Freedom Anniversary Extended LGBTQIA++ Special Edition to come out. )"
7482,How is this game still not dead like...my mod library has already surpassed 100 and my boi Alduin died 10 times over....10/10 would yoink his bones again though :)

7488,"Obviously one of the best games ever. Always great coming back to start over and experience something new. Some quest are a little tedious at times but manageable. Main story is alright. Fighting system is good, not counting multiple exploits you can use va AI. Map is well designed, a bit glitchy, but pretty. Some paths of character development (skills) are seriously busted. Some are too easy to master, some are barely possible on the other hand. Makes no sense, but main traits are okay."

7491,IS GOOD

7495,this game bad
7496,Its great. Its Skyrim. Mod the hell out of it and play it forever
7497,I love the game and being able to mod is the most fun
7498,Easily the best game I have ever played!
7499,"It's F***** Skyrim, bro"
7500,It Good
7501,"its great
"
7502,one of the best open world games of all time
7503,This is the standard for open world RPG games for a reason. No regrets for picking this up.
7504,Who doesn't like this game?
7505,i ate a bee in this game
7506,You are legit insane if you have never played this game.
7507,Great RPG - even after nearly 10 years
7508,it's fun
7509,It realy makes you feel like a skyrim
7510,"one of the best games of all time

7511,Best game I've ever played.
7512,One of the top 5 must play games of our generation
7513,"Classic.  One of only two games I've pre ordered and not been disappointed.  At time of release I was dealing with a medical issue which kept me in bed for a month, this game was a massive escape and kept me sane while I was missing the great weather outside!
"
7514,iolkjhgfdsghjkl;';lkjhgfds
7515,"Being a khajit and sneaking through people (and pickpocket them) is so much fun! If you're not the sneaky type you can also just smash through anything and anyone with a great axe. This game supports many playstyles and rarely limits you to one solution to a problem. You can do anything you want, do any quest you're interested in and ignore the rest. I assure you, any resource spent on Skyrim (money, time, etc) will be worth it."
7516,The best fantasy world created :)
7517,Really liked the giant space program feature. 10/10
7518,i think it's a fun little game. you play as someone who does stuff and sometimes you mess up. i especially like sneaking around and misleading bandits. this game has workshop support so you can fun in uniquely specific ways. 10/10 it's pretty cool that they made the dedicated scream button integral to the game.
7519,DELICIOUS
7520,"After the first 100 hours everything becomes a blur...

7521,The Crusty Scrolls V: Skeetrim
7522,"fantastic! bought & played, still don't know what tf is going on a decent amount of the time but when i figure it out it's fun :)"
7523,Is one of the best games I have played hands down. Played first on the 360 then switched to PC cannot suggest this game enough.
7524,overall just a great game tons of lore hours of gameplay so many ways to play the game :)
7525,Morrowind better lole
7526,It's skyrim...play it
7527,"Much like the developers, I never finished this game all of the way."
7528,nice naked women mod
7529,yes
7530,memes. magic. yes.
7531,"Graphics, Game play, Story line.  In my opinion, everything about this game is great.  I definitely recommend this game."
7532,"Hours of gameplay, lots of side quests and two main quests, it is a great game and I've played it a few times over, different characters and specialities! wow"
7533,One of those games that just suck you in and won't let go.
7534,"10/10 if you havent played skyrim you havent played anything
"
7535,"Never 100%'d the game, always end up with at least 4 broken/bugged quests. 
Still Good, still the best medicine for depression. Why the NHS don't prescribe a healthy dose of Skyrim il never know"
7536,Buy this game for all your consoles and pc and then wait for the gameboy advance edition. Has almost unlimited modding capability if you can get it work after installing them.
7537,I don't think this game needs any more reviews. It's simply amazing. You can spend years playing it and still be surprised.
7538,huge varied first person
7539,my child hooddddd

7547,I like the gameplay.
7548,"It's beautifully crafted, the game play is easy to get into, there's hours and hours of content. I've played this game at least 3 times through and each time I pick up a new quest or something that I hadn't done in previous play through's and I'm always so pleased to pick this game up again and again."
7549,Gayming
7550,dragon
7551,Todd howard you have done it again.
7552,pog
7553,good story and you can lose hours playing
7554,"I keep coming back to this game - yeah, there is some weirdness occasionally, clipping issues and really strange NPC behavior, but overall it's a playable game with a lot of fun options. I can build up a character and then just go around bashing things without advancing the storyline, which these days is a relief."
7555,Publishers are claiming that single-player games are dead. I should respectfully disagree.
7556,90% of the spells are warcrimes.
7557,"Personally one of my favorite games of all time. Even if you haven't played any other elder scrolls game, I beg you to try it :) There's just something magical about skyrims world i can't put to words."
7558,Open world adventure that never ends
7559,"Game... bug
Mod... no bug
Game crash...

Repeat until learn
Game... good
More mod!"
7560,"147 hours? hahaha, I think it dropped 1,000 hours somewhere, it is probably the last game I bought at full price on opening day and here I am years later starting again because it is still the best game I have ever played."
7561,"you can kill chickens
14 raw meat out of 10 aborted feetuses"
7562,YES
7563,"I devote this to the brilliant mod creators pouring their heart and soul into a plethora of brilliant mods for the benefit of all gamers for FREE. Having the ability to make Skyrim truly mine is lovely and I can't wait to savour every little moment in this game and infinitely more from mods. I just like RPGs and Skyrim is a fine one indeed. This is what Art is all about, pure immersion in creative works from the community. 

I played Skyrim SE but they wouldn't let me review it so here I am"
7564,Oblivion on steroids.
7565,eh
7566,epic
7567,"
GOAT GAME, ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME"
7568,"In the videogame Skyrim, I create mods that spawn cheese, kill Fondle, and slaughter zombies with a potato. I also replace the statue of a woman holding a statue of a sword with a weeping man holding a statue of a sword that isn't an actual sword. And then I buy the woman a copy of Limbo.

I'm a god.

I call myself Diablo the Cheater. As far as I know, I'm the only person who writes a list of cheating cheats and uses it in-game. My mod turned the game into an interdimensional sex simulator (powered by a fucking necromancer), and I use that game on a daily basis. To date, I've cheated in thirty games. Twenty-one of them were developed by other users, and the other two were made by me.

And today, this motherfucker is named after me.

I use a relatively simple cheat to game console games. What I do is turn the switch on the controller I use into a button on the console, and then I press it to trigger cheats that give me a better experience. Here's what those che."
7569,"If you install mods, this game is worth it. If not, I would stay well away."
7570,"Thank you, Todd Howard."
7571,Amazing experience!
7572,"Skyrim: 100
Fun: 100
Time to play special edition"
7573,DRM
7574,Still a classic after 10 years.
7575,SKREEM
7576,its skyrim
7577,why can i not kill the kids
7578,This game being 10 years old makes me feel so incredibly old.
7579,"There are hundreds of hours to be spent in the game without any replay.  Add mods and replay to cover the different branches and you're easily into the thousands - and all without having to be online. This game is great, and the one I come back to the most."
7580,d
7581,game
7582,Skyrim+Mod=WTF i have done this is not Skyrim at all
7583,nice
7584,Replayable and absorbing.
7585,"Skyrim wins the award for the most overrated game of all time. 
- Plastic world thats a 100 miles wide and two inches deep & not worth exploring
- Terrible generic story 
- Bland two dimensional characters that have no soul 
- No immersion (Due to many of the above mentioned cons, the world and the whole experience just feel artificial)
- Trash combat 

And there are no mods to fix above mentioned problems. 4/10 Masterpiece."
7586,This game played a massive role in defining who I am today! Would recommend 11/10!!
7587, .
7588,Clearly nothing i can say here is a new bit of information. This game deserves all the praise its get and i wont deny that. Time to start up a 4th Play through.
7589,very amazing
7590,Classic!!!
7591,I would keep on playing this game until the day I die
7592,yes.
7593,"This game is absolutely amazing, I love this game
"
7594,"I would like to get back into the game but im afraid after i get into modding again i dont even have time for basic self-preservation, like eating, pooping or masturbation anymore"
7595,arrow knee
7596,"I've played this game a LOT on my Xbox. And I got it again becasue I love it, though I did t=get the unlisted version due to technical capabilities, but even though that happened I have a great time whenever I play :D"
7597,"At the time of this recommendation, i've got 173 hours of game play on the steam version of this game, and probably over 2k hours on the xbox version. If that doesn't tell you how this review is going, then I don't know what will. 

Do I recommend? Hell yes! Here's why:

Tons to explore, many people you can kill/befriend/marry/hate [i] *cough* [/i] Nazeem [i] *cough* [/i], and many different paths you can take that will either make you rich or make you an honorable hero (I always choose the rich route because it's difficult to pay for all the houses otherwise. Plus, who wouldn't want to be the leader of all the different clans?). If you're a collector, this game is great because you can collect all the powerful gear and random items. Or, you could be a hoarder.. either way works :D

Is there any reasons I wouldn't recommend this game? Also yes:

Many different glitches that were never patched that can be game breaking if you don't remember to save the dang game. The upside is, these glitches can be worked around with the autosaves if you have them often enough. 
Sooooo much grinding to do anything in this game. You spend a ton of time in caves and there's a few choices that if you make the wrong move, you just die. I play this game on expert and I'm often a one hit KO with the bosses and I have over 200 health. Like, come on man, let me have a sliver of hope please? 

Otherwise, this game is amazing and you should definitely play it... Once you start, you'll never be able to stop... [strike] you probably won't see the light of day for a week. [/strike] Good luck adventurer!"
7598,ywwt
7599,"Playing the vanilla game on ultra settings...it may be old school but its still a great open world game to play! Not as pretty as Oblivion but a great story line. Plus there are mods galore if you want  to go that route.
Its one of the all time great games...so dive in  and give it a go."
7600,I like this game but I don't recommend it. It will draw you in and steal your life. And if you get into modding... god help you if you get into modding.
7601,pretty good
7602,5 Stars
7603,"I've been playing this game nigh on almost a whole decade now whether it be on steam xbox, ps4's and so on. its what introduced me to gaming as im sure oblivion was the same way to those in the mid early 2000's I cant recommend this game enough. All I wish is for their next game to come out and see what changes between that and old Skyrim herself"
7604,This plucky little game might just make it.
7605,amazzzzing
7606,Occasionally glitches out but otherwise awesome. Good graphics. I enjoy how I can run around and just adventure all over (follow a bunch of side quests) or stick to a main story line.
7607,yes
7608,nice!
7609,Lots to do. Lots to explore. Lots of mods to customize this game. That's it.
7610,"This game is a legend in the PC RPG world now. That's for good reason. It doesn't get much better than this. It does have flaws. It needed to be patched since the beginning and modding can make it much worse. But everyone who loves RPGs has been lost within this game at one time or another and revisiting it always feel like being at home again. 

I don't play it anymore for just one reason. I'm hooked into Elder Scrolls Online now. Clearly that MMORPG takes its strengths from Skyrim's basic appeal: To make it huge and completely open world. Skyrim came dangerously close to the MMORPG category even though it's a single player game. The Elder Scrolls mythology was best displayed within Skyrim and now that lore has exploded on the scene in Elder Scrolls Online and has nearly become universal. I might be overstating it a bit but when players think of sword and sorcery lore they think first about Tolkien's Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring or they think of Oblivion and the Daedric Princes. Mark my words, movies are inevitable. 

Skyrim is still the flagship of Bethesda's realm... or will be again when the movie premieres."
7611,Its good
7612,I don't even play Skyrim when I load up this game
7613,Not as good as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
7614,Sets the standard!
7615,Is a masterpiece!
7616,Can i play this game coop with a friend ?
7617,"Why did Bethesda commit stupid? It's a good game as the old version, why is there a reason to hide it and make less money?"
7618,"ALDUIN KILLED ME LIKE 450, I WON AFTER 2 NIGHTS FIGHTING HIM ANYWAY GOOD GAME FREE OF BUGS BUY (Y)"
7619,I used to be a gamer like you until I found Skyrim Mods. Now I'm just a degenerate.
7620,awesome game
7621,"You have  endless options to choose from characters, playstyle, choices to make. No two games are the same.
"
7622,"A great time waster, and finally a purpose for the game on EVERY CONSOLE IN EXISTENCE!!"
7623,It's alright.
7624,just great
7625,do i need to explain
7626,"I have owned this game since it was put on steam.  And now Zenimax is claiming this is not an authorized site to purchase their games. As i received an email from my isp Stating Zenimax, and Bethesda say it is copy right infringement.  So Until those two fix their stuff I will not own any products."

7635,BEST RPG GAME WORLD!
7636,...
7637,Still after all these years. hands down the best fantasy first person RPG out there.
7638,I've played the game for almost 2k hours. I think it speaks for itself.
7639,Fabulous game with a massive modding community.
7640,"Great game and never ending,  So many story lines to play and explore."

7672,"yes
"
7673,"All around fun game, no ""one true"" way to play and complete this game, hell you could leave the main story quest line for pretty much last, and the modding community is pretty big so no real shortage of things to do in this game."
7674,best game
7675,"Great game play and story line.  Skyrim is very replayable. There are many options for your character. And even if you play the same class, the random encounters will be different enough that it won't seem like the play-through."
7676,Fuck you tod Howard give us elder scrolls 6
7677,"yeah dragons and things and shit, good stuff"
7678,"its a good game, even if you 100% it you can go online and add extra content with mods"

7682,Being open to mods is what makes this game excellent rather than just great!
7683,good game with mods.

7685,"Когда-то и меня вела дорога приключений, а потом мне прострелил колено..."
7686,"True Sword, Lots Magic!
Adventure Boy"
7687,"moddability and replayability are some of the best in this type of game.

Its a Bethezda game it does have its drawbacks although nearly every bug or glitch that Bethezda  could not be bothered to fix has been fixed by the modding community."
7688,yes. play this game
7689,very good but if you want the remastered version get the special edition
7690,gud
7691,Best child killing simulator ever !
7692,"A beautiful game, I really enjoyed playing all of the main quests and I do like that you have multiple choices for most of them :) I would love to play it again for the first time"
7693,"First RPG I ever played. Love this game. Will always occupy a special place in my heart. Ages like fine wine, and the memories just get sweeter."
7694,"I'm not the biggest Elder Scrolls fan (Fallout has always been more my interest) but Skyrim is a great game. I play with a ton of mods these days, but I originally first played the game on PS3 a number of times. It's pretty easy to get lost in the world when you allow yourself. 

Like a lot of RPG's, or maybe just Bethesda games, the best part is being able to create almost any experience you want. It just depends on how creative you are (and what mods you're gonna use)."

7698,Its a really good rpg
7699,"Still an amazing game, even playing through for the second or third time you find things you have never seen before. The workshop mods make this game even better, 100% recommend!!"
7700,Been playing on and off for several years. Feels like a new game every time I play
7701,"It's Skyrim. There's something for everyone and, if there's not, there's probably a free mod in the workshop that changes that."

7714,.
7715,Gas game
7716,"I started playing it shortly after launch on the 360, got it on Xbox One, got it on Steam, then got the free special edition on Steam. That alone should state how much I've played this game.

I always enjoyed stealth-based games, lethal or non-lethal. Skyrim fit the lethal stealth just right for me with the insane damage you can do with a bow and dagger and sheath that was possible to pull off without pixel-perfect movements. The exploration for the game is fantastic though I wish they would give you a permanent horse sooner, ""immortal/ summonable"" to get around earlier instead of installing a fast travel mentality. The combat can be painful at times, ""facing a mage that can spam 100 damage fireballs at you,"" but overall feels solid. Enchanting leave a bit to be desired. Creating your own ""class"" can be difficult when you cannot get some of the enchantments you want as strong as they are on standard items. The story is what you make of it. If you rush through the main quest and beat the game, you won't get an extraordinary value. If you branch and talk to people and do side quests, you get substantially more. If you delve deep into the lore and books, you get seven years of youtube content. This game shines the most in its modding community; it is vast and dedicated, allowing for substantial replayability in different ways."
7717,=]
7718,"It slightly saddens me to know that one day, I will play this game/series for the final time, never to step foot in it's universe again. The amount of nostalgia I have for this game is immense. I remember my sister playing it when it released in 2011 and practically begging her to let me play it. Since then, I've started a play through of the game at least once a year, each time trying something a little different. The purity of your first time playing the game is super special. You're lost, you can't fast travel very far so you have to frolic to the next town to restock on arrows or potions or even perhaps both. The lore is new so this civil war you keep hearing about is pretty confusing and you're quite sure what this dragon-born thing is really about yet. Suddenly, as you're on your journey to who knows where, that Jeremy Soule written masterpiece of a soundtrack kicks in. Bliss.

Well played, Todd. It just works."
7719,pretty good
7720,Skyrim Enough said
7721,gg
7722,its skyrim. i mean c'man
7723,When the whole game is a glitch you cant get mad at them

7725,"
it has great content and story lines
"
7726,"Soy muy amante de esta epoca en la que se desarrolla Skyrim, me encanta este juego, el juego vanilla esta muy bien, y el poder meterle mods para darle un par de detalles adicionales lo hace perfecto para tener muchas horas de diversion."
7727,got em
7728,Good game
7729,buggy as hell but its fun and imersive why i recomend this game its simple moding its a thing and that makes this meh 7/10 into a 10/10(just to say its a 7/10 due to constant bugs and outdated mechanics/graphics even for his relase of 2011. the only constant problem with this  game its requiring alot of saves due to how easy its to get gamebreaking bugs that destroys your saves so save often. last thing do not mess with render distance cause can make some zones crash instantly(even tough render distance its a joke)
7730,"Can't wait to spend another $20 on a new version with updated water textures where a mod gives better textures for free, 10/10"
7731,Play this game! You will not be disappointed!
7732,This good. Play now.

Nice Bethesda."
7751,"Brilliant game, all there is to say."
7752,"Best game ever i already have a recomandation on special edition, so i wont write it again, it is just best of all."
7753,"Good game, but at this point you should probably just get the special edition. All the talk that it's worse for modding is outdated, and the special edition also runs in 64-bit (in other words, it works with your computer's resources better). While the special edition does cost about $20 more, it also includes $45 of DLCs."
7754,"It's f*cking Skyrim, come on!"
7755,this game is unplayable i cant even get past the opening scene cause im spinning like a fucking beyblade

7761,woah
7762,its skyrim do i need to say anything more.
7763,"Glitchy, but a classic nonetheless. You should play vanilla on your first playthrough, but definitely use mods on subsequent playthroughs."
7764,Rated 'A' for awesome!
7765,"The OG release of Skyrim. Not the second, or third or VR, or whatever cashcow Bethesda is trying to release. More mods are available on this version, in addition to better support. My only complaint is that this no longer has an easily accessible store page, and the DLC also suffer the same fate; you need links to the store pages to get them. Additionally, the DLC are all still full price, but it's worth it as most mods rely on them. All in all, its Skyrim, the fifth mainline release of the Elder Scrolls series and you won't be disappointed if you came this far to at LEAST find the store page."

Notes : Skyrim is a excellent game afterall, but it will become a masterpiece when comes to modding. Bugs can be frustrating especially in the main quest season unending. This can be fixed in mods like ""USLEEP"" also when you thinking with the boring and bland graphic there are some mods but keep in mind and obviously need a better pc hardware (especially when you install grass mod,  min spec gtx 1060), but without mods you can play with low hardware like gt710, or vega 3. for cpu is not much of concerning since it can run dual core cpu, also 4gb ram is playable solid 30fps with 720p high texture, if you wondering that you are below all above you still can play skyrim with ultra low texture mods that can play even in celeron procesor. in a meantime you still can play skyrim with a laptop since 2014 or above. Heck even a gt210 can run skyrim in 800x600 with high texture and medium high render settings. quest is rather short when ONLY playing the main quest but it will take months or maybe two to complete all of the quest (including DLC and side). But wait if you thinking it's the end of the line then you're wrong cause there are tons of quest in the modding community. otherwise i should say becareful when modding, once you mod the game crash will occur often when you install a new mods, but you don't have to think about the mod version since most all mods are compatible in skyrim unless you using SE version. well that's all thx for reading :D
"
7767,i played this game alot and it is so fun
7768," Bethesda for the most part, top notch. Most of the game's they put out are worth the time and money spent. All the Elder Scroll game's are worth the play through. Hands down classic."

7810,"For a game that released about 10 years ago, it still holds up very well. I played through it for the first time, I can honestly say the game gets an 8/10. Some mechanics feel clunky and bad, but on the whole, Bethesda really made something special here."
7811,An amazing game with an almost endless pool of content. It is the first game I got all achievements for and have played through it several times on several different platforms.
7812,"Still have fond memories playing this on my ps3 on my small portable vhs tv in my room.
Many late winter nights spent on this game while everyone else in my house was asleep."
7813,"If you've come to the reviews section to see if Skyrim is right for you, then you're wasting your time.  It's right for everyone.  It is THE gaming experience that has been ported across platforms as old as the kids now buying it.  Its a masterpiece and should be bought as a milestone in a persons gaming career."
7814,decent
7815,"its ok
"
7816,"The. Best. Game. Ever.

What makes it so great isn't just the base game and the dlcs. They're amazing and full of life and content. But you also have over 60,000 mods to download and try on just Nexus mods alone. Whenever you're bored or just wanna relax, skyrim is the game to play. It's reasonably priced too now given how much you're getting."
7817,"good game 10 out of 10
"
7818,I heavily dislike this game
7819,"Skyrim holds a very weird status as a game unlike any other.

On one hand, its modding community flourishes and expands greatly upon the games original content, with new npc's quests, areas, locations, and even a mod such as Skyrim Together which makes the game online so you can play with friends (with mods too!)

On the other hand, the original content of the game holds lackluster content with an expansive world that you likely aren't feeling inclined to explore compared to other Open World titles on the market. It's definitely fun to play one time through, but with what I've experienced I doubt I'd revisit any of it without the improvements of mods. Not to say there isn't fun to be had, but other title's base game, such as the Witcher 3, are surely much more worth your money.

On that note, its clear that mods are a must for the enjoyment of this title, so if you're hoping to experience the game get ready to spend hours on The Nexus or the steam workshop finding mods to your liking and working out errors and crashes. It's a lengthy process, so make sure not to get too carried away with what mods you find and remember to play the game. It sounds odd, but I've surely spent more hours modding this game and debugging it rather than actually playing it. However, by spending some time modding your game, you can completely customize your experience to make it YOUR Skyrim. Your experience will be very different from another's with what mods you add, whether you focus on adding focus on warmth and survival to expanding upon weapons or magic systems. Skyrim, despite its lackluster base game, is still an experience i'd recommend due to its strong modding community and ability to make it your own."
7820,funny sword game cool as
7821,"Don't play this... It's addicting... first you are doing the main story line, running from things fighting things then you go talk to some... omg a side quest!................ oh yea there is a main story line to this.."

7834,Yea this game is good

The original is better than this scam edit

"
7855,I've finished Skyrim more times than I can count and keep coming back and finding something new about it. Its a great installment in the franchise and probably the biggest hit of them all.  Well worth your time. The next game will have to be something truly grand to top this.

7860,"My brother gave this game to me for my twelfth birthday. I haven't played it terribly often but I have and still do play it occasionally often during school holidays and semester breaks. Maybe it's because I'm slow but between this and the special edition there's still stuff left to do after a few hundred hours and near to a decade. I assume there are better games that are equally expansive, but I wouldn't know. I would say personally I enjoy it more than Minecraft and Europa Universalis VI. I'm sure that says more about the type of games I enjoy though, because other than being not particularly story  based those games don't have that much in common with Skyrim. It still remains fun and exciting after a few hundred hours and close to a decade. As someone who isn't particularly into gaming, it absolutely fulfills my gaming needs."
7861,"I mean...its Skyrim? You can play almost anyway you want as almost anyone you want. 600+ hrs in, and many different play-throughs later, and I'm still discovering things I have never done before. Or perhaps I just forgot. one of the two."

7891,"This the the only game that i actually enjoyed in the last 2 to 3 years, and i'm kinda bummed that i didn't find it earlier."
7892,Damn you storm cloaks.
7893,"As you probably know, this is a pretty good game, even in it's vanilla form still very mych enjoyable imo."
7894,The game ruined my life. 10/10
7895,love this game cant stop playing it
7896,Good game spent years playing on xbox and transfered to pc. just as good of a time if not better with workshop 12/10 recommend for a nice cool rainy day
7897,"uber fun, lots of content, worth the buy, kinda sucks that the hd feature was free mod that bethesda felt they could charge full price for."
7898,Water is buggy - causes player to continually toggle between crouch and standing as if a turbo function was being used.  hard pass on an unplayable game
7899,"super nostalgic, played it when i was a kid and i play it now"
7900,"For those still playing this game, try to avoid fast-travelling! Skyrim is a better experience when you walk, run, or horse-back your way to where you want to go. People seem to really love doing this in Red Dead Redemption 2, and quite frankly the same enjoyment can be had taking the scenic routes of Skyrim. Soak in the music! Watch the wildlife gallop by! Take time to think about life the same way you do while in the shower. Watch Skyrim's months go by as you enter winter and triumphantly survive to see Spring. Allow yourself to get a little lost and have unplanned adventures!"
7901,Amazing game can be made even better with mods
7902,"Buy the special edition. Fantastic game, but the special edition is just objectively better and cheaper now that the legendary edition isn't available on steam (you can still buy the dlc but it's hidden)."

7904,meme
7905,Amazing!
7906,"An RPG masterpiece for sure. Even after almost 10 years, this game still good to play.
But the big problem of this game is... bugs... Really I can't count anymore the number of bugs per hour that I had while playing this game.
Sometimes, the bug can be funny to watch but the rest of time it's so annoying that it cuts the desire to play it"
7907,"I'm going to offer a dissenting opinion here.

I can't say that Skyrim is ""objectively bad.""  I have about 30 hours in it, so I generally got my money's worth.  But by comparison, I had several hundred hours in both Morrowind and Oblivion.  Aside from improvements to combat and graphical improvements, I think Skyrim is generally a step back from both these games, and a pretty poor RPG in general.

In Skyrim, you play as a quest-doer.  Gameplay consists of performing linear quests for people who ask you to.  There is typically only one way to complete a quest, and if you are given a choice, its usually only at the very end of the quest, right before you get your reward.  There is gameplay outside of doing quests, but it's not very fun or rewarding, and you don't really get to roleplay as anything other than ""person who does errands for other people.""

The quests are often linear to the point of being nonsensical or immersion breaking.  For example (extremely mild spoiler warning), in one quest you help the guards in a city find a serial killer.  You can find the killer's diary before even starting the quest, which basically amounts to a signed confession by the killer.  However you cannot show the diary to any NPC or talk to any NPC about the contents of the diary.  You have to let the killer kill several people before you can apprehend them in the ""proper"" stage of the quest, despite having hard evidence the entire time.

That being said, the content in quests related to the main story or major factions (e.g., thieves guild, dark brotherhood, etc.) is generally good.  It gets worse and worse as you move down the totem pole (e.g., doing a quest for some random NPC in town often involves moving to a map marker and pressing ""E"").  The content outside of quests is pretty dismal.

As an example, the game doesn't force you to join the thieves guild to become a thief; you can break into any NPC's house and steal their stuff.  But thieving outside the thieves guild quests is often boring and pointless.  With rare exception, NPCs don't own anything interesting, and it is trivially easy to sneak around their mostly empty houses.  Even breaking into the palace of a Jarl rarely produces anything other than a few cheap trinkets.

Being an assassin is even more frustrating.  I'd guess that roughly 40% of named NPCs in Skyrim are essential (unkillable), even if they have no relevance to anything other than their own, mediocre errand for you to do.  Further, you cannot tell which NPCs are essential before you land the killing blow, at which point they'll just kneel on the ground for a bit, get up, and talk to you like you didn't just try and murder them.

Exploring is also fairly pointless, which is disappointing for a game with such a large and detailed world.  Basically if the game didn't direct you to a cave, ruin, or dungeon via a quest marker, it is almost certainly filled with randomly generated loot, which is at best a very mild improvement to whatever you're already carrying.  If you manage to stumble on a quest-related dungeon without picking up the relevant quest, good luck; there is a good chance that you'll encounter a door or some barrier that you simply can't get through without an item from the quest giver.

As a short aside, the dragon attack mechanic in the game is cool for the first couple times it happens, but becomes really annoying really quickly.

If you haven't played many RPGs, you might be inclined to think these examples are the norm, but honestly none of these problems exist in Morrowind, a game produced by the same studio 9 years before Skyrim came out.  I'm not trying to say that Morrowind is objectively better than Skyrim, Morrowind had a ton of problems that Oblivion and Skyrim fixed.  But to me, it seems like for every thing Skyrim does better than its predecessors, it does something else worse."

Further, I went on to Skyrim - Special Edition, which was free from Bethesda and Steam, I thereafter logged on many thousand more hours of enjoyment! No other game has provided me with as much pleasure! I spent a month in the hospital and many months attempting to recover. Then COVID hit.  Thank you Bethesda and Steam for providing this game!

The Elder Scrolls foretold of their return!
Their defeat was merely delay, until the time after Oblivion opened,
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
But no-one wanted to believe – believe they even existed.
And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.
But, there's one they fear.
In their tongue, he's Dovahkiin – Dragon Born

7996,"I have no idea why I haven't reviewed this game after countless hours. This game is perfect, considering it was made in 2011. Vanilla Skyrim kinda gets boring after 10 playthoughs, however modding help. I recommend: Sancrosanct- Better vampires. I can't wait for TES6 to be better."

irregardless of it being worse than the predecessors (that i haven't played yet) or the fact that it's a bethesda game it's still near and dear to me and i honestly recommend it. Many hours of gameplay in the vanilla game alone and if killing gets to repetitive you get become homesteader via the hearthfire dlc. 

dragons, fantasy, building houses and beautiful landscapes to look at while you ignore the main quests? what's not to love

12/10 did buy again for pc when i didn't have access to my xbox"

this game is easily bethesda's best game ever and if you say falout new vegas is better I will fus ro dah your existence into outer space"
8038,I have played and replayed this game in so many ways. VR is pretty unique too.
8039,Its Bioshock! One of the all time greats!
8040,Skyrim and the rest of the Elder Scrolls Series have become classics for offline gamers. There is no better open world RPG i have ever played. The ability to mod is its hugest success. This gave all players and modders a playground!
8041,"pretty cool, played this years ago and im glad to be playing it again
"
8042,It gewd
8043,its just fun and funny modded XD and amazing story can play it 100x over
8044,it s a very good game to explore and kill and the story is really good
8045,This is a great vacation from the real world!
8046,"This was the very first game I cracked 1,000 hours in, back on Xbox360. I platinum-ed the game back then, before mods were allowed on console. Then, when PS4 came out, I bought this game again. I think I put another 1,000 hours into my PS4 account, also getting every single achievement the game offered before later being allowed to use mods (but no mods that changed gameplay, so generally visual only mods). Here I am, again, on another platform. Still playing this game. While I can't see myself putting in another 1,000 hours, I will one day get all the achievements Steam has to offer for this game. For a game that came out 10 years ago this year, it still holds up and delivers in a way other games simply cannot."
8047,"I played 55 hours of this game in 2014, then my save file corrupted, lost forever. FUCK YOU BETHESDA"
8048,"This is a fantastic game with the Steam Workshop Mods even better, and tons of stuff I have not explored still to this day. So I am very pleased with this game."
8049,Game is pretty good. But then theres the hundreds of bugs that are game breaking. This game is the most frustrating shit show i've ever seen. Legit worse than Ark.
8050,Skrim
8051,"I've played this game more times than I probably should have. This is my favorite game of all time, and definitely a must-play for any RPG fan. The storylines are the weakest part of the game, but the exploration and progression is the most satisfying experience I've had in a video game."
8052,"Despite all the bugs, it does have a really good story line to follow and most side quests are actually fun. Also fantastic if you just like to explore."
8053,"Skyrim is the greatest game to ever be made on Earth. You can try and change my mind, but you will fail. Skryim is the GOAT."
8054,please do yourself a favor and give it a shot
8055,"The action oriented Elder Scrolls, you know it.
Play it, mod it, enjoy."
8056,hehe unlisted game
8057,Game just doesn't work abandon all hopes of modding this game doesn't matter how high powered your processor is this game will crash consistantly ever 10-30minutes.
8058,It's great just don't kill any chickens
8059,"We all know the game by now, but honestly? It's worth it if you want to make a good character and have their own lore."
8060,iz gud game
8061,"great game 
"
8062,"The combat is flawed
The animations are stilted
The waypoints are confusing at times
The side missions are better than the main story pretty much
The dialogue is alright (except for the same five or six voice actors that get repeated the entire game and even characters changing voices mid-conversation multiple times including gender-swapping lol)
The graphics are pretty good for 2011
The music is the best thing about this game tbh

Obviously mods would fix most of these issues, but that's my issue with it. The game has been out for a decade at this point and the community have done a better job supporting the game than the developers have (not in financial terms at least). It's a great game at heart but I refuse to replay it."

8070,Skyrim is great
8071,"I mean, if you somehow haven't played Skyrim, what are you even doing?
Just play it! it's a hell of an adventure that I always seem to find myself coming back to every once in a while. Not to mention that there are a lot of amazing mods.

Seriously, why are you even looking at Skyrim reviews right now? It's been out for almost 10 years! You've probably already bought it on several different console systems."
8072,"you shout, you hop, you play, you swing sword - what more could gamers need? this is the best game of all time. cut and dry. here's to 7 more ports."
8073,"It's Skyrim, do you really need to know if it's good? Everyone owns a copy of this game on some platform!

Seriously, this game is great, it has some bugs/glitches that you'll probably want to mod away but that's the Bethesda charm.

Once my xbox finally died, I got a new PC and now I still play to this day. I've purchased this game 3 times now, and I have no regrets.

I think I've done everything (or most things) the game has to offer. I love Skyrim. The Pros outweigh any cons. Most (if not all) of the cons can also be fixed via workshop content, so it's really great!

If you manage to do it all, try a mod that opens up a new chapter into the game, or creates a completely different story.

So there is 1 really big con, that's the lack of co-op. Yes you can mod for it, but it's not n00b pc user friendly, and it's very very glitchy and buggy. I would say it's not functional... So that's it. My only complaint really.

Spend your coin. Play Skyrim. I'm bad at reviews... forgive me."

8083,"Why are you even looking at skyrim reviews? you know you have this game on every console already, you most likely bought it about 5 times just do it again."
8084,game says it all...
8085,"this game is stunning, the atmosphere, the stories, the quests/missions, those magical potions and wands, dragons, the undead and those different type of races, having an option to be able to create your own character and even more!!!
it's just amazing i would recommend this game 100% 
except it's unlisted...such a shame..."

8092,"Epic story. Major strategy game. In a mid evil setting of legend, dragons and powers that no one else has is given to you. Just be careful."
8093,game is dope 11/10
8094,go to install the game after awhile and i can not even get past the first load screen. cant access the main menu before a crash. anyone have a fix
8095,mega good but spiders be spooky
8096,it good
8097,"You're here because either you are looking for the most modded game of all time, heard about this as a classic from your friends or YouTube, or you're interested in hearing what other people think of Skyrim.

Well here it is short and simple. Story is okay. Combat is okay. Characters are okay. Visuals leave something to be desired. If you have played this before, you might relive some nostalgia but honestly this game is better with mods. It's so much more entertaining that way."
8098,"this game is epic i played it and fell in love even 10 years later i still enjoy it
i instantly bought this on my new account and started a new character"
8099,"Amazing game and my favorite from the elder scrolls franchise, can't recommend it enough! after beating the main story and the two big dlcs, mods are just fabulous! The forgotten city was my first and now I just keep on discovering more and more. anyway it's worth your time."
8100,Most likely one of the best open world games out there.  Many still play this game even after 10 years since release.  Large community that have added many thing to the workshop.
8101,"Special edition is this, but newer.
Skyrim was always mediocre though, if modding support wasn't there it wouldn't have any staying power."
8102,Iconic game!
8103,very good
8104,"one of the best games ever made, immersive, plenty of stuff to do, excellent combat and enemies, exploration is fun and rewarding, cities are beautifully designed, forests and wildlife are excellent"

8107,What do you mean recomend? this is skyrim
8108,"Nearly a decade old now, Skyrim still stands out as one of the great milestones of gaming.  Explore a huge, diverse world at your own pace, undertake a plethora of quests and customise and improve your character as you go.  If you've never played it, just go for it.  A modern classic in my opinion, and the thousands of mods available just add to the vast amount there is to see."
8109,"This game is the best for people who love open world games that gives you freedom but also gives you lots of quest. I personily love this game, have been playing it 7+ years."
8110,.
8111,"Its awesome, no cap!"
8112,"long time fun, play now for free health issues and crippling depression"
8113,"I have played this game for hundreds if not thousands of hours, the only reason steam displays me having (at the time of writing) 12.6 hours is because steam only records hours played when online. This is one of my favorite video games of all time; be it with mods or even vanilla. It's a wonderful game and highly recommend it. Mods obviously make the experience so much better, but as previously stated: this game is still great even without mods."
8114,"youre crazy if you dont
"
8115,It's an amzing game. It has a lot of gameplay
8116,This game is incredible and life changing. Def top 3.

8123,"(Essential quality-of-life mod recommendations for completely new players after the DLC links in this review.)
A wonderful game, but odds are you already know that if you're looking at this stealth listing instead of the Special Edition. The base game is fun, but flawed; mods are the lifeblood of this game and can provide everything from improved menus/graphics/models to improved quests and combat to the downright silly memes like Thomas the Tank Dragon. I wouldn't say the base game is BAD, but it definitely has issues and can be improved easily.

Unfortunately, Bethesda is pushing the Special Edition HARD in order to shove people toward crappy paid mods inferior to preexisting mods. This likely wouldn't be half as annoying if the Special Edition didn't break many of said mods; Special Edition compatible versions need to be made separately from the Legendary versions. The irksome little buggers are even hiding the DLC that makes up the legendary edition: 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/
https://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/
https://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/

Personally, I use Vortex Mod Manager and Nexusmods to make modding fairly painless. Even if you want a ""Vanilla"" Skyrim experience to start you off, Skyrim's default UI and menus leave something to be desired. I very highly recommend: 
- [b]Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch:[/b] Fixes a ton of bugs and is generally wonderful. Use it.
- [b]SkyUI:[/b] improved menus, including an item-search function and organizing by weight, value, value per weight, etc. Seriously, use this. The default menu is terrible. 
- [b]Static Mesh Improvement Mod:[/b] Vastly improves models so that, say, you can shoot arrows through the bars of grates instead of having the grate model be a solid square.
[u]Lower priority, but still nice to have[/u]:
- [b]A Quality World Map: [/b] Greatly improves the world map's appearance and makes it easier to tell where in the world [strike]is Carmen[/strike] you are.
- [b]Climates of Tamriel:[/b] Lighting and environment AKA graphic upgrades. 

That might seem like a lot for a ""vanilla"" game, but as you'll learn with Skyrim, mods aren't actually as big as they look. Modders frequently go out of their way to avoid conflicts with each other and simply focus on their own piece of the pie. This is one of Skyrim's strengths and is how, say, you can have [i](*checks own mod order*)[/i] 35 mods on a stable game, if you're careful."

You want hookers in your game?
With mods you can buddy! :D
You want rainbows? That's all you here bud!

Take beautiful flowing pictures of sexy af elves, and make out with them too!
This game and mods, you will never need to buy another game ever ever again. Just play and mod Skyrim for eternity; in fact we can keep this up for another 800 years. It just works!
But not without mods. Once you've modded skyrim, you'll never go back."

-Awesome vanilla DLC
-Lots of replay value (days and days of binge playing fun)
-A freakig awesome comunity workshop of DLC's with thousands of options to perk up and fuck up your game (even to sexy up the game if you are into being horny all the time)

Why are you reading my review? BUY THE BLOODY GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
8144,"this game is very cheesable which i like and it just works
its an old game and im recommending it about 9 years after its release so it must be good and just get into it you dont even need to glitch the game and i feel as though glitches only come to those who glitch so as long as u stay clean your fine it has some of the best missions and diversity a game could have even though i normally play as a sneaky stabby boy each time i feel like its different"
8145,"Vanilla game is mediocre and visually unappealing, with significant steps backward in design when compared to predecessors in the Elder Scrolls series Oblivion and Morrowind... but is a superb modding platform. I say that without sarcasm or insult—it is totally genuine praise. This game is very, very fun to tinker, fiddle, and create your own fun with. In fact, it is rivaled by none when it comes to that experience; not Minecraft, not Gmod, none. ""But why recommend this game if you admit it's not that good without mods?"" you may rightfully ask. In response to this, I say that judging TES games without taking modding into account is like judging AAA FPS series installments by their singleplayer. Games will only ever be as fun as their communities make them, and Skyrim's community have made it a blast for ten years and counting."

8147,"Lots to explore, read and try! definitely would recommend!!"

8151,It Just Works
8152,Allow your consciousness to slip away from the real world and into the fantasy of Skyrim. This is an amazing game. All the good stuff that you have heard about Skyrim is 100% true.
8153,"fucking cool game ever
"
8154,"played it first on xbox, epic game, download mods to see boobies"
8155,"Yay, dragons."
8156,I really enjoy this game. I hope Elder Scrolls VI is just as fun and amazing. There are many mods out there that allow you to customize the game to your likes. Even after all the time playing the game their are still surprises and experience that I have not had. This game is the first game that makes me want to get all the achievements. Their are so many side quests and interesting events that occur while playing it is easy to get sidetracked and away from the main story. The guild quests are fun and exciting.
8157,This has some different mods to SE. I like LE for reasons of modding.

8167,I've played this game for a while now its great the only issue I have with it is the amount of bugs
8168,Play it.
8169,One of the most easy games to mod and full of amazing adventures without them as well!
8170,"Skyrim on pc with mods is amazing, the exploration and hidden quests in this game alone are worth it. 10/10"

8175,"June 2021, WARNING, while i give it a thumbs up there were so many quests that are broken and stuck. Its hard to believe after all this time this game has this amount of broken quests and some of them were major side arcs. Some you could go back to a much earlier save and spend a lot of time then redoing all you did only to find out that it was still fugging broken. quests like finding maba in riften. necklace in a drawer, going through a mystical portal that would freeze my PC every time i tried to go through as part of a major side arc. I was able to finish the game though but i felt like i got robbed of a lot of stuff and wasted way to much time having to redo some quests. I still enjoyed the game overall though and even with its many still flaws its worth playing but certainly not paying more then 10.00 for this outdated and still very buggy game.  A lot of my hours were AFK time spent leveling up heavy armour while i slept to get points"

Plenty of stories, characters, quests, collectables to find. Great fun, good mechanics.

8193,"Love it! You have to understand that I didn't understand this game when I first played it... This was because the setting and mythology surrounding it wasn't very appealing to me, that being said. 

Once you get a hang of the honestly rough and straight forward gameplay you begin to enjoy the game, it's premise and the world that you're thrown into... you can build your character however you want, he can be a mage an archer a theif a duel wielding warrior and more! 

Want to be a Chef, want to be a Miner, want to create potions and unique weapon effects, want to become a Blacksmith well now you can! Join a guild marry a lizard and live happily you've earned it...or have you? 

I give The Witcher 3 a 8/10 without mods and with mods I give it a 8/10...

Oh yeah the story? I fell asleep in class... It's good."

8209,"Nearly reaching the peak of RPG gameplay, Fallout New Vegas is another option but this is good for the Fantasy Types."
8210,"bethesda only shows the deluxe edition when you search skyrim, good work on finding the normal edition"
8211,"amazing world filled with story lore and advunture you can play it for days and still have something to do very addctive aslo 
Mods Mods Mods 
the mod community is amazing and big you can find a mod for everything"
8212,"If there was only one game to play, this would be my choice, and I've been playing videos since ""Pong""."
8213,best game ever
8214,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there..."
8215,A true sandbox game that has held up really well. Don't get mods until you're bored of the base game because they will basically create a new game experience once installed.
8216,its skyrim...
8217,Reaching level 80 is worth it
8218,"good gracious todd, you've done it again"
8219,Incredibly rich and detailed world.  Many side quests supplement the main plot.  Best of its kind in my opinion.
8220,"I have played this game on console since I was a kid. Going on almost ten years since this game came out and it is still one of the best games ever made. Especially now on PC with the mods that make the game almost like new.
"
8221,"Skyrim is the game that allowed me to start my adventure in gaming originally getting it on the Xbox 360 since then i keep coming back too this game and playing a play-through each different to before a different class a different race, This game is and will continue to be a master piece"
8222,"One of the Games everyone have to play. And from Skyrim, SkyrimSE and SkyrimVR my favorite (because of excellent modders support - you can find everything you want).
10/10"
8223,There's a reason this thing went mainstream.
8224,"Tons to do in both side- and main quests. 
And you can play it even when you are a bit tired, since you can focus on the big world with all its side quests. 

I think this game might be my all-time favourite, 
And yup.. I got it on ps3, ps4 and switch too. 

I can not recommend this game enough for you."
8225,"Hmm
"
8226,"Great game, I am sure you all already know the multitudes of reasons."
8227,Good old times.

8242,One of the best games ever made.
8243,"Тупое говно тупого говна. А вообще игра легендарна, как и это издание."
8244,"They thought of everything. Excellent adventure game  and has puzzle solve, level up perks and works well with steel series controller.
"
8245,"what possible is there to say about skyrim that has not been said ., i originally bought this game on 11/16/2011 for my ps3 and fell in love with the game ., fast forward to building my first gaming pc with some outdated parts .. this game is master piece even years later ., being able to use mods to increase the replay of it is incredible .. the story is as fantastic as it ever was the game holds up even 11 years later ., do yourself a favor and play it . i love this game period."
8246,It's inevitable to come back to this game
8247,"It's a good game, and the mods make it even better."
8248,Thank goodness for mods or this would be a very bland rpg
8249,"Yeah, yeah, the game is so popular it's a meme. But really. Really. It's a FUN game. Not everything about it is perfect or even good, but it is /fun/ and that is what matters in games."
8250,I like it bc i like the game
8251,"This game is amazing.  Open world, good story, good RPG elements and you are not forced to keep to a rigid class system.  DLC as well worth the money."
8252,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there."
8253,yeah it's skyrim
8254,kaya rogorc kata :)
8255,"A classic and very immersive and fun to play. It provides a real feeling of freedom and exploration too.

My main criticism though is that I find the main questline a bit boring. Just slaying dragons and stuff... it sounds fun but it got repetitive for me very quickly. Maybe I should try it again sometime though.

Instead I mostly spent my time exploring, doing other quests like the Stormcloak ones, and just enjoying everything else Skyrim and its world has to offer.

Anywho, even with that factored in it's easily a game I'd recommend :)"
8256,"Had the legendary Edition of the game (including all DLCs) and now it's telling me the game doesn't have any DLCs
it's Bethesda's cheap greedy way to force people into buying the special edition of the game which is basically the exact same thing

people need to give Bethesda the EA treatment and boycott them"
8257,Its a fun game that i just love to MOD .

8384,I love the worldbuilding and all the different quests and paths you can take.
8385,"I have a love hate relationship with Skyrim, and the vanilla experience, which this review is for, is most certainly a hate relationship.

As a disclaimer, I will say that MODDED Skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, however to leave a positive review would be to suggest that the vanilla experience is good enough, and that's just not something I believe.

Skyrim is the weakest game in the Elder Scrolls series, and was the beginning of a long series of Bethesda trumping RPG features to make the game more widely appealing to broad audiences. You are locked into the role of the dragonborn, and forced through a linear story with literally no options to play as who you want. Give us a character creator, diverse skills, and perks all you want, the fact that we are given a linear story with no other choices removes the right for Skyrim to be called an ""rpg"". These issue plagues the entire game. Alongside this forced storyline, Skyrim is riddled with unkillable NPCs that are ""essential"" to the storyline. Also, bandits assaulting a person who is the known dragonborn, who has literally slain Alduin the fucking [i]WORLD EATER[/i]??? Is Bethesda that lazy?

[h1]The Present ""Choices""[/h1]
Now, let's talk about the choices they DO give you, and why they aren't enough. The glaringly obvious one here is the ability to choose a side in the civil war. Imperial vs Stormcloak, the choice between law and order or..... racial superiority? The entire civil war storyline is very lazy, with no lasting impacts on the game world. Bethesda had the chance to make the civil war a meaningful, huge part of the game world, with player choices changing everything. Imagine if the game completely changed based on the side you chose and who won. A believable Imperial Skyrim, showing how the previously Stormcloak regions are now coping with Imperial rule, or the opposite way around. Instead, nothing like this is present. You choose a side, do some quests, kill some people, and now one side has ""won"". The Battle of Whiterun is pretty cool, though.

Alright, well how about joining the Thieves guild or the Companions? Or the ability to join the Dawnguard or become a Vampire/Werewolf? Again, the same problem applies to the Thieves Guild and the Companions. Joining them has no real meaningful impact, aside from a few quests you can do. The difference in experience a player who chooses to join these factions versus one who does not are completely mitigable. Dawnguard is an exception, I'll give them props for that one.

Now, it's time for me to lay my overwhelming negativity upon the gameplay itself.

[h1]The Combat.[/h1]
The combat in Skyrim is ""good enough"" at best and downright retracts from an otherwise pleasant experience at worst. Overall, it's a completely bare-bones combat system which does everything it has to to get the job done, without innovating in any way or providing anything interesting that might make the player need to use their brain. To begin with, the enemy AI is absolutely atrocious and frustrating. They make stupid decisions, they have generic headless chicken tactics of running towards the player, block-attack-block-attack-block-attack, and then promptly dying. The only thing that makes the AI even somewhat of a challenge is the classic lazy system of ""gib lots of hitpoints :D"" and ""remove lots of hitpoints >:("". There is nothing interesting present, no abilities which might throw you off-guard, no tactics employed by AI in groups, not even something as basic as a system of soft counters aside from armour type. If Bethesda had any interest in creating an innovative game, they could've designed the AI based around synergy, timing, and tactics. Lots of games allow for basic systems like this, and yet, in the number one best selling RPG of all time, every enemy you face is a headless chicken. ""Never should have come here!"" Don't even get me started on the creatures found throughout Skyrim. Not even basic wildlife AI is present, instead they just plop a hostile AI in the woods which will blindly charge at you no matter the situation. At least Fallout had the ""Friend of nature"" perk, god damn.

[h1]Perks and skills[/h1]
The system present for perks and skills is actually, surprisingly, perfectly fine, but the issue arises through it's implementation and poor synergy with gameplay. Perks and skills are uncreative, blindly raising a stat or checking a gate and allowing you to craft more things or kill stuff deader with generic AoE damage spell #134. There's a lot of potential here [spoiler]that mods explore[/spoiler] to allow perks and skills to unlock new gameplay features and change the way you play the game. Perks should be about giving you entire new abilities, unlocking a new tactic to employ during combat, making your character into a unique-lil-bean, but instead, we get stuff like [b][i]stealth is 20% easier. [/i]

[h1]The World[/h1]
The world is completely static. This is a huge problem and a first from Bethesda. Even in Fallout 3, the worst of Fallout, the world changed in meaningful ways after beating the story, [i]albeit through a DLC[/i]. There's great mods to address this, my favorite being Helgen reborn. Aside from the static world, they totally knock it out of the park on this one. There's plenty of locations to explore, most of which are unique and engaging, and a lot of awesome visual story-telling. The world is the strongest point of vanilla Skyrim.

[h1]In conclusion[/h1]
Skyrim isn't a bad game, but it's certainly a bad RPG and a bad installment in the Elder Scrolls. With mods, you can make it into one of the greatest games of all time, and the community has truly made Skyrim into one of the best fantasy installments in the gaming industry of all time. However, it is a great example of failed potential and how an unpassionate game studio can completely fall short of what could've been."
8386,Its the best game ever
8387,"""it just works"""
8388,It was a good game. I liked it
8389,The children should fear the strong.
8390,It's skyrim
8391,One of the best games I've ever played in my entire life!

8395,"My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperial, can you say the same?"
8396,KANKERZIEK
8397,Not worth it now that 64 Bit Skyrim is out.  Do not bother unless you want achievements or modifications that require this version.
8398,Its gud stuff
8399,good game
8400,"still one of the best games ever made 
"
8401,I've sunk many hours into playing and modding this game it's a true masterpiece that Todd is trying to destroy with SSE.
8402,game is pretty dögshit but you can be a werewolf
8403,best ever
8404,i broke it. i would break it again. i owe my life to this game
8405,gud
8406,pretty good
8407,yes.
8408,"GAMEPLAY: completely broken in both good and bad ways. On the positive side there is a massive open world with tons of content, the combat is at best passable, and a number of glitches and exploits can be used for both useful and hilarious results, sometimes simultaneously. On the other hand, the game is riddled with numerous save-ending bugs which require you to save often and keep track of how far to go back if a quest breaks, stealth is completely broken, the combat is at worst mind-numbingly tedious, and the puzzles are asinine. Skyrim is devastatingly unpolished and it shows. 7/10.

LOOKS: the animations are jank and most faces look terrible. The environments are pretty impressive though. 8/10.

VALUE: Skyrim is a huge game with insane replayability. You can go through the game a dozen times and play it completely differently, experiencing different parts of the world, each time. Furthermore, Skyrim has a dedicated community of insanely devoted modders who allow you to basically change Skyrim into any game you want. However, it's become slightly more difficult to buy old Skyrim instead of Special Edition because Bethesda had it and its DLC delisted from Steam search. They've also stopped discounting it on sales, but if you can track down Skyrim from some other more congenial source at a price befitting a decade old game, the value increases only further. 10/10.

OTHER NOTABLES: Jeremy Soule's music is pretty awesome. 

FINAL VERDICT: 25/30, 8.33. This game is tremendously influential and a huge part of gaming history. It's definitely worth experiencing at least once, even though it's also hugely flawed."
8409,"Absolutely love this game! Love it so much that I have it on four consoles! Do I have a problem? Yes! Will I do anything about it? Hell nah! 

In all seriousness tho this game is a masterpiece. Sure the graphics are a bit dated but for its time it looks A M A Z I N G! There is so much to do that you'll never get bored! Want to be a badass assassian? A thief as elusive as the shadows? Or what about a badass Drow spellsword dragon hunter? The possibilities are truly endless!

TLDR; I rate this game a sexy 10/10."
8410,cool
8411,"Its amazing in everyway its bugs are awesome but one thing
FUCKING MIRAK STEALING MY DRAGON SOULS"
8412,it's the funny arrow knee game
8413,Is good.
8414,"Easily one of the best fantasy RPGs out there, even almost ten years after being released. Main quest line is good, side quests are good, DLCs are good. There's nothing I can complain about, really."
8415,"I killed Cicero
10/10"
8416,IT FUn
8417,"Even in 2021, Skyrim is still just as fun as it used to be back when it first came out. While the game might be a bit buggy as many Bethesda games tend to be, the Steam Workshop can help fix many of these problems. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and open-world adventure games."
8418,"u can get a ""kill children"" mod, then adopt children and kill them in ur home.. nobody will know 10/10"
8419,"Very addictive
"
8420,"nice game, nice story, good side quests, I loved it"
8421,Worst game ever
8422,uwu hot cat men
8423,No description needed. One of the best games ever created.
8424,Very fun with mods
8425,I fell up instead of down. 10/10
8426,It is Skyrim perhaps the best in the entire Elder Scrolls line. If you have not tried it do so. It lives up to the hype.
8427,Best game ever
8428,Gold and goodly.
8429,"I used to be an adventurer like you, Until I took an arrow to the knee"
8430,still a good game 7 years later!
8431,Wow quite the game! I can recommend!
8432,yes
8433,"Minuses : The game has dull gameplay, you are a caveman. There is no balance in this one, NPC do know nothing about you, Dragons are weak,chests are infinity. Pluses: there are a lot of ability which you always improve, lore is not bad."
8434,"I have always played Skyrim on PS4 but now I have it on my laptop so that I can use cooler mods even if my laptop probably can't run most of them.

Best game"
8435,"There are no bugs, only features"
8436,"I have been playing for many years, and i will continue to play for many years to come inshallah

Tek sıkıntı şu ki oyunda seslendirme kadrosun her halde 8-9 kişiden oluşuyor çünkü bazı sesleri çok fazla duyuyorsunuz. A köyünden bir adamın sesi, D krallığında bir korumanın sesi çıkabilir."
8460,cool game
8461,"I dont know what Im doing but its fun. 10/10
"
8462,"It's like lots of other Bethesda games where you get kind of caught up in side quests for awhile... Then about 100 hours in you're ready for it to just all be over, so speed through the rest of the game.  So the game has some things that pull you in at first, but be warned: one of the most anticlimactic endings (or non-endings) ever."
8463,cool game
8464,"Friends hyped me up to play this all time ""Classic""...... Let's just say my time on this game lasted about 10 mins as I sat through the buggiest intro of all time while my cart and horses flipped around the screen non-stop. Worse than Cyberpunk!"
8465,A classic
8466,it was super immersive and fun
8467,"Started playing it in again 10 years after first release. Got a bugged intro, horses going crazy, carriage flying in the air. Aaahhh Bethesda. 10/10."
8468,Better than sex with a dwarf.
8469,Playable
8470,KOKONUT APPROVES
8471,"What can you say about Skyrim? It's Skyrim. Let it into your heart and you'll always have fond memories, even after the combat gets old and mods no longer satisfy. I recommend that you kill the first dragon then pick a direction and head out into the unknown. The story's not going anywhere, and the adventure is really what this game is about. I wish I could play this game blind again."
8472,"I have been playing the game for years but only recently on my computer, it's by far my favourite and most repeatable game I've ever played. I have made at least 30+ characters and amassed a minimum of around 1500 hours, 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
8473,it real good
8474,kage
8475,I love this game.  It is huge and very compulsive
8476,Breton for life!

8489,Open World
8490,it gud
8491,Awesome RPG with seemingly endless replay value after the main story lines and plenty of fun side quests.  Highly recommend
8492,Is aight
8493,"Dislikes: Can be glitchy. No Co-op (would be amazing).

Likes: Absolute masterpiece of a game.  If it had the complexity of Morrowind and coop it would be perfect.  A lot of amazing MODs to keep the game interesting.  Graphics still hold to today's standard although no t quite the breathtaking experience it was on release.  Can't wait for the sequel, although it seems like we might be quite a ways a way."
8494,its a great game
8495,had this game since 2015 HIGHLY recommend it to anyone
8496,aa
8497,Love this game !!!
8498,"Great open world, Great story and gameplay. One of the best games of the decade but shows its ages, mods can fix that"
8499,"sheeeesh

8500,Kill Dragon Good

Story was a bit chaotic at start."
8503,Praise be to Godd Howard
8504,good
8505,good clean fun
8506,bien bien
8507,possibly the best game bethesda has ever made. but the truth is that its only really still relevant because of how stupidly fun this game is
8508,"Don't lie, you still lol at that Arrow to the Knee meme!"
8509,"Cant start a new game, since I previously played with Mods now ever time I try to erase everything an re-download the game I run into the same bug. Horse Carriage will never reach the chopping block, so it makes starting a new game literally impossible. It is sad that since they came up with the enhanced edition that allows for no MODS they forgot about this one, loved playing the game in 360 and PC and now I cant enjoy it again. Dissapointed, definetely wont be buying the next 3 versions of Skyrim for the newer gen consoles. 

"
8510,
8511,my favourite game ever created.
8512,It's Skyrim. You Should know why.
8513,yes
8514,greatest game of all time. you're missing out if you've never played. even after a decade the game is still interesting and the game feels alive. skyrim puts every game to shame with countless hours of content and the game still feeling fresh
8515,Sadly I only bought this game once
8516,"""The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your horker
...I can respect that."""
8517,Good if you avoid all the magic and witchcraft stuff as much as you can. Fun to grab all the weapons and sell things and BUY Things!!
8518,Eren Yeager
8519,yeah its okay i guess
8520,"Its Skyrim... Just buy it, because if you're down here looking for reviews then you already know that you will!"
8521,"It's literally skyrim, i don't know what i could say to convince you to play the game at this point. I guess if you enjoy open world fantasy games this is right up your alley."
8522,"gg, nice graphics, npc's are weird but i like the shouting and all the spells, v fun, had gud time, last played in 2014"
8523,"I only just got into PC gaming a year ago. And only really built a PC to mod Skyrim ,but sadly I wasn't able to find this version of Skyrim. So I bought Skyrim SE ,and enjoyed it still ,but I knew that the original was still the best for modding. Anyway so 2 weeks ago I found a digital version of le for $10 ,so I immediately bought it since I had been looking for it ,and also it was just a great deal.  I played it vanilla for 12 hours admiring the pixelated shadows, blinding bloom, and the nice cold feel of the lighting compared to special edition's orange warmish vibes. As well as feeling nostalgia from when I played it on the 360 9 years ago. After that I wanted to see what the Nexus had in store for this game. And o'boy was there a lot! I proceeded to mod the shit out of it! And it looked 10x better than my modded SE version. It was amazing just playing around with oldrim enbs just looking around wondering why se's enbs are so trashed compared to it. Overall modded oldrim is just amazing ,and even though I only have 24 hours while writing this review I plan to play for 1000s of hours. But I will warn you that oldrim with it's 32bit engine is quite unstable even when fully modded for maximum stability I stumbled through more stutters compared to SE. But it's still playable ,and still get a constant 60fps while modded to heck. Final thoughts I do think this version is better ,but I have to say that if you want a fully stable experience I would go with SE. Plus  oldrim will not really take to much advantage of modern hardware ,so if you have a lot of cores ,and a powerful gpu it will not really not use your system to the max even when fully modded ,so if you want to fully take advantage of your new shiny hardware. I'd recommend  SE. At the end of the day both versions offer something unique ,and Skyrim is Skyrim ,so whatever version you get, you will have a good time."
8524,"Skyrim has limitless potential and in the base game you can do so much and play in so many different ways. but then you add mods to the mix and its easily the best game iv'e ever played.any bugs the base game does have are always easily fixed and not game breaking in the first place, i have played a lot of games but there's no other game like Skyrim that i always go back to, 10/10 would love to experience it all over again"
8525,after 250 mods the game crashed its all bethesdas fault
8526,"This game is literally the glitchiest game I've ever touched, in the first ""scene"" The wagon scene, my horse glitches out and i don't progress, smd fucking stupid ass game"
8527,Perfect game to lose time and escape reality
8528,
8529,RPG
8530,"Güd.
mod it so bad Todd Howard himself won't recognise it, even better"
8531,It's a good Elder Scrolls Game. I like all PC Elder Scroll Games.
8532,"Amazing game, definently reccomend.
The graphics are pretty astonishing for a 2011 game, great story, 10/10 battles, badass dragons!!!
everything is great. I also really apreciate the HUGE size of the map and the sore amount of freedom you have. you could play this gamne for possibly 400 hours and still not be able to fully complete it. Personaly still havent finished the game but cant wait! great to play the game once more, memories flow in like crazy :)"
8533,Fooose..
8534,not good
8535,good game i like the story behind it i wont spoil it but im really enjoying it so far
8536,"A classic, coming soon to your microwave LCD display
"
8537,good game very skyrim
8538,i always come back to this game but ive never finished it before
8539,"Can't start a new game, because the intro is a buggy mess and i glitch into oblivion"
8540,very good
8541,When I think of my childhood I think of this game
8542,"It looks cool, I never played past the first town but it had a good intro.  I'll get around to playing it eventually, then i'll let everyone know if this game is any good."
8543,"this is my new account, i actually probably have several thousands hours in this game. what can i say that hasn't already been said"
8544,Fun game and a nice community of modders providing support for Legendary (LE) Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition (SSE). Making new characters and trying out new mods is almost more fun than playing the game.
8545,great
8546,"Very good game kinda addictive played this game for a long time probably a good few years can't get enough

"
8561,yes
8562,"For some reason the words level up just sit at the bottom of my screen, not to mention the worst intro to anything I have ever seen I would honestly rather watch the Room in its entirety than sit through that garbage intro again. I love this game but having to restart because my file is corrupted I just can't do the intro."
8563,"yes
"
8564,Endlessly replayable.... stands the test of time.
8565,One of my top favorite games of all time. definitely worth playing. i had it on ps4 and played enough to platinum the game.
8566,"A great open-world adventure, that has many hours of replayable content."
8567,DA BESt!!!!!
8568,"to all who wants to play this gem again and dosent want to have stuff bugging out add the [HAVOK] in your skyrim ini file in the my game section on your pc.

8569,This game has some of the best playability around. I buy this game for every platform and it's always worth it. Check out how many awards it has.
8570,Graphic nice. Game play fun. Learning controls slightly difficult.
8571,a classic so to speak
8572,A modders dream that I always return to.
8573,my game is just extremely buggy I can't even get to the character customisation section without having to download a save file to skip the cut scene that just bugs out. I have the LE and not the SE but still the game breaking bugs are just unacceptable
8574,"its a classic, why NOT play it?"
8575,Staple
8576,"Esse jogo me ajuda a lutar contra minha depressão e me alivia de todos outros problemas de uma forma tão magnífica que, eu não sei nem como demostrar isso tudo em palavras. é um amor e afeto tão grande que gerei a partir deste jogo que.. nossa.. eu realmente não sei o que dizer. Comprem-o, vocês merecem viver a mesma experiência que eu e com certeza, muitas outras pessoas tem/tiveram."
8577,simply amazing
8578,the mods and questing and all the stuff
8579,Fun to explore the world and learn many different aspects of game play from magic to fighting to thieving.
8580,Best game ever made. Period

8586,"The modbase here and in Nexus is still good working 5 years after its release.
The DLC's are wonderful.
All these storys in the game are wonderful, even the tinyest ones.
Charakter development is very good and satisfiyng.
So good that I had to immortalize it on my Steam account."
8587,One of the best games ever.
8588,cool i guess
8589,"First game I've achievement hunted. Far from the last.
They all fall, 1 by 1."
8590,"Don't use mods. They will break your game and make you ctd randomly with no explanation. You will spend hours trying different methods to fix it, none of which will work, you will look on forums and people will regurgitate the same overused and useless information and ask for your information and computer specs, which will just result in them telling you to use LOOT or BOSS, neither of which work. If you really want to use mods, be very careful and don't say I didn't warn you."
8591,I like the gameplay and character development.
8592,"Wasted weeks of my life in this shit... 

[h1]10/10[/h1] would do again."
8593,I deleted my save files by accident and I don't wanna do anything over again ever in my life. Was a good game though.
8594,One of the best games i have ever played
8595,H
8596,good game
8597,I absolutely LOVE playing this game. I typically use mods so I have yet to finish it but the quests are really awesome and some of the mods out there really increase my love for this game.
8598,Better than sex.

8637,Awesome game
8638,a new hand touches the beacon!
8639,"This is one of two Bethesda games (the other being Fallout New Vegas) that really got me into and help cement my love of first person RPGs. I didn't used to understand why people were so obsessive over them until I actually spent time on it. I have over 100 hours into Skyrim (not sure why Steam says it's only 95 but whatever) and especially with the addition of mods, I feel like I could probably start a new save every month and not ever get bored. The lore, the storylines themselves, all the customizing. Obvs, it's going to have glitches and issues - this is Bethesda, after all. But I still consider it to be one of the best games I've ever played."
8640,.
8641,Viking game good
8642,kinda weird but i have h

8653,gud
8654,"This game is MEH deal with it

lets make this the #1 review! Love ya"
8655,Classic
8656,For the mods.
8657,"The popularity of this game speak for itself. Even though it's been mostly replaced by the newer 64-bit Special Edition version, there is still some content that is only available for this original version which has become known as Legendary Edition, (or Oldrim). 1,500+ hours of playtime, a decade after it's release and still counting."
8658,endless gameplay
8659,"This game never gets old. Even nearly 10 years later, it still has the story and the graphics to fully immerse yourself in it."
8660,"
The Story:

Obviously, the majority of this whole foreign, breath-taking setting was inspired by the long graceful tide of generational and commercial: drug induced comas.
  Like Previous entries into this Crack-Rock-based ""Lore Hardy"" Series, hardly any of the actual plot is truly comprehensible. Not even the in game characters have clue whats going on at any given moment, but, they WILL beat the absolute Tar out of each other over who gets to keep the bigger plot of land as to grow more dingle berries, or whatever.
Story score: 8 out of 10 crack pipes...
(Could use more Crack.)


The Gameplay:

Honestly an old gem... with a nearly ten-year-old engine, that will crash 8x before you can cram the 15th ""Extra Phat 4k Tiddies mod"" into it; either that or the game will crash itself for you if even dare to wince at it from across the room.
Gameplay Score: 7 out of 10 4k Tiddies
(Go get 'em Tiger! :^J)


"
8661,kill bandiut go weeeeeeeeeeee
8662,n
8663,It goes without saying that I recommend this game. The community has made this game one for the ages. The mods and great ideas make this game fresh and fun.
8664,so far so good
8665,"sztos gierka :)
"
8666,yeah
8667,"Despite the bugs one can encounter here and there in their playthrough, it's an ok game with some fun to be had. Mods on this version of Skyrim is better than on SE if you ask me."
8668,One of my favorite games of all time. It has a great storyline and great gameplay.
8669,It Has Birds
8670,please the God Howard and buy 10 skyrims today
8671,It's Skyrim. You have to love it.
8672,"Time spent playing the game: 8 hours.

Time spent fast traveling: 115 hours

2.5/5 - idk that one character with the swedish name or whatever was kinda hot i guess"
8673,"It may not be as deep as an ocean but to this day I still have yet to find any other game set in a fantasy setting that: -

- has both first-person and third-person modes
- doesn't lock you out of certain side quests without progressing the main story
- allow you to influence in-game factions
- let you buy land and build a house
- let you marry a lizard woman

I didn't even touch the variety of mods that the community around this game has made. From changing the gameplay mechanic to adding isles of new land and story, these efforts are a sight to behold."
8674,"amazing game
"
8675,This game doesn't need much reviewing anymore since it's practically been played by everyone that plays games ever. I thought I'd leave a positive review anyway and say that I can't wait to play Elder Scrolls VI in 2037.
8676,It's kind of boring.
8677,this game is boring as fuck every single time i have tried to play it i just cant had more fun uninstalling
8678,"mhmhmhm

"
8679,"Let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll?"
8680,One of my favorite games. This game got me into RPG's to begin with.
8681,I love the game I bought it on switch!
8682,It's one of the best games ever made!
8683,still good.
8684,Great game
8685,Best RPG game I've ever played
8686,The variety of game play and open world feel lets you delve into the world in such a way the time flies by
8687,"Amazing game with days of content that basically any PC can run.

It can be buggy at times and the graphics aren't anything special but it ages surprisingly well for a game made in 2011.

Many people spend hundreds of hours on this game, there's over 28,000 steam mods and 60,000 other mods, and there's even (I think) 3 DLCs for the game.

The game progresses your perks and skills depending on what you do, firing a bow, sneaking up on people, casting healing spells, mixing potions, swinging an axe.

Sometimes it's hard to know where to go, what to do, because of how much freedom you get, but that's expected in any open-world game

9/10"

8689,efsane
8690,"What can be said about Skyrim that hasn't already been said? The storyline is fun and the game is incredibly immersive. There are millions of mods to add to the game that can make it even more immersive. The game as a whole is perfect for anyone who loves knights and medieval times. Everyone will either sympathize with the Stormcloaks, the Imperials, or they just do all the sidequests and ignore the main quest altogether. I highly reccomend this for the adventurers, the hack and slashers, sneaky archers, or the mages."
8691,"It's skyrim, stop looking at reviews"
8692,"Skyrim is timeless, the world created, the lore and the characters make the game.
The modding community that are always coming out with new and exciting mods help keep the game going."
8693,"who trynna fuck in istanbul
dis game finna slays i guess if u are into dragons and shit i dont know i havent played it yet"
8694,why bethesda remove it from the store tho
8695,"Years ago i put hundreds of hours into several characters whose journeys still revisit me in my dreams. Now I'm back on the wagon, rolling downhill into another series of adventures over various character paths. The core story progresses predictably but it is the variance between quest points where this game transcends the simplicity of sword and sorcery, becoming something you exchange stories about with other adventurers.

It is intensely atmospheric and the landscape has an emotive and engaging presence throughout. Flora and fauna are skilfully and seamlessly integrated into well-crafted set pieces. Characters ramble and roam believably and the fantasy theme sucks you in and keeps you there.

Replay value is high and I am still finding things in one character's adventures that I missed in several others. As you mature in this game your exploration can develop in a way that leaves you feeling a master of your environment. When you look out over the mountain ranges and sweeping plains of Skyrim, you will see stories yet to be written, not just quest markers you need to check off the list."
8696,"An amazing game. Replete with opportunity and nostalgia. Even if you aren't a fan of the elder scrolls franchise, you can still appreciate this game for its breadth, scope and ambition."
8697,sram
8698,curved swords
8699,Mantap djiwa!
8700,"Although getting the SE version of the game would be a lot better, the base game deserves as well as a good review even without all the DLC."
8701,dovakin kinda got a fat bunda
8702,"Skyrim is a great, buggy, funny and glorious game. Who hasn't played skyrim yet and either loved it or hated it. Its also lasted as long as it has done due to its thriving modding community which is still alive and kicking out awesome and creative mods even now.

so yes in short i would recommend you play skyrim if you somehow haven't played it yet"
8703,If you like fighting dragons...
8704,cool i guess
8705,I love this game.

8718,"Despite how dated the game may seem, and the initial glitchiness of the game during it's release, I absolutely love this. I've played it through at least 10 times, and on 3 different platforms. If you haven't played it, you really need to."
8719,"Game's on all platforms.

If you haven't played it yet, consider this game the bird who's lifting up your sorry stone home."
8720,A very detailed game that makes time disappear .
8721,"I literally have a tattoo for this game. If that doesn't tell you that it's amazing, I don't know what will."
8722,"I wouldn't be surprised if my 500+ hours took 2000 hours to accumulate. This game is broken and buggy as hell, and Bethesda has made zero effort to fix it. Constant freezing, crashes, even save corruptions on a fairly regular basis. Unfortunately, this is kind of a running theme with Bethesda: release a broken, half finished game, then make modders fix it for free. I'm not holding my breath, but hopefully with the Microsoft take over of Bethesda, will see people who actually know how to finish and/or code games"
8723,Its a great game with an interesting story and even when that ends there is still tons of stuff to do.  10/10 game
8724,Skyrim.
8725,very swaggy...dragons go roarrrr
8726,I'd like a refund.
8727,My favourite game I can constantly get lost in.
8728,Its Skyrim. What review do you need?
8729,it's POG
8730,"I liked all of it. Liked it in 2010, like it now, in 2021"
8731,"It's got bugs for sure, but the game is still one of the best games I've ever played."
8732,Mods make it an endless experiance.
8733,"I liked this game because of how free it feels, but it can be buggy at times."
8734,"The combat is a bit loose and floaty, and the occasional glitch must sometimes be navigated with console commands, but there's a lot of fun in this game, even if it could have been better with an optional questline to defeat Maven Black-briar soundly.

I would even settle for disgracing Brynjolf.

Anyway yeah, the characters are engaging, the optional questlines are many, and the world is a sufficiently magical one to adventure around in.  Could do with more voice actors, but even so, the game's been many an hour of fun for me."
8735,"Positive review because of mods. Otherwise Skyrim is the elder scrolls devolving with less and less content compared to other titles. Changes to leveling, stats, and magic was a mistake in my opinion. Really hope Elder Scrolls 6 is the game we deserve!"

8741,"Skyrim is an amazing game. The story, side quests, characters, voices, music, mods, and overall enjoyment is amazing. Certainly one of the greatest games of all time! I highly recommend."
8742,It's just brilliant.
8743,I can't say enough good things about this game. One of my all-time favorites.
8744,"yes

8745,Super duper
8746,"This is an incredible game. Imaginative, inventive, pure escapism.  The fantasy narrative doesn't disappoint, not ever. I highly recommend this game."
8747,Down Right Amazing.
8748,"If I had a sister, I would trade her for skyrim in a second"
8749,too many mods... way too many
8750,"The potential is unlimited, rather than making Elder Scrolls 6, they did some stupid mmorpg skyrim that is basically a clone of every mmorpgs out there. I am disappointed in the company, but this game, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a gem, I highly recommend you to finish the main storyline."
8751,when we can have 6
8752,best game
8753,Skyrim more like BUYrim am i right?
8754,This game is sick. Its a great rpg. I really like the atmosphere and the stream lined leveling

8756,"awesome game!, by far my favorite"
8757,"Todd howard please, stop releasing skyrim and start releasing the hostages, its been 20 years!"
8758,good game!

8760,I've played this game for years and it just keeps getting better with more mods coming out. Would recommend to any open world RPG fan. 9/10
8761,iMMERSIVE
8762,"I haven't put many hours into this game, but honestly I don't see why everyone praises this game. I know this came before some of the Fallouts but I still enjoy them more than this. The story takes you around the map, but not in a good way. It'll have you travel many kilometers away all the while you have the chance to be attacked by a dragon, just to have it turn you around and run right back to where you came from.Sure it revolutionized the way games were made but it's not all it was cracked out to be."
8763,Chaos game
8764,great game have no dislikes
8765,اللعبة جميلة لكن الجانب التقني سيء جدا جدا وذا مو شيء غريب وكنت عارف لكن مو لذي الدرجة مهمات ما اقدر اكملها واللعبة تكرش كل شوي

8773,MOD IT. lol
8774,"Skyrim is considered a classic because it's immersive, it gives you a really well realised fantasy world to wander around in, and for the most part, it looks good. Why am I not recommending it? Because if you get down to it, Skyrim is lazy. Let's forget the janky engine for a second, Skyrim's biggest issues lie in story and character. The story is vanilla, predictable, and in most parts, bland. The characters are just triggers to push the story along. There's no depth, no detail.

Let's get back to that janky engine. With enough mods, Skyrim can look beautiful, but there doesn't seem to be anything you can do about the combat. It just feels clunky. 

Skyrim is ambitious, but in all the wrong places. A continent with multiple cities to visit? Great idea, except most of those cities are small enough to be considered villages. Tons of armour and weapons? Sure, but they all look the same. A role-playing system that's easy for those new to the genre but robust enough for seasoned players? We got a system that's shallow and that's easy to create an OP character in. 

Skyrim is a classic and there are a lot of fans, but it seems like this was the start of Bethesda's decline. Across console and PC, I've sunk about 400 hours into this game. You might be wondering why I say it's bad if I have spent so much time in it? Because for the longest time, there weren't any better RPGs. Now there are."
8775,10/10
8776,fuck you yall dumb bitches making it a difference on skyrim together with the special addition and regular big fuck you steam you suck dick also download shit to random random places

8803,S'alright.
8804,the game
8805,"Skyrim is one of the best games I've played. It allows you to flow to different styles of play such as bow, hand to hand, or magic. It also gives you the ability to make it your own such as choices along the way and the creation of housing. I recommend this game to those who just love a good story line with lots of fighting."

8817,"honestly, I didn't play the game cuz my bro decided to play it, but I think he liked it"
8818,is gud
8819,duh
8820,"A latecomer to the game for sure, but great storytelling never ages and the Skyrim has some of the best"
8821,Horny mods
8822,"Skyrim is a good game, if a bit buggy.  Get it on sale.

(I first bought this on the Xbox in November of 2011, it was so buggy that I could not finish the game.  I swore never to buy another Bethesda game until at least a couple years after release and never on a console.  At least on a PC you can use the admin interface to bypass bugs, whereas on a console you basically have to restart and avoid bugged quests.  I finally finished it 8 years later in 2019  on PC.)
"
8823,I've played this game on every platform possible. It's an amazing game that I'll probably keep playing even when the next one comes out in 2030.
8824,Simply one of the greatest games of all time.  The perfect sandbox solo rpg.
8825,Two thumbs up
8826,"I have just over 400 hours on THIS version of Skyrim, no shit I recommend"
8827,It's a great game. Nothing bad to say about it. It's just great.
8828,"HERE FOR WHAT? DOUBTING THE MOTHER OF ALL RPGS, YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT YOURSELF."
8829,YUH
8830,"Great game 7/10 vanilla, modded 11/10 tons of mods for legendary edition...
Don't get special edition, you'll regret it, trust me...
SE is just a disgusting money grab."
8831,"I keep getting back to it. I have no idea why. It just keeps you engaged for a long time. And then there are the mods... oh boy.
Skyrim will never really get old."
8832,"Modding makes this game an endless experiment, I comme back to it every year for a week or two since I've started playing ages ago."
8833,"Got so mad this piece of trash kept crashing I got Skyrim SE



Todd howard you motherf0ck3r"
8834,"Its a great game to just play around in or with. Modding has kept this game alive so long that the fans are the ones that make the best content. Go to nexus to download mods and new stories, have some fun!"
8835,Love it
8836,sim
8837,nice
8838,"Almost an infinite number of things to do.  I've played this game for years.  I would recommend getting the special edition, which cleared up a number of annoying bugs in the original game.  I rate this as a truly great game."
8839,"This is a classic, everyone one should play this game"
8840,git
8841,"Have you ever wanted to lose all of your friends and loved ones over a bunch of code? If your answer was yes then i have the perfect game for you. I have personally spent 1/3 of my life playing Skyrim and i dont regret it whatsoever. My parents no longer call me, my girlfriend ran off and took the dog, i havent had food in my house in over a week but i couldnt care less because im the Dragonborn!"

8843,Skyrim is an older game sure. But it's still so much fun. I've been playing since 2011 and I'm not tired yet.
8844,Legendary Video Game that will never get old.

I hope the next TES give me the same experience and joy."

8863,"This game is entertaining as hell, and extremely addictive. But it's also broken as all shit. Especially once you start installing mods. I have can't even open my saves half the time."
8864,"I loved how interactive this game is, the graphics, the characters, the creatures and the scenery are all awesome. i get lost happily in this game."
8865,"Boring

8866,Nice.
8867,A classic game that is still VERY fun to this day.
8868,goood game
8869,It's Skyrim! What else is there to say?
8870,"I always love Skyrim ever since it came out. The choices of who you want to be, and the quest are challenging as well."
8871,3 generations of consoles and still being played. Also workshop and other mods revamp it if you ever get bored.
8872,love it
8873,"looks its not a good game but it is a fantasy sandbox you can kill literal days worth of time in so like, its fun"
8874,"As you launch the game for the first time, you're changing your life forever. One of the best games ever made."
8875,Es ist Skyrim was kann man da noch viel sagen.
8876,its skyrim come on get it
8877,epiccc
8878,Good.
8879,"I played this game for 330 hours and today I still found a new, large quest that I've not seen before."
8880,"Was an amazing game. The mods were fantastic. The unfortunate reality however is that the game is outdated and many mechanics have started to lose their effect. The special edition should be bought if you want to play for story. If you are certain of the mods you want to play, and they are not updated to Skyrim Special Edition, Most mods are no longer updated, but it is a good game for memories."
8881,Has the best community but old.
8882,Legendary RPG. Highly recommended
8883,What can I say – I played it on launch day and I still play it on my Switch. One of the greatest RPG/open world adventures.
8884,It is very engrossing... almost addictive.
8885,good
8886,"this game is kept alive by the dedicated modding community. If it wasn't for the mods, this game wouldn't be worth your time."
8887,Yes
8888,"Ive played skyrim on every console and on every PC ive ever owned, just as Todd Howard intended."
8889,Overall great game
8890,Best game with a ton of nostalgia.

8899,its alright
8900,"Great gameplay, okay graphics, buggy from time to time"
8901,"I find myself always coming back to this game and playing through it. It has its issues, but it's undeniably fun. If you want something that you can just ignore life and enjoy a story, this is it. Can't wait for the next installment of the Elder Scrolls."
8902,its goooood
8903,"Very immersive game with seemingly limitless quests, items, and places to explore.  im 168 hours in and only 7 quests into the Main Quest. Not because it takes a long time, but because i find myself doing other things like leveling skills, smithing and enchanting gear, finding unique weapons/armor, crafting potions, cooking Vegetable Soup for the stamina regen, etc. The list goes on and on. I'm certainly glad i gave this game a try. I'll be playing Oblivion next!"
8904,Lots of shouts. Lots of mods.
8905,"Skyrim, although a little dated, is one of the best open world first-person RPG available. (If you want newer, try Witcher 3).  I highly recommend Skyrim (and once you tire of it try the free Enderal total conversion.)"
8906,i
8907,"i must be crazy

8908,FUS ROH DAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
8909,"True legend in my opinion. Despite it has not the best graphic of their year, u can really enjoy while you are discovering all around of Skyrim. Knowing NPCs, side missions etc. You have to play it if you have not tried it yet"
8910,like yknow.
8911,There are two types of people in the world: those who play Skyrim and liars
8912,yeah this game? sex
8913,"NOIC
"
8914,"skyrim tells your story as the dragon born, who uses shouts to do various abilities. set  in a medieval time period expect to use medieval weapons such as swords, long swords, staffs, knives, bows and with dlc even crossbows. open world, can choose different paths such as werewolves, vampires, thieves, assassins, ect. a war divides skyrim as well choose between the empire or the storm cloaks.  as this version is not the special edition mods are on workshop, and may affect trophy/achievements."
8915,yes I like this
8916,gud
8917,"Someone said it's the ""most perfect imperfect game."" I find that 100% true. There's something about it that will keep you coming back again and again... for a new mod, for a new build, to find little hidden gems in the world... we have arguably ""better"" open world sandboxy RPGs, and it's hilariously silly to be the unstoppable god of the endgame, or just be the world-saving, dragon killing hero AND the headmaster of mages college AND most infamous assassin AND the leader of the thieves guild AND a vampire lord AND the deciding factor in civil war.... there are too many ridiculously over done side plots that doing them all in one playthrough is often less satisfying than actually ""ROLE PLAYING"" your character and just choosing a few. Sure you could do them all... sure you COULD make each cabbage worth 10000000 gold in console... and you probably will at some point. That's the thing. This game is everything to everyone, and that's why after all the years and re-releases and the stupid unfixed bugs and moronic physics and hilariously bad plots.. this is still the iconic definition of a genre."
8918,yeah not bahd
8919,Not very good
8920,"noice
"
8921,"Best single player game ever, no other can compete in the slightest and you CAN NOT change my mind."

8938,The opening scene is so buggy with horses spinning in a circle and the wagons bouncing around like rubber balls. All I can find to fix it is to uninstall mods but I never installed any. When the wagons finally stop they are not in the correct position and the NPCs can't move to progress the story. Tired of trying to figure out how to fix this kind of crap and just don't care to put the energy into making it work. What a waste of time trying to get back into this game.

8962,"I'm getting this out of the way, I love this game. This is one of my favorite games to play when I'm bored. One could play this game in a day any they would barely scratch the surface of what this game have in store. The gameplay is very good and simple, with there being no wrong way to approach your play style. Mods also add so much more content to the game, whether it's lore friendly, ridiculous or fix bugs.
Speaking of bugs, that's my main negative to the game. It is a cliche to say that a Bethesda game has bugs, and for good reason. Most bugs and glitches are fairly minor in all honesty, but my brain still gets fairly annoyed when running into a bug that doesn't go away. And don't get me started on the crashes at happen. Fortunately crashes are rare, but I'll be lying if I didn't tell you how many time I uninstalled or reinstalled the game. But I just keep coming back to this game because the positives outweigh the negatives.
Play the game. That's all I have to say. If you get mods, don't do a lot at once, but it is all worth it. 8.5/10"

8996,"ive been addicted to this game since it came out. i've owned it maybe 6 times on different consoles and now my pc. i well have over 1000 hours or more, im such an addict lol"
8997,It is Oldrim
8998,"my game is so broken i basically am playing ""The Younger Trolls"" instead of ""The Elder Scrolls"""
8999,"Skyrim is one of the 7 wonders of the world, bestowed upon us by the Demigod Todd Andrew Howard himself. In the year 1970 the first earth day was observed also this year Todd Howard freed himself from his mothers womb opting for a internally cut C section, he assisted doctors with his own birth because he had a vision. Since that day he worked to create a game so entertaining, so perfect, so beautiful you want to buy it 6 times. I believe God himself sent us mortals, Todd from heaven to give us a glimpse of eternity. Perhaps i sold my kidney and sacrificed my first born in a demonic cult along with prayer in hopes that Skyrim get released an 8th time, maybe even a 9th time.
I will be forever awaiting.

Obviously this is sarcasm the game is a 6.5 out of 10 it didnt age well."
9000,Need something?
9001,reagerg
9002,"GOOD GAME, BUY IT"
9003,it just reviews
9004,great game even from years later  where ES6 at
9005,"After many years and almost two thousand hours of playing, its still one of my all-time favorite games. Highly replayable!"
9006,Really sneaky archer pussy simulator
9007,"""Ah, I See you are Finally awake"" and i need to say this game is such a nice Singleplayer game(there was a multiplayer mod in making but got dumped sadly) 

PRO

-you can be everything between an angry hulk and an sneaky cat 
-you have multiple ways to fight against someone (one/two-handed sword axe/sword.. , bow etc.) 
-the graphics look pretty good when you take in consideration that this game is 9 1/2 years old
-the Story is just so interesting to dive in (good replayability without getting bored)
-Cicero (you'll understand when you have him as companion)

CONTRA

-still After ~9 1/2 years a lot of bugs are in the game (most are fun very rarely game breaking (not happened to me))"

9010,Very good game
9011,I do not know why but after about 30 hours of PC game play my saves corrupt and quick save breaks. Seems to be a server based issue with my account somehow. The game is so good though that I will reinstall and replay these 30 hours until I die.
9012,FUS RO DAH!
9013,ps3
9014,I love changing the dragons into thomas the train.
9015,"What can I say?  Simply the greatest FRPG of all time, until Bethesda likely does it again when the next Elder Scrolls comes out.  Great base game, great DLC, and tons of mods for people who like to tinker and take it further.  I'm guessing there is nobody out there who hasn't played this game yet that might want to, though.  I'm preaching to the choir.
"
9016,It vury good
9017,This game is good overall.
9018,"The main plot is very short if done alone, which makes sense due to the focus on side quests as well. The final boss was way too easy, but other than that this game is perfect!"

9021,"Man, I love this game so much played this back on PS3 an the 360. From the moon and back, I love this game. In fact, if there were 3 things I would bring if I were stuck on a deserted island, this game would be one of them.

Skyrim is a magical game. Too addicting for us human beings to comprehend how much of a gem it really is. And it’s so weird to me that it’s not the best RPG to date of its time even tho the graphics are pretty stale. There is many games with better graphics, story and gameplay. Yet it doesn’t matter to me, because Skyrim still stands to me as the greatest open world game ever.

I’ll try to explain why. It’s as simple as games get. You play as a person about to executed in a world of civil war between two armies known as the Stormcloaks and Imperials, in the world of Tamriel. But suddenly, as you are about to executed, a dragon shows up and saves the day. And it’s up to you to put a stop to these dragons, as you are later revealed to be the legendary Dragonborn, a powerful hero who can kill people by shouting! 

The world of Skyrim always gets to me. The characters are all creative, quirky and interesting. They each have their own personality and have their own quests. They are so memorable because of how different each one of them are. I remember walking around the outskirts of one of the cities, and suddenly, I found a jester who spoke in a creepy way like the Joker. I remember finding a poor kid whom I adopted in my home. I remember finding a drunk who wanted to get a girl, however another elf was blocking his path. These characters are so creative and hooked me into this world immediately. Combined with the massive lore makes this one of the most complicated fictional worlds to date.

The gameplay will also get you. Literally and figuratively. It’s so awesome to get new weapons, level up and gain new perks and come up with new strategies to take down each dungeon. I should also mention that this game is LOOOOOONG. In realtime it will take you a entire year to finish the game on a casual level. I have spent on console over 1000+ hours on it as shown on my console settings for the game and I am still not done with this masterpiece. There is such an insane amount of variety it’s honestly crazy that thiers no other game really like it an that's what makes it a true gem to own.

That’s a big part of what makes this game so good. It’s addicting and replayable. The combat is so simple but can be tackled in so many ways. The enchantments, alchemy and leveling are so satisfying and enjoyable, and even if you never use them, it’s still fun to just have them in your inventory. It makes you feel like a god.

There are so many things to do in this game, it's insane! It’s so crazy to me, that a single-player game can be this big. Sure, other games are just as big as Skyrim, maybe even bigger, but it’s so simple and wonderfully accessible, which is what makes Skyrim stand apart from games like, say, Witcher 3.

Skyrim is a classic of the ages and my favorite game of all time. Everything about this game is perfect. The ominous soundtrack, the story, the combat, the characters, the lore! I love this game with an absolute passion. It’s truly a game I will remember forever. It may look gloomy on the outside, but on the inside, it’s a powerful, heartwarming game that drowns you in its sea of ideas and characters. Sure, it’s quirky, annoying, and sometimes, I just wanted to yell at my screen sometimes because glitches kept on happening or I couldn’t get past an enemy. But honestly, I see this as a good thing. I was so entrenched by the world that I was getting angry at simple things like fictional characters getting injured or dying, and it’s not just me that gets so sucked into this game. The community has added so much to this game, it's mind-blowing. I will, and always will love this game"

9056,"This is a game I haven't beaten yet (in the process). The enjoyment comes from the plethora of mods that the community have for this game.

9063,WHAT
9064,This game is worth playing over and over - the gameplay can be different based on your decisions. The open world format is just amazing - so much customization can go into it!
9065,I have played this game countless hours on console. How ever on pc my entire time has been spent trying to fix a glitch that completely stops me from starting the game. Everytime on the starting carriage ride the game bugs out and I am unable to get to the point where I can make a character. I tried modding it to fix that bug and that still did not work.
9066,"Ten years, two platforms, and I'm still not bored with Skyrim.  8.9/10."
9067,"Base game: Your the dragonborn you kill dragons stop the invasion of more dragons save skyrim from dragons- end
DLC: Hunt and kill vampires or become a vampire yourself
         Adopt a child and build a house
         Kill the only other dragonborn to exist other then you

The game is amazing either way, play it all the way through. THEN MOD THE GAME TILL IT BREAKS AND CANT LOAD THEN REINSTALL IT AND TRY MODDING IT AGAIN TO HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN OVER AND OVER CUZ YOUR STUPID AND FORGOT TO INSTALL ANOTHER MOD REQUIRED TO RUN THE OTHER MODS AND YOU TRY TO ""FIX IT"" BUT YOU JUST BREAK STEAM NOW!"
9068,You haven't truly played games until you skyrim.
9069,***YES***
9070,"Needless to say, this is a good game for experiences like adventuring.
However, as the name suggests, this is themed after Skyrim; in other words, almost all snowy regions. So unlike ‘The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’, the landscapes are mostly bleak (I mean, I do recommend TES4 too).
Also, as an action game, it is easy to get bored if you want a tough experience in battle.
In any case, mods are helpful for all problems. I played over 1000 hours, and I still have fun playing it. You should buy Skyrim. Everything is going to be fine. *You can see a bottle of skooma aside me*"
9071,boobies
9072,Never gets old
9073,I sure love flying off Tamriel to the next continent when I engage in combat with a giant.
9074,Started a new game with mods and saw a noble flying around on his horse. It immediately proceeded to crash my game. 10/10 would play again
9075,haha funny loud noise make people fall over.
9076,Give us Elder Scrolls 6.

9083,"My personal favorite game. I don't know if I even have to say anything, I think my time played speaks for itself."
9084,good
9085,"Skyrim is a great example of how it is false advertising to manipulate people into believing it to be a great game or even an RPG which is not even close. The main story ""borrows"" or should I say steals elements that are unoriginal. The role-play in game is lacking to the point of being ""The Room: The Video Game"" with no proper choices. People need to put aside their ""nostalgia"" and realise the harsh reality that this game was made by a amateur team. They had four years to create a great story driven game but instead  it is just a pile of ""Game of the Year"" lies. Due to the popularity of Skyrim, this affected Fallout 4's development and story to the point of being laughable and stripped of the major role-play elements that made Oblivion and Fallout New Vegas amazing as well as iconic was disregarded and abandoned."

9103,Without a doubt one of the best games ever!!!
9104,"the game is good, everything works well, with the typical bugs that bethesda games always has, so good nonetheless"
9105,"Skyrim is one of the best games I've ever played, and the only Elder Scrolls game I've ever finished. I wish I could selectively erase my memory and start a new game."
9106,"I've played 1000+ hours of this game. Needless to say it's really really good for single player and story love it. You can also add on mods that make it even better and add more to the game vastly. Would 100% recommend to who wants to play a good game that takes a while to finish, and then you'll probably replay it over and over just like it did. Especially for a older game it's very very good."
9107,"great graphics, great story line"
9108,"If you haven't played it at this point, do it."
9109,10/10 amazing game well over 1000 hours between the pc version love all the mods and the game as a whole
9110,hello i have been captured in a military ambush at the border and am now going to be executed alongside a insurgent leader
9111,"such a good game. I am totally amazed have this game is so good even after such a long time
"
9112,STAB EM IN THE BUTT!!!! but for real its good. specially with . . . mods . . . u know the ones.
9113,Even in 2021 I’m playing this modded and it never gets old. Great game.
9114,"Game gave me lots of memories (special thanks to Legendary difficulty as well) and was fun. Art department did a great job but the devs no so good - plenty of bugs, crashes, etc. I I went for a 100% and I got 421 hours worth of gameplay, this includes side quests, speaking to every NPC I could find, reading all the books (was using a list to make sure). There were some really good books too but there were also plenty of typos, which doesn't look good on AAA games. The skill system is pretty good but the legendary reset in order to keep leveling your character isn't so I found a mod that gives you a perk every time you complete a bounty to fix it. Legendary did add a layer of fun to it as well by making me more cautious of everything and whenever a single arrow would pin me straight to the wall. The beginning was kind of rough and felt forced to do certain things cause I'd get 1-shot during most quests, you could always lower the difficulty if the need be, but after I got the hang of enchants/upgrades, got some skills and knowledge of the game it got bearable and eventually once I got the best of the best almost nothing could stop me."
9115,It's skyrim
9116,"Skyrim is by far my favorite game, as someone who only played things like animal crossing and neko atsume i really thought this type of game ""wasn't for me"" and yet, like the real world, there are so many options of what i can do that this game is perfect for me in any mood. The experience is extremely able to be customized, and i have fun each play through. Definitely spoiled me in the quality and content i expect from other games!"
9117,One of the best games yet.
9118,"BEST F....ing GAME EVER 
started first on ps3 like 4 5 years ago wanted it back so long now i  have dlcs as well"

9128,I have put 4k hours into this game it sucks

9130,"Skyrim is great and has absolutely no glitches in any way shape or form. if anyone says there are bugs, they are probably talking about they butterflies or torchbugs or maybe even a chaurus."
9131,"I think when I play this secret version of Skyrim, I should get +20 to sneak for all characters upon creation."
9132,Skyrim will always have a special place in my heart. Non-modded it's still a fantastic game to play and get lost in for hundreds of hours. With mods it becomes a whole new world to explore.
9133,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim My Special L*verslab Mods Don't Work on SSE Edition
9134,It's Skyrim.

9137,"One of the best RPG's in my opinion. Lots of options, good crafting, exciting quest lines, good lore, combat seems slow at first but become somewhat fluid once you get the hang of it."

9139,swords my guy
9140,BEST GAME EVER
9141,like
9142,"It's the first Elder Scrolls game I actually played and after 200 hours I didn't want to leave. What a world this is, what engaging stories these are. I really felt like I was living in a heroic fantasy novel. And the things this game does I can't explain.  
I'm still thinking about the two Alikir warriors standing at the gates of Whiterun no longer looking for a runaway Redguard woman because I chose to kill their leader instead of let them take her back to Hammerfell to answer for betraying her homeland. I'm thinking of the Arkay priest who stands at the entrance of Understone Keep and stops me everytime I pass him to initiate a repeated conversation. A cannibal woman wanted me to lead him to his slaughter but I chose to stealth kill her instead.
Whether its the intention of the developer or one of the games bugs these characters remain in place reminding me of the choices I could've taken. The choices I still could take with another playthrough. But I'm still only at level 20 with my current build and have more of Skyrim to explore.

Btw. I recommend this version not the Special Edition with its lacklustre mods and microtransactions. Links below:

9144,"If you think thats bad, I probably had the same amount on console before I bought this."
9145,"If you find this page this Skyrim is basically the same as special edition, so if you want you can get this with graphics mods instead of spending extra."
9146,Awesome replayability
9147,this game is fun
9148,guys please trove has better gameplay than this
9149,"It's alright, I guess."
9150,"buy the game, get invested in the game, Todd improves the textures slightly, -$60 from wallet, Repeat for consoles owned. (-$60x=y)
buy the remaster (-$60), get bored after the 2 hour refund, weep, pray for skyrim 2, Todd announces switch edition.
buy the game on switch (-$60), looks like oldrim, realize no steam workshop on switch. Nintendo:""We are unable to provide refunds or exchanges for mistaken purchases, and/or if you don't like the game."", Weep some more.
Load up oldrim and enjoy all the workshop mods you forgot you had, take a hit, and play.



just buy the newest skyrim."
9151,Fun! Mod it for best resultzzz!
9152,"https://youtu.be/dKdhxf_ZnvU

Pacing and spacing will be the key deciding factor in this game for a players ability to engage with it. This game requires curious players to poke and prod to find the content they want."

9154,Great game id suggest everyone to play very fun mid evil game
9155,"addons, and then some more addons :)"
9156,"Its hard to but into words why this game has been such a constant companion over the years but I'll try anyways. The game itself has a very very deep and rich story which feels very much alive and real. I mean there are podcasts dedicated to exploring the TES lore alone. The open-world character, just as with previous titles of the series, goes so far that sometimes you completely loose track of what to do but venture out and explore new adventures. It is very easy to create your own adventures as well. Granted, there are some negative aspects to the game as well. For instance, after a quite extensible time you realize some sections are repeating such as bard songs, cave patterns. Quite frankly though, these patterns never really stood out far enough for me to appear as a huge negative point. TES has one of the biggest and most passionate modding communities which help out in many of the above mentioned cons. In summary, if you like to immerse yourself in rich worlds that don't take you by the hand and guide you through a linear storyline but get to explore by yourself, then that game is perfect for you :). Just a tip, its easy to overuse the fast travel, I'd recommend disabling that function through a mod. It will greatly enhance the experience :)"
9157,"After playing the vanilla version game for about 300 hours on Xbox, 50 hours on switch and about 40 hours on PC I have come to the consensus that this game is like a fine yogurt. Its Cultured, tasty, and it gets better with age."
9158,"Top 10 games of all time, very free feeling with a captivating story line and hours on hours of side play to keep the fun going. Just when you think its over and you've done everything, hundreds of hours in mods to keep your attention, huge cumulation of brilliant and fan driven minds to keep you satisfied.  9/10 (-1 for ending the project as what i feel too early, deserved more DLC's)."
9159,"if you like collecting shit, play this"
9160,Skyrim is another great Elder Scrolls chapter in the Saga. Long games.
9161,Great game
9162,.
9163,Not bad

9180,I absolutely love this game! I have been playing Elder Scrolls since Arena and have not found a better CRPG in all that time. I just hope I live long enough for Elder Scrolls VI.

9186,"I can do whatever the hell I want in an open world full of ice. 🧊 

I can glitch under the map and steal from the merchants and sell it back to em! Profit! 🤑

I can beat up a mammoth with a dagger and get flung fifty seven miles into the Sea of Ghosts, when I die 🤽‍♀️

I can happily say this game has helped me discover my purpose for life other than being a trans girl. (❁´◡`❁)"
9187,yes
9188,yes
9189,shit came out 11 years ago and im still finding new shit
9190,its fecking skyrim
9191,"Skyrim is apart of what I would call the ""Steam Classics Collection,"" boasting a significance in gaming that's lasted over a decade now, something few games can say. The entire reason that Skyrim is still relevant to this day is one, simple aspect that has nothing to do with the actual developers of the game; modding. Skyrim is probably THE MOST modded game of all time, and the experience you can get out of the game through said mods makes the game vastly superior to its' vanilla counterpart, and easily makes it worth the 20 bucks it takes to download the game. Me personally? My favorite aspect of modded Skyrim is the roleplaying; you can truly experience the world as the character you have created. The infinite amount of replayability and approachability to modded Skyrim is what makes every experience with the game a new and refreshing one. I highly recommend Skyrim solely due to how much you can tweak the game to your tastes.
Also, while I'm here, my favorite mod is ""Divine Punishment for Mention of Arrows in the Knee."" Instantly brings lightning down on any dumbass who dares mention arrows and knees in the same sentence.
9.2/10"
9192,"Great game, almost infinite replayability"
9193,"This review has been looking for you, your eyes only.... Lets See.... Ah, a review from the internet! Moving nowhere in the world are you? 

""9/10 vanilla, 100/10 with mods, depending on pickiness; we all know what Skyrim is by this point."" 

Whelp that's it! Got to go!"
9194,10/10 a MUST play game fit for any gamers collection
9195,The best game a 4 year old has ever made.
9196,I honed millions of hours modding this game and can say confidently that is good game.
9197,Still one of my favorite games of all time.
9198,isa good game

9211,Pretty good. Install 100 or so mods and it becomes pretty great.
9212,Great game
9213,"Each Elder Scrolls game is good for different reasons.  Skyrim is all of those reasons combined into one release.  It's going to be hard for Bethesda to outdo this one.  With 1000 hours of total game play, I still have yet to explore every path possible."
9214,Addicting youve been warned
9215,funny game :)
9216,very good
9217,"One of the best games i have ever played, much thanks to the great mods for the game. 
Respect for the Modders!!"
9218,reallly cool game
9219,.
9220,Good-ro'dah
9221,"A fantasy/adventure game that never gets old, with an almost endless amount of missions and side quests to complete leaves you with something to always do. The base game and DLCs are great but the game takes on another life with mods like Wyrmstooth that introduce in-depth side quests and new areas to explore."
9222,good game
9223,You're Finally Awake
9224," I'm autistic, and many games can be challenging for me. Specifically games where you have to protect yourself, and enemies are often nearby. Skyrim has completely changed gaming for me, because it's given me confidence in myself. I only play on Novice, but I'm able to complete things, survive, and feel pride through that. I'm so grateful for this game."
9225,Game is a buggy mess.
9226,"Hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border? Walked right into that imperial ambush, like us and that thief over there."
9227,"I love this game. I've been playing online games, for over 20 yrs and I think this is one of the best. Impressive story line, with characters and npc's having their own stories and personalities. The graphics are just the most beautifully done and you can play the game as hard or as easy as you want. You can play this game, over and over, and it is never the same. It is a very well done game. I highly recommend it."
9228,It's fun

9231,"i have a pretty healthy sized willy, on top of that i have a very loving and obedient girlfriend who i kiss and cuddle and sex all day and night, and i play skyrim, if you would like to be like me, play skyrim too, its very good for your sexual auras"
9232,it's skyrim my dude
9233,It's skyrim. Just slap se mods on it and it'll be your favorite game
9234,nice
9235,Timeless classic.
9236,The game is good. The one thing I don't like is the grinding/farming for skills
9237,It just works.
9238,"With all the glitches in the first section, it is unplayable for me, didn't get the game for that much money but never mind."
9239,absolute yes
9240,Skyrim is amazing. I've never played a game where you can dance with singing crabs and shoot pink dildos into a raider's ass.
9241,"nice game
"
9242,Only played this for the Thomas the Tank-engine dragons.
9243,Quite possibly my favorite game of all time (though it requires many hours on the Nexus and upgrading to SE to really get everything out of it).
9244,i finished this masterpiece twice and yet i still wanna play again. This comment should make u understand how good this game is.
9245,"everything considered, i think this game aged well."
9246,good
9247,pretty pog
9248,"I guess I used mods a few years ago well when I tried to install and play on my new pc no matter what I do the cart is flipping at 10,000 mph and the first scene won't even play through. I've tried everything even deleting every mod and redownloading the game but when I do it comes back with the mods. The game is broken and I see why it's been hidden in the store."
9249,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo_at_the_2010_South_American_Games
9250,"I like to explore the world, make food and discover recipes, make potions and use the forge. 

The battle is lack of impact and mutilation. The mods turn it real and maximize the factor replay. 

I'm playing on linux, and i was wondering.... Why they don't make it native for linux ????? 
Dude, the linux gaming community is hungry for great titles like that. They will buy it for sure."
9251,"IF YOU DONT CAP THE FPS AT 60 IT WILL BE LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE, otherwise it's pretty good

one thing that's kind of disappointing is dragon fights and vampire fights. they're not even that hard but NPCs will run in to them and die so you'll either have to go through the rest of your playthrough without that NPC or reload an older save, do the fight again but without letting the NPC die. also those fights will happen pretty much whenever, even during quests so sometimes you will be fighting a quest boss and then out of nowhere a dragon comes in and you have to fight it and the boss. ALSO sometimes dragons will just fly away which is super annoying if you spent good arrows trying to kill it. 

apart from that, good game"
9252,Sure why not
9253,Infinite possibilities for play.  Innumerable quests and the game can be played as one of several professions.  You will love Skyrim.
9254,"I used to be an adventure just like you, then i took an arrow to the knee!"
9255,"Easily one of the best games I ever played... Even in 2021.
You just can't get bored of it."
9256,best game ive ever played. ive been a big fan of the elder scrolls for a long time now
9257,"better version, can play enderal"

9262,Only played the game for a few hours. Not a bad game.
9263,"Just great all around, hope they add scrapping with the next installment.
"
9264,"Immersive fantasy experience that offers hundreds of hours of gameplay. One of the best games of all-time, no exaggeration. Smooth graphics, good vocal acting, deep lore, interesting crafting system, and a fun leveling system. What's not to like?"
9265,one of my most faveriot games but minecraft is better
9266,:)
9267,"Mate, this game is just a masterpiece in every way."
9268,top 2 storyline-based game I've ever played.
9269,"I've enjoyed this game for years. When it comes down to it, the best part is that its re-playable. There's always a way you haven't tried playing yet or something cool you can do. Mods make those options even more vast and interesting. I seriously love this game and I hope Elder Scrolls 6 is good too."

9286,"A mess, I love it"
9287,YOU CAN SLAY DRAGONS!!!

9305,"""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is the best Skyrim you could possibly own.  It has mammoths.  It has cheese, made from the milk of said mammoths.  It has dragons you can't fight as Stealth Archer from ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" and ""The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion"".

Homage aside, I like the mods.  Like, I [i]really[/i] like the mods.  Overhaul mods are a great way to shake up the game's lame-ass progression system.  ""Yippee! Another 20% more effective at a thing!"".  And there's a couple of them to choose from, too: ""SkyRe"" and ""PerMa"" are two overhauls from the same person (those are abbreviations; I forgot their full names).  ""Path of Magic"" is a magic skills only overhaul that I really like, but it doesn't have perks for spells added by ""Apocalypse Spells"".  ""Ordinator"" might be another one: I'll have to check.

There's mods that add in new characters and companions, mods that expand towns and villages, mods that restore cut content and squash bugs.  There's mods that add in unlicensed characters from movies, TV shows, and other games.  There's mods that spawn bandits when guards remark about how few raids there've been, there's mods that make everyone talk like they're Khajiit.

It's for the mods, really."
9306,one of the most fascinating and captivating games
9307,I've sank so many hours of this game on the Xbox 360 when i was younger and bought this version to mod the crap out of it and for nostalgia and I've had a lot of fun so far I highly recommend it
9308,Better than Fallout 4
9309,"It's Skyrim. And it's 2021.
If you still don't know this game, there's a chance its graphics are too old, by now, to even appeal to you.
Anyway:
. RPG
. FPS
. Open world
. Viking-like environments and props
. Dragons
. Fus-Ro-Dah

That's pretty much all there is to it.
Hundreds of hours of gameplay are more or less guaranteed depending on your tastes in terms of RPGs.

Wait until you've reached 200 hours, before even getting close to Whiterun. Or Riverwood!!
Stay away from the main storyline, you don't need it, and certainly you don't wanna get to know dragons for a while, in the beginning.
Just my 2 cents."
9310,"I enjoy the quests, the overall landscape, and the characters. 
"
9311,"Been playing this for 10 years and still haven't finished all the quests. But I have a nice house and a family that loves me.

10/10
Better than my real life."

P.S. NVM, Just bought the SE, thx Todd for making me bought skyrim for the fifth times

This is a game where you can easily lose track of time, there is so much to do in this game its insane. I can ramble on all day about how good this game is and why every gamer should give it a go at least once! For me this game is a 10/10 also if you kill Paarthurnax you're a traitor to skyrim!"

9342,"English:
My favorite game! put Thousands of hours into this game and I'm still enjoying it, first I played it for hundreds, maybe a thousand hours or more back on Xbox 360, my 360 had a problem that it wouldn't connect online so to play the dlcs I have bought the legendary edition (bought the game twice for 360) I'm not sure if I got the platinum on the 360 but I certainly did a lot on it. Then I played on PC non steam for hundreds of hours more, then started playing with mods for hundreds more hours. I got the platinum on the Xbox One and now I got the platinum on the PC version for the first time, always fun, always interesting, And you can always extend the experience with some mods. Skyrim is a most for anyone who considers himself a true gamer.
Português:
Meu jogo favorito! investi milhares de horas nesse jogo e ainda estou curtindo, primeiro joguei centenas, se não milhares de horas no Xbox 360 na época, meu 360 tinha um problema que fazia com que não conectasse online então então para jogar as dlcs eu tive que comprar a edição lendária (comprei o jogo duas vezes no 360) não tenho certeza se eu platinei o jogo no 360 mas eu certamente fiz muita coisa nele. Daí eu joguei no PC sem steam mais algumas centenas de horas, então comecei a jogar com mods mais algumas centenas de horas. Eu peguei a platina no Xbox One e agora peguei a platina na versão de PC pela primeira vez, sempre divertido, sempre interessante, e você pode sempre estender a experiência com alguns mods. Skyrim é obrigatório para qualquer um que se considere um verdadeiro gamer."
9343,"When this game first came out, I was bummed that it was Steam only. Sorry, I'm old school and began working with computers back in the 80's with my Atari 8k, so I tend to be a little slow when it comes to new things. I've come to appreciate Steam over the years and have no regrets installing it. As for Skyrim, the game is great. The graphics are top notch. My only problem was building my Welsh castles. Skyrim looks big, but it really isn't. I had a very difficult time finding a place to create my stone wonders and finally decided it wasn't worth the effort. It's still a great game, don't get me wrong. I don't rack up 1000+ hours on games I don't like! I just have to leave my castles in Oblivion."
9344,"Spent somewhere around 600+ hours and the game is still as fun as when I made my first character.

Mods make it even more fun.

I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone."
9345,Nice
9346,This is a great game.

9358,its not bad to play every 10 years or so
9359,so much to do and so little time to do it
9360,one of the best games ever 11/10
9361,"I am writing this comment 43 hours in. I will probably have many more hundreds of hours in this game, but I'd rather have my opinion as unbiased as possible. 
I played Skyrim for the first time this year and I avoided it before because I heard everyone praising it, so back in the days I decided I would not even try it. This changed however and I must say that I do regret not playing it earlier. 
I am not going to get into the story because I finished Dragonborn and pretty much started Companions and a few other side quests, so I am not yet finished with all the content. 
+ The story so far is not fantastic in its writing, but the soundtrack, atmosphere and details are as amazing as they can be in a videogame. The graphics are not outdated at all, and with a few mods they can become a world where I'd leave my real life to live in. It's hard to explain into words how the atmosphere changes so many gameplay aspects. Just... picture the wind rattling through the trees, the snow in your hair and a wolf howling in the distance. Looking up and seeing a dragon fly above your head and your veins are filling with adrenaline.
I played Oblivion, Fallout and a few other open world games but none could give me those goosebumps. The options of what you can do in this game and your personal choices and imagination are endless. 
- The game still crashes sometimes and without mods that fix bugs it wouldn't be as nice, so you have to invest time in learning how to mod properly, which can be frustrating and it can spoil all the fun for beginners. Sometimes the dialogue system can also be chunky, but I wouldn't emphasize on it too much. Also I was put in front of many situations at first where my villagers would get all killed by vampires and I could do nothing about it because I was not there when it happened. I eventually solved it with some console commands but it can be frustrating when a whole village is dead. 

Overall I love Skyrim and even though it requires a certain mood to play, it's one of the best games ever made. 
"
9362,ye
9363,"when i play this game I feel like when people say ""everyone is a lizard"" i believe them"
9364,Its fun
9365,;i;yhly
9366,Every much enjoy
9367,
9368,"Great game! I've been a fan of the series since Morrowind on the Xbox. Including dlc, mods and the sandbox app you could stay busy with this game forever. A new installment is certainly due as the graphics are slightly dated now but it's still a lush beautiful landscape filled with monsters and NPCs who almost aren't all completely stupid. Truly if Bethesda decided to update the graphics and the NPCs AI this game would dominate the market all over again. 
I say go for the new one when it comes out but for now Skyrim still holds up pretty well."
9369,amazing open world game. You can really define the game for yourself.
9370,yes
9371,"Much like many bethesda titles, the game is not nearly as challenging as any of it's predecessors, with worse mechanics and removed features. The main quest is horrible and a lot of the side quests are not enjoyable and most of them are just the same quest repeated a 100 times. The world and atmosphere of the game is very depressing and grey, and it very much doesn't feel like a real fantasy setting. Overall it's not too bad, and it's definitely not the worst bethesda game but the other games in the series are much better."
9372,"amazingif kept playing you can always find something you havent done yet 
"
9373,Good game
9374,It just a good old fun adventure game where you get to kill dragons. plus the mods seen on this game is sooooo big like my god some of the s**t people have modded for this is is insane.
9375,Maybe one day i will write a review that this game deserves... Untill that time i can only give a thumb up
9376,YES BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD OF THE SPECIAL EDITION
9377,One of the best games ever played
9378,The open world play and the many quests.

9381,Don't buy any games on steam. Their program is trash and can't even launch games properly. Then blame it on anti virus software and that they didn't make the game. Then why in the hell do you sale it through your software??????
9382,Good
9383,Just completely amazing.
9384,Classic
9385,This game sucks
9386,Awesome Game!!!

9394,I don't care what you think you have going on in your life. If you purchase this game it will consume you. It's very fun.
9395,Love the story line and imagery.

9397,GOAT of gaming
9398,"Right now, one dislike.  Been a long time since I played.  HOW DO I MAKE CHOICES? 
Can't find in Player's Guide."
9399,"It's Skyrim, what more is there to say?"
9400,It's pretty fun.
9401,"I have a crippling Skooma addiction I have lost my wife, kids, and my house. I'm going inna woods, I will see you all when I return."
9402,Play this game
9403,"Flawed as it may be, still good"
9404,What to say?
9405,"An absolute legend and worth returning to time after time. A shout-out to my fellow archers! 

The only downside is that it triggers my motion-sickness so bad that I have to use a mod and adjust the FOV to allow me to play for more than ten minutes."
9406,Excellent
9407,"MUDDAFUCKASHIIIITT
"
9408,it was poggy
9409,Who wouldn't recommend Skyrim? Great game and awesome graphics.
9410,First time playing Skyrim. I had to reload my save 3 times in the first 8 minutes due to the bugs with the carriage. Would recommend if you can deal with some bugs.
9411,skyrim is the best game ever made
9412,"A fun game with quests but a very open world, easy to use and detailed magic mechanics and fighting."
9413,"playing since 2012, always wondering around doing side quests, changed computer like 5 times and windows a 1000 times, never really finished it yet haha."
9414,"Ah yes. The only game I have on many platforms. 

I dont know why, but I have this need to own this game across different platforma Sigh*

Yes. Its a must play!"
9415,"yes
great game
you know what an absolute masterpiece"
9416,Skyrim is very fun still in 2021! 100% recommend
9417,you already know
9418,Its fun  game to come back to after a few years
9419,just play Morrowind instead
9420,Amazing game of 2011!
9421,"perfect. this game is legend. has memes, mods. speech 100 is biggest meme.
but its sad cuz no one knows where speech 100 is from. people that never played it is propably have no life."
9422,"these game is bad it full of bugs and it old dont buy 
the review for the game track it me"
9423,i mean yeah its alright
9424,its good
9425,"El Guapo says Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is very entertaining with many character options, character development , and objectives. Worth every penny."
9426,Very good game lets me make fire like caveman. No titties though. This is supposed to be fantasy. Wheres the boobs. Bad game 3/10
9427,amazing
9428,nice
9429,I LOVE MOST OF THE GAME
9430,Its trash. It only took me several hundred hours and one broken monitor to realize just how poorly designed this game is. It runs like garbage on anything but dedicated gaming PCs despite the fact that most of the environments are empty. The game play ranges from boring to frustrating. Stealth archer was touted as the easiest way to play. Bethesda apparently didn't like that so now enemies just rollerskate out of the way of your shots. Magic is pointless. Melee combat is boring. The story is stupid and if Todd releases one more goddamn version of this stupid game I will shit a house.
9431,Great game to slow sip.
9432,GOO
9433,"Without mods : fun game, the graphics are very much dated by now but very big and sprawling world full of side quests and weird characters in true bethesda fashion. Definitely recommended for any 3D rpg fan.

With mods : perfection.

Conclusion : yes you should play it. It's by now a cult gaming experience so you'll get something out of it no matter what, even if that something is just laughing at stupid glitches. I'd recommend to start vanilla or with very few mods if you want to get a taste for the og vanilla gameplay but, as all bethesda games, the enhancement of replacing dragons with Thomas the tank engine is too good to pass up."
9434,so many bugs do i really need mods just to play the game ffs constant save errors autosave just stops working then alll saving stops working imagine grinding for a few hours only to have to replay it
9435,yes
9436,20/10   worth spending 300+ hours in it never run out of shit  to do even better with mods!
9437,Why can't you have woohoo with Serena?
9438,👌
9439,Awesome game!
9440,"One of, if not the, best RPGs ever made."
9441,i wonder what my character should look like.
9442,v nice
9443,"Of all the open-world RPG types, I feel like Skyrim is the only one that never fails to drag me back in. It's the only one that feels like you could just play it forever... but in a good way? Oof, I love this game."
9444,"Kick the chicken!
You know you want too."
9445,"Skyrim is a game to get lost in, it is an immersive and massive game. It was a staple of my childhood and I always find myself coming back to it!"
9446,Mod it and it's good
9447,"This is one of my absolute favorite games, because ya know, dragons"
9448,If you like shouting this is your game.
9449,its skyrim

9457,"Skyrim has a high replay value. There is so much to do, I don't know if I'll ever be able to discover it all. I can't wait for the next installment of Elder Scrolls."
9458,"very pog
"
9459,"I still haven't finished this game. I keep restarting, modding, and playing but I never finish a single play-through. Help."
9460,I think about the game and play it again every year or so.
9461,it lets me have mods that this one can have than the special edition skyrim. i love this game  and the other thats the same but the mods makes it much more fun.
9462,Someone stole my sweetroll. 10/10
9463,a yes 7h played in a day
9464,"Best game ever, though i do prefer se. It isn't working right now. still troubleshooting a problem were opening inventory causes a crash. if anyone has a solution, please tell me. i love this game and really want to play again."
9465,"Amazing
"
9466,gud
9467,Endless hours of game play. Ability to add more content through mods in the workshop enhances the gameplay fun. My all time favorite game.
9468,CTD simulator
9469,dude it is skyrim....
9470,Great if you like spells or swords or bows or horses or nature or exploration or just about anything. One of the best first person RPG I've ever played.
9471,I LOVE this game
9472,"good
"
9473,"The best middle earth themed, fantasy game I have ever played. Main quest and the story is so beautiful but at the same time side quest scale is so wide and gripping. Along my offline hours I have played approx. 350 hours and every minute is worth it. Do not think twice just go for it."
9474,havent really played so i cant really review tbh
9475,hammer go hit
9476,good
9477,"Look, It's Skyrim. You probably own 90 copies of it for everything from your Nintendo Switch, to Alexa. There is a Daggerfall mod now, you should buy it."
9478,"I am pewdiepien= and i support this gam,e. it is vewy immersive and makes me wanna kill myself, also kinda waNT TO FUCK THE DRAGOMNS"
9479,i have bought this like 13 times by now don't ask
9480,"Todd Howard has done it again. Prepare for a lot of spelunking and zombies in game and tons of modding out of game in order to turn Skyrim into less of a buggy mess.

On the plus side, there are a lot of mods to choose from."
9481,Mod it.
9482,best game ever
9483,Went to the midnight release back in 2011. Still play to this day.
9484,Goated
9485,gut gut
9486,Very good game
9487,Two of my favorite things in the world: Gambling and modding Bethesda games
9488,gud
9489,Its da best game!
9490,great
9491,Best Game !
9492,i keep accidentally playing this instead of the special edition and I think that says something about how good this game is
9493,"this will be a hot take but I genuenly dont like skyrim I just dont like it 
the base game is just weak walking simulator and its boring if you play without mods
I will still recommend the game but its 65% if im realy generous"
9494,skkyyyyrriiimmmmmm
9495,i always loved skyrim
9496,its skyrim
9497,ni....
9498,"original skyrim purchased on steam in 2011... no longer works. Menus are broken, resolution is broken. no support. no updates to install. have to buy the new se version. pretty crappy"
9499,"It's a good game, but steam keeps uninstalling itself and all of my games keep disappearing. Can someone pls msg me and help me?"
9500,Look at my playtime.
9501,"Greatest role playing game created, so far. Wonderful characters and character development. Fantastic for fans of Swords and Sorcery fiction."
9502,"fun its better than remastered in someways, but remastered is better if you have a good pc but this one is still worth playing even if u have a good pc because of the mods and lower cost"
9503,"Haha years later review. NES version was a lot better, but i still like this one."
9504,"TOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
9505,"You know the rules and so do I
FUS RO DAH 
sorry it doesn't rhyme"
9506,"Best open world game ever!! Better than Far Cry, and so much more to do such as Quests in every village or town entered, secretive guilds to join anytime during the game. Best of all this game offers a unique crafting system easy for all ages to figure out how to enhance weapons, armor, shields, everything even potions can be crafted using a special Alchemy Lab and hundreds of new recipes to discover making that either deal or heal damages based on the potency created. WOW!! This game literally didn't miss a trick in any way."
9507,Great game with Mods
9508,Just plain awesome. I have played the spots off this and it has held up well for a decade.
9509,"Started my crippling dragon yiff addiction, 10/10"
9510,some of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen.
9511,I figured out how to mod me being a cute boy lol
9512,The game of my childhood. Still playing almost 10 years later.
9513,"Dovahkiin! Dovahkiin!
There's no more sardines!"
9514,"This is easily one of the best fantasy free roam games out there. It's got a few bugs here and there but the amount of detail, content, and obvious effort put into the game really makes it worth playing. You could play this game for 2 weeks straight and there would still be quests to do. So what are you waiting for and buy it already!"
9515,"Dragons
"
9516,Great game all around and will hold up for a long time
9517,K
9518,i feel like i'm actually outside for once
9519,pretty good
9520,"well what can be said about this game that has yet to be said in all these years....how about that this is a good game.well made,weak story..but the engine is old and the next elder scrolls game needs a better engine...but other than that its still a beautiful game to watch and play through..i recommend this game to everyone"
9521,Beat for good old fun
9522,great
9523,"Skyrim is love, Skyrim is life"
9524,its not for me but i love the lore
9525,"I hit 300 hours in this game. It is both fun with mods and without. I enjoy glithching my way to the top and being unkillable. I enjoy making the game difficult or unplayable with mods. Oblivion is my childhood, but I had the most fun playing Skyrim."

9530,great game
9531,"Bought it on switch, ps3, ps4 and PC and still got like 300 hours minimum on each
what more do i need to say"
9532,"Three 'must to do things' in life:

1. Install this game and launch it once
2. Install Enderal: Forgotten Stories
3. Enjoy!

Edit. Forget part 1, Enderal is standalone these days"
9533,ok
9534,I remember the first time I ever played Skyrim in 2012 at the age of 10. Coming out of Riverwood and seeing the lights of Whiterun pierce through the night is still to this day one of my most memorable gaming moments. I recall a feeling of absolute freedom that I'd never before felt in a video game. The definitive fantasy RPG experience imo.
9535,Only Skyrim can make you feel like you can play it forever...
9536,bethesdas last days of decency :D
9537,climbed a side of a rocky mountain on horse back ......... 10/10 would do it again

9545,.
9546,Delicia do macaco
9547,Pretty good. A little dated though.
9548,Just a fun game to do whatever in. You control the story and what kind of person you want to be.
9549,"Skyrim for the broke people who can't afford Special Edition
Which includes me so I have no complaints"
9550,"Skyrim, and all Elder Scrolls games, are amazing open world fantasy RPGs, with in-depth captivating storylines, great character customization, epic combat, hours of quests, crafting, exploration, and so much more. Highly recommended! :)"
9551,"I dont think I really need to say anything, if youre here you already know whether to play it or not."
9552,I've played this game on multiple platforms for many years and I absolutely love and would recommend this game to anyone!
9553,I mean it's Skyrim...
9554,A new hand touches the beacon.
9555,fun
9556,"am not liking uninteractable brits hauling away another skyrimmer on ""official buisiness"" vaht e do ?steal a toothbrush? And i am lost half the time."
9557,How modding can carries a game from Great to Legendary status.
9558,"the worst game ever made, I can't even start the game, I can't switch from intro to new game, cart and horses get stuck, fly wtf?  DON'T BUY THIS SHIT"
9559,This is  a great action-rpg that has stood the test of time. It is like warband or arma that the base content is extended endlessly through the great library of mods available to it.
9560,"Over 8 years later and this is still one of the best games I have played. The modding community around this game are extensively creative and passionate about the game, which makes it such a pleasure to keep playing."
9561,best game out there! valid! sheeesh!
9562,it was awesme and famous for many years and hours to come.

9588,"Couldn't become VL in special edition, and since the bug originated from this game, I fully expect the same bs. 

DO NOT BUY OR BOTHER WITH DAWNGUARD, it is broken. Piss on Skyrim..."
9589,"Forever classic. I have the SE edition as  well. Even though after  10 years the graphics are a  bit outdated, the feeling of playing Skyrim is the same. If you haven't tried it, you should! Also there are a ton of mods which enhance the playing experience!"
9590,Immersive and great fun.  Plenty to do and develop
9591,oh yea
9592,good
9593,fun
9594,"Best addition in the ES series imo Plenty to do, very immersive fixed a lot of the glitches in recent years too. Overall masterpiece of a title."
9595,"Absolutely goated game. I've played Morrowind and Oblivion, but haven't enjoyed either of them as much as this. If the base game gets boring after 600 hours, mods are always an option. Just be prepared to spend 600 more hours troubleshooting all of them"
9596,"Well, it is Skyrim =)))))"
9597,e
9598,A LOT of content with good story-telling and a few really great characters.  Really can't go wrong with this title. Probably an eight out of ten.  A great value when you look at the hours of gameplay for the money.
9599,Nothing more to add to the others. Now playing the free mod Enderal and this is another excellent reason to go for it.
9600,pOG
9601,"My favorite game of all time, I first played it on 360, I put hundreds of hours in. Then I got SE for PS4 and put hundreds more hours into it. I eventually got it for PC so I could play Enderal and because there was supposed to be a full ASOIAF/GOT Overhaul Mod, but that never came out. This game is a true Masterpiece! IDC how dated it might be now it still has elements no other games have been able to match. If you haven't played Skyrim you need to buy it right now and play it. If you want to play a game that truly makes you feel free, play this game now!"

I love this game equally much now at almost 23 years old as I did when I was 13.

Released in 2011 and blew all of us with its amazing open world of skyrim, filled with breathtaking lore, the characters, atmosphere and the music is stunning. Not only that but hundreds of quests to get lost in as well as the DLC's dawnguard and dragonborn to add on top of the already packed game and the mods for this game are insane. Want an epic open world rpg to play this is the ultimate game to waste countless hours on. Skyrim community you make us proud. Now if you excuse me I have Thomas the tank engine to slay for its train soul I mean dragon soul."

9635,best game ever
9636,Great Game
9637,yes
9638,the game overall in storywise gameplay ect is good and all but this game has quite a few problems 1 a flashing water glitch that makes your character swim and lose your sword swing or bow draw mid combat which often gets you killed 2 the enimies often greatly overpower you so often unless you have a good weapon like the master sword you wont get far 3 one wrong change in mods and BAM THE GAME WILL CRASH ON STARTUP AND YOU CANT DO A THING and 4 DID I MEANTION DEAD DEAD AND MORE DEAD?! I SWEAR YOU GET SOMETHING IMPORTANT OR JUST LEVEL UP BOOM DEAD 5 SECONDS LATER AND YOU GOTTA GET IT BACK luckily if you type tgm into the console youll be just fine and enjoy the game
9639,"I mean, who doesn't like Skyrim?"
9640,Really game to play through quarantine. Its a game!
9641,"Its skyrim why wouldnt you play

9651,"I've been obsessed with this game for a long time, and used to watch my brother play it before I was allowed to. I love this game so much and always recommend it. I've basically done a completionist run of it a couple times now. It's buggy here and there, as Bethesda is, and has some common glitches, but it's a really special game to me."
9652,It good.
9653,"My play time is not real. I first bought it for the PS3, I must have played it for over 300 hours, then I bought it in Steam, and mostly played it offline, so my hours didn't count. I must have roughly 1.5k hours.

Skyrim, what can I say?
It is one of the most recognized games of all times, and when you play it, you can tell why. The freedom of exploring the beautiful landscape, fighting mythical creatures, shouting Lydia from the top of The Throat of the World, killing Nazeem, reloading, killing Nazeem, reloading, killing Nazeem...
Sorry, I got carried out. 

Anyways, the game on it's own is good.
Cliché story, but what story is original nowadays?
Although the weapons, armours and spells are really varied, the combat ends up being dull.
The same happens with the enemies, there are only two or three unique enemies, and not ""unique"" in the way of Bandit boss, that is a regular bandit with good armour and more health. And at higher levels, they are just sponges that absorb all your blows.
Potions and poisons are really varied and add a lot to the way you can play.
The map is not as huge when compared to other open world games, but everything is handcrafted and so perfectly placed, that you don't get tired of exploring the world.

And then there is the mods...

GOOD LORD THE MODS!!!

This is where Skyrim really shines.

There is no limits with the mods, and they just keep appearing.
After 10 years, you wonder ""what else can they make?"" and BAM!!! Now you have chicken wings.
Want to fight in WWE Smackdown? you got it
Want chickens to explode? say no more fam
Want to have all your previous characters as followers? lets break space and time continuous together!

There is just so much!
The mods range from ridiculous to ultrarealism-survival-real-life-eat-drink-sleep-die.
Fixing bugs and problems
New maps and campaigns (Falskar, beyond Skyrim, Skyblivion, etc)
Quality of life (better dialogue box, better ui)
Better combat (body parts health, impactful weapons and shields)
Realism (food, sleep, temperature)
New and improved skills, spells, powers
There is no end to it

At one point I had almost 300 mods at once.

Now most of the mods are ported to the special edition, so you don't have to worry about that."
9654,vewy gud UwU
9655,great
9656,"Being someone who likes to get 100% in games it really upsets me that Bethesda decided to create DLC that's incompatible with this version of skyrim, to then add achievements for which you need said DLC. 

What's the point of this? You're locking people out of being able to get 100% on a game they paid full price for back in 2012. Not to mention making them buy the game AGAIN if they want to experience the DLC. 

Yeah, it's Skyrim. And Skyrim is a good time, but these shitty fucking practices are just cringe and not based in the slightest. Don't buy this version, don't buy the anniversary edition. You know what you should do instead."
9657,"The legendary, hugely popular, last Elder Scrolls game TESV is everything it is to be Bethesda’s best work. Each game built upon another with a lot of things repeated, expanded upon, or scaled back, balancing it into something that feels natural.
A decade later, the magic having faded from video games’ golden age, technological leaps and bounds having diminished into uninspired sameyness. Which game is better is to every person a question of what touches the soul. Living another life in another world is realized to its potential with the imagination that Skyrim inspires as we reach for our dreams in the dark. The lore of everything leading up to it at its end in that moment when what the artist has been trying to create is completed.
Saving the world again, this time, as the last Dragonborn from a dead Empire fighting itself in the shadow of its Dragonborn founder. The world has fallen apart, but you save everyone in it from its old ruler, the World Eater. Who you are only powerful enough to defeat because his blood runs in you as it did in Talos who united the world under the Empire that has fallen apart. The hope for the future is to return to the unity that he had created, but the only thing that is certain is the now. Dovahkiin is unstoppable with limitless power and potential. The game gives you the freedom to be the Dragonborn that represents everything that The Elder Scrolls is. It is different for everyone who plays it. There will never be another Skyrim.

9659,"Having played the main quest(s) several times through many years ago I was pleased to find that there are still all kinds of things I had never encountered before.  Different ways of completing difficult quests, random encounters I had never had before, places I had never stumbled upon in previous play through (fast travel isn't always best).  Additionally some of the mods I now have add some real benefit to the game, from simple lighting improvements to features and spells that should have been in the game on day 1, to say nothing of improved companion AI (no more triggering every trap) .  Totally worth the (?) $60 I payed when I first got it, wish they would make another like this instead of those mmo..."
9660,ah yes
9661,s
9662,"so fun love this game ,"
9663,ye
9664,I've been a fan since the game came out and the mod community is still ongoing today almost a decade later. You will get lost in the amount of stuff you can do modded or not
9665,"Runs like ass and the company is dog water. See who's bar of colour will run out fist, it wont be yours. too easy."
9666,"GOOD GAME
"
9667,it is a pretty good game!
9668,Classic Open World Gaming
9669,"It's Skyrim... I wish Bethesda would come out with the next installation and not just release this game over and over. Fun game, but old."
9670,"Amazing game, so much contents to play around."
9671,This is just a classic. I got this game because I wanted to get some nostalgia. Also this game has pretty much infinite replayability as there is pretty much a mod for anything in the game.
9672,It's a classic
9673,see for yourself
9674,"I don't think it's possible to not recommend this game.

In Skyrim the story is your own to make.

Despite the ""bad graphics"" I think the game looks quite nice, maybe that's just because I like the style due to nostalgia but still, I like it.

Alright, so sure, base game there are bugs and honestly they're not that bad and sometimes can be pretty funny. Of course, you can get mods and whatnot to fix that.

On to the mods, they can be pretty good and honestly that's probably how it's survived for so long, I mean hell, as I type this I'm getting a mod. I suggest playing without mods for a bit before getting any though unless they're simple improvements like better blood/gore or better looking magic.

Anyways, I haven't slept for over 24 hours so I'm a little sleep deprived and probably seem really.. wordy? Rambly? I don't think that's a word actually. Anyways, yeah, hope this helped."
9675,this game is the boom
9676,OLD SCHOOL CLASSIC
9677,i have always liked skyrim
9678,"It just works for me.
"
9679,Bethesda made this game extremely mod friendly for PC users to enjoy for many years.  A fantasy RPG with a many stories and endless quests and a big open world to explore.  The modding community makes the replay value amazing.  Enjoy the base game or make it your own.  So many possibilities.
9680,"I have played this game for alot of my life and I don't regret it, I just wish I could play it for the first time again."
9681,"this game is one of the OG games i played when i was young i would recomend this game if you like RPG style game or open world adventure games if you have a VR headset and like this game then you should get skyrim vr as its the origonal game with all the DLC and polished for VR

this game has been so fun to play and i thank steam for alowing it to go up on the steam store

9685,yes
9686,"you there, your finally awake"
9687,great game whether you play it once or a 100 times there is always something to do. great game would recommended.
9688,"Please forgive me, my PC. It's just too many of mod"
9689,peepee poopoo check!
9690,Very basic compared to previous Elder Scrolls games. It's like a PC version of Game of Thrones. Very mass appeal fantasy adventure with few fantasy elements besides dragons and elves. Not interesting.
9691,yes
9692,"I usually play through this game every two years on a different machine.

I guess I'll be playing it on xbox again at some point."
9693,"An absolute classic. I come back to play this game every now and then, sometimes just to explore and enjoy the nature and music of this masterpiece of a game. I love the storyline, the sidequests and characters. Everything in this game is enjoyable and it has something for everyone. I've played this game since it came out (on Xbox 360 back then) and I don't think I'm ever going to stop coming back to it. I can only hope that the next installment in this franchise will be atleast as good."

9698,"A complete buggy mess. Open a door everything flies around the room. Including dead bodies. The water keeps disappearing and reappearing.
Fast travel is extremely buggy and loads you in the air and you fall to your death. Cant run even tho you're no where near from being over-encumbered. Enemies during combat keep floating and dropping. Dragons flying through walls. Horse falls through the floor. Several times. And on some occasions i glitch through wooden bridges running across them. While in beast form my attacks don't seem to hurt anyone.
The game for me is unplayable."
9699,"I die to often but its still good fun.
"
9700,"It is glitchy. It’s is buggy. It is Bethesda. All that being said this game is one of my all time favorites. Between the great story and wealth of lore any time spent in Skyrim is time well spent. 
And what could make Skyrim better? Mods! With a modding massive modding community Skyrim can be changed and tweaked until it is the game you need it to be."
9701,Good

9718,Mainly walking around but ok...
9719,I just cannot stop playing Skyrim. It is so addicting. The only change I would make is to be able to play with a friend. Two person game to go on missions and stuff.

9730,It's alright
9731,"The best game ever to relax and play, edit: my most favorite game ever, Love this Khajit called J'zargo"

9737,"Great classic game, if you like in depth and a long duration, this is for you."
9738,If you havent played then wtf?
9739,good game
9740,a good but buggy game
9741,I've played this game on 3 generations of consoles and on PC and I still love it. The base game has hours of content and the vast amount of mods available allow you to customize your play-through and adds tons of replayability.
9742,With all of the mods available its a new game each play through.
9743,"is gud
"
9744,"Is excellent in many ways better than Oblivion, Fallout 4's settlement builder feature really shows what Skyrim could have been if Bethesda realized the popularity of Legos, perhaps they meant not to put pressure against the Lego industry or might even have to pay rites to it if settlement builder feature takes from that market. Less use of plastic however means Lego company becomes anti environment for money and loses popularity anyways. Skyrim would be in my favorites with Oblivion but Fallout 4 showed Skyrim could have had settlement builder feature. Spears yall peace..."
9745,Classic
9746,
9747,yeah its pretty good i guess
9748,get it... that is all.
9749,"amazing
"
9750,"Bad game, not good, very fun though"
9751,"They'll never make another like Skyrim. Such a spirit and hype in this game that hasn't faded even after a decade. While we ride the cart into Helgen for the millionth time, it honestly warms my heart to know that other adventurers are taking their first cart ride at the same time. This masterpiece has spawned countless things that we now take for granted, such as It Just Works, rubbery thot followers, floating horses, dragons piggybacking giants, Really Useful Dragons, burden carrying, and Must've Been The Wind...the list just goes on. I honestly want to work for Bethesda after playing this tour-de-force.

Dawnguard was equally as amazing. We all wanted a gothic vampire tale whether we realized it or not. This amazing DLC gave us crossbows, Ancestor Glade, The Forgotten Vale, and Yes What Did You Need. It gave us our best friend Serana, and even inspired nexus-user @Mengyei to create a full-blown Anime narrative that I strongly recommend reading (I love your shit, Mengyei. Huge shoutout.)

Nothing on Dragonborn or Hearthfire. The new armors were all too weak except Nordic Carved. The new area was kind of fun for Morro-boomers like myself, but it quickly lost it's charm. House building was just an unimmersive timesuck -- I'll just take my Breezehome and be moving on, thank you -- although I suppose it is technically a roleplaying possibility, and alchemical gardens were extremely handy.

In short, I will always pick up my steel after a workday and participate in the Skyrim Space Program. I will always ride horses up sheer walls. I will always abuse Sibbi Black-Briar's pockets until I can disrobe people undetected. I will always Soultrap a lifeless wolf until I can summon demons.

I give Skyrim the only rating it ever deserves -- 10/10. If you've never played, come join us in the only magical world you'll ever need."
9752,"immersive fantasy world, incredibly well done. wish they would do more like it."
9753,
9754,its skyrim if you haven't played it before then you just arnt a gamer period. everyone and their grandam has played this game and so we all know that it is a good game.
9755,i wish i had the nerve to play this game
9756,"Im not sure why i didnt write a review yet, but Skyrim is and will allways be one of the greatest RPGs of all time. 
Some people would say that the story is short, well.. if you only speak about the main story this maybe is true. 
Some people would also say that sidequests are boring and in 99% of the time i would agree, but NOT in Skyrim. Skyrim has surpassed the borders on what a game is, Skyrim is more then that, it has so many stories
to tell and so many secrets to find out. I know many people that played skyrim and even i have played it alot.
But i know of noone that knows everything about Skyrim. If you want to dive into a world of magic, secrets and battles, Skyrim is the right choice. And even if one day you come to the conclusion ""great game, but i have seen everything now"", there are thousands of mods waiting for you that open new maps, implement new characters and fill the world you began to love with new life.

Yes, Skyrim is definitely worth playing"
9757,"amazing game, so much to do youll never get bored"
9758,Good game
9759,It just works
9760,"If you're still reading a Steam review to buy Skyrim (probably even full priced) you've probably never even used/owned a computer/gaming console. And that's okay!
If you like dragons, fantasy, dead people, living people, crabs, Sonic, basically anything; you'll probably like Skyrim as well. You can spent hours upon hours just playing the vanilla Skyrim. And if you're done playing vanilla, you can get yourself some mods. And spent hours upon hours finding new mods, doing crazy shit, corrupt your game. 

It's Skyrim. I don't know why you're even reading this review. Just buy it. (but don't buy it full priced. just don't. Especially this version.)"
9761,"this game is greater then anal, now im addicted"
9762,the Elder Scrolls games are always awesome
9763,"This is one of the best rpg games I have played, its up there with guild wars for me.  Which I love. This game has it all and so much content you can play for years.  Great for fans of guild wars and single player rpg games."
9764,This game is freaking awesome First time i ever played this!
9765,It's Skyrim. Mod it.
9766,"Aha, another game where I can get bullied by dragons. Great choice if your into sword fights and magic lizard people."
9767,cmon man
9768,"Simply the best RPG/shooter out there. I love the action, mechanics, game feel, music, and the beauty of the seemingly neverending places to explore. The mods add a very nice touch to the graphics, like fire, water, clouds, plants, etc. This is truly one of the best games ever."
9769,"This is a wacky, fun, weird game.
And I really like it"
9770,just dont watch a speed run and this game is great a decade after release
9771,Tons of content. Great storylines and dialog. Amazing scenery and soundtrack.
9772,Very nice and immersive a total classic you should play if you havnt already.

it's Skyrim again"
9782,"very EPIC and DOPE role playing GAME

9783,So many hours spent. So much fun. To this day I still learn new and awesome things.
9784,This is skyrim if you don't know it buy it you will lose your life playing it.
9785,very good
9786,best game
9787,The best bad game
9788,It is cool.
9789,even after like 10 years the game is still good. It's still Bethesda so of course there's bugs but nothing crazy bad that i've come across
9790,"If you somehow don't know Skyrim, get it NOW. Amazing game, one of the crown jewels of The Elder Scrolls series. It took the concept of wandering around aimlessly and still having fun and defined it almost into a genre."
9791,sky rim
9792,This product has so many small adventures it keeps a player interested and coming back for more. You can change the way the world treats you just by playing differently.
9793,iv beat the main quest 20 times and it gets better and better. i never get board of it. It is fun to just roam around and play the game and meet new charaters
9794,Yes
9795,"I can't believe how addicting this is, I spent so much time on this totally worth it. Now Vilkas is my bitch."
9796,31
9797,"Excellent!  The game play, game controls, story and a true ""open world"" concept were well done. I spent many hours even after the main campaign was over just roaming around the gaming world revisiting the towns, people and landscapes. That in itself for me was enjoyable experience. Hopefully in future games the romances and character creation will be a little more developed, but overall a great game 9.5/10."
9798,One of the best. But you already knew that................
9799,This is the best RPG i have ever played. its a must have for new gamers or for casual gamers!!!
9800,Simply a really good game
9801,Where the hell is my skooma
9802,Good Other Than Needing Mods For It To Be Decent And Bethesda Not Caring To Fix The Game Themselves And The Fact You Have To Buy A Completely Separate Version Of The Game To Play This Is Vr It's Decent Not Recommended But Decent (same exact thing goes for fallout 4)

9902,"Bland visuals, bland gameplay, bland voice acting, just overall bland game."
9903,Great game..  always lots of stuff to hold your interest in it.
9904,"While I will go ahead and give this a recommendation, it's a mild one.  Why?  Well, boiling it down...  Very thin character and story writing, a bad combat system, and exploration that gets dull very quickly.  It's puddle deep in many ways, and it's a fun puddle to splash around in but I got tired of it.  There's a lot of systems that if you like playing around with, I could see you getting a ton of time with.  But I didn't enjoy playing with any of them for long, as they're thin and wonky and glitchy and service no story.  In the end, I did have some fun and did finish the main storyline, and I found it passably enjoyable, so that's a rec.  But barely."
9905,game still poopy. play morrowind instead

9907,good
9908,Fun

9910,"This game is the greatest game of all time, it's rpg, adventurous, and creative. You could replay this and play through it differently everytime, so many quests, and if you get bored of those join one of the factions, bored of that, get the dlc there are 3 of them, bored of that look at the unlimitated number of mods. no sure if i spelled that right, but anyway this game is perfect and the bugs are honestly comedic not game breaking so you can have a laugh too, the elder scrolls series 10/10."
9911,"nobody:
always none:
me in 2021:
Holy shit, what is this?
Forged in God's very flames. 

Do mine eyes tell me lies, 
A new Elder Scrolls Game?

Time is nigh, I must fly,
Venture forth on my quest. 

Goodbye Ma, goodbye Pa
And goodbye Girlfriend's breasts.

I'll be off Azeroth, catch you later Hyrule. 
I'll be gone Albion, I'm no longer your fool. 

Other crap filled the gap
While I waited to begin...

The adventure of my life
in the land of Skyrim!

9912,"What I love about this game is that it's set in the medieval times and you're able to do a lot of different things within the game. you wanna be a vampire? go right on ahead, how about a werewolf... sure have at it. you can also download mods in the game which could make it even more immersive."
9913,Don't think I need to explain too much. It's Skyrim. it's the best.
9914,"Total classic. It's a little dated now, pretty buggy and the combat isn't super well developed, but the story is fun, the world is epic and some of the questlines are really great. Mod the shit out of it once you're done too
"
9915,Great Game and one of the first games i ever played never gets old
9916,nice

9920,I played 243 hours and still didnt finished the main quest because of all the interesting side plots :D
9921,Finally got Oldrim on PC. By far the best way to play this masterpiece.
9922,Please Help me
9923,This game + mods = infinite possibilities. You don't even have to enjoy RPG or fantasy like games to enjoy Skyrim. The main story line is a bit stale but the DLC and most side quests are really enjoyable.
9924,greatest game ever
9925,"This will keep you busy for many hours.
"
9926,I like it
9927,Skyrim is a game that you can play for hundreds of hours and still have new things to find.
9928,if u can get past that its shit its good
9929,This game is beyond words
9930,very fun great addition to the series
9931,"this version is buggy as hell.

couldnt get past the start cutscene as the map bugged and killed my horse

water effects bug to hell if you go near it and the map makes you bounce constantly

cant install mods onto it. sorry i meant good mods that cost nothing

get the special edition"
9932,Release TES 6
9933,"I think the amount of hours I've played speaks for itself, although I'd buy the Special Edition at this point.

I strongly recommend the Requiem addon if you want a more RPG'ish, and less action oriented, play experience."
9934,"haha, big hammer go whack"

9936,this is the greatest video game ever made
9937,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following 2006's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011.

The game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.

Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. The game was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the character advancement and setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Nonetheless it received some criticism, predominantly for its melee combat and numerous technical issues present at launch. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and over 30 million copies on all platforms as of November 2016, making it one of the best selling video games in history.

Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released—Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn—which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition and released in June 2013. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition is a remastered version of the game released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in October 2016. It includes all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade, along with additional features such as modding capabilities on consoles. Versions were released in November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation VR, and a stand-alone virtual reality (VR) version for Windows was released in April 2018. These versions were based on the remastered release, but the Switch version's graphics upgrade was relative to its hardware capabilities, and it did not include the modding features."
9938,"I LOVE IT
"
9939,"I mean this game took some many hours of my fucking life, that you might as well play it.
During this shitty lockdown that game some other ones gave me reason to live. 10/10 would waste my time again. THANKS BETHESDA"
9940,its ok i guess
9941,"What can be said? It's a Bethesda game. It doesn't how many times they remake and remaster it claiming to fix issues, there are bugs abound. Yet that doesn't stop any of us buying and enjoying the game, myself included in that.

Bethesda have always, and continue to, placed down fine game frameworks that modders can take and run with, and their title of Skyrim is no different. Where Skyrim itself is a ""Fine"" and playable game, the modders really do take it to the next level, the modding community for skyrim do everything from increase the graphical detail, to improving the UI. Modding is where Skyrim truly ascends to an 'experience'.

 Pros:

- Stealth Archer
- Guaranteed a lot of hours in adventure
- Large, Diverse World.
- Modding Support ads to replayability
- Modders have probably fixed any bug you can find
- Memes

Cons:

- Stealth Archer
- Stealth Archer
- Stealth Archer
- Bugs
- Stealth Archer"

9945,"This was always hype back when I was a kid, I only really got into it recently. Too bad not for long, this game is an utter mess, either crashes or can't play it because of bugs (swimming in air, seizure inducing intro.. )

Oblivion was great tho."
9946,"""Like Fallout with bows"" IGN - 11/10"
9947,they didn't remove the ability to buy the original

9955,"One of Bethesda's best games that I had a chance to play. Even years ago, when I had no money to afford it, I was playing it, cracked, from some pirate sites. And now that I have it, still love it!
It's an amazing game, that I recommend, and you definitely need to buy and play it!"
9956,wicked
9957,"After years of playing, what else can I say but a forever great game"

9960,"Been playing it for 10 years, will probably be playing it 10 years from now."

9975,fun
9976,"All time classic, and will remain on my top lists of game. Got me through lotsa lonely times <3"
9977,Love the depth and detail of the world.  Tons of quests to keep me busy.  Creating different characters and seeing how the quests can be run differently.
9978,"very fun
"
9979,"I've started multiple games but only finished the main quest once.  And I doubt I've seen much more than half of what the game has to offer.  It's a great game that is far better than it had any right to be.  It became a phenomenon, because it deserved to.  Enjoy it."
9980,"It good, one not good thing though.
everytime i get a sidequest and want to complete it so i dont have anymore quests, i get another one when i finish, so flippin annoying! but worth the grind, get on top ;)"
9981,"Up there with the Witcher 3 in terms of best RPG'S i have ever played. 9,5/10"
9982,"I've played this game for around 3k hours between xbox, nintendo switch and now jumped on pc.

This is probobly the end of me playing this game as i have found interest in newer games of this type.

But this then again, a game review from someone that played a game and all its dlc's for 3k hours should be worth a read.

This is a super safe 9/10."
9983,Great fantasy game!
9984,One of the greatest games in recent history my dudes and dudettes!
9985,This game was the most entertaining software I have ever played.

9998,"It has a huge and detailed world with beautiful visuals and an atmospheric soundtrack. I will never forget my first playthrough. Skyrim has a great story with deep lore. It features the same freedom of choice like its predecessors. The amount of things to do seem endless. There are so many quests to fulfill, dungeons to explore etc."

10001,epic
10002,"2,000 hours and counting.. 2,000 game crashes and counting.. Still havin fun"
10003,"Awesome single player rpg with multiple holds each connected to their local outer-lands. Lots of dragon attacks to really emphasize being ""Dragonborn"" a specially chosen individual, which you soon come find out there is a lineage of dragonborn who came before you. Immerse yourself in an X-tra large world of wonder and adventure, and be amazed by the amount of freedom to develop your characteristics, becoming a vampire, a thief, a werewolf, a soldier, a powerful wizard, or all of it together!"
10004,
10005,Highly recommended I have 602 hrs in it and I am determined to complete it.
10006,A CLASSIC IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED YOUR CRAZY DO AT LEAST ONE VANILLA PLAYTHROUGH WON'T REGRET

10014,"Awsome and fun, has good mods and a good time spending game"
10015,"Perhaps not as good as Oblivion, but the graphics are better and the world is much bigger. Still, it's an Elder Scrolls game, and a great one."
10016,ALOT OF FUN
10017,good game but too glitchy for a recommended
10018,"What can I say what hasn't been said already? Skyrim is the most played game of the last decade and with good reason! I started over after heavily modding it to make it look even better :-)
If you haven't played it yet, you should! Period."
10019,"its good but im just so trash that i cant defeat the dragon xd, i love the character making."
10020,Banging
10021,This game was amassing back in the day but the PC is where it becomes legendary. I cannot recommend this game enough with mods this game is whatever you want it to be
10022,"The game is good, but the ease of adding mods makes it great!"
10023,I have been coming back to this game for years and it is still a blast to play.
10024,"Been playing for years. Mods make it infinitely variable. still finding things in the game I missed in other games. Would recommend to anyone with hours (years) to waste and who likes to role-play. I really like that I am free to do as I wish, even ignore the main game, and still have days of other things to do, other quests."
10025,forever my life
10026,Somebody stole my sweetroll
10027,"An excellent and efficient waste of time. 

I have this for both PC and PS4."
10028,i love it
10029,open fun
10030,"Yeah, dude"
10031,Downvoting because its not Elder Scrolls VI.
10032,I downloaded a mod that turned everything into thomas the train... 10/10
10033,This is one of the games I've played.
10034,yes
10035,Needs more releases
10036,"Through big picture I have been able to play this game with a xbox controller for series s.  It makes the battles easier for me.  Having all my buttons right at my finger tips.
"
10037,"Spent this long on the game, and almost never got past dawnguard.
....Mod, new game, speed run Dawnguard, get bored and install more mods, new game...

How much of my life has been spent on this game?"
10038,Opened the game instantly got flung in the intro sequence because my refresh rate was too high 10/10
10039,It is excellent game. Open world in the game is one of the biggest i've ever seen. You can play hundreds of hours and you will still have unexplored places. And i like the complete gameplay.
10040,"its cool
"
10041,.
10042,"Great game, lots of fun :)"
10043,yeyeyeyeyeye
10044,it has lot of new part to it. i recommend this game fore ages 14 and up.
10045,"A classic, never gets old"
10046,"very fun
"
10047,"Its skyrim, you can play it on a spud"
10048,good
10049,It is just a great game with an almost endless amount to do. I always recommend it when someone asks about Skyrim.
10050,amazing game. can't stop playing
10051,"Awesome combat, multiple character types, and independent development of skills. Make a stealthy mage archer, or whatever else you might prefer! While it is a single player game, you can add followers of various types to assist your missions! Definitely worth playing for hours without end, You can save your progress any time, You can also remake your character and start over if you want something different! You cannot remake your character without starting the game over, but previous saves will let you restore the progress of the previous character if you decide to go back to the previous character. Good luck, and enjoy!"
10052,"[h1]Summary:[/h1]
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an outstanding and very memorable game.
The base game remains fun for about 24-36 hours at a moderate pace. No singleplayer game has infinitely fun content.

 - [b]Pros:[/b] Good combat, some great quests
 - [b]Cons:[/b] Some glitches, dated graphics

I would recommend it at full price ($19.99). I also recommend buying the Dragonborn and Dawnguard DLCs (I cannot see these DLC in the store anymore, but I'd pay $20.00 for the Dragonborn DLC and $10.00 for the Dawnguard DLC)

[h2]Detailed review:[/h2]
[u]Graphics:[/u] Not bad. Very dated, but not eye-wrenchingly ugly. This game was released in 2011, what do you expect?

[u]Performance:[/u] Great. If I tried it, I'm sure my printer could run it with at least 50 FPS.

[u]Gameplay:[/u]

- [b]Combat[/b] is good. Melee weapons and bows are mind-numbingly simple, but magic combat is very fun and engaging. Against a tough foe, fighting by any means is fun and engaging.

- [b]Dialogue[/b] is good. I understand what my character is going to say and I usually have different choices on what to say, and it usually has an effect on gameplay (but not always).

- [b]Quests[/b] are great. The are many quests in Skyrim that were very fun and memorable. The rest are at least enjoyable.

- [b]AI[/b] is okay. Friendly AI is competent enough to not frustrate you and enemy AI is also competent enough to put up a fun fight.

- [b]Glitchy[/b], as is the case with Bethesda games. If you're familiar with the game's console, you won't need to download mods for fixes.

- [b]Crashes[/b] occasionally, but not often enough to be frustrating."
10053,Best game ever!!!
10054,.
10055,c'mon
10056,Dragons!
10057,let me guess someone stole your sweet roll.and it was delicious. now i used to be an adventurer like you then i took an arrow in the ass true story.
10058,"""Psst! Hey. I Know Who You Are. Hail Sithis!"""
10059,"Oh, you're finally awake!

Huh? Dragons? Shouting? Civil war?

What are you talking about, master? Come on, let's go cuddle on the bed!"
10060,
10061,Ｍａｓｔｅｒｐｉｅｃｅ.
10062,"Very well thought at, a game that's always new everytime you play it. Almost infinite systems when increasing skills. Much more engaging than Elder Scrolls Online."
10063,great game keeper but only in antholigy best skyrim ever put out ps4 suckzzzz when it comees to skyrim
10064,"Ruined my life since 2011,
Way worse than previous TES games and only saved by it's modding community.
I've alway had a love/hate relationship with this game.
It abused me in every possible way and our relation is as toxic as possible, please send help ASAP.

Recommended."
10065,"The gameplay is repetitive and boring, the story is terrible, as well as the world building, it's full of bugs and it get's old pretty fast.

idk why i've spent hundred of hours in this."
10066,"its aight

needs more rule 34"
10067,"Come on, it's Skyrim. You know you need to play this."
10068,whats not to like
10069,"thumbs up , THUMBS UPPPPPPP!"
10070,Love that's it Love
10071,Best game
10072,dragon hgnnnnn
10073,Nice graphics with the option to either follow story line or play with an open world concept.  Characters are highly customizable with different talents and skills.  Add the perks you get from getting different guild affiliations and its perfect
10074,Not as good as Fallout.
10075,"dttulioumn bfmjjjjjjj         cvruy6,.dcry8 d tf5 dcru dcruy dv"
10076,"Awesome and inmersive adventure for long, long playing hours.
"
10077,Very good immersive experience
10078,a masterpiece thanks to the mod that allows children to be killed
10079,"Great game until I broke it with mods. 

10/10 will break with mods again."
10080,"When all else fails, stealth archer."
10081,Great game. Would have liked to see a skyrim multiplayer but its great on its own.
10082,"After 240 hours and multiple and I mean multiple new games I have FINALLY completed Skyrim! Not 100% but all the achievements at least. I did finish the main quest line also.

Great game for those who love to build a character to suite their individual play style while drinking mead and riding a horse. Let's not forget shouting people off mountain tops either!

Not a great game for those who:
[list]
    [*]Have OCD
    [*]Like to collect all the items
    [*]Are hoarders
    [*]Get distracted by searching every single nook and cranny
    [*]Want to understand every single lore related item in the game
[/list]
Seriously though, it is a Bethesda game and like any Bethesda game... well it is a Bethesda game so I shouldn't need to say more. It is Fallout 3/Fallout New Vegas with mead, dragons, and swords. No guns allowed."
10083,Great fun
10084,.
10085,"This is a song that I've heard too many times. That being said, it's not Skyrim's fault that i've bought it multiple times and played it over and over again.

There are certain classics that i've read/watched too many times. Skyrim is up there.
I reckon it could be the last great TES game"
10086,This is an amazing game with loads of different things to do! It has and infinite amount of mods to add to the fun of the game and almost endless amount of missions and lore. I definitely suggest this game to anyone with too much time on their hands or anyone who wants to play an amazing Open-world RPG.
10087,The game that defined open world for me...I can't recommend it enough.
10088,"great game, but publishers, or microsoft, idk who to blame but hiding the original version to make people buy the special edition is pretty fucking scummy in my opinion
"
10089,Absolutely my all time favorite
10090,"A buggy game, I think Oblivion was much better, but still interesting. Improves on the experience overall and simply adds much more, though the story did feel a little bit weaker than previous games. Still, when you add all the expansions and content plus the mods, there is really is a lot to do in the game and explore, so never a dull moment. like the time vampires massacre a town and fuck up your time too."
10091,Excellent game. In depth story line and character creation.
10092,amazing
10093,Nude mods make the game better 10/10
10094,Best game on steam
10095,"I don't really like medieval games, but this one does it to me!"
10096,It's an open world you can do what ever you want
10097,It's Skyrim. Enough said. still relevant this many years after release.
10098,"During my teenagehood I played hours of skyrim and oblivion on my ps3 and now years later on pc I have learned.......Skyrim isn't merely a game IT IS AN ENGINE.  I love oblivion to death but when it comes to modding skyrim is much more stable and easier to mod. You won't get as much silly ai in skyrim either   , and while the silly ai is super funny because in  skyrim it is  a little rarer it can  help you take the game more seriously esp when you want the game to be more moody. 
If you are here on the hidden page of old skyrim you are wondering ""should I get this game ?"" you might be thinking ""should I get skyrim se instead?"" Well it's an awkward place to be as many old skyrim mods like horses revamped and burning skies are not yet ported and one of the best mods skytweak has to be manually converted to work on skyrim se (some I've heard reports of some things not working) on the other hand  many newer mods will only work on se , sometimes they get backports but not always. Se is much more stable for modding and has better graphics but this means low end gamers might not be able to run it. If for whatever reason you need to game light old skyrim is a better choice , there are low end tweaks out there but it's your call.  You'll need to weigh the pros and cons , it could be you start with oldyrim and go on to skyrim se later on when more mods appear. 
I got skyrim se free as I already had old skyrim before se first came out , I plan to port over but have a modded setup I love and might only port for skyoblvion if it's exclusive or if all the mods I love get ported.

IF you don,t want to spend 30 hours troubleshooting mods and game testing which mods work best , download vortex mod manager and download mod packs or make mod packs recommended by others. In otherwords find lists of mods that work together for other people , I put my main stealth and combat mods that work together bellow.


What did I do to my game?
With much heavy modding I have made stealth closer to the thief series with skytweak to edit npcs detection  to be more sensitive to light and using thief tools to add water arrows to put out lights , rope arrows to climb and noise arrows to distract as well as letting me knock out npcs  if I wish not to kill them and then of combat closer to the souls series with parry critical attacks , lock on and dodge roll as well as increased difficulty   as well as using brilliant story mods like ""the forgotten city "" but souls like world mods like darkend. 
UPDATE I RECOMMEND USING WABAJACK IF YOU ARE NEW TO MODDING OR USING SIMPLE MODS LIKE THE FORGOTTEN CITY USING MOD MANAGER TO INSTALL !
Here are some of the mods I use but a warning they might not be ideal for those  very new to modding but they work nicely together so I,ll mention them anyway , these ones that fix stealth and combat  if you are interested  for role play , survival etc etc there are plenty of other mods for different tastes and plenty of modlists. I like Ineed but I couldn't get it work  with my other mods , never figured out why. This is also the current load order I am using for these mods , in between many other mods for other game tweaks like burning skies, follow me , horses revamped etc etc. 
I also use skyrim script extender can be downloaded through steam (=
Vigilant.esm  (meant to be dark soulsy I haven't tried but it is recommend)
Darkend.esp (mini dark souls world!!!)
The forgotten city (the first mod to win  a real award for story telling , just recommend for a good story mod can be installed through steam workshop and requires little mod experience )
Dark Souls Combat.esm  (IT'S dodge isn't great so I use the tdodge with it instead but the poise system is very good) but it is a  heavy script mod and needs to be loaded before Critical Hit. Bugs I notice are skipping animations (but damage still goes through) I suspect it causes enemies not attacking bug too but I still love it.
Critical Hit.esp So important if you don't use the dark souls combat mod needs to be loaded after darksouls mod or skipped otherwise. The poise and stammer system isn't as good as dark souls combat but animations are less buggy.
Wildcat - Combat of Skyrim.esp makes npcs smarter and tougher recommended with the parry mod otherwise  you,ll get one butchered 
SkyUI.esp Required but if you prefer old menus you can revert it back with SkyUI-Away make sure to disable the warning menus , this is needed for a lot of mods
Sneak Tools.esp so important for stealth!!!!
Action Combat.esp

10110,"The game is amazing, there's nothing more to say. However, if you don't already own the DLCs, you will hate your life realizing that 25 out of the 75 achievements are locked behind the 3 DLCs, that would be pricier together than the Special Edition itself. And you get no sales, because they're unlisted. I would've loved to 100% this game, however, I'm not going to pay 45 euros for 25 achievements."

The RPG isn't perfect, sometimes your choices just WON'T change anything.

Weather its on on console or PC i can always sit down and play this game as whatever kind of character i want to be. Good Breton mage? No problem. Bad argonian werewolf pickpocket expert. Have fun! This is one of those games most other games aspire to be. Easy to play, easy to comprehend within minutes of loading in for the first time, and yet immersive enough to waste and entire day that could have been otherwise dedicated to house hold chores and responsibilities, speaking of which, has any one seen my cat?

This 10 year old game stands up against modern day releases, making them look lousy. Lydia has a little too much attitude. 9.5/10"
10160,"--- GAMEPLAY ---
Although simplistic combat in this game is amazing for the variety of weapons and spells that you can mix and match. I've played an awful lot of Skyrim throughout almost every console available to purchase it on and I've always tried to vary my combat from other playthroughs. Whether it's playing a stealth necromancer to going all out with a warhammer and heavy armor. The combat in the game really allows itself to be replayable to try out a variety of playstyles. Enemies in the game scale with you so you are never really too powerful against them until you start passing NPC level caps. As well as this the variety of enemies means that fights can feel very different. Giants for example you want to try and avoid upclose attacks and staying near them for too long but a dragon would be the opposite trying to get as many hits in before they flew away.

Puzzles in the game vary in difficulty quite a bit. Some puzzles you can run into and immediately see what you need to do, some of them you will be googling. I can't really speak for the first time I played the game anymore but I don't really have much trouble nowadays with most of the puzzles. There is a lot of variety when it comes to the puzzles. From hints in books to find a certain location to the claw door puzzles which could be pretty confusing for the first time round players. One thing that I will say is that when it comes to quests sometimes the markers can be a bit too helpful. I think I'd prefer if it just told you the general area you need to look for something or an enemy is located or even a way to toggle between exact location and general location.

--- STORY ---
The story is pretty good. It did actually take me a few months to eventually get round to finishing the main story because I was focusing on side stories which I think probably improved my opinion of it. The main boss battles I always felt were pretty intense especially the last one despite me being a pretty high level. Although I enjoy the story overall there definitely are some aspects of the story I felt are dropped too quickly and some that straight up annoy me for being a thing that you don't have a choice about (although there are mods to give you a choice in the matter I'm referring to). There are a lot of memorable NPCs throughout the main story which is pretty amazing considering how many different characters you meet while playing that some of them are so memorable. I also really like how the main story ties in with some of the side quests that you would only ever realise if you did multiple playthroughs and took different approaches.

The abundance of side missions in this game is where I've spent the most amount of time. There are multiple choices to take for basically all of the large side quests which encourages replayability a lot. Not to mention the DLC which adds a huge amount of content to play around with. All side quests felt pretty fleshed out and fit perfectly into the world. There was nothing that ever felt forced in just for the sake of being there.

--- Community ---
Although I don't normally talk about modding I feel if there any game that is most suited for this it's Skyrim. There is a massive abundance of mods that do basically anything you could think of. Whether you install them from nexus, through the steam workshop or through the game itself there are so many mods to play around with. Although it should be said that playing vanilla first time round is highly recommended. Mods fix an awful lot of the bugs Skyrim has to offer as well as add content larger than DLCs. Not to mention Skyrim Together which allows you to play with your friends. Honestly, because of the mods alone is probably why I have played so much of this game on a variety of platforms. I don't know my exact hours all together as steam probably has the lowest but I'd estimate it at over 2000.

--- AUDIO ---
The music in this game is just phenomenal, I get chills every time I hear it even ten years later. Not only the main theme but the music that just plays when walking around to the music when you go into combat. All of it is so memorable to me and I recognise it immediately. The in-game songs aswell sang by the bards add so much atmosphere to the inns around the world. 

--- BUGS ---
In short, the game is a buggy mess. I can't couldn't the amount of times I've experienced a physics issue or even a crash it's happened so much, but don't let this deter you. For as many bugs that can be annoying there is twice as many that are just downright funny. Seeing an NPC flail around after death, watching an NPC swing around like they have a sword in there hand but it's empty is always funny to see. After a while you honestly just get used to it. However, as mentioned before there are huge efforts by the community to iron out these bugs via mods which you can very easily find in any of the mod managers.

--- DIFFICULTY ---
If I'm being honest the game is fairly easy for the most part. I find most death I have are because I end up falling off a cliff, into a trap or other avoidable deaths. That being said some of the bosses I still find very difficult even after fighting them. For the most part i don't have most trouble with enemies but then again I know basically all of the attack patterns. Puzzles can be fairly difficult as well and you will almost certainly be googling some answers.

10168,"I was going to write an in-depth review of all things I disliked about Skyrim, but I'll summarize and present lesser mentioned points here. You can find one million videos called ""The problem with Skryim"" or something on youtube if you want 1 hour of some nerd complaining about why the game is the worst of the series.

[b]In short[/b]
My main problem is that Skyrim is less roleplaying and more action, and the action is just okay enough to carry it for a short whiile, since it's lacking in complexity. There is no reason or motivation to roleplay. Your character can be a jack of all trades and can get into any faction or be anything or anyone even if they're not built for it.

[b](To go more in-depth on that point)[/b]
This demotivates specialization and this in turn demotivates roleplaying. Writing has also taken a big hit compared to Oblivion and the quest design can be just terrible at times. If I see one more ""Collect x amount of this"" quest I'll go insane.

The game is so scared to exclude players, to present difficult and interesting scenarios or to let players do a method of problem solving complexer than combat (like speech, skills such as acrobatics or athleticism which were removed, spellmaking, etc.), that it is severely lacking in depth, while not presenting enough gripping gameplay to balance it out.

[b]As an overview of the progression of the Elder Scrolls Series (from the games that I've played)[/b]
- Daggerfall had procedurally generated worlds and a large number of systems that you could interact and play with
- Morrowind had amazing lore and world-building, and bringing the old mechanics into 3D brought a lot of opportunities to solve problems in ways not intended.
- Oblivion had good writing (at points) and streamlined a lot of elements, making the game more accessible and easier to play (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). It had less focus on lore, but more focus on individual quest stories.
- Skyrim has less lore, less roleplaying, less interesting writing/story, and the only thing that improved were general accessibility aspects and better combat. Making it one of the games in my collection that I feel like I wasted my time on.

P.S. if anyone tells you the story of Skyrim is good, ask them if they remember the main quest or what the politics behind the Imperials vs. Stormcloaks conflict was."

skyrim feels like its RPG elements from oblivion and morrowind were gutted to non-existence.
you can make 100 new characters, but everytime, in every way, it is always the same experience.
i kinda wish that they incoporpated more RNG procedural generation into quests, dungeon designs/layouts, and loot/gear. more depth to the skill tree system, or something. 

i've played skyrim way too much. but its been 10 years. and all bethesda has to really show us is Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. i wish that if anything theyd learn from what made tes 3 4 5 good. and make something out of that as one amazing rpg game. for the next 20 years.... heres to TES 6 in 2028"

I've 7 Achievements left and this one will be a pain as it looks like I'll have to do the whole quest line again. Sigh, maybe next year.

This game is beautifully crafted. No doubts. For a game developed at it's time. The colors used for both editions are well suited to the environment and the scenery developed was masterfully created. 

Although like any game made under the Bethesda branch, there are some bugs that I have encountered over the years with this game that should have been fixed. But nerveless, I have found ways to move around these and still enjoy the game.

Overall, I personally give this game a 8.5/10

Highly recommend this game for anyone interested in Open World RPGs"

I've played this game at least three times, maybe even four, from start to finish. But then again, there is no finish like in some games. There is so much to do and so many sights to see. How can I otherwise explain that I've spent 580 hours of exploring the vast realm? That's nothing to sneeze at.

Although the game is getting quite old, it is still pretty to look at. Especially with all the mods and additional content provided by the talented coders out there. Thank you!

I recommend this game to anyone interested in role-playing. Just be warned that you might get seriously sleep deprived sooner than later.

I know I am not alone saying this, but I can't wait for the next chapter to come out. Maybe before that I'll just have to start a new game from the very beginning again..."
10294,ebic
10295,this game sucks. mod it to hell and have fun.
10296,fus ro dah?
10297,Lol its skyrim. Just don't forget mods

10306,"It's Skyrim. It's good.

And don't forget. You start out as a horse thief in this game. :D"
10307,"Great game. Missions/ story lines are well made and very interesting. You have a lot of choices to what you want to do. Playing on the PC is a bit different because you have to optimize your setting when playing. I did struggle a bit with the graphics and several stutters (water, dialogue, music) but after game was optimized everything went well."
10308,it's just fantastic. I literally grew up with this game. Im just playing it again and it still feels different to all the other times i played it. Masterpiece
10309,"Bandits when they see the guy that slaughtered dragons for fun, went to the underworld to save the world, ended the civil war, has 15 Daedric artifacts at his disposal, assassinated the emperor, killed ALL dragon priests, member of Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Nightingales, Dawnguard, The Blades.

10311,.
10312,this game is boring af. Why I gotta download like 30 mods to make it playable?
10313,"I love this open world game. It's fun to run around (virtually) in this beautiful landscape. Takes my mind of things. Is really relaxing. I love Morrowind and Oblivion too. But I mostly come back to Skyrim because it looks so good. Some of the quotes of the (rather talkative) NPCS became legendary: ""I took an arrow to the knee"". ""Need something?"""
10314,Good game
10315,5/7
10316,Very fun. I come back to it all the time.

10326,skyrim is just an awsome game very replayable especially if you can get the right mods and such
10327,Being able to adjust game play to your perfectly desired specifications makes this the best one player game in the world.
10328,"This game has taught me how to climb any mountains in any games without using the designated path. This is the best Rock-Climbing Simulator game I have ever played, 10/10."
10329,I think this game is great if you want some serenity in your life.

10334,"just a plain but good game

10335,"Good game, massive game, maybe even an endless game... Been playing since 2011 when I got a day 1 copy on Xbox 360 and still find myself playing off and on all these years later. Very immersive."
10336,it gud
10337,"It just works
10/10"
10338,Years after I first started playing this and it is still fun. So many options to try out and mix up
10339,"It's nearly 10 years old, the bar was set for rpgs, nothing compares."
10340,The game is perfect. The music is perfect. The acting is perfect. The story is solid. The modding community is a wonder to behold. No more needs to be said.
10341,its gud
10342,"amazing graphics, great storyline, endless options and opportunities and quests for you to go on"
10343,I've been playing this since release and it's 2021. I think im becoming todd howard...
10344,good game
10345,"awesome game. One of my favorites, always a game to easy come back to after breaks"
10346,very fun game with a good mmorpg feel with out being mmo
10347,Gut Game :)
10348,is gud ))
10349,"Fantastic game, huge replayability, with mods even better."
10350,FUN
10351,"Just to say, the game is amazing, I will also note that playing with mods if fun, but be careful. I do not recommend ""The Arena"" mod, it causes terrain errors in the Whiterun plains. Anyways, this game, I absolutely adore. It got a spot on my favorites, and for a good reason, the graphics are good, the combat is challenging sometimes, but I still like the way it functions. I never thought even collecting flowers was fun. If you like games where you decapitate your foes with a big sword, sneak around and take things, or even overpower your enemies with magic. This game is for you, there are some things that disappoint me though, I believe the character you meet sometime during the thieves guild quest ""Karliah"" could be married or could be a follower. Also that some of the mods don't work correctly, but this isn't a problem with the vanilla game. Skyrim can be played in any way, either it is destroyed by mods, or just played in vanilla. For all the scrubs out there, use tgm in the console, activated by the ""~"" button, this will turn on god mode, making you have infinite magicka, health, and stamina. Note, this will not change the ""Pilgrim's Path"" you still take damage ;). Long story short, this game is amazing, and I highly recommend you at least try it."
10352,"Купил игру по предзаказу. В день выхода она не работала, через день тоже, а друг на пиратке играл и наслаждался. Позже это исправили и смог играть
Решил в 2021 поиграть немного. Так игра не запускается. Просто берет и вылетает после заставки.
Одно разочарование, даже просто запустить игру невозможно"

10354,"By all measurements a cleaner and easier-to-digest game compared to its predecessors, though it could have done much more if it didn't stray so far from its roots.

An absolute gem of a game nevertheless, modded or not. Just don't get to thinking the rest of the series is quite like it.

8/10"
10355,This is a totally immersive world that has you drawn in and playing for hours. Would totally recommend playing on pc with mods. Don't play it any other way than your way.
10356,"Love the game play, for the most part.
The leveling up is completely different than both Morrowind and Oblivion though."
10357,yes

10366,One of the best Bethseda games ever
10367,nice
10368,"The best fantasy adventure RPG ever! 

It has a huge and detailed world with beautiful visuals and an atmospheric soundtrack. I will never forget my first dragon encounter or collecting my first butterfly wings (sorry butterfly!). Skyrim has a great story with deep lore. It features the same freedom of choice like its predecessors. The amount of things to do seem endless. There are so many quests to fulfill, dungeons to explore etc.
 
My mod folder needs its own hard drive...

10373,k
10374,yo honestly best game ive ever played
10375,fus ro dah
10376,)yes.(
10377,simply the best game ever
10378,Most immersive and thrilling fantasy adventure/RPG. Compelling main story and a open world with seemingly unlimited side quests/adventures to partake in. Dungeon and loot scaling so no adventure is ever the same! leveling is achieved from getting better at skills (one handed/two handed/heavy armor/alchemy/MANY MORE!)
10379,Do it for the memes
10380,Good game but
10381,Yeah its good
10382,It's a shit version of Oblivion and I still love it so...
10383,epic
10384,It's nicer with mods
10385,very good with mods
10386,"It's clearly aged poorly and it's not as amazing as everybody claims it to be, BUT I still enjoy Skyrim solely based on its VIBES. Real talk, the soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule is probably my favorite video game OST of all time."

This game is so dear to me the only time I would go through the trouble of setting up my incredibly broken laptop was just to play this game. So long as the laptop could still run it, all was well in life."
10399,"Such an expansive, rich world, ripe with quests, collectables, and NPCs (and enemies!). Oh yeah, and the mods. [b]ALL THE MODS[/b]! There's such a vibrant and [i]still-thriving[/i] modders scene supporting this game's longevity."

10404,great
10405,"good game
"
10406,"Game from 2011 patched and fixed with mods to be on par with some modern titles. Truly a fantastic once in a lifetime experience, after you get to actually playing it after troubleshooting 200 mods for 30h that is."
10407,The Zoidberg mud crabs are all that needs to be said about this game.
10408,"I played 1,000 hours of Skyrim Elder Scrolls V. Nuff said"

10418,"dungeons and dragons
"
10419,The best Fantasy 1st person RPG I've played.
10420,"Open world games pretty much peaked with Skyrim and GTA IV. The story line is great. The combat is not the greatest ever, but it is straight forward and you can get some crazy combos. There are classes but you aren't hard locked. Want to be an expert bowman that fells enemies in one shot but carries a massive battle axe for close range? DO IT! 
Buy a house!
Buy a horse!
Get married!
Adopt kids! wait... I guess that's good?
Decide a civil war. I got stuck the first time I picked up Skyrim. Just have fun. Most importantly, remember J is FOR JOURNAL! All the details you need are in there."
10421,Yes
10422,Arguable that this is the greatest game of all time.
10423,"The game is lush, both visually and tactically. There are so many things to see and do. You can play for hours without getting bored. Play it straight through the main quest or take your time and explore every nook and cranny on your own gaining achievements organically, the choice is yours."
10424,boring lame don't play best game ever i had my grandma die while playing i think i stronke my  heart is attacking itself grandma got the ak out of the kichen drawer and shot my dog  10/10 would play again
10425,"Always clunky and buggy, but still a classic."
10426,"really good rpg

10427,very nice
10428,I'M GOING TO COMMIT A WAR CRIME.
10429,"This game has an endless amount of replayability, if you get tired of the main game there are also thousands of mods to completely change the game."
10430,it's a fun game and i love the story
10431,What do you want?
10432,"Tried it for a bit, really open and deep"
10433,"Well, it's my favourite Game!"
10434,"Some people play shooter games, some play arcade games, some do MMO's. What is Skyrim? Skyrim is one of the most adventure hungry games I've ever played in my entire life. Start off as a little undressed race of your choice with a name of your choice after escaping a dragon attack- figure out that out of everyone in Skyrim that you are a Dragonborn. (AKA you are literally talking dragon language making you be able to shout fire from your lungs, or freeze, or taunt and many more.) Knowing this talent you travel the world and you decide what to do with yourself. Do the main quest line? Sure, but theres many other quest lines that all have magnificent rewards. My advice is buy this game right now, silly man."
10435,"TOO. MANY. DRAUGRS.

Otherwise this is fun. Also, there are still a FUCK TON of mods being made for this!"
10436,"Cause ive played this game non stop ever since it came out, first on the playstation 3 and then on steam. Always comming back for more. If you dont mind some things glitching out existence its beautiful"
10437,It's Skyrim. You like TES games? Then get this one.
10438,"introduced me alongside ESO to the wonderful cluster fuck that is TES lore. too deep in it now. play it, it's good. second best game of the decade"
10439,good game

10441,"Totally immersive, lots of different play styles and quest lines to explore."
10442,Big PP
10443,"The best game, that isn't even good."
10444,One of the greatest RPGs of all time.
10445,"It's Skyrim, it's been around forever and is a meme in it's own right and you can mod the shit out of it. What's not to like?"
10446,"Skyrim will never stop being a highly played and well-loved game as far as I'm concerned. Been playing it since release on multiple platforms and this game has been my go-to through many hard times. It's engaging, comforting, and a good escape. At this point, if you haven't played it yet you're missing out big time."
10447,"Just as fun to play now as it was back in 2013 when i played on Xbox 360. There are some weird frame issues, and is a little janky even on a top-end pc; but alas its good fun. Its Skyrim after-all, so it's a pretty good game!"
10448,"Yes
"
10449,2
10450,cool
10451,Really good game if you don't anything else to do with your life. 10/10

Conclusion? Mods. No mods= mediocre bethesda trash."

10459,The Elder Scrolls series would be good if it added the SPECIAL system from the Fallout series. Gradually leveling all of my stats is boring.
10460,"god
"
10461,I like the variety of the content of this game and I find it very entertaining.
10462,"The Legendary RPG that has set the standard for how RPGs are compared to today, TESV: Skyrim is a landmark RPG that defined a genre for over a decade. With one of the most active modding communities for a game, this game proves to keep on chugging along, with over 10 years of age.

If you enjoy RPGs, or if you genuinely like a great story telling game, or even a great game in general, this is for you.

Highly Recommended."
10463,I cant wait for Skyrim 2
10464,An oldie but goodie. Still lots of fun to play and lots of  the world to explore.
10465,good
10466,"disrespect skyrim, and you disrespect me"
10467,"great game, honestly one of the best out there
"
10468,played the hell out of this on the PlayStation 3 and 4 and still don't feel like i have the right to make a review but all im going to say is its an amazing game that easily will give you hundreds of hours of content!
10469,Modding is the only reason why you want to play this game. Who even finishes the base game anyways.

10486,Neat game
10487,I love the graphics  and the music. I have played this many times always as a different person/creature. Somethings remain the same but not everything which makes it so you have more free will.
10488,"Is it buggy? Sometimes. Does it have the best gameplay? No. Is ti a bad game. Also no. I first picked up a copy of this game back in 2013-4(?) on the 360. I've bought this game four times now. I've never played and replayed a game so many times. It's a bit watered down from Oblivion and Morrowind (though those both had there own issues) but it's still a solid game overall, and pretty much every issue can be fixed with mods. Also I wish that this version were easier to find."

Personally, its one of my all time favourite games. I have Over 200H played On Pc and hundreds on the Ps3 and i'm still not bored. Overall this is a very good game. mods that you can add to it make it even more fun. the game maybe old but it is worth it. If you've played other Games like it (Elder scrolls Games and Fallout games) you'll definitely Love this this one."
10553,skyrim
10554,Great game really enjoyed it :)
10555,OUTSTANDING GAME
10556,I'm just here for the mods tbh
10557,Classic game
10558,PLAY THIS SHIT
10559,"very nice
"
10560,fav game all time literally have over 5 years game time across all platforms
10561,Fantastic
10562,Super fun !! If you like open world rpg's this is a must play :)
10563,"In many  ways,this game is the best experience a male can have. Yes you heard me right!!! Even better than sex because it doesn't last a few minutes but you have hours upon hours of playtime fun ;)"
10564,"Best game ever, the soundtrack give me goosebump everytime i hear it and the modding community still alive, with the DLCs make this game fantastic! best game ever made by human"
10565,GG
10566,"After years of playing this game whether on the special edition, this version or the xbox one and 360 versions, Skyrim has never been disappointing, matter of fact it's one of the few games i would call the greatest of all time literally, this MF is a master piece, worth about 20 more play throughs"
10567,Still one of the GOAT's
10568,"easily one of the best games to play of all time. just go get lost in Skyrim, the homeland of the Nords. have fun, and nab frostfall on the way in.

The modding Community is incredible and i'm pretty sure it will be going strong for a long while yet."
10569,super fun game and mods make it so much better!
10570,"Favourite video game of all time. Hours and hours of content. Buy it, no questions"
10571,Only thing bad here is the constant running back and forth from the dungeons with loot. They could tal a lesson from the Gothic series and cary unlimited loot with no weight requirements
10572,Fun Game
10573,"Honestly, I don't know how bethesda roped me into this one, as i generally find fantasy kind of tedious and much prefer sci-fi games, but i have played almost 200 hours of skyrim and i'm still looking forward to playing it after i finish work."
10574,Lok Vah Koor
10575,THOMAS TRAIN SHAGGY
10576,An all time best game.
10577,"It's bloody boring but it's so captivating. 

It really should be called 'the worlds most fantastical hike ever'"
10578,"Not a good game - The combat's clunky and uninteresting, the world can be paper-thin at times, but - 

I love it anyway."
10579,This game is amazing. fight dragons. shoot arrows. swing swords. kill vampires. kill wolfs. shoot fire and ice? pew pew pew at fish. take down rebels and an empire. ride horse. ride dead horses. become an assassin. become an assassin again. become ware-wolf. this game is amazing.
10580,"Skyrim will always be good, one of the best games I have ever known. The only bad thing about this game is that there aren't enough dlc's and the next game is so far away."
10581,Still a great game to this day!
10582,What did you expect? of course it's good
10583,yess :)
10584,One of my favorite games.
10585,"Nice story, graphics and a good way to learn modding"
10586,"s
"
10587,
10588,"Classic adventuring fun with a few bugs. [If you're too good at being a Werewolf your loot can disappear]. Dungeons that repopulate, some cycle-able quests. Once you get your fill go into the story and have a good ol time that way too. A riot even on legendary difficulty because of the shenanigans you can do."

10616,"There's no gameplay, and the writing blows. Don't waste your time man. You wont get the hours back."
10617,"It's the good kind of glitchy mess, I prefer this over cyberpunk, I find myself laughing more than anything from a levitating horse, to seeing a chicken noclipping at high speed and just hearing a ""BUKAH"" from it. even the ragdolls are the best."
10618,old but gold
10619,Best game ever made
10620,"Skyrim is one of my favourite games of all time. I have a lot of love for it, as it brought me more into the RPG Adventure Genre. There is so much world building and detail put into the game, I still find little surprises now and then. I have replayed it many many times and still find joy every run through. This should be one of ""the must plays"" on every gamer's list. Mods are helpful to amend the immersion / graphics / gameplay and keeps it fresh."
10621,Great single player open world experience. Would love to see in a multiplayer setting... Which I believe came out later in The Elder Scrolls series.
10622,10/10 One of the best games ever
10623,Best. Game. Ever.
10624,"gg
"
10625,its fucking skyrim
10626,its nice
10627,I personally didnot like the game. It was very short lived. This game just felt to easy. Yes its replayable but after a while it gets old. This game has tons of mods which make all the issues better but I'd avoid playing vanilla skyrim.
10628,Yes.
10629,original Skyrim best of the best
10630,cringe but funny

10644,"I first played this game for the PS3. Several years later, after getting married, I left the PS3 for my little brother so I was unable to play the game anymore. I then found it on sale and had to get it. The gameplay has always been smooth and a very pleasant experience. There is a lot to do and if you like fantasy RPG games...this is for you! Not only this, but any game in the Elder Scrolls series."

10682,"This is one of the games that never dies. With over 1000+ hours on PC and consoles combined, I can honestly never get sick of this game no matter how much I play it. Regardless, with all the mods that you can install on PC the fun never ends. I would recommend it if you like open world games and rpgs. 10/10 would buy on 4 consoles again."
10683,This game will always be one of my all time favorites
10684,"I mean, it's skyrim. Not the fancy graphics one, but the oldschool badass one!"

10687,THE best game ever.
10688,"this game is one of the best games ive ever played and the community support ive ever seen ive been playing the game for years now amnd still its so fun and entertaining and the ammount of mods you can add to the game to improve and better your experience is like no other game out there and thats a fact. i have over 300 mods in my current game and i continue to add on to my game when new interesting or good mods come out, but of course got to be careful with mixing too many files will break your game.  highly reccomended one of the best games to ever come out and best community built game out there"

10691,nice

Skyrim is the best RPG on PC in human history! Simply put it is exactly what players want in an RPG on so many levels."

"
10694,Great game.
10695,"It's a good game, but would be better if we got a remastered version of it. I'm ready for Skyrim 5. Let's go."

*laughs as he installs Skyrim for the billionth time and mods it to non-functionality*"
10703,i bum chickens in this game
10704,The greatest Skyrim of all time like the dlc's are just an add on to the game but you don't even need the dlc's because there all ready is a lot to do in the base game I'd for sure buy this game if I were you.
10705,it is good.
10706,Elder scrolls 5 skyrim is one of the tremendous hard core games which everyone likes for me this game is for the people who like more fantasy games having dragons involved in it  talking about the storyline of skyrim. It has one of the best storyline and quest i have ever played
10707,nice
10708,"Dragons, shouting at bearded old men, stealing from people as they look at you and quicksaving before you slay an entire village. 10/10 would recommend."

10720,the best rpg
10721,very gud
10722,This game never gets old to me and has always been around the best game for a long time along with minecraft. But this game gets better when you have the community creating mods for the game.
10723,Conjure Bow spell is so fun omg
10724,One of the greatest games ever created ... and that's without the mods.

10733,EVERYTHINGGGGG
10734,"It's an aging game, but it is definitely still fun to play. The main story is really long and there's a ton of other stuff after you complete the main story to keep you occupied for a very long time."
10735,Storyline makes you think.
10736,its good
10737,"decent

it's not a masterpiece"
10738,"Hidden gem not many people know about. For such an obscure and niche title it has surprisingly much to offer. The main story is kind of weak tho.
5/5 would shout a dragon skeleton off a mountain again."
10739,Good Game
10740,"Been playing this game since it came out and I have stopped playing this game every now and then to experience different games but I still end up coming back to Skyrim, 10/10 in my book."
10741,SO SICK DUDE
10742,Very fun
10743,best rpg of all time! easy for newcomers
10744,"The Vanilla version of the game is enjoyable for your first run. However, if you want to experience more from this game and get deep in the lore of Tamriel, you definitely need to mod this game. There are countless mods that not only add to the game's storyline, but also fix some unlogical game mechanics. Let it be the ""Pc optimized UI"" or any DLC sized mod, you will find many that will suit you. To wrap up, this game has one of the most potentials regarding RPG games and it is a game that you must experience at least once in your life, though."
10745,its skyrim...
10746,Best game ever i love it. The game runs even if you have a bad PC like i had. The story is great and there are so many quests so you never run out of things to do it is really fun and i recommend it 100% there are so many bugs tho and if your not a fan of bugs and glitches you should still play it it is amazing!
10747,"Mods. At a certain point I wasn't even playing the game anymore, just installing and testing mods. 10/10 would and am doing again on special edition. Possibly my favourite MODular gaming experience of all time, never gets old."
10748,Best game ever
10749,Best Rpg out for 10 years. Can't wait for ES6.
10750,"Even without mods this game is still bloody amazing. It's a game that I think I can replay almost every single year. If you want to install mods, there's almost no limit for what's out there... although I recommend playing without at least once. There is also a Special Edition, so you should probably buy that one instead."
10751,"Best Action RPG that i know , and the only good first-person RPG that i know"
10752,Buy it for Enderal; otherwise get the special edition
10753,amgous
10754,"yes

10767,"If youa re looking for a game to paly and chill, this is the game for you"
10768,Is good. Is Skyrim.
10769,"Don't want this game to end ! is it the best ever-perhaps not but nearly with added DLC . Not perfect, dialoque could be more flexible for the Dragon born  and imterior maps more detailed but overall. Superb playing."
10770,"10/10
It just works..."
10771,"I've had this game for years, looked at it briefly, decided I didn't like it and uninstalled.
Decided to give it another go yesterday and, whilst I've no idea what I'm doing, I'm now a little bit addicted to it.... I don't have a particularly amazing laptop and there have been no issues loading/moving etc. There's a lot to do and explore so I think I'm going to more than easily get my money's worth from it."
10772,"This is a fun game despite being poorly made and lacking polish. Worth a play through if you haven't had the experience, but hard to come back to."
10773,Open World. Gear. Enemies. You name it.
10774,use mods
10775,My favorite game ever (mods BB)
10776,"One of the very first RPGs I ever played, holds a special place in my heart"
10777,good
10778,Still worth playing 2021!
10779,I love skyrim
10780,"One of the greatest open-world RPGs, and RPGs in general, of all time. One of the first and greatest sources of mass moding, and changed the way games came after. 10 years later it's still better than some new games, and the modding community has updated it to the point that it could still compete with AAA games if it were released for the first time as such."
10781,i started playing this game back in 2012 or 2013 it was definitely before freshman year but at that time i was using a gt 1030 and i5 4440 and  8gb of ddr3 ram now im using a GTX 1050 Ti and a i5-7500 with 16gb of DDR4 ram. havent played with the new pc which ive had for almost 2 years now but the game is so old and probably hasnt been updated in so long i can destroy it with graphical 4k mods and some improvement mods and still run around 90 fps. back when i was using my potato pc which i got from BJ's it was running at 45 an under. if my current pc can handle cyberpunk 2077 without crashing and maintaining around 40 fps for 3 female characters and 3 male character then this game shouldnt be a problem with performance. i have 126 hours into the game and about 113 hours is just testing mods. skyrim is a huge game and the most popular game when it comes down to modding. but if you buy this version then your screwed when it comes to mods that require the dlc which this game doesnt have and your cant buy the dlc for this game. you have to buy the skyrim special edition to play the dlc which is really dumb and now bethesda is in the dumpster because fallout 76 was a multiplayer game with horrible bugs. this is and fallout 4 are the only games bethesda did good on. this actually was my second game i purchased on steam my first was GMOD so yeah eat me putzi
10782,"Skyrim, what a master piece. This game came out in 2011 and from all the hours I have on it and how much I've played it I have only finished it to the point where I felt like there was nothing else to do 1 time. That excluding the fact that mods make it so much more fun. Hours upon hours, days upon days, months upon months of gameplay. Graphics in my opinion are completely fine and shouldn't be complained about. This game is very fun and taken up more of my life than I care to admit. 

You can buy the Special addition but I prefer the original just cause. If you don't have this game already stop being an idiot and buy it."
10783,"I recommend this game to anyone, Skyrim a vast Open world adventure type game it's a lot of fun playing it after a couple of hours however, I don't recommend installing tons of mods on this as the old game will actually not even open if some of the mods you have conflict and potentially break the game itself which is exactly what happened to me I had installed texture packs and stuff including Water Realistic 2 and it conflicted and broke the game so now i can't even play it, the only time i would install another mod on this is when i get the Special edition as it's way more mod friendly sitting on a new 64 bit platform and won't crash as much."
10784,
10785,"I've been playing this game since I got it on xbox in 2011.  I played without mods for hundreds of hours and had lots of fun.  Then I finally decided to try mods and it is even more amazing.  You can totally use mods without the dlc but there are some you can't use.  Use mod organizer 2 and nexus mods.  I recommend using sinitar's modding guide. 
 I also recommend sexlab, cbbe, hdt physics engine, schlongs of skyrim, demoniac body texture, shiva's hair replacer, expressive facegen, expressive facial animations, dynamic animation replacer, glowing ore veins, auto unequip ammo, CL's ebony weapons, and alternative daedric weapons.  I probably missed something."

10799,"A huge open world does not automatically make for a good video game, and nowhere else is that more prevalent than in Skyrim. Skyrim is the game that wants to look great but not play or feel great.

Even for it's time, Skyrim sprawled this huge expansive world with very little in terms of overall content and feel. Yes the world was big and gorgeous but it lacked substance. You spend most of your time in Skyrim walking from A to B in order to do quests and take on a selection of enemies that ultimately just boils down to left clicking with your weapon / spellsa bunch of times until they stop moving. A hack and slash can be fun if the core gameplay is designed around the combat but Skyrim's mechanics aren't. 

You will repeat this cycle over and over until you reach the final quest and even beyond finishing that quest it all feels very meaningless. 

The story isn't something to write home about either being a very run of the mill ""You're the chosen one"" story and it does very little to hold you interested. Some of the side content is decent but I could not tell you a single story even if I tried.

It's very clear from the first hour of the game that Bethesda's focus for this game was ""Big huge world"" and the stuff filling this ""Big huge world"" came second. It's a shame because it could have been something great. What we are left with is eye candy that tastes bland."
10800,What kinda bullshit is it that the game punishes you for leveling up? Enemies you were killing in one to two hits in the beginning of the game can now kill you... Hard enemies you had to struggle against can now kill you in two hits and you have ten times the mount of health you had the first time you encountered them. Get the best items in the game armor sword doesn't matter because you're lvl 60 and now your super bad ass sword is about as useful as an iron sword was at the beginning of the game.
10801,"Decent open world RPG. It's starting to show the weight of all the previous game's system and design choices, but still manages to be a fun experience"
10802,gamer
10803,Fallout with Dragons 10/10
10804,Skyrim is a game I can not get into. I have tried to play it many times but something about it just bothers me.  I know this game is praised and my wife has over 2000 hours put into it. I would recommend it based on how much she and everyone else loves it. sucks that this version is hidden on the store and fans seem to like it better than the remaster.
10805,"cool game
"
10806,best game
10807,"Skyrim is nothing but a time-old classic. There is very little bad to say about the game as it was intended.
My first encounter with this game was on the Xbox 360. I put in a lot of time into it and as a result I look back on it fondly. There is an incredible amount of content and things to do during your time playing. If you've never played Skyrim before, I'm not quite sure what to tell you. There's no doubt you should get it, even 10 years after it's release. The graphics are pretty, the immersion is no doubt there, and the made-easy ability to mod the game creates endless hours of fun.

Up there in the greatest games of all time.

9/10"
10808,It's f!@#ing Skyrim.
10809,game is just epic
10810,"Ok, where would I even start with this game.
Skyrim is one of the best games I have very played. Its replay value and vastness has left me more satisfied than many other games did. Skyrim definitely shows its care and to my opinion is probably the last game from Bethesda that is actually extremely enjoyable. I say this in a way, not to put down Fallout 4 or anything after it, but the games that came after Skyrim just don't feel like as much love was put into it. Skyrim's mechanics are by all means nothing too crazy but its still something to behold. The way the world interacts with you, the different skills paths, it's no wonder this game was so successful. Skyrim has a hold over my heart and I want it to stay there. While I know mods shouldn't be counted, the fact that Bethesda encouraged mod support shows their dedication to their community. The base game in itself was unpredictable but with mods it's even more so. No one play through is the same unless it is forced to be and even then, surprise drunken bandit horde. Honestly the game still leaves a lot to be desired but at this point I wouldn't trade it in for anything in the world."
10811,I love this game so much it feels never ending I really enjoy the enormous open world and the possibility to do pretty much what you want and follow the path you choose
10812,sick
10813,Fun.
10814,"An amazing game with loads of default content, but the fun doesn't stop because you can add MODS!

(Be careful though, too many mods can cause your game to crash at the start.)

Since I'm already talking about it, if you have way too many mods loaded into Skyrims launch directory, then your game just won't start. But the amount of mods you have is dependent on the performance of your computer."
10815,so much to do.
10816,mods
10817,yes
10818,FUS RO DAH
10819,"I know this game has been around for ages, but there is still so much love in it to be discovered.
I have played it more nearly 200 hours and can still find surpris or beatiful corners.
The history of the game also plays a role now and just starting a new save is so nostalgic.
Thumbs up any time of the day."
10820,good game
10821,"I really wanted to love this game, and you probably will. I just don't plain and simple. I don't have any nostalgia and I could care less about the mods. If you like any other Bethesda game, I'm sure you'll like this one

10854,"I think my hours speak for themselves. This game is chock a block full of content and places to explore. Similar to the fallout games though I found the combat in this game to be pretty boring. No matter how I start to build my character I end up creating the same assassin archer every time. The mods really elevate the game and it is not surprising at all that they continue to release this game onto other consoles.

10884,"While i'm not exactly happy with what Bethesda has been doing, it is still a good game... with mods. The unoffical patch is a must! Other mods I use are (more important first, though i like them all):
SkyUI. to have an actual PC-centric UI
Ordinator, for the boring ""more damage"" skill trees become MUCH more interesting
Skyrim Reputation, VERY important to me - now the world feels much more coherent!
Impervious, so the classes are more interesting then just bretons all day
AlternateStart, so no more 20 hours of intro cinematic (chossing hunter is quickstart, essentially)
Andromeda, so the standing stones are not just ""atronach all day""
Apokalypse, want to be an actual mage (over what base Skyrim offers) ? This is the mod!
DisplayEnemyLevel, for better gamefeel - also shows their HP
Protectyourpeople, so noone semi-important dies from some random Vampire or dragon
FloatingDamageNumbers, better gamefeel
UltimateDragon, personal choice, but still pretty good imho
Experience - personal choices from here on out btw
Skyrim - Community - Uncapper
No killmoves  (annoying for me, to slow)
UnreadBooksGlow
ReadandlearnSpeechcraft
Missives
ArsMetallica
HonedMetal

Skyrim immersive criters - might be slightly unstable, but to good for me to drop
Immersive Patrols - some nice clashes between groups, but might cause instability on lesser computers?
and finaly, as a very nice bonus, mods for each berenziah crown parts and jiub's opus.

"
10931,"This game has a cool world to explore that you can spend many hours getting lost in (which is good) but the combat system is horrendously awful. If you play on the easier difficulty, you just click the attack button until the enemy dies, which gets very repetitive very quickly. If you are going to try this game out for the first time, just play on the default difficulty and don't expect combat to be fun. 

If you play on a harder difficulty, it kind-of forces you to block and bash and stuff, but it just makes fighting more annoying than repetitive. The only way to counter an enemy's attack and prevent them from doing damage to you is to either do a power attack or bash while blocking, which both take stamina. Even after maxing out your stamina and getting perks to help conserve it, you still run out too quickly to keep bashing and power attacking, so you are guaranteed to take a hit in almost every encounter. Even more annoying is how certain enemies will kill you in one hit, even if you have decent armor and are blocking. All of that combined makes fighting any remotely tough enemy a huge pain in the ass and is not fun at all.

Sure, you could install mods to try to fix the broken combat, but most combat mods just try to add new, janky systems instead of fixing the broken mechanics that are already there. I heard that using a certain combination of mods can make the combat somewhat fun, but there is no one list that everyone uses, so you'll have to spend many hours experimenting with different combinations of mods just to get a sub-par result.

The world and exploration is cool and all, but the combat honestly ruins it for me. I guess most people just don't care about it as much."

10990,"Came back to play this after a loooooooooooong time (ended up gettin it here and on console around the same time so played it on console with my son and neglected this version).  Why is everything hidden?  No pass or bundle for all the DLCs either?  Come on Bethesda, you guys are one of my favorite studios, don't start with the shady shit.  I dont want to buy the damn SE edition and that's obviously what you are trying to get people to do."
10991,everybody loves a little rim in the morning.
10992,"I'm giving skyrim a negative review because it's approximately ten years too late to impact sales. it really is a mediocre game that doesn't live up to the literal decade of hype, though"
10993,Still holds up after being released 9 years prior
10994,yea
10995,It's ok
10996,played since 2013. this game never gets old.
10997,"great gaem 
"
10998,Basically Fallout but better with bows and swords
10999,"Open-ended. I do not even complete the DragonBorn quest anymore. I follow the Mages College of Winterhold quests to become the Arch_mage and later, build a house. I own the PC version, PS4 version and the PS4 VR version. Immersive game playing experience. Favorite game ever really."
11000,"DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION IF YOU MIGHT WANT THE DLCS IN THE FUTURE!!!
If you for some godforsaken reason have managed to end up on this page, you need to know that Skyrim SE is the version you want. This one is stupid expensive if you want the DLCs.

Skyrim SE (includes DLCs) - 40€
This version + DLCs - 60€
Extreme annoyance - Free!"
11001,Fun and interesting game.
11002,"todd howard
(laugh)"
11003,good
11004,"One of the best open world games of all time. Amazing immersion not by way of the best graphics or main storyline, but the ease of which you can wander off and pursure the quests and progression that befits your character."
11005,"Became a werewolf. Ripped off a guy's head with my bare (wolf?) hands. 

Went home to my house full of stolen potatoes and sweet rolls. Adopted kids called me Papa and gave me flowers they found as a kettle flew around the room and knocked my House-Carl in the head. 

10/10 best game ever."
11006,du bist gut
11007,based

11010,I prefer this over the special edition.

11012,Best game of all time
11013,Too short 0/10
11014,"It's not a bug, it's a feature! >:("

11018,"until the next es games comes out this is the best you are the hero, how you want to be game"
11019,Pretty good if your gonna mod it get ready for a lot of headaches
11020,"I have so many hours in this, mostly playing through community mods. I played it to the end, played every quest, played several characters and styles... and started over again with a ""legacy"" character where I have a minimum of mods installed, so I just load up and play mod after mod.  I have moved on to the newer Special Edition by using a mod to move my character face over and start again.

Live another life, mod the think until it breaks..."
11021,yea
11022,its skyrim
11023,"It just works.

"
11024,It's Skyrim. Just play it man. If you haven't already somehow.

11026,good game
11027,"I have Skyrim on basically every console, and I've beaten it on each of them with all of the achievements. After around 108 hrs, I was able to get all of the achievements. This includes some minor modding to take a break, and creating numerous characters to get a feel for my favorite combat style.

The DLC is definitely necessary, and I highly recommend it!"
11028,its TES....enough said
11029,YES.
11030,"come on, you know what this game is"
11031,The best RPG made.
11032,"It's pretty alright. Although, there's this one achievement, ""Hard Worker"", is so difficult that I have yet to do it."
11033,I love the autonomy and the high fantasy setting
11034,U KNOW WHY I LIKED IT
11035,"one of the best and immersive game out there.Was also surprisingly playable on low end device.

11062,can we fantasize whiterun as pornography creators
11063,I still haven't beat the game.  There is so much to do outside of the story it's easy to ignore it entirely.
11064,its a cracking game  lots to explore great graphics and mods too
11065,good game.
11066,"This game is still great, after a lot of years.

It allows to play widely different playstyles, roleplaying and it has a lot of content.

Very fun, one of my favourite games of all times"
11067,.
11068,It's okay
11069,Jesus needs to fuck off. Stupid Cunt
11070,по кайфу
11071,Skyrim is Skyrim
11072,Its a good game. I hope my my future kids get to play this game
11073,Bethesda at their peak. Nothing more to say except Oblivion had better factions. Take it for what it is.
11074,"Worst TES game in the series.  Boring story, even more boring gameplay (left click spam sim), class customization watered down, bland map, and no real additions made to the game since oblivion.  Why -2 IQ brainlets circlejerk this game I will never know."
11075,fun
11076,obviously
11077,"skyrim is my all time fav, some minor glitches but overall fun with mods..."
11078,NEW PLAYERS BEWARE ...... this is highly addictive you will lose track of time and will spend LOTS of time here  .......... BEWARE!!!!!
11079,pretty aight
11080,yes
11081,YES!
11082,these dragons are lookin kinda thicc ngl o.o
11083,Ok this is the best game ever made
11084,this game is pretty fun
11085,gg
11086,"A whole world of strongholds, dungeons, caves, ruins, and underworlds packed with quests."
11087,Dont Buy this game.
11088,"This game sucks, 10/10 would rec"
11089,"If you like epic lore fantasy this is a great game, I would recommend the various extensions and DLC to extended the play and enhance RPG play"
11090,Dragons
11091,Masterpiece
11092,its skyrim whats not to like. its got weapons and dragons and a lots of things to do
11093,AMAZING
11094,This is one of a handful of games that I don't think I'll ever grow tired of. Truly a masterpiece of a game with so many ways to play serious or silly.
11095,Amazing game. Always fun even after all these years
11096,yes
11097,"Still the best fighting system, especially compared to games like Witcher III and the like with their ridiculous over-complicated controls. I actually prefer Oblivion's controls to Skyrim, but Skyrim is still better than the 'targeting' systems."
11098,good
11099,"1) Free choice to make any character class/type
2) World scales to level so you can explore almost anywhere anytime but scaling does not make you feel like you are loosing power relative to the mobs in any way
3) Great stealth system if you like to play that way
4) Crafting system very powerful but dont need to use it to do well
Huge world with 100s of hours of  quests/locations to explore"
11100,haha i scream
11101,IT FEALS GREAT TO BE ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO HAVE CHEAP SKYRIM
11102,I would recommend the Insects Begone mod if you hate spiders. Also you might need to reinstall in case into sequence is buggy mess. But still quite good.
11103,"People mention this game a lot for a reason, It's really good. It pretty much set the standard for Open World games for the better part of the 2010's. I have about 500 hours in it when combined with PS3 and Switch and it's great. Play it. :)"
11104,"Fun game, you can play over and over and always have a new experience."
11105,aoeu
11106,Cool epic game if you like that sort of thing.
11107,"The freeform way you can play, as exploration ,mystery, horror or straight up combat, not to mention the sheer modabilty  of the game. after all these years i still  find surprises in the game
"
11108,
11109,Very Nice
11110,"It's most definitely not the best game in the series. But it's okay. I still think 3 and 4 were better. I'm especially angered at the lack of depth for the guilds this time around. There isn't even a fighters guild, just a weird knock-off that lasts two minutes."
11111,This game is probably my favorite game of all time. I've been playing it for years across different platforms. the game has massive amounts of room for playing a new build. The community is great and is constantly coming out with content that makes the game even better. tons of fun with lots of room for creativity and entertainment.
11112,mmm dragon :)
11113,"It is a good game. [spoiler] There is a huge spoiler at the end of the review [/spoiler] I have over 20k hours of just the saved time (and same or more of unsaved) played on my PS3 and I still haven't proceeded through the main quest line far ([spoiler] last time I've finally finished the elven manor part [/spoiler]).
However... It is very easy. Compared to the previous TES games it lacks so many things starting with quest descriptions and the whole questing process proceeding to the battle system and finishing with the  equipment management and variety of armour. They have surely improved some things but as it always is in such cases -  they've made other things worse. I'm not including the bugs and glitches here for they always were more of a funny side of the game rather than something that makes it bad or unplayable.

In conclusion I'd say it is a game worth buying but during discounts as it is - just like all the games these days - is friggin' overpriced.

Oh, also you can't purchase any longer the vanilla game or the legendary edition as due to the dev request their pages are no longer accessible in Steam. These days you only can purchase the special edition via Steam. It includes all the DLCs though, but I personally am more of a fan of the original one. That is if I can be called a fan of TES V at all.

[spoiler] And here is the biggest spoiler and the main reason why I'd actually STRONGLY NOT recommend anybody to buy this game on Steam and why I'd completely and totally recommend to either get yourself a CD with the game that does not require you to have any accounts at all or to even perhaps get it some other way (if you get what I mean): bethesda has made two huge shitty decisions after they've launched this game on 11.11.11 and they are
a) ""hey, remember those TES CS kits we were publishing before with TES III Morrowind and have made free to download for TES IV Oblivion that allowed the players make a huge amount of mods and patches to the game? Let's not make it this time! We can get all the money for ourselves with our official DLCs that would cost as much as the original game itself! Players gonna love this! Or not... But who cares what they like, right?;
b) (some years later) Allright team, the community has managed to get access to the TES V CS somehow and now there are tons of unofficial FREE DLCs out there on the web... What are we going to do with all those fuckers STEALING OUR MONEY by giving those DLCs and mods away for FREE? I know! Let's make a Creation CLub! It will unite ALL the best FREE mods and patches to the game and will be SELLING them to the players for their REAL MONEY! And to convince the dumb gamers to actually buy this shit we are going to promise them to have a 100% full compatibility with their other mods and saved games, which of course is going to be a 300% bullshit. That's a perfect scam plan! We need no effort to make a mod because someone else is going to make it, then we grab it and sell getting all the money because EULA and intellectual property still belongs to us. 0 effort 100% profit. ""It just works"". [/spoiler]

So yeah, go get this game buddy.:buzzed::cleanseal:"
11114,yes
11115,free skyrim se lmao
11116,After more or less 10 years of playing this game I keep coming back. With the mod community this game is a never ending story worth taking part in.
11117,FUS RO DAH
11118,"10/10 classic and amazing game. You can do so many things and follow so many paths. Can't abstain myself from killing the chickens. Do so, and an war will start, just that one army is the entire city of that chicken and you."

11125,its alright
11126,I love Skyrim...Best RPG ever made so far in my opinion. At least once you start Modding that is....well worth your time! I have over 1200 hours of play time and still going! Be carefull when adding Mods....add 1 at a time and test play it before adding another.
11127,"It's Skyrim, it's a decent game, although easy to get off the storyline because it's open world, so you end up in areas that are way overleveled for you at times, even on the direct path to quest objectives."
11128,Thomas the dank engine.
11129,Really good game and glitchy but thats the fun of it
11130,w
11131,"Im adimate that everyone that enjoys gaming must play skyrim at least once, all of the elder scrolls games are amazing and without a doubt, some of the greatest RPG games ever created."

11142,"when the world out there sucks, wherever I am I know that in skyrim there is always a warm fireplace waiting for me to start new adventures."
11143,"Great RGP Game, one of the best out there!"
11144,It's cool
11145,"Do not listen to all of these peasants singing the praises of this game.  The don't understand the real purpose that Skyrim serves.

Many still have this misconception that Skyrim is about going on an adventure to save the world and kill some dragons while collecting fat stacks of enchanted iron swords because loot distribution is completely FUBAR.

They are wrong.

Thanks to mods, Skyrim has transcended the boundaries of our mortal minds and has become something that was once thought to be left to our imaginations.  I sit here writing this review as I watch my dragonborn, dressed in the skimpiest of bikini-armor I could find, getting railed by Paarthurnaxs' enormous cock while enamored with the 4k snow drifts textures that I had forgotten I'd downloaded and the god-rays from my ENB filling the space between my body and his.  Sometimes I wonder if all the effort to get this working was worth it... dozens, neigh, hundreds of hours spent downloading patches and digging through page two of google search results and many obscure forums to find the fix for why my boobs are not jiggling properly, why I keep crashing after looting a dead bandit, why I keep getting error messages every time I enter breezehome.  

As I peruse the forbidden scrolls, looking for my next mod, wondering if I need to upgrade my basket textures to 4k, or if perhaps I need a new custom home, or maybe that I need a wave-defense minigame to test our my OP gear at, I see it.  A fully-fledged BDSM framework with two dozen requirements, half of which I already have.  I briefly question my sanity, do I really need this?  I already have so much content that I'll never get to... what if i have to spend another two weeks troubleshooting and tweaking configs before my game will even launch?  All these questions and many more race through my head.


I click download."
11146,"When the sky rims ;)
 only skyrim fans will understand"

11157,So many mods I cant even enter Whiterun anymore.
11158,Is good.
11159,ADDICTIVE AS HELL
11160,yes
11161,"Since page for this game is hidden for some time I doubt anybody will read this and because the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews I doubt it will change anything, but I'll nevertheless I'll post my negative review. 

Question ""Is Skyrim is a bad game?"" is a bit a question like ""Is McDonald's a bad restaurant?"". It's extremely popular, but also very mediocre, unspecialised and unchallenging. Dagerfall was almost a simulator of life in fantasy realm. Morrowind and Oblivion made a reasonable balance between technical limitations, streamlining and giving player meaningful choice in character creation. In Skyrim you don't have meaningful choices, there is almost no character creation, you can grind all stats to maximum, you can go through game without thinking and just swing whatever you can find, your stats will accomodate. 

This game is extremely disappointing as an rpg and Elder Scrolls Title. And while some people have lots of fun with it and nothing wrong with that, it's Bethesda's success, I am afraid we won't get any Elder Scrolls games similar to older, more ambitious titles."
11162,Very epic
11163,Best Open World Roleplaying game ever so far. It is the massive offer of mods that make this classic shine.
11164,tadffdsafa
11165,"with mods you can clap those cheeks of dem dragons
"
11166,"Very good gaem
"
11167,"A classic.
I would play newer editions, and mods make the game bearable.
But still shows its age in its old engine and poor mechanics."
11168,"With mods, I can play this game on my smart toaster."

11170,yes

11186,Everybody knows that Skyrim rocks lol.
11187,"I mean I don't think I could say anything about skyrim or elder scrolls games that hasn't already been said, but I've owned this title on both playstation and PC, and I seem to enjoy going back and playing this every now and again."
11188,It just works! Well for the most part. The modders  keep making this game better and better.
11189,still after all these years one of the best single player rpg around

11192,:D

11196,good
11197,"An experience (only started in 2021) like no other. When you on a main quest, you deviate so much, hours go by just by exploring or fighting a random dragon. Did I just wake up from a coma, how did this fly under my radar."

I have never been so attached to a game like this one. I've played this multiple time and done everything there is and not once been bored. Even after all the content has been explored I added mods to spice things up which was amazing. If you have never played this game and love RPG then get this game."
11203,simply great
11204,"Hey, you. You're finally aw-"
11205,its alright
11206,"Very open and has lots of things to do in it, and you can be a lot of different races, and that is just describing a little about it, so many people should play this, heck , the whole world should!"
11207,Tis good game.
11208,its good. i was compensated by bethesda for this review
11209,Instant Classic still one of the best RPGs to date.
11210,"good
"
11211,"Tem nem oq falar né, se vc n jogou vc morou numa caverna pelo último século, mas se não jogou, jogue."
11212,"This is a great example of mods making the game great. I can't play vanilla anymore, I tried.
"
11213,It's just the best....play it. :)
11214,I've played this game for a few minutes now and I think its pretty darn good
11215,"I guess everyone is well familiar with SKYRIM game, 
but if not - 
It's open world, sandbox game <= that means game invites you to do whatever you want, the way you want, when and where you want.

For me best way to relate skyrim gameplay to people not used to video games, is to say that it's computer version of running in the backyard with sticks used as swords, bows and wands.

There is main story line, but it's so short that if you will do it as soon as possible, you will frogot about it existence at all.

So since now We all agree on what skyrim is - let's quick wrap up pros and cons of the game 

1. gameplay - 
it's little bulky, as expected of 10 years old game, but with mods it can be refreshed to meet modern standards.
2. Story - like i said in introduction, the best story in skyrim is one that you will create and enjoy by yourself, main story line is not too important, therefore i will not elaborate on why you shouldn't kill parthurnaax
3.music - is great.
4. graphics - same like gamplay bulki, but with mods can be refreshed to look great.

yea so...guess you should try out by yourself."
11216,"One of my favorite games, Skyrim offers a ton of content, even in the base game. With the addition of greats mods from the community(Nexus & Workshop), the amount of time you can spend i this game is unlimited."
11217,I have always heard about this game and seen so many memes on youtube and facebook but always thought it was not worth playing so just played souls games since they looked similar to this game. but after playing being the same type of games for the past few years i decided to play skyrim and now i have been playing 104 hours of this in a span of 1 week and i love this game! its so addictive and so fun! you can do so much in this game and explore so many places and ppl! you can go at your own pace leveling up isnt that hard a bit grindy but worth while! im not even done with the base game and i cant wait to play the dlcs! i love how you can postpone the main quest and just get lost in the world and lore of this game by going to side quest and talking to solders the jarl and civilians or even reading books. the only thing that this game is missing is multiplayer and being able to ride dragons if those 2 things were possible this game would be the perfect game i swear its huge bucket of fun! i RECOMMEND THIS to anyone who loves to explore  and is into the souls games and the dungon and dragons type of games heck even if your into that this is your game! 10/10!
11218,"Its skyrim one of the best games ever made duhh
"
11219,"Todd Howard demands your sacrifice, Todd Howard demands you buy Skyrim on all your consoles, Todd Howard is now your god, and Skyrim is the only game you play"
11220,it good
11221,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim — this is a new life. A world where you can be a thief, a robber, a hired killer — or you can go to save the universe from the impending mystical threat. Or not to go, to forget about everything and just settle down in a small cozy house in the northernmost point of Tamriel, to start a family. It is important to understand that there are no restrictions. Developers don't interfere in your affairs, but they give you a million opportunities. This is a real ROLE-playing game in the most correct sense of the word.
Skyrim attracts with its chic game universe with a long history; thoughtful and interesting quests with a lot of references; an amazing game world and countless more tricks.
This game has left a pleasant impression on the soul forever. 💗"
11222,Yes
11223,Play it
11224,good game
11225,piss
11226,Love this game! So many possibilities and combinations.
11227,"Still my favorite rpg! I can get lost for hours doing the simplest of things, like chasing butterflies lol

10/10 Masterpiece!"
11228,What's there to say really. Just play it!
11229,This game feels like home. 10/10
11230,"Skyrim is the most perfect game in the entire universe, zero problems or bugs whatsoever. Only intended features, yes indeed. No exploits, no bugs, no glitches- only the most perfect and absolutely intended features from our glorious overlord Todd Howard himself. An absolutely beautiful game where you can become a magic using lightning addict, or perhaps a potion popping physical berserker, or perhaps even the ABSOLUTELY incredibly rare stealth archer. You can kill dragons and save the world, or settle for robbing and murdering everyone you can find. 10/10, best most excellent perfect game ever created, no need for any improvement at all. Perfection incarnate."
11231,One of the best Games I ever played!
11232,Best game of all time.
11233,Awesome!
11234,"Let me guess...

Someone stole your sweetrolls?"
11235,"You have used this product through Steam Family Sharing, but you must own it in order to post a review."
11236,It's Skyrim.
11237,skyrim
11238,"It's old, but it's still as great as it was when it released, even better with mods."
11239,murdering dragons is fun
11240,get it
11241,yes
11242,"ilove this game
"
11243,"cmon man, it's skyrim.

Sucks that they hid this version so people spend $20 more, both are great but if you can't really run the SE version, try this one out."
11244,in ways its not as good as the rest of the elder scrolls games but still a game i love and would recomend :)
11245,"It's a fun game. That's it. It's not particularly good, but it's really fun. I like it :)"
11246,"Skyrim is one of those fabled games that everyone talks about, and it may be daunting to get into because of all the talk around it. It goes down as a classic for this genre, and while sometimes it doesn't just work, it has enough elements that even now in 2021 I still can play for hours on end and enjoy myself."
11247,"Hands down the greatest game of all time.
"
11248,Great game that I can't seem to stop playing and always return to for entertainment!
11249,"Good way to pass the time. Flexible gameplay for any adventurer be it stealth, magic or head-to-head brawling. Mod versatility is great whether you want immersive story or something off the wall and unrelated to the story setting."
11250,Great game! I'm still playing it (SE version though) years later :)
11251,"Game is fun, but it's a damn shame Bethesda hid this version from Search"
11252,Timeless classic.
11253,shits gas
11254,proof that a game doesnt have to be good to be good
11255,"Cant wait for The Elder Scrolls VI . If its even 60% of this game i will love it. Nice questing, skilling, alchemy, combat, magic, everything <3"
11256,it is a great game because it has a big open world and can level up your character and fight to save skyrim from the dragons that fly around and attack you because you are dragonborn. and you absorb the dragonsouls to unlock dragonshouts and use them along your journey as you level up. also you can make your own armor and upgrade them to make them stronger and makes it  easier to kill the bad guys.  and because the game never ends so you can keep playing and playing to your hearts content.
11257,This is the way
11258,"Still one of the best games ever made. This game is over 9 years old and even playing it unmodded is still overly entertaining.
Lore, landscapes and locations are rich, the skilltrees are easy to understand and the combat system is gold. Aside a few little buggs this game has to be rated 11/10 and can be recommended even nearly a decade after it's release."
11259,dialogue simulator
11260,Brilliant RPG!
11261,"just a good game innit

11266,"it's freakin skyrim, its epic"
11267,"I was convinced to get this Legacy Edition of Skyrim (henceforth referred to as LE) rather than the Special Edition (SE) in part because supposedly it was better for modding- more mods available or something. While it is true that there is a larger quantity of mods for LE, basically all the most popular ones have been ported to SE or have better SE equivalents, SE has a lot more new mods, and a significant number of the highly anticipated mods in development will be exclusive to SE.  So no, this is not actually the best version for modding.

I see people mentioning the cost as a reason to go for LE rather than SE. As I'm writing this, SE is on sale for $15 (which happens multiple times a year) whereas LE is $20 without dlc and never goes on sale because it's unlisted. Put SE on your wishlist, get notified when it's on sale, and you can have it for cheaper than LE.

If your computer is too old to run SSE though, this is a good option. My old laptop could run it."
11268,yes
11269,^
11270,Alright game.
11271,Fuxckin godly story. skyrim should be a religon
11272,It's a sick game. You know that. Everyone knows it. It's almost like it's one of the most popular and beloved games of all time..

11278,"Great game for those looking to get into rpg games, it's simple enough to learn easily but still in depth enough to be fun."
11279,Dope
11280,There are so many variations in the gameplay. I have enjoyed all the Elder Scrolls series games and Skyrim is right up there with the best.
11281,okay
11282,"cmon, its skyrim"
11283,Very realistic & can do things on your own....and has the magic to it that seems very real too...and less menu driven too.
11284,"you can lose all your equipment because the game isnt done right, a mission didnt give me all my gear back and really dissapoints. Will not continue playing it"
11285,yee
11286,"Amazing game play and story-line, exactly my style of game."

11291,Great Game what a classic and personal favorite
11292,10 years have passed and its still the best modding game
11293,"With it's great story line and exquisite gameplay, not to mention the myriads of side quests and objectives, Skyrim will have you playing for hours into the night."

Todd Howard was in the Chess Club!"
11303,Coming back to Skyrim is like coming back to that old show you loved as a child. You never forget that magic that enthralled you and sucked you into the world.

11313,fun game with heaps of mod suppourt
11314,clasix
11315,What to say about skyrim... It's one of the best games ever made for any fantasy enthusiasts. A must buy.
11316,"Bethesda is reason I don't hold Cyberpunk 2077 bugs against CDPR.
Every game ever made by Bethesda has been some of the most unreliable buggy trash.
It's a running joke in the speed running community that the most challenging part of the game is finishing it without a total crash.

Physics are terrible. Books fly off tables. Animals bounce into the sky. People float up walls, back down again, then speed run through the street.
Have a dragon attack during a conversation and get blocked from continuing the mage's college.
Try to walk instead of fast travel and find you can't even make it from Riverwood to Sky Haven temple... your companions get confused and glitch out along the way.

The Elder Scrolls world is interesting, to be sure, but as always packaged in some of the nastiest game code on planet earth."
11317,I'd say one of the most interesting games I ever played
11318,Its a great game on its own and even better with Mods. There's a reason people still play it because it holds up pretty well after such a long time
11319,Its Skyrim....
11320,Fuck Todd Howard
11321,It's good.
11322,lightning spells are cool

11328,yuh
11329,"This game may be almost 10 years old now, but it's still endlessly fun, endlessly moddable, and with all of the different ways of playing through combat you're guaranteed to always end up as a stealth archer. HAIL THE DARK BROTHERHOOD"
11330,skrrt skrrt DRAGONS
11331,fun but buggy
11332,very good yes very good
11333,Its Elder Scrolls nuff said
11334,It A great game!!! Its even better with mods !!
11335,"I may have saved the world from dragons, vampires, teddy bears and politics, but nothing beats any of these things:
-Getting smashed into space after stealing some mammoth cheese from a giant.
-Killing goats by shouting.
-Being hunted down by the whole world after accidentally running over a chicken!
-Collecting [b]ALL THE CABBAGES[/b]!
-Drowning Whiterun in cheese wheels :)"
11336,Truly the most fun i've had in years. Ive done everything about 10 time over and had even more fun with mods.
11337,Im enjoying.
11338,Best game ever mads
11339,"Gamer Rating: Legendary. 

I don't get surprised much, but when i hear there's somebody who hasn't played this game.. It's hard not to stare at them. 

One of the greatest games of all time."

11344,best elder scrolls ever i hope they make another btw dont get greymore its ass
11345,Uh. This game is the mighty sauce. No doubts.
11346,one of the best
11347,"this is an awesome game to get away from the norm, I recommend it."
11348,Really fun. Better with mods though.

11353,its amazing
11354,It's a shame this is no longer available and they are trying to force Skyrim SE.  SE is a horrible alternative
11355,classic and great game. many ways to play.
11356,It's Skyrim. Of course get it. It's great. It's for anyone. You'll love it.
11357,"   I love Skyrim, cant wait for a Skyrim 2"
11358,Yes.
11359,It is one of the kings of gaming for a reason.
11360,"Get this version over the SE if you play on a potato (like me!). 

Also, make sure to memorize the opening dialogue by heart. Otherwise, you aren't really playing skyrim enough..."
11361,FUS RO DAH!
11362,Best Game of the year  in 2011
11363,"Personally speaking, I regard it as one of the best games of all time and a new milestone setter for its genre in 2011. Special praise in addition for opening it up to the modding community with its creation kit (could not find it anymore though [?]). Mods complete this game in so many wonderful ways. A great thank you to all modders as well!"
11364,BEST GAME EVER
11365,"its skyrim, if you dont already own it at least on 6 different devices by now. you probably live under a rock"
11366,good
11367,shame this copy is hidden because of special edition same experience thought
11368,I'm an olde fart who has been playing video games since it started. I give this game a ten star rating!
11369,"addictive 
Love the open world 
Love all the side quests and ability to just endlessly capture butterflies
The opposite of railroaded  - only the first 10 minutes of gameplay are scripted, then the rest is OPEN"
11370,"I love skyrim, Hopefully you will too..."
11371,very gud
11372,fun
11373,"can be a furry
رءع/10"
11374,I cannot believe you can die by falling off the stairs! I think in real life I wouldn't die falling at that height. I found it funny for the first time but the second and third made me angry! On the other hand I even enjoyed picking up the flowers and thanks to the mods there were plenty of them.
11375,It just works
11376,The original is the best!!!
11377,Really fucking FUN!
11378,good obvsies
11379,"          To praise this game would be beyond redundancy and one need not be reassured of its perfection as it merely stands as a testament to the unfaltering wisdom of Todd Howard whom I have not lost faith in. 

           Many among the flock have been led astray. they slander the good name of Todd and fail to see that he is merely testing us. we have become blinded by the earthly myth of perfection and he merely wants to show us our own folly. but soon the day of reckoning will down and Todd Howard will ascend once again and purify what is impure and clean what is unclean and those that kept faith in him will have their hearts filled with joy and those who doubted him will be consumed by Todds wrath and he will then plant himself in the ashes of the old world and sprout into a magnificent tree and we his disciples will build a new world with his mighty roots as a foundation and his tender leaves as shelter and from his vines we will suckle his sweet nectar and eat of his tasty fruits and the seeds of these fruits will be planted and from them will sprout new elder scrolls games and all will live in peace and harmony. 

      Praise unto Todd.

11380,"Supposedly there's a story in this game but I like playing the ""Install Mod, CTD, Fix Mods, repeat"" game"
11381,FRESH MEAT!!!
11382,i dont even own this why can i review it
11383,I have played this for nearly 800 hours. So I would recommend it.
11384,"This game is crazy fucking good and is a must play for anyone, and is prefectly priced unlike its upgraded brother"
11385,yessirr
11386,yeah
11387,"Still holds up after a decade, and the avid modding community makes the game even better."
11388,Great modding community.
11389,"400 hours, hundreds of mods and i still haven't beat the main story.

10/10 would get attacked by macho man dragons again"
11390,"Skrim is the best, its like minecraft with curves!"
11391,"I like this game because of the overall open world, minus loading screens. (Unless you use the no more loading screens mod) I love to mod PC games because it adds a lot of aspects to the games that are made. I think modding is an important part of EXPERIENCING a game and can improve everything a game has to offer. 
I love Skyrim because when modded it can be STUNNING and adds SO SO much customization that Bethesda Sadly didn't include. 
Lets say you don't want to mod the game but still wanna play, DON'T! Hah, i'm just kidding...you can still enjoy the story that this game has to offer. Along with the leveling and different character builds. 
Overall I would give Skyrim a 9 out of 10 - Modding and All."
11392,"Awesome game, I forgot to review after all these years."
11393,its skyrim. do you live under a rock?
11394,"good game, play enderal"
11395,"I feel like the more and more I play this game and mod it the more and more I break it and experience strange scenes... such as a random drunk man running into then dancing in a ""hidden"" room and talking about random items I found on the floor in the middle of a quest. I highly prefer this over ""Special Edition"" Skyrim. It's amazing."
11396,"Skyrim is beautiful and is probably my most favorite game of all time. It has tons of quests and places to explore. You can choose any life, or just be a sneak-thief archer. ;)"
11397,probably one of the best games.
11398,"Not glitchy at all, 10/10 stars."
11399,You can almost walk on walls. 10/10
11400,Still just as good as the day I bought it can still recommend it if you wanna hop in an easily modifiable rpg with a fleshed out world

11410,"its good
"
11411,Great game
11412,I would very highly recommend this game! Be warned there is mature content.
11413,"Skyrim is an awesome way to pass the time, there is endless things to do, quests, sidequests, or just walking round the map is enjoyable enough. Ran into glitches a couple times so its probably best to check you dont leave quests with glitches too long, especially the main quest otherwise it could fuck u up a bit later on in the game. Overall the game looks really good and there is a lot you can learn about the storyline which is interesting. Probably one of the best games."
11414,COOL
11415,"This is the next chapter of The Elder Scrolls, Skyrim expands on what Oblivion had to offer Skyrim is as big as it needs to be you will never feel that the world feels to small the world is big open and a rich."
11416,"Its Skyrim. If you haven't played it yet, you should."
11417,This is game. playing.
11418,Never gets old.

11420,My only complaint is that I've spent so much time coming back to this game.

To allow our godly world to finally be free from the tyranny of the great beast Rhett. Praise me, your saviour."

11430,Best. Game. Ever!
11431,dont play this game
11432,A glitch swapping tall tale game.
11433,Modrim.
11434,"Look Todd, I bought Skyrim ok please let me see my wife and kids ."
11435,"[h1]Yeah yeah, mods mods mods, whatever. Here's the real questions you're probably looking for:[/h1]

[h1]Can this game be fun without mods?[/h1]

Answer: Yes, but you really [i]really[/i] should still install the Unofficial Patch.

[h1]Can this game be fun with mods?[/h1]

Answer: Yes, but the longer you go modding the game up and down, and seeing that most of your mods may be [i]fixing[/i] the game rather than adding to it, you may eventually realize how much potential this game could have had, and how little Bethesda and Zenimax actually care for the Elder Scrolls in general. 

[h1]To anyone who hasn't purchased this game yet...[/h1]

You've probably seen all the titty mods on youtube, all the stupid tiktok and oblivion NPC memes. But is this actually a good game to play? I've [i]recommended[/i] this game to you, the reader, as someone who has put in over 1100 hours into Skyrim on the Xbox 360 (no mods, pure vanilla). I've only recommended this game because I think it [i]actually is[/i] a decent playthrough on vanilla. Play this crap, explore the different classes and combinations, play through all the questlines and [i]do everything without mods... until you get bored.[/i] But heed this advice: [b]don't expect much for a game released in 2011 after being put on the back-burner for Fallout.[/b] I've spent so many hours searching for mods, installing mods, being frustrated at mods, and even making some small mods. It's a whole other Skyrim. But damn, the original game could have had a lot more love to it. Definitely. I love the fun I had playing vanilla, I adore and applaud the effort from the modding community into everything they've done to compound the fun, and I am [i]pissed off[/i] to no end at the fact that Bethesda seems to want to out a garbage MMO like ESO, then consider themselves ""done"" with The Elder Scrolls for the decade. Skyrim by itself is barely a playable game, and it isn't much a step up (graphically or gameplay-wise) over Oblivion. The next Elder Scrolls game should have much higher standards than this.

[h1]Something else you should really know before buying...[/h1]

There are (at least) three main editions of Skyrim because Bethesda loves to milk this decade-old dead cow. There's Skyrim: Special Edition, and there's the original ""Oldrim"" OG Skyrim, released in 2011, and there's Skyrim Anniversary Edition with all the Creations and other boring crap. I won't ramble about the differences between each version, but if you want to get into modding this game, just know that 

1) Oldrim has been removed from the Steam store at the request of Bethesda, but you can still access it through a Google search
2) You cannot run Oldrim on a PC that doesn't support 32bit 
2) You should pick between OG Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition, as it will affect what mods you can install. Generally, Skyrim SE or AE is a better choice at this point (April 2022) but just know that a lot of the OG mods (save for the more popular ones) won't run on SE or AE unless there's a port made.

Alright there it is, go have fun"
11436,"ABSOLUTELY fantastic and worth every penny and a great time killer

11439,FUS!
11440,It's 2021 and i'm playing this game for the first time ever.  Love it
11441,Amazing game endless missions and You have the ability to choose what happens so you can make the entire game change buy killing someone early or as simple as stealing a apple from a merchant

11444,todd howard dont hurt my family please.
11445,its skyrim what more can u say
11446,"Over 1000 hours in this game and I'm still finding new things in it, places, quests, just little random tidbits hiding in the landscape; and I really enjoy it.  I appreciate that an older game can still hold my interest even though I overall know what's going on.  The leveling system gives you many ways to play,  and its easy to take your time or go quickly as you prefer.  Will always be one of my go-to games, no matter how old it gets!"
11447,"great even years later
"

11454,"This game is incredible, this is 100% my favorite game of all time, it is incredible, surprisingly great graphics, and awesome gameplay. I've done so many of the campains and i love them all. I don't even like open world games, but this is an exception. If you havn't played this already. DO IT. It is so worth it."

11463,"Progression of a Skyrim player.

Part 1. 
New Elder scrolls you say, sure I'll snaffle the snack.

Part 2.
Well I guess another mouthful can't hurt.

Part 3.
Hundreds of hours in, and hundreds of snaffled mouthfuls of Bethesda's finest, you are now incapable of moving, your being is merged with your desk in an un-holy amalgamation of flesh, shoddily painted MDF, snack crumbs, and spittle. You turn in panic, realising the years that have passed, a cry escaping your lips, but your wife lies dead at your feet, eaten by the cat. Sugary tears, laced in MSG roll down your gargantuan frame with the dawn of your reality. Screaming you thrash. Screaming you flail. But your efforts are in vain. Todd Howard has you. Todd Howard will not let another flee. 

With a Herculean effort though you tear from your desk, crashing to the floor in a terrible fit. Paw over paw, your fat digits clamber, desperate for the door, desperate for salvation, desperate for a bath and low fat diet...seriously though, you smell like someone wiped week old bacon over a public restroom floor and used it for cologne. But within reach of the handle you hear his voice....it's Todd! You turn and he's there, shimmering like some Daedric trickster, there he cackles, his arms wide in mocking embrace. And where do you think you're going his eyes cry out....not from Todd. Never from Todd. You turn to lunge for salvation, but your hand is struck with DLC after DLC. But you are strong...aren't you. You mustn't look. Then a slap on your leg fells you and you roll to see the Special, ultra, legendary Edition, now with 3000 hours of extra content, and at no extra cost....new horse armour. OH GOD WHY WON'T YOU LET ME LIVE your mind howls, but it's too late. Your protestations ring hollow in your own fleeting consciousness as Skyrim claims you again. The warmth. The calming, familiar warmth. It is...happiness.

And you smile.

And you smile. 

And you smile. 

And you smile. 

And you smile."
11464,"The quest never end until I took an arrow to the knew, and them I became the dragon born"
11465,A very well balanced game with plenty of story and styles for everyone. This game has no exploits!!
11466,best open world game i have ever played
11467,Fun Game and fun to mod. It may be an older game but the replay value is unreal.
11468,if you need to hear how amazing this game is then you've prolly been hiding under a rock
11469,"Play This game
"
11470,I used to be an adventurer like you
11471,i would ask people to play this any time
11472,eh
11473,it's kinda fun i guess
11474,one of the greatest open world games of all time
11475,This Game is fun and is fun to mod as well.
11476,Good Game
11477,Why buy this when the special is out
11478,Is good game
11479,"takes far too long to make any progress, even paid for dawndarg expantion witch sucked because it has too many gliches. 381 hours waisted on this game.."
11480,Been playing this game for half my life and I still play it and love it to this day. You will never run out of things to do and explore. The mod community is enormous as well.
11481,Longer you play it the better it
11482,"Seemingly infinite world, with great artwork good story lines and all round fun to play"
11483,An absolute classic!

11487,"This could be the most longest game I ever played. It can go on and never end, with all the MOD's in the work shop. OMG I LOVE THIS GAME!!!"
11488,good game
11489,Nice x2
11490,
11491,"good for unplugging your brain for hours.

11492,very nice
11493,Easily one of the best RPGs ever made. The replayability is insane.
11494,it good
11495,yes.
11496,"guys its elder scrolls come on :D
"
11497,gaemrt
11498,Not a lot to do.
11499,Its Skyrim
11500,One of the greatest games ever created.
11501,"its been out 10 years, yeah its amazing"
11502,This is a very good game.
11503,ok
11504,"Swing a sword, shoot a gun from cover or stab someone in the back. Solo or with follower. Choose your play style. Kill dragons or get killed by them. Go fishing... by swimming after them. Explore. Do nothing but stare at a beautiful screen made by... Use magic. Best yet... use mods! Create an experience unique and loved by ONLY YOU! For you are alone. Everything else is programming."
11505,Oblivion and Skyrim are still some of the better RPG out there.
11506,good game
11507,"Excellent Game with so many options. A must play for anyone, (teen and up)"
11508,good
11509,.
11510,"Best game ever any platform 5/5

11511,"Nearly 10 years old and I still want to play it.
Guess I could recommend it too."
11512,its ight
11513,died
11514,"Amazing gameplay
"
11515,It's Skyrim. What else?
11516,Good RPG
11517,this gam is gud you shold pla
11518,"Possibly the best RPG game I've ever played. Mods make the experience enjoyable and ""immersive""..."
11519,so goooodddd
11520,"It's a classic, not much else to be said about it. If you don't know what skyrim is yet then you've been living under a nordic tomb since 2011. If you don't know a lot then prepare for a lot of bugs, but also a lot of fun and a great modding community."
11521,gud
11522,"If you haven't played skyrim by now you're living under a rock, buy it play it love it."
11523,"This game is still the best game ever made, years and years after it was actually released. The amount of mod support also means you have an almost infinite amount of additional weapons, armour, quests and areas to explore for free. The quest arc's are well written and fun, with the land being interesting to explore. The amount of world building in this game blows my sock's off every time I play, and the amount of random extra stuff you can do just astounds me; like getting married and adopting kids. Skyrim makes it a pleasure to do things that in any other game would be boring montonous tasks; grinding smithing, mining, collecting ore, collecting herbs, walking from point A to B, etc... 

Honestly, there is a reason I have this game on every console, and every version (VR and SE) at least once - I have hundreds of hours on this game combined, and it never gets boring. To be honest, if you play games you need to play this at least once because it's such a classic. It is my favourite fantasy universe ever created (LOTR and GOT included), and I would 100% recommend!"
11524,"fun to play, cool story, lots of availability for mods"
11525,11/10
11526,very enjoyable! I have played this game for years I am still finding quests I haven't done and dragons to slay. :)
11527,dragon go burrrrrr
11528,Its Skyrim
11529,"Amazing game, still relevant today"
11530,this game is pretty good
11531,"Buggy shit show, still 10 years after release.  Mods are the only reason to still play this game."
11532,no.
11533,yes
11534,Dogshit console game
11535,ooooo
11536,"The best RPG of all time.  We need to the next chapter to come out, this game is like 10 years old now!   If you want to play this, use the mods.  Graphics and many aspects of the game can be improved with them."
11537,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the gold standard of open world adventure RPGs.  Even after over nine years.  If you have not played it, I think it's time."
11538,"9 years old and still a great game that holds up, I only got around to playing this game finally in the last year and it has helped me while away may hours of covid lockdown.
Classless character development and open world gameplay gives you a feel of really making your own story in Tamriel. 
Definitely worth playing if like me you'd never quite gotten around to giving it a go."
11539,"As a game i have loved for the last several years of my life, i can do nothing but recommend this game to anyone who hasnt yet played it. my only issue is that even though the game is 10 years old this year, they still havent fixed major bugs in the game, opting to instead slap the game onto anything that can be remotely called a gaming console..."
11540,very good game i like because it is very good and epic i like it alot because it is good and poggers thank you developers i love you because this game is good very nice i like it its cool
11541,000
11542,its skyrim
11543,"Fun adventure game.  Slaying dragons, using spells, and medieval weapons. If you are an Elder Scrolls snob you might be wary, other than that I think most people would enjoy."
11544,Yes.
11545,"SKYRIM SCHMYRIM....

if you hurt a chicken you get hunted till you die...
if you steal a sweetroll.... you get hunted till you die....
if you do anything remotely ""bad"" you get hunted till you die...

other than that, you can enjoy the oh so many gamebreaking bugs and mods till you're drop dead tired...
probably spent 4k+ hours on my old xbox on this game.... 

rating: 2/10

not enough death's from random things"
11546,Awesome game 10/10 especially with hearthfire
11547,i like skyrim girl bobs
11548,"A classic in gameplay and content. There are more hours of gameplay from the modding community than I'd be able to complete in my lifetime. So with this, I want to send out a giant thank you to the entire modding community, from the coders, the writers, the modellers and artists and the beta testers. You guys have eaten (let's just say), more than a few hours from lounging time.

Thanks all for all of the hard work"
11549,"I enjoy the format, well planned."
11550,"I lost my childhood in this game.
Extreme modding potential.
Works good (besides some Betheda-isms) in 2021 even !

20/10 would recommend."
11551,it's skyrim.
11552,sexy dragons
11553,Yes
11554,yup
11555,great game. modding makes it better.
11556,I don't wanna write a review
11557,"Worth playing 100 %. It might be an old game, the main story is short, but with mods it's truly exceptional. I love this community. Entire teams are working on giant projects like skyblivion and skywind, that already look absolutely stunning! And they will be accessible entirely for free!

Overall vanilla Skyrim is 8/10 from me 
with DLC's it's 9/10
With mods - 11/10"
11558,REALLY GOOD GAME
11559,"My absolute favorite game of all times!! The perfect game!  Highly recommend for those into dragons, magic, elves and adventure!"
11560,No words.
11561,
11562,peepeepoopoo
11563,yuo
11564,"Make a character, beat the intro, choose a direction, and walk.

This game is fantastic. I've spent countless hours caught up in walking through the vast land of Skyrim, losing myself in the tall mountains and deep forests. The game is at its best when you travel off the beaten road and explore the world around you. Its this kind of game that has the potential to become more, and transition from ""a game"" to ""your own personal experience""."
11565,"can't bang the dragons
3.5/10"
11566,I enjoyed it quite a bit.
11567,its a fun single person game
11568,Oh lord the mods.
11569,yeah its a pretty good game easy to mod and a lot of mods out there
11570,fusoduh? its the best i has it in every console
11571,w
11572,it bangs
11573,My familiar is named Dave
11574,pee poo
11575,...
11576,Simply SUGOI! The best RPG in my opnion.
11577,"I've played this game all my life and I love it. It has many MANY flaws, but I even love the flaws. You may hate it, and I get that. But I would recommend that you give it a shot.   (FYI: This game is also made by the people who made fallout if you didn't know)"
11578,Sell your soul to Todd and give in to the all consuming power that is
11579,"best game ever
"
11580,"IT CORRUPTED HOPEFULLY I FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
11581,"Best game I've ever played. It never gets boring and even if you 'finish' it, there are plenty of mods to keep you entertained. If you're still hestitating to buy it: don't. It truly is an unique masterpiece.

+ Great main storyline with loads of smaller side quests
+ Doesn't require a beefy computer to run it
+ THE SOUNDTRACK!

- There are some bugs, but most of them can be easily fixed"
11582,"Skyrim is that kind of games where you feel like a childhood. it is so calm to be here , like at home."
11583,You’ll be a lot happier with buying this game and a belly full of mead!
11584,Yes
11585,the best game ever made
11586,It took me about 100 hours to even start the main quest
11587,"I've played this game for years across all platforms, logging hours upon hours of game play. I have never grown old of this game. I can only hope that generations after me will love it and care for it the same. the amount of depth you can put into the game is insane if you know how to work mods."
11588,there isn't much to be said. everyone knows this game is a classic that has been around for a while. if you're on the fence about buying this game then just cough up the $20 that they're asking. If you haven't played this game yet you're missing out
11589,.
11590,best walking simulator ever
11591,Very good my friend
11592,Amazing game. Open world and everything. It's a really good game for someone who love to play open world games. Even tough it's 10yrs old. It holds up super well. Looks like a game from 2016-2017.
11593,everyone knows this game... if you dont own it you should. if not... just check all the mods you can get :)
11594,"good game
"
11595,"This game has been around for a decade and people still play it with enthusiasm. Not much else needed to justify a positive rating, right?"
11596,Degenerates like you belong on a cross
11597, A+++++++++
11598,Very good rpg
11599,The game plays horrible on PC.  My character freezes and continually has a jerking motion when moving and the weapons dont work correctly due to the weird movements.
11600,"best game na
"
11601,"Beautiful, open-world, non-linear, freeeedom! And a ton to explore. And mod. Perfect fantasy rpg."
11602,I may not have many hours here but on SSE i have 300 hours I just didn't have the dlc speaking of the dlc https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/211720/ https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/220760/ https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/226880/
11603,Skyrim is a fulfilling and very open ended RPG experience. On its own the game provides a thorough experience in the Elder Scrolls worldspace as well as a broad range of quests and playthrough options to keep you involved for potentially years.
11604,"GOOD

"
11605,"One of the best games I've ever played.

Lets be honest here. If you haven't played it by this point, you probably never will. Easy 10/10. Have recommended it numerous times."
11606,"It has been years and it never got old, if possible It became more fun and engaging to me as I learned more about the Elder Scrolls and the story behind it."
11607,ysolda
11608,Best game ever made! But we all know this already.
11609,ye still good after 8+ years.
11610,Todd got me to buy this game 6 times.
11611,"One of the most legendary RPGs in existence, with hundreds of hours of content. I've played this game many times on console, and on here, i've played it again with mods. Modding on this version can be hard, but this version has some incredible mods that make it worth the effort. 10/10, even better with mods."
11612,Definitely one of the best games that I've played and constantly play to this day. Gives me so many memories from when my sister first got the game and we took turns playing it on the Xbox 360. Highly recommend this game for anyone who loves open world games
11613,sword
11614,"The Elder Scrolls stopped being interesting around Morrowind. First, let me point out the game looks nothing like these screenshots. NOTHING.

Second, the game is still glitchy. Third, the story and quests are nonsense.

What keeps this series going are diehard fans that share a sense of the futility in playing the games, and the deep pockets of the parent company to buy awards. There's nothing here worth spending your time on. An absolute horrible gaming experience."
11615,alaaa
11616,"\\NOT A BAD GAME PLEASE READ//

Whilst this game is great, I wouldn't purchase this version anymore.. 

Skyrim will run fine but I can guarantee you'll run into issues at some point, I've had numerous bugs that completely ruin progression in the story not going to hint as to what part of the story in-case you've never played the game (Yes some people still haven't played this somehow...). But cutting straight to the point there are numerous bugs surrounding stability in this game, audio in the open world often stutters and gates randomly completely ruining the immersion. I've also had issues with objects randomly flying everywhere when you enter rooms.

- Either way spend your money on Skyrim: Special Edition its more stable and a better purchase if you're looking to play the game."
11617,Better than the updated version. The community has encredible mods.
11618,yeah its skyrim
11619,fun
11620,"Dude, it's skyrim"
11621,Better than cyberpunk
11622,Great game with excellent missions and no bugs or glitches at all. Only features.
11623,veru good
11624,still great all these years later
11625,ye
11626,Love it!
11627,"This is my favorite game of all time. It was the first game I ever played on Xbox, and when I built my PC it was one of the two first games I downloaded instantly. I'd love for there to be a new, updated version with better graphics, but the mods work well."
11628,yes
11629,"One of the best games I've ever played. I always still come back to it. Mostly because Elder Scrolls Online isn't my forte, but I do love the open world and the gorgeous scenery as well as the secrets, all the side quests, main quests, always something to do, explore, or discover!"
11630,yum
11631,"It's a game full of adrenaline, keeping you on the edge of your seat"
11632,"Skyrim so big and full of lore
I heard something, I could have sworn
A cock pumping, behind this door
Oh no, a twig - it breaks, I mourn
For my ass virginity, it is no more
this a horny mister dragonborn          (LOL)

-Yeah Great Review By Conny 
_Also, did you know I'm currently single?!?! Yup that's right. So? You want to sex, Ok - take a friend invite to me and i will have so much frickertime with you.... that is so hot


Yeah Skyrim - Good Game.. Cap FPS to 60 and voila no bugs LOL! Lots Of Content - Lots of Women, No sex though, But I'm Sure There is Mods for That. Also The story,, better than most hentais to be perfectly honest

"
11633,ONE OF GODS PERSONAL FAVORITE GAMES!!!!!
11634,"Awesome game with lots of replay value, endless strategies and alternative approaches"
11635,a true classic. Somehow still relevant... almost 10 years later.
11636,"For a first/third person fantasy RPG game, it's quite fun and I'm glad that modding the game is fairly simple with the vortex launcher, as this allowed me to mod out blood and spooders. (I don't like either. Although for blood, my reasoning is because it's not necessary to make a good video game. The only blood I kept with the mod is when you do a hit to an enemy, this is for convenience sake so that I can see if I hit the enemy or not with my strike or arrow shot)

Originally, I bought this game to play the mod Skyrim Together with my friends, but then we never played it, so I finally decided to get my moneys worth and force myself to play through this game's main quest line just so that it wasn't a waste and collecting (digital) dust in my steam library."
11637,Best game ever
11638,g  o  o  d
11639,"This is the only Elder Scrolls game I've played, so it's easy to say that it's the best. 
It has a ton of high quality mods that can easily crash your game, but everyone needs to see Thomas the Tank Engine gliding through the skies and breathing fire in their lifetime. I've easily put in 80hrs in this game before my laptop grew too old to keep up with games, but I'm looking to repurchase it when it goes on sale on Switch.
I'd recommend this game to literally anyone, especially people like me who dislike skill-based games, where I can just turn enemies into chickens and make myself a Finger Lickin' Good™ Meal. Yum. 10/10."
11640,"WOW. This was my first time ever playing this game.(yeah, I know) My friend had been singing it's praises for years and I finally got it. My expectations were high, but they were blown away."
11641,"I don't think I will ever understand why Skyrim is so popular. 

[list]
[*] It's incredibly buggy. There are endless videos on Youtube showcasing the severe bugs, including people who complete the game very quickly by abusing glitches. I've had several Skyrim fans tell me that the bugs are one of the GOOD things about the game because they're funny - like that would ever fly with any other game. 
[*] The map is huge but [b]empty[/b]. I spent hours exploring the wilderness only to come across a few generic bandit camps and a random cave or two. Any town or village that is not a main city feels incredibly empty with taverns containing just a bartender and a sad little bard sitting in the corner playing for nobody.  
[*] None of the NPCs are compelling. They all have one or two lines of dialogue that they repeat over and over and all the ""main"" NPCs have cardboard personalities. It's hard to take characters seriously when you can literally steal the clothes from their body and watch them continue to walk around repeating their bland voiceline completely stark naked. 
[*] Quest lines are generic and unrewarding. I remember completing the thieves guild quest line which results in you being made head of the guild. There's nothing you can actually do after becoming the leader, and some of the guild members even still say the same lines that they did before which make fun of you for being a new member that is below them.  
[/list]

Skyrim is trash and looks even worse next to RPGs like The Witcher or Dragon Age. It's an empty, generic, uninspired, unpolished sandbox mess."
11642,yes
11643,"Ruined my social life. 10/10, will play again and again and again."
11644,Yeah I guess its good
11645,"""it just works"""
11646,"still amazing
"
11647,"Can't wait until TES VI, so playing this again will have to do."
11648,its an incredible game
11649,Its been my favourite game since it came out.

11651,^
11652,"I'd get the Special Edition now, but amazing game otherwise. Not as good as Oblivion though ;)"
11653,"Yes
"
11654,"One of the most fun and captivating games i've ever played! the vanilla game is amazing and can keep you hooked for hours. the mods on this version make the game 100x better, however the mods on the special edition isn't something worth trying... if you plan on modding skyrim use this version as its a lot better, the selection is more fun and large, also the workshop content is just amazing to pay around with"

11672,I played special edition on my console and got it on pc for the ability to mod the game. Without a doubt 10/10 game
11673,pretty good

11680,"It's a good game, but no reason to buy this version or it's DLC. Switch to SE when you can on sale, or with a steam key."
11681,"THE classic first person RPG of the 2010s. A cultural touchstone. If you haven't played Skyrim, what on earth are you waiting for?"
11682,"I play solo, not with others online, as I am unsure of how to do that, but it is fun to accomplish the various quests, be able to interact with so many other characters in the game, wander through the landscape and not have to stay on designated trails.  The ease of use with the keyboard and a mouse is just seamless and you don't have to constantly think of complicated key commands to do most of the things you do as you play through the game.  The music is beautiful and perfect for this game, and the various landscapes are stunning!  I am almost 70 and I love it, as does my husband.  He too plays, on his computer....and we are constantly comparing notes on where things are or places to explore!"
11683,This game is definitely worth spending time in.
11684,My all time favourite game since I was 9 woot woot!
11685,VERY ADDICTIVELY COOL
11686,Such a great game I put so many hours into it.
11687, there lots of thing to do and things to find its even better ween mods are in it and i have a blasted
11688,Offline ESO :(
11689,ok
11690,i have rather play this game then get my dik wet
11691,I payed more attention to tidy up my in-game house than my real-life house. I totally lost myself in this game.
11692,YEET
11693,FOR FUCKS SAKE STOP BUYING SKYRIM!
11694,Pure Classic
11695,"A review hardly seems necessary, but just in case....

This is one of those games that you can sink a *lot* of time into, and that's without the unparalleled quantity of mods available for it.  It's just that fun--even many, many years later.

Note:  I recommend *not* trying to do everything in one game.  Start over from time to time and try a different approach to the game.  Been playing sneak-bow a lot?  Try a two-handed in-your-face build!  Sided with the Stormcloaks?  Give the Imperials a try!  Tired of being a goody two-shoes?  Join the Dark Brotherhood and get your assassin on, or side with the vampires in Dawnguard!

Mods take this to a whole new level.  There's more content--and much of it quality!--out there in mods than in the base game and official expansions combined.  Take your time and enjoy all that Skyrim has to offer!"
11696,"When I first purchased Skyrim, I was late to the table and had purchased other games at the same time that hooked me before Skyrim did. I eventually went back to Skyrim to give it another try and pretty much went down the rabbit hole. There's a lot of freedom to work on whichever skills you want when you want. Most caves/dungeons have a convenient exit that returns you to the entrance, or takes you back out to the open world through another exit, which cuts out the annoyance of having to backtrack every time.

The music and the visuals really help to draw you in. And there are tons of mods out there to alter the game in various ways. Lots of replayability."
11697,I love the game. I own it on both the playstation and PC. I'm ready for the next Elder Scrolls game. Skyrim is going to be a tough act to follow though.
11698,good game

11715,To Skyrim
11716,"Good game, but too many fetch quests.
NPCs are a bit dull and not enthusiastic like in Oblivion.

Oblivion gets an A-   great quests and nice looking world)
Skyrim gets a solid B. With mods, I'd give it an A    (not so great quests and decent looking world, use mods)"
11717,"I was an adventurer, but this game is now unlisted"
11718,Ive been playing this game for 10 years
11719,"Amazing game, extremely entertaining and fun. The game is certainly not perfect, and has its issues but that didn't stop me for having so much fun."
11720,A good GAME

11739,"The best game for now in that genre, I wouldn't compare it with Witcher, because it's completely different, in many ways. 
But if you love RPG, you will enjoy a lot. Highly recommend, don't miss it up!"

11744,good
11745,"Probably the best game ever made. Its absoluetly massive, Ive been playing this game for 6 years and still havnt done everything there is to do. The animation and graphics arnt the best nowadays but the combat is still up to date along with upgrading mechanics. The quests are cool and shouting is probably one if not the best mechanic in any game. The armor and weapons look amazing along with the enemys. The graphics ownestly arnt to bad and it can easily run on any pc due to its low system requirements"
11746,booba
11747,bruh
11748,"Wonderfully immersive open world, fun quests, beautiful music."
11749,"I suppose it's time for a long overdue review..... That no one needs because, y'know... It's Skyrim, why wouldn't you buy it??

So, it only took me 1,100 hours, at least 4 or 5 in depth play throughs, and finally the use of ""Skycomplete"" to do literally everything possible in one play through (except for siding with those filthy Imperial invaders!). If that doesn't tell you how much replay value is in this game, then maybe browse the almost endless amounts of mods that still grow by the day, 10 years later!

I'd argue that it has to be at least one of the most replayable games ever, with the highest value for money, especially if you buy the GOTY edition on sale."
11750,Maybe not the best but my favourite game... ever.
11751,"Hey, you're finally awake!"
11752,<3
11753,"it a good game
"
11754,great game
11755,Game is and always will be a masterpiece
11756,"Skyrim is the greatest game ever created. 

I've played through this game a couple times. Here are a couple recommendations.
1) For your first play through do whatever you want. Wander around, max out every skill, become the thane of every city. Become the arch-mage and guild captain. Do it all and eventually get around to the story line. Get a bunch of silly outfits and get those kill-shot screen shots. 
2) Second play through, pick a hobby. The DLC is great if you want to explore the vampire/werewolf/slayer lifestyle. Vampires are classy AF. Go be wild. Download a bunch of mods and fear Thomas-The-Train-Dragons. Instead of being a jack of all trades master one hard.
3) You've experienced the game. It's still gorgeous. It's still fun but you want more. You need more. Make a new character and uninstall all of your mods. You're now a loyal Imperial soldier who only is going to level illusion magic. Steal from a Giant early. Sell the loot and spend all your gold on Fury, Frenzy, Rally. Go to every main quest and have the Imperial soldiers slay themselves. Cast Fury and hide until you have mana again. You've only leveled Illusion and some light armor after being attacked. 
You don't fast travel. Take a horse or a carriage to each town you need to go. Follow the road; the world is full of random events.
Ulfric Stormcloak is slain by your follower at level 6. You're a hero to the empire. 
You have the closure you need. You did good. It's time to uninstall."
11757,nice
11758,"Whoa, like what a great game..."
11759,Replayability: 10/10
11760,gOOD gAME
11761,"Bitches be like: I hate skyrim
10 minutes later: Me and the skyrim"
11762,like Far Cry 3 without guns
11763,"Nice game. In 50 years from now when elder scrolls VI comes out, we'll look back on Skyrim and realize that nothing will be able to replace this timeless mastapiece of a game,"
11764,It's Okay
11765,One of the best open world game to date. Not to mention the mods you can have in this game. Very fun story. Cool choices for characters and builds (even though i make sneaky archer every time).
11766,"good game. hours and hours of fun to be had.

11798,Hey you your finally awake
11799,"one of the greatest games ever made
"
11800,"Reaching the end of both main quests, these were very enjoyable 405 hours! I've played most of the storylines, except Dark Brotherhood, and Seasons Unending (Ulfric went down before I came to a certain point in the dragon quest). I discovered almost all locations (maybe one or two remained overlooked). And I had a blast building my homes and adpoting 6 kids thoughout the lands (Hearthfire with Multiple adoptions mod)

Coming from Morrowind, which I played way beck when, Skyrim did not disappoint, despite having simpler gameplay mechanics, and what felt like a smaller world map. There is a lot to discover and a lot of fun moments to be had."
11801,Hottest game of 2021
11802,100 out of 10 def worth it
11803,Sweetrolls
11804,"This game defined a generation for gaming, no matter what people say they cannot deny this title's impact on those of us who played it years ago and still continue to play it. Whether you play it vanilla or completely change it around with mods, theres always something new to be seen and experienced. I can say with complete confidence that this game deserves a 10/10."

11813,shouting in public is not okay
11814,so this in my opinion of this game called skyrim i played about 854 hours and can tell people that this game is well over amazing. the fighting techniques and story line is on point and i will indeed tell people about this game and if you dont have it i strongly advised you get this game before u forget its graphics are good the voicing is great and the creatures in it. they can be the size of a rabbit to the size of a DRAGON! so if its not to late get it now on steam y'all thank me later PS its not free sadly but its still a great game ;)

10/10 would do all over again."
11820,"good
"
11821,"This has got to be one of my favourite games so far! The landscapes are beautiful, the music and storyline is emersive, and the game has a really rich, complex lore behind it. A masterpiece."
11822,"i love its large, open world style allowing you to do anything and go anywhere with thing getting harder as you level instead of lower and higher level quests."
11823,Have loved this series from Arena to ESO Greymoore. Cannot wait for ESVI to arrive...
11824,todd howard I hope your next shit is a hedgehog
11825,In the first hour of playing I managed to make a set of light armor that increases my health by 2.6 million. 10/10 would recommend
11826,its good and fun. lots of replayability
11827,Love this game as my time played suggests though I can no longer play without mods it is still my favorite game I keep coming back to and have been since 2013.
11828,Horrible Game Choc fulla bugs. Cant move without being teleported back to where I was.
11829,Great Escape from the real life world. You can almost do anything in this game.

11841,"Awesome completely immersive game with endless quests, will never finish everything in game!"
11842,"Good gameplay, story, graphics and modding community. Highly replayable."
11843,Truly one of the best games ever made.
11844,i like how you can do whatever you want n this game.i
11845,Very Fun game.
11846,Skyrim is a great RPG which provides the player with a unique experience. I've played around 50 hours of game play as I still have many mission left to complete. Worth the money but graphics could be updated.
11847,"Wow  its a GEM

11859,Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the high king.
11860,"Have you heard the tragic tale of Bethasda?

No?

I thought not. This is not a tale the modern day Elder Scrolls fans would tell you. They were a gaming legend. Bethesda was a company, so powerful and so wise they could make some of the biggest titles in a snap... They had such of knowledge of video games, they went on to influence many other game series."
11861,"its skyrim, you know what your getting. Gorgeous game with too many quests and way too much to do. will suck you in for weeks or months at a time"
11862,It's Skyrim. What else do I have to say?
11863,Help I'm trapped in the eternal playability of this game. I see a new mod I dl i start a new run. I first played this in the PS3 with around roughly 5000 hours into it. I bought this game for the PC because mods.
11864,It was good enough that I enjoyed it for over 300 hours.
11865,I guess it's pretty good.
11866,v fun
11867,After playing this game I can conclude that this is definitely Skyrim
11868,"If this is in your library,

Wanna be a sneaky rouge that backstabs and slinks in the shadows? Skyrim has it. Not to mention the countless quests and storylines you can tackle its neverending fun!

11888,"I love this game so much, there is so much content. This is the type of game you can play for hours. Even the bugs are so funny and fun. I also own a copy on every console for no known reason but I do recommend."
11889,"kill dragon

11890,"Кривое поделие Тодда Говарда, полное багов и недоделок. Если вы хотите интересного геймплея, с модами - не покупайте. С модами возиться вам придётся, а игра всё-равно останется прежней."
11891,1440 hours faphand in the game. Any question?
11892,kind of similar to... overwatch!
11893,GOOD
11894,"Ah, the original Skyrim. The graphics are starting to gather mold. The mechanics are unrecognizable as far as the previous games are concerned. You're obligated to buy all the DLC separately, because let's face it, the main quest story is such a slog I can hardly believe people still play through it. It doesn't have the mechanical depth of the previous games, no. I can't say the story is much of an improvement over Morrowind or Oblivion. Hell, you have to install mods just to stop the engine from collapsing in on itself.

But, even with all that in mind... I still can't bring myself to hate this stupid game. It was released just before I hit high school, and it quickly became my binge game to curb my depressive episodes. If you were between the ages of 12 and 65 in the year 2011, and you played video games, you played this game. And it was fun. That's all there is to it.

You should probably get Special Edition instead if your computer can stomach it. Recommended with mods. 
"
11895,doesnt get past opening cut scene
11896,it sucks
11897,"So how old is this game?  What console gen was it ported down too any way?  Isn't there supposed to be a war going on?  What's so great about an open world, with beasts and bandits anyway? 
    Well like music, it takes passion and timing to create something legendary.  Elder Scrolls as a series has garnered devote attention; from both sides of the screen.  Bethesda and Steam made it possible for the MODs to thrive.  Thus the game could be elevated to the hardware available and tweaked to your bent.  Gaming like this is nothing short of crafting your own designer drug.
  I run ~25 MODs on the original game.  About five to enhance the graphics, five to enhance the followers , and the rest to fix the game.  Sums out to a very enjoyable character arch, with only ties to the story arch were I deem them useful.
  With a flexible camera position: you are free to direct your own movie.  It's not for everyone.  Getting the MODs to play nice can take some homework/trial and error.  But the reward is nearly boundless freedom of play style.  It's not a heat and eat, meal.  Your going to have to leverage imagination to savoir the delights.  
  We can only hope that Microsoft gives the series more life..."
11898,amazing game my cataloged hours don't actually show my time in this game because of how much i play offline and it was not synced to the cloud
11899,"love it its sooo good finished the game 15 times
"
11900,Snow is nice. Simplest and prettiest Elder Scrolls so far.
11901,gud
11902,"Skyrim was my first experience with the Elder Scrolls series and quickly became one of my all time favorite games.  It has been ported to nearly every system since its release and it is arguably one of the most modded games of all times so theres tons of options for additional modded content if thats what youre into.  I have spent countless hours just wandering the landscape of Skyrim and I seem to always find something new every time I play it.  The story is fun, the environments are pretty cool, and the Elder Scrolls lore/story are immersive.  Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs or Elder Scrolls in general."

11929,"My most favourite game ever✨. 

No matter how long I don't play it, I always come back to it. It pretty much has endless content.  Especially with all the mods you can install. Every playthrough brings a different story for your character. I think I will be playing this game until I can't hold a controller anymore.

Is it buggy and glitchy sometimes? Yeah. But I don't think about that when I'm roaming the mountains overseeing the beautiful nature on my horse. It actually makes the game quite comedic to me sometimes. NPCs do the weirdest shit man. 

Overall, I would encourage EVERYONE who hasn't played this, to give it a go. Especially women. I think more women should try this and play it (this is coming from a woman). The clothing in this game is respectful and you see women as well as men everywhere, as NPCs and as enemies. It also has beautiful nature, heartwarming stories, interesting lore, and it makes you feel like a bad ass. And there is plenty of mods for better customisation of your character including hair, clothes, better sliders etc. 

(I have never ever reviewed a game, I don't usually do those kind of things, but this game deserves so much praise for transporting you to a different world. Especially in corona times)

TLDR; amazing replay value, mods adding extra content/ beauty, beautiful world, 
and ladies do try this game! ❤️"
11930,10/10 horse physics
11931,yes
11932,"Skyrim means a lot to me, whether inside or outside the game. It gave me more than a unique experience with feeling the pulse of such a solemn and epic land, it gave me something as well other games may never be capable of offering."
11933,v good game
11934,Its Skyrim
11935,is good.
11936,FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
11937,"I loved being either sneaky mcgee or sword and shield man during the time of dragons. Then I thought ""Hey what if I was an undead mine owner who lived in the death star and had a naked cat man as a friend?"" then I stopped playing it."
11938,"Buggest game i ever played, the lazy ass makers never even bothered to fix game braking bugs in there dlc, dont waste your money on it."
11939,Redguard
11940,It is a timeless classic at this point. Everything Bethesda puts out for the Elder Scrolls series has been incredible. Also excellent mod teams that constantly add additional hours of game play and fun unique customization options.
11941,It's a huge game. I wish they'd make another that's not mmrpg like this one.
11942,"Skywoom Iws a goowd gawme >wO
UwU rawrz"
11943,Super cool. Thanks Todd. I look forward to the next Skyrim.
11944,"Defiantly a game to go down in the ages, rich and vibrant landscape, easy to get into with a bunch of different playstyles to suit everyone's preferences. Overall been playing this game for 8 years and would defiantly recommend to someone who enjoys fantasy and RPG games"
11945,it is great fun and even more fun with mods.
11946,"I have spent over a thousand hours in this game and I keep coming back, despite all the bugs."
11947,"Its a total mess, just like me , except i like it unlike me"
11948,awesome game
11949,..
11950,"Skyrim lets you play all roles you can think of, and allows you to completely master every single one of them, absoutely awesome!
The mods are pretty good too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
11951,goog dame
11952,"cool game, todd howard can eat my shorts though"
11953,10/10 would play again. Still wonder if im going to take an arrow to the knee.

11960,One of the best games ever made even with it's faults and rushed assets
11961,It's okay I guess
11962,"it's fukkin skyrim dude be a werewolf orc, or a cat person, or a literal lizard wizard in a blizzard who shoots lightning from his hands

honestly if you haven't heard of or played skyrim you're basically a numbskull"
11963,Best Fantasy RPG Game ever made!
11964,ö
11965,This game is indeed skyrim
11966,.
11967,theres not a lot to do really
11968,"After playing through this twice, spending 329 hours total on 3 different pcs, playing the DLCs, most of its side quests, and grinding 20 levels to get all of the achievements, then resting my thoughts for half a year,
I am now absolutely sure, that this game fucking sucks."
11969,"thanks to the lockdown and after several years of playing other games i have made myself reinstall skyrim on my school laptop (because efficiency is key) and i had forgotten just how much fun this game is.
i have racked up about 90 hours in just a couple of weeks, and while it is still the Tod Howard definition of perfection (so bugs are still a feature) it is one of the best RPG's of all time, especially when installing a couple of mods.
i do dislike the fact that when mods are enabled achievements are locked. i honestly have no clue why given the fact that if you really want to cheat your way to 100% im sure there are ways of doing that with concole commands.

but if you have never played this (not so hidden) gem it is deffinetly worth the money."
11970,It's fine ig
11971,4
11972,"Well, it's Skyrim"
11973,lol
11974,"Very nice open-world RPG, not that amazing of a game if you just play through it (and there are plenty of places the game severely lacks) but if you are the type to play every side quest before you even start on the main story, then this game is for you. The modding scene is unparalleled in my opinion, and it isn't really worth playing without at least a few, some literally fix the game, and some add big boobies."
11975,
11976,"Makes me hard
"
11977,"Replayability, graphics, story, mods... one of my top games"
11978,This game is a really intertaining and keeps you on your feet
11979,sword man good. spell man better.
11980,Wonderful game and the mods make it better. truly a timeless classic
11981,Open world experience with flexibility with the modding community. Sometimes I simply enter the game to ride my horse with the Headless Horseman from his appearance to his grave and just enjoy the scenery.
11982,Fun and excellent and beautiful and enjoyable and amazing and awesome and grand and that's all
11983,Legendary game! No more!
11984,amazing game bruh
11985,pp poopooo
11986,this is crack
11987,is allright
11988,Very good
11989,prty good
11990,Just finished character creation. seems okay.
11991,"Skyrim might very well be my favorite game of all time. Since it came out in 2011, I have never been able to find a game to rival it in terms of epic viking-saga vibe and call to adventure/exploration. If that makes any sens."
11992,The best thing Bethesda ever made
11993,"Its ok, untill I took an arrow to the knee"
11994,"IF YOU LIKE GAMES YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS ONE

11995,Best game I've ever played!

12000,"yes. its good. play it. i like it.  you will too,"
12001,fun
12002,It's 'ite
12003,"In my opinion, this is the best Elder Scrolls game as far as the control set up is concerned.  It is a blast to play, and there are many ways you can change things up to make it a new experience.

My only complaint is this game is appearing to not be updated as much as it needs to.  The only reason why it needs updates is because Microsoft keeps changing how Windows 10 interacts with the hardware.  This causes glitches and game crashes.  Depending on how many mods you have or what specs your computer is, this could be an infrequent occurence, or it could happen every time you pass some invisible line on the ground."
12004,Skyrim is a masterpiece bugs and all. It's a game that will stand the test of time like many of the older Elder Scrolls series. Cannot wait for the next release of an elder scrolls game it has a lot to live up to.
12005,"I spent more time modding this game than actually playing it. You can make some very uh......""pleasing to the eyes"" uhhh.... women. 10/10. Go out and explore with your Glooty Mcthicker companions."

12018,"It's taken too long for me to review my favorite game, don't let my hours deceive you...

11-11-11.. Skyrim just dropped.
I booted up my xbox 360 and put the disc in and got completely enveloped in the game. Around that time skyrim was a pretty beautiful game despite its color palette of grey and blue. The combat was fresh coming from oblivion and the magic system in the game was jaw dropping. Executions were brand spanking new and added so much depth. Kill cams still weren't old and getting those long range archery shots was so satisfying... Fast forward to 2021.

It's been NINE years since the games release and ive played it over Xbox360, PS3, Xbox One, PS4, pirated PC versions, off steam accounts that werent mine and then finally on my own account. While Steam says I have 615 hours, its not including the experiences I've had with this game since it's console release. 

In my opinion, the game aged wonderfully; Skyrim is still a game you can boot up vanilla and still have a good time if you haven't burnt the game out yet. The combat is a bit wonky nowadays when you have games like The Witcher, Sekiro or any other modern sword fighter thats released but it still has its charm. Skyrim has always been easy to play, quick to learn and fun to master. While the combat consists of mashing leftclick, when you crank that difficulty slider up to legendary you might have to play differently. Stuns locks with shields or pouring out raw magicka creating combos with runes and mastery tier spells can be so amazing to experience the first time around. Questing, the core focus of the game, never gets old. It baffles me that after 2-3k+ hours, I still find new interactions, items and events. Truly amazing. 

But you already played Skyrim, we ALL have lets be real. Now comes the important part of the game... the one thing that gives this game its foundation when put up against modern RPGs and that is the modding community. They are so devoted to this game in Nexus mods, Loverslabs or whatever place you use, they all adore the game and continue to make it prosper. Skyrim has the most diverse gameplay of any RPG because people have been forging the game to be played in a multitude of ways for almost a decade. From a Sex Sim to a Hyperrealistic RPG, there isnt a spec on Skyrims continent that hasn't been modded. 

I owe a huge heap of thanks to the modding community for keeping my favorite game alive and fresh. Every load order i create the game feels amazing, looks amazing and plays amazing. 

TLDR: If you are going to get this game 9 years ""late"", don't worry, you have no idea whats in store for you.  

Final Verdict: One of the greatest video games ever created that will uphold the TES legacy forever."
12019,"It's Skyrim, no presentation needed"
12020,great game
12021,Might be the best game I have ever played and I have played a lot of games...
12022,"very good game
"
12023,It's Skyrim. What else needs to be said?
12024,"Gotta love that sandbox! I bugged Alduin that he just stuck on the beautiful blue sky and after killing it nothing happened (yea, i returned to my save before he stuck on sky ;))."
12025,"Skyrim is, and always will be, one of the greatest games I have ever played, I was late to the party by a at least 3 or 4 years. Which is a true shame, because to this day I stumble across new things I have never seen before in this overwhelmingly expansive world. 

What I would say however, is while this version is *cheaper* with, dlc included it is more expensive than special edition. Furthermore, the modding community (which is an amazing group of people) no longer develop mods for this version, at least not regularly. With this in mind, buy special edition if you don't have either, it's still supported, technically cheaper overall, but still Skyrim. And that's all that really matters."
12026,Amazing game ... a million ways to play and experience awesomeness!!!
12027,Still a great game with a great many of mods to heighten gameplay once it gets stale
12028,"Probably one of the best games ever created. the lore, the story line, the visuals and the deep level of details. #1 in my book."
12029,"I have had this game ever since it came out, it is for sure one of the most fun i have had playing a video game, it is fun, and anyone can play it, 10/10 i would recommend any day"
12030,The best
12031,"Skyrim is not only a game....When you listen closely, it is also your life's harmony."
12032,"Despite the jankiness of the game engine, this installment of TES is pretty darn good. 

Having moved to the mountains from the coast, it took me a while to stop feeling like I was playing Skyrim IRL when I'd look off to the distance and see a misty mountain top - wait, was that a dragon I just saw? :D"
12033,I played this for a week straight and it altered my thought patterns and invaded my dreams. when i closed my eyes i could hear chanting in the distance. good game.
12034,I think i m finnaly ready to rate this game. 10/10 would replay again.
12035,it's skyrim. what else can i say.
12036,Best version of Skyrim.  Too bad nobody can buy it any more.
12037,nothin wrong with it. I want ES6 tho lol
12038,in this game i used spelles
12039,cat girl tits man
12040,yeah
12041,"Bugged as all hell with many annoying choices in game play, underneath it's a pretty solid game. I disliked the necromancers as they felt overpowered and I find anything that uses ice magic in this game annoying. Some fights were very enjoyable, one memorable one was a chief bandit with full plated armor at the end of a fort. Puzzles could use some work though as they feel as if they were ripped off the back of a children's menu even though this game is rated M."
12042,Hours of fun.
12043,I have enjoyed the diversity of players and equipment...the options are endless.
12044,pog
12045,mods
12046,Accidentally got married
12047,Meh.
12048,.

12050,"The game, the one you can play countless hours and still be amazed at what you will discover around the next corner. IF you have yet to try it, please treat yourself to this fine piece of software. 10/10."
12051,"kool game
"
12052,"Did this game need a 166,533rd review? Sure, why not? 
Skyrim is a classic and you'll find few who disagree. Like its predecessor, Oblivion, Skyrim had me playing for hours and hours on multiple platforms for years (xbox and later PC). Skyrim will always be THE adventure RPG that set itself apart from the others and stood the test of time."
12053,It's a really good relaxing game.  The only downside is that it crashes at the worst times.
12054,"its a good game
"
12055,OuuU ou OuUoO UnnnGHHHH OOOO ooooOooOOOooOoOoOoo AHHH AHHH AHH

12057,I'm not sure if I should be upset or happy with how many hours Todd took from my life with this game. F Creation Club though.
12058,"Killed a king nobody noticed 
Killed a chicken and the whole world turned against me.
"
12059,what a fantastic game if you have never played it i would definitely recommend getting it
12060,The remastered one better
12061,one of the best games ever
12062,My PC is a little slow but that's because I have an old system with new software but the graphics look great and the game is fun to play still figuring out the controls but that's okay.
12063,"it got wings, so yeah...... doesn't take much to buy my vote :')"
12064,Addictive good
12065,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
12066,honestly it's just the best game ever to be made with hours and hours and hours of storyline side quests afterstory content dlc weapons npc's and countless other reason why the game is great. DEFINETLY worth the price.
12067,It's 4 times the size of Fallout 4.
12068,"The first medieval rpg i ever played and i was impressed. This game is just a lot better than new vegas. It has a cool story, satisfying combat, great conversations and items. The game is also really cheap and totally worth buying.

12075,"I never played this, decided to come back to it, find out that mods are required to fix game breaking bugs, and then find out that the unofficial patch requires ALL the DLC to work.... and the DLC is hidden in steam. Then when you find it, you find out it costs an extra 45 bucks. I'm going to try to play the vanilla game, but the first game breaker I encounter, I'm going to uninstall and never play a bethesda game again."
12076,its a good game ez to mod fun to play one of my most fave rpg
12077,What else is there to say.... it’s Skyrim. It will forever be a great game.
12078,Yea man this the one

12092,"I don't know why you haven't played this game. Play it.
"
12093,"The best game on steam and a must have for every gamer. Even without mods this game will stun you.
10/10, could not rate higher, wich is a shame :'("
12094,have to special search this one so it isnt the goty edition but totally worth it just due to mods alone
12095,"Bruh, it's Skyrim"
12096,"I love this game and have played it for 100s of hours, and I can say I recommend it, with the best modding community (Possibly in front of gmod) and rn it's a really cheap price. Fun game and funner with mods, and it doesn't cost 30 pound like Special Edition which is essentially just Skyrim with a bad Enb. It's just not worth is to buy SE if you've already got LE. Anywho, it's a fun game, and some of the questlines are kind of repetitive and boring, however. Still, fun game, 10/10 just based on my experience and memories of it"
12097,"Bethesda do one thing well and that's detailed, interesting worlds. Skyrim is no different, but this game has aged very poorly when it comes to gameplay. After playing modern melee combat games, it's hard to return to Skyrim, even with mods.

A shame that Bethesda is a shell of its former self, I have no confidence that they can deliver good products anymore."
12098,"This is the one and definitive Skyrim. If you are able to, get this edition over SE. A lot more mods and a support of ENBs. 

You can still get cheap keys in retail (because this version never goes on sale). 

Get it, mod the sh*t out of it, enjoy!"
12099,"Best Game if you like FPS, RPG, and magic"

You might call him the most powerful man in all of skyrim, but then you remember that the giants have the abilities to send people to space, they do this by slamming people so hard into the ground that they fly up, so atleast have to make a tie."

12143,"I played this wonderous game this past week, after taking a year off from it; it felt like shaking hands with an old friend. It has its faults, bugs and the like - I have regularly dealt with the sound and some visuals glitching out near water, to the point where the game thinks I'm suddenly swimming on land. But the core game? The quests, dungeons, the lore? It is not far short for perfect. I just hope, with what I've seen with Fallout 4, ESO, and Fallout 76, that 2011 was not Bethesda's peak."

12145,it is fun game from my point of view.
12146,very great game
12147,fantastic as always from Bethesda
12148,love this game and have since day one
12149,"Best game I've ever played. Well rendered open world environment, with rich lore."
12150,"As much as Todd Howard whispers sweet little lies into my ear, its a very neat game and very fun. Cant wait for Elder Scrolls 6 in like 4 or 5 years :/."
12151,"This is a game that can be enjoyable for along time. play the game first, then after beating it add mods."
12152,main menu theme is so badass.
12153,the old ones are better but this is till fun
12154,"If You are seriously in the review section of Skyrim, You will find no answers, just a question 
Do you value your short time on this planet of ours if. 
If yes, then leave while you still can.
If no, then you are in the right place. Welcome to the game in which you will mod it more than you play it. 

Good Luck"
12155,"One of the best older open world games, set the bar for current games.  Fun to revisit."
12156,"I don't need to say anything about this game, one of the best games ever made! something for everyone, i'm only typing something cos steam says i have to if i want to like the game."
12157,All time great RPG
12158,"For many Skyrim V was the game of 2011 receiving rave reviews from nearly every gaming website and gamers alike. For some reason I just never checked it out at the time despite hearing how great it was from friends. 
The game itself is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. 
I've played it through to full completion and am still finding new things to look at and do in it. The main plot is engrossing & compelling and there are more side quests than you can shake a really big stick at. The clever cinematic ""camera"" tricks blend seamlessly into the gameplay, adding a depth of immersion not seen before in an Elder Scrolls game. The voice acting outstrips all previous games in the saga and the soundtrack is beautiful & perfectly matched to the game's ambience. 
The map system was pretty hard, trying to find routes to get to places as no roads are marked on your map initially. I guess this adds to the realism, but it was rather off putting when you don't know how to get around this new world.
Highly recommend Skyrim to any role player. No knowledge of previous Elder Scrolls games is required to understand what's going on, yet the game-lore manages to remain completely faithful to all the previous sequels."
12159,"Great game, its a classic and I have enjoyed coming back to it in 2021 and I'm sure ill love it even more when I do another run with mods"
12160,Eh I liked Morrowind more
12161,"After 10 years, Skyrim still holds my interest. Why? Because of its addictive glitches, because there's always another way to complete the same dungeon, the same story, even the whole game. It may seem boring at times and unimmersive (unblended assets, animal behaviors, etc) but then you look through modding libraries of Steam, Nexus, and a few unorthodox websites for rare interests, and see that Skyrim is more than just a game; it's an ENGINE! Instead of looking at the same snowy tundras and mountains, you can modify it to look like you're already in Stros M'kai, with sandy beaches, palm trees and probably even the whole population as Kahjiits! You can reshape Skyrim in your own image- altering npc textures, adding more trees, making it always foggy, also making it so everyone essential can die like earlier Elder Scrolls games! The only problem with modding is if you install one too many replacers and textures for the same subject, the game will likely crash or cause flickering textures. Buy the Legendary Edition for more complex modding but with less restrictions and the same old Skyrim lighting or buy Special Edition with easier modding capabilities, but disables achievements while active, and the ""remastered"" graphics with more bloom, field of vision, and unbalanced priced dlcs that adds more Morrowind and Oblivion items."
12162,"This game is awesome
"
12163,"fun game, best $50 I spent in 2013"
12164,Almost 10 years old and it's still my favorite non-Donkey-Kong game of all time.
12165,this game makes my cooter vibrate
12166,good game
12167,Just play.
12168,banana
12169,"its cool

"
12170,.
12171,fun long story
12172,Still in my top 5 rpg list
12173,Quite enjoyable have played for a long time
12174,"I remember the first time I played this game, I fell so in love with it, played entire days, explored a lot and the more I knew about the story, the more I got into it. The soundtrack and world building are just so amazing, voice acting is great, the quests are enjoyable. One of the best Action-RPGs I've ever played, plus it has mod support for extra quests and better graphics!"
12175,Great game
12176,"Open world concept with good story line and multiple developmental lines. (knight, thief, assassin, etc)  Tends to move slow compared to 1st person shooters but it has it's charms and mysteries to solve.  Note large no of user supplied add ins available."
12177,best game ever
12178,Unrivaled to this day
12179,"Most epic RPG ever made? Possibly.
Should you play it? Not a valid question at this point, play the damn game."
12180,well its an elder scrolls they are all famously good
12181,Great
12182,i am the dovahkiin
12183,"Sometimes I just wish I could play this game seriously, but I always end up doing weird stuff with the console. It's just too much fun, I spent almost 20 hours only typing random commands to break this game! It's just really great seeing a game that let's you do all these things like spawning and killing almost anything and you can even set your speed and jump height as you please and attack speed and damage too. You can literally run faster than fast travelling in this game. 
99/10 I love it way more than I should. Story is still good. Even if I got a little impatient at times due to my massive movement speed and the  slow movement speed of other characters."
12184,Best Rpg
12185,"The OG version of Skyrim. 

The game so good Todd Howard made his career re-releasing it. 

The game so good fans forgive one of the biggest downgrades in game mechanics depth from one game to another in the same series. 

The game so good its completely normal for people to have clocked hundreds or thousands of hours playing it. 

"
12186,REJECT MODERNITY RETURN TO SKYRIM !
12187,"Broken, buggy mess, but very pretty. Go play it."
12188,Noice
12189,I have played through this game more than 8 times and I still get enjoyment from it after so many playthroughs i just downloaded mods for the first time and its amazing views
12190,"Even though this game was released some time ago I find myself continually coming back to it and exploring the world of Skyrim.  If you enjoy open world type games and exploring, all set in a fantasy world with Dragons,  then you will most likely enjoy Skyrim."
12191,"You can fly with a bucket, does any game need more feature?"
12192,"good game, my favorite in fact"
12193,One of the best games ever!
12194,Game of the Year without question. Well worth the price.
12195,Mod it 'till it drops.
12196,Love it
12197,"People say Skyrim isn't as good as it past Elder Scrolls game - I'd agree with them but that's not to say it isnt a fantastic game. What really carries it, like all Bethesda games, is the mods. Really this game would have died without it. The main story line is the most boring and unmemorable story line ever but the world is truly the opposite and that alone is why its lasted so long, why people are able to continually mod it, because of the world Bethesda has created."
12198,THSGRTGASZTGRH
12199,Poggers
12200,all
12201,o
12202,its pretty okay
12203,vikimg

12205,Thanks Todd very cool.
12206,"Its a little heavy on the dialogue but the exploring and fighting is intense, broad, engaging"
12207,killed my horse 3 times and had to reload my last save from like an hour ago because i couldn't live with the guilt. highly recommend.
12208,"It sure is an entire mainstream, surface level and enjoyable game. Also 300 titty mods help."
12209,it good
12210,aaaaa
12211,Horse go over moutain
12212,It just works
12213,It's Skyrim. Enough said.
12214,always loved this game. mods give tonnes of extra replayability
12215,penis
12216,shit game
12217,bruh its skyrim what did u expect this game is fire
12218,fucking good game i have like 300 hrs on console as well
12219,"yes
"
12220,A great game.
12221,with some mods to allow multiple characters to play different styles in this diverse nordic back drop you can find yourself enjoying hours of play time without even realising it.
12222,yeet
12223,Це тупо Скайрім
12224,is good
12225,Fun
12226,"No matter what game i play this is the one that i always come back to.
"
12227,"I tend to have a hard time finding a video game that I really enjoy and want to stick with for a long period of time. But for the past while I have been reliving the greatest video game ever made. There are countless hours you can put into this game, 1,000's of different builds and the mods are incredible. This is definitely a game I would recommend for everyone. Very, very fun and addictive.

Questing in the game is so much fun. If you ever find yourself thinking, hmm... I really don't want to do this quest. THEN DON'T! It's not like the quest will just go away. Every quest that you get will always stay with you. Like what do you mean Alduin is about to destroy the world? I want to go on a 8 hour expedition to get the Aetherium Crown first! That's how this game works and it's great.

Skyrim's leveling system is so much better than games like Fallout. Skyrim rewards you for being diverse in your play style and allows you to actually use whatever it is you actually will use, Are you a Necromancer? Great, then don't worry about having to level your Archery up because it won't help you as a necromancer. Leveling can be unbalanced sometimes and there are some really easy exploits that you can abuse to level up faster, but it doesn't really matter because it's a single player game and you have the freedom to approach it as you want.

The difficulty system in this game is great. I myself love to play this game on Master. At the beginning you'll struggle you'll die a lot then eventually you will get to the point where that same Bandit Outlaw that was one shotting you at level 13 does nothing to you with your full Daedric armor at level 47 or whenever you get it.

I've made multiple different characters and have made tons of different builds and everytime I sit down and really play through this game I find myself growing a slight addiction. I adore this game ever since I played for the first time."
12228,"Its the best game ever created, but it isn't perfect. If you plan to mod Skyrim or SSE it will crash over and over but its to cool to not try again over and over. If your not a patient person then modding isn't recommended."
12229,good
12230,"After many thousands of hours playing this game it still doesn't seem to get old.  Starting as a different race or different skill set provides many hours of fun.  The mods that are available make it a totally different game.  New followers, areas, and armors really can change the game.

Highly recommend this game for anyone looking for hours and hours of non-boring excitement."
12231,"Really fun medieval fantasy, adventure, fighting game"
12232,"One of the best RPG on the market. Great open world, be whoever you want be. Just choose a destination point at the map, go there and react whatever happens during the trip."
12233,It's SOOOO Addictive with mods. I've put almost 7500 hours into it combined with my time on xbox
12234,"Very realistic,Immersive role-playing, Loved it."
12235,Better than SE
12236,"very niceeee

12253,Wonderful game with a ton of modded workshop items to make the game fit more to your liking. Vanilla game is great for a full playthrough. Always enjoy playing this each time with a different class each go around. Its a must have game!
12254,really fun  game to play there lots of ways to play it . my favorites  a hunter and necro   still  looks  really good after about 11 years now
12255,Best game i have ever played
12256,Fun!
12257,Todd
12258,"It's skyrim, nuff said!"
12259,It just works
12260,"One of the best games. Coming back to it all the time, never gets boring. 
"
12261,"Pro tip, hide the amount of hours you have played by going offline on steam. That way people won't judge you as much for having over 500+ hours on a single game."
12262,Best Elder Scrolls game until VI is released in 2075 :)
12263,Yes
12264,It's super glitchy.
12265,"It's a shame that this game is unlisted, it is way cheaper than Skyrim SE, it has a lot of mods that are not officially available for SE, some PC's cant run SE properly and yet Bethesda forces you to buy the more expensive and more demanding version of the game.

If you managed to stumbled upon this review and are going to buy the game, don't forget the DLC's, that are unlisted as well:

[spoiler]I guess i like it[/spoiler]"
12266,Its preety good but i´ve only played it for like a hour or two
12267,It's ok I guess.
12268,"2015 : Bought the legendary edition of the game
2021 : Still modding the game"
12269,ya already know it a good game
12270,Love this game! I always keep coming back to it and it never gets dull
12271,booooring
12272,"This game is very well made, the game itself is amazing and has a good story line, it has dragon riding (Bend Will shout on dragon) and a lot of great quests, if your someone who is scared to be killed, use god mode (God Mod and all cheat codes are only for PC feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) if you can't use god mode then play the game normally. Now let's move onto the bad things about the game. While it is a very good game, some things ruin the game, one of those happen to be the MAJOR lag when you go to fight or walk, I've died many times from lag and I have went through almost every single existing horse in the game from the lag (9 of them were from me attempting to run off mountains but a majority of the horses that have died are from lag) another thing is the instant kills, I have no problem with dying but it annoys me when I'm at FULL health and then out of no where I just die, even if nothing is attacking me I randomly die. Overall this game is great it could use a little work on the lag but otherwise its a great game. I have spent 56 hours playing this game and that shows this game is good. If you like dragons, fighting, magic. adventure, exploring, single player, and amazing games then you will enjoy this game!"
12273,always fun
12274,pp popo
12275,"I just have 3 words to discribe this magnificient game:


IT.... JUST.... WORKS...."

12279,"Although this game has some years on it, its still one of my favorites. This game never gets old."
12280,"The best open-world game, TO DATE. Many hours played on this bad boy, many more to come."
12281,"Skeleton, bears, DRAGONS. LOVE THE GAME"
12282,"best bethesda game
don't cry"
12283,"Skyrim is a game where a man who is destined to fight a dragon who threatens the entire universe, will do literally everything else besides that, then disappear for eternity once he gets bored, only to come back later after everyone suddenly has an insatiable urge to walk around naked, and rather than killing each other everyone would rather fuck each other. I literally just described how 80% of people play this game, but won't admit it."
12284,"If this game was a dog, it would be called Good Boy."
12285,goodf
12286,"Imma be honest, the game wouldve been outdated if it had released in 2004. Its bland, its boring, not engaging in any way. You need dozens of mods to even make it somewhat playable.

I played it many years ago, made bad memories in over 100 hours. Downloaded it again recently and it is even worse than i remember.

2/10
Do not recommend (unless you are ready to download dozens of mods which bring it to a 6/10 at best)"
12287,I'm going to 100% this game.
12288,Best game around

12295,"This review is based on playing it recently.

The freedom this game gives you can still be a lot of fun, but overall this game has NOT aged well. In 2011, Bethesda got away with their games being so broken was due to their epic scale. Unfortunately, in a post-Witcher 3/Breath of the Wild/Outer Wilds world, Bethesda doesn't have that excuse anymore. There are still game-breaking bugs found in the game today.

I easily recommended the game in 2011, but there are so many better options in 2021."

12297,i used to play this game like you. then i took an adventurer to the knee
12298,"The 196 hours is actually drastically low, it doesn't include the hundreds from console or from the special edition nor does it include the hours from my older account. I would estimate around 1000 hours at the very least. That being said. This version has been around the longest it has more mods available to it(at least as of writing this that I am aware of). If you like modding this is the version for you. If you want to be able to mod but with less options and want a ""nicer"" looking game out of the box...then go for the special edition. If somehow you have not heard of or seen gameplay of Skyrim or any Elder Scrolls game really, then what are you waiting for? Get to playing!!!"
12299,"Best meet and fck XXX game ever. Oh wait, its a great simulator. Oh I mean.. modding simualtor ;)"
12300,"Lots of exploration, achievements are great, must play"

12303,This game sucks. P.S. crucify me
12304,:)
12305,"played a little, also pretty fun."
12306,"Does this game really need reviews at this point? It's 9 years old, critically acclaimed, and has been re-released several times."
12307,Pretty good
12308,"If you have not played this yet. Then yes, I recommend it for your collection. Modding community is still active. Tons of user mods add HOURS of content. DLC is pretty good overall. If you already played through this tho. Its not worth 30 bucks for the mods or dlc alone. imo."
12309,"coll game, poggers customization, i have it on ps3 and 3 different steam accounts, highly recommend this classic BANGER"
12310,Its great.  Its that simple.
12311,Its Skyrim what do you expecct ride a horse slay a dragon and mod the ever living crap out of the game. have fun its awesome
12312,"TL;DR - 7/10 for content, 10/10 for game overall.

Skyrim was and still is my #2 favorite Open World RPG. To give a proper review, we must go back...

I preordered Skyrim for the 360 in August of 2011. On Friday, 11/11/11, I began my adventure as Taro, an Argonian focused on swords and heavy armor. That single character had about 1500 hours or more of game time before the save corrupted.

I then restarted Taro once Dawnguard came out, and continued through Hearthfire and Dragonborn. About 1000 hours later, I bought the game for PC, and that opened up the world of modding to me.

With over 600 more hours and double that fixing error and rearranging mods, I am happy to say that this is the best game I've played with mods.

Skipping the skimpy armors and NSFW content, Skyrim has the largest modding community (including Special Edition). The following mods are ones I always have installed that aren't environment, textures, etc:
-Knights of the Garter - 15th Century armors based off of real knights
-JRC Witcher Swords - Adds swords from the Witcher series
-Chronicles of Steel - Realistic Nordic weapons
-LeanWolf's Better Shaped Weapons - No more paddle swords!
-aMidianborn Book of Silence - Armors and Weapons look much better

Story:
The story of the game is good enough. With mods, they get better and make more sense.

Armor/Weapons:
Could be more, but the paddles are good enough. They are much slower than should be realistically, and some of them just look strange (Looking at you, ebony swords!). Armors are meh. Make no sense in a frigid cold environment.

Magick:
WAY less than Oblivion's spells, but some are much cooler. Frostbite, Flames, and Sparks are the basic three that you can use early on and have a cool effect to them.

Overall, my #2 favorite game ever. It cannot beat TES 4 Oblivion in my opinion, as the latter's DLCs are much more worth the cost, and while the animations and gameplay are very dated in TES 4, I would recommend it more. (I'll go into better detail on my review of Oblivion.)"

12323,FOR SKYRIMMMMM
12324,This game will give you 0rg42ms and I have no issue with that
12325,it's alright i guess

12331,good
12332,Love this game enough said
12333,"Simply a magnificent gaming experience. The world is robust and beautiful and at times deadly. Scenery is breathtaking and the gameplay is exquisite. I have played this game through several times, before it became Steam property. Can't go wrong with Skyrim."

12337,yes gud gam
12338,Fun game.
12339,"Yes, it does and always have its flaws, but this game was fun back when it came out in 2011 and it is still fun a decade later."
12340,"It's Skyrim, one of the greatest gaming series of all time.. Why exactly are you reading reviews for this game? Just freaking buy it so you won't be considered a square."

12346,"By far one of the most overrated games of all time. The graphics are terrible, the environments are bland and ugly, characters look like complete abominations, armor looks bad, weapon models look bad. Combat system is absolutely terrible. This game was made with an ancient engine. Story is a joke, side quests are indeed endless, but none of them are interesting. The most sleep inducing game I've ever played. As soon as I try to do another playthrough I fall asleep 2 minutes into the game. Best insomnia cure for sure. No wonder why this game has one of the biggest modding communities ever, players have to make the game interesting and playable themselves. The only good thing about the game is Khajiits."

12348,best
12349,"Fun game, couldn't get into the game personally but there is a ton to do. I'm a fallout player leave me be."
12350,"its a good game cuz its got wizardz and orcs and its a good game

"
12351,"I have given this game multiple chances (split over multiple years) to convince me. Because everyone speaks well about it. And because my friends like it a lot.

However everytime I begin to somehow enjoy myself, I get hardstuck by an other rediculous issue.
I have played without mods, and I have played with mods (to *fix* the biggest issues for me, UI and weight.).

But everytime I begin exploring the world or building up my character I run into questbugs.
Or lastly I can't even load my save anymore despite not changing anything about the few mods or my PC.

I'm so tired. Instead of releasing skyrim for a billion platforms, maybe they could go and bugfix the issues that are after years still in the game and the engine and the code."
12352,"Big open world with hours of game time. On occasion it is very buggy but usually in fun ways, modding community is insanely devoted, even nearly a decade after it's release! 
Experiment with different play styles and characters, embrace the lore and take your time adventuring, that is what makes the elder scrolls franchise stick out.
Character building isn't as in depth as it has been in previous games but the perk system still allows for a decent amount of customisation, I would strongly recommend nods to buff standing stones and magic spells though, as this allows a bit more variation in your characters."

12361,A great vacation to a fantastic world.
12362,Very good game. Highly recommend never get bored coming back to this game always something new to do or a different way to play.
12363,"Over 200 hours of playtime, still not bored of it. So yeah, of course I would recommend it, been a while since I devoted myself in a game this much.

I bought the game more than a year ago (yeah, I'm really late), but I only started playing it 3 months ago, and god knows what I was missing...

If someone is reading this review and is uncertain he should buy it (which is not very likely since the game is unlisted...), do not hesitate, I can assure you won't regret it."
12364,incredible game

12366,i have bought this game so many times. would probably buy it many more times too.

12384,i only really started to understand how great this game actually is once i bought it for the 4th time
12385,"This game has not aged well for me, but it's made improvements in the software since I spent 1,000+ hours on my PS3 exploring the dull world of Skyrim. It's a tundra that sucks the life from a retirement home, but I couldn't help myself. I kept spending hours upon hours leveling up and fighting Dragons. 12/10 would recommend spending a lifetime in this world if you haven't yet."
12386,Great frickin game. Highly recommend

12398,it's ok
12399,"This game is the king of world-adventure format role-playing games.  Even though it's a few years old now, the graphics are still spectacular.  They've evolved the combat and skills development over several previous incarnations (and it shows).  I just keep coming back to it!"

12406,"I keep restarting but I never finish the game.

Skyrim is an old, dated mess that only manages to thrive due to the amazing modding community around it.
Really, as great as this game may have been when it came out, it's aged like milk. That being said, within the milk are small gold nuggets that you'll choke on."
12407,walking simulator
12408,"Really replayable.  Excellent, time-tested modding scene. Runs reasonably well, the glitches can be ironed out with community patches, and the graphics are reasonable for a nearly decade-old game."
12409,"I'd like to start with wether or not I believe you should play this game, short answer is yes, if you like fantasy and exploration this game will be for you.
The long answer, this game might as well be a sandbox for you and anything you wish to do not to mention the thousands of mods which create a richer experience, improving the not so polished areas of the game however mods aren't necessary for an enjoyable experience as vanilla skyrim has tons on things to find such as dungeons and holds along with random encounters which mean you can sink hours by just exploring the open world whilst going to the next quest objective.
Although i find this game extremely enjoyable I do think that the main story is nothing special as well as the combat which, although fun, is quite boring and uninspired heavily relying on creativity rather than skill, the game also has a fair share of bugs and glitches which could potentially ruin your experience or just make you  giggle.
All in all even though this game has it's shortcomings I still think anyone interested in the fantasy rpg genre should really give skyrim a try even if it isn't a perfect game, I still think it's a whole lot of fun."
12410,"Lovely to play. The music and the environment are really actually quite relaxing.  There is always plenty to do on the game, and the questlines are quite entertaining.  The fighting is pretty low key, and there is not much to it.  If you enjoy slow pace , adventure games and great environments, this ones for you."

12417,A true masterpiece!
12418,veri good gam.
12419,its ok i guess
12420,"I value this game overall.

Pros:
Decent graphics, especially for it's age even without mods
Abundant amount of quests and things to do with 200hrs on record
Good value for price, got it on sale for around $15 including all DLCs
Feels good to level and sharpen skills to max level
Hunting dragons is cool, got to get all those shouts right?

Cons:
Perhaps too many quests, too non-linear, main quest-line appears insignificant and lost in the size of game
Characters feel generic, not as detailed or personal as other RPGs
World feels more suited for an MMO than a single player game
Single experience wasn't as intense as say Witcher 3"

12429,"10/10, one of the best games I've played"
12430,"I'm pretty comfortable calling this a timeless classic. It's a heap of sh*t that needs mods mods and more mods to be even remotely playable, and even then save files bloat up over time until they die. Still, the active modding community offers fantastic versatility that many other games can't hope to compete with."
12431,Great story
12432,One of the greats... there is very little this game does wrong.
12433,"It's the biggest game of our generation, a child was named dovahkin,what more is there to say? Is bethesda scum? yes absolutely."
12434,"One of the best games ever. If you have to read this review, go back to farmville or whatever because you missed it."
12435,"The Steam Hour Counter is not even close to the time i have invested in this game.  I mod it until i break it, then do it again.  Doubling, tripling the size of this game means nothing to me. I easily have three to four times the hours playing this game into modding it, and I've broke my PC twice, and bought two PC's, just to play it the way I want. Burn it down, start from scratch.  Not graphics, just content. ASO to free up space and all the mods i can muster.  It's given me ten plus years of fun and taught me a lot about modding.  I can't recommend this game enough, I run an older system, and it still works great.

I am trying to figure out how to create my own mods for this game.  In the mean time I have figured out how to use bat files to make changes to the basic game.  My children (yes I am an old lady) have tried to get me to play Fallout, but I am too much into Skyrim that I cannot imagine any other game would be so fun to play."

12483,Nice
12484,Bethesda isn't the greatest company in the world but this game is one of the best games I have ever played so much to do so much replay ability i never really get tired of it sometimes I won't play for a while but its like something is always pulling me back to it I love this game
12485,this is my 5th time buying this game :-)
12486,One of my favorite games of all time.
12487,"Nice

12490,it is a good game and lots of content good story fun all around
12491,Just a RPG classic.
12492,"Personally I'm partial to Oblivion for the more creative and fun side/guild quests, but Skyrim is still a very good game. I'd argue the main story lines were better in Skyrim but the side quests and guilds could be slightly underwhelming at times (too short!). Still a 10 tho."
12493,good game
12494,"This game is legit a different breed there is so much to do in this game, tons on quests, lots of storys, and hours of fun :))))))))))))))))))))))))"

12517,"This game is worth the cost, its replay value is very high and always has much to discover!"
12518,"Amazing from start to finish, and tons of mods for when you think you've done everything the game has to offer creating an entirely new experience."
12519,"good

12520,"Got it for the fact that I can deviate from main quests to just vibe. Turns out? The main quests have VIBES. Snuck into a fancy dinner party to spy.... lit vibes. Can def be a bit gory, but that can be turned off. Settings also permit subtitles. Really awesome game. Super glad I bought it. 100% worth the money."
12521,"Countless of fun hours in this game Skyrim will never get old, I highly recommend."

12536,bethesda victim
12537,"If you haven't bought this edition already, buy the special edition because it is 64-bit, newer, and more stable. If you only have this edition, that's fine too. I don't need to tell you to play this game because you know you should."
12538,"I don't have that many hours on the game, but it's worth buying. I've never really been a fan of rpg games, but this one surely made me enjoy my time on it. My favorite part was when I took the clothing of every single npc I killed and sold their stuff for  5 dollars, I also kept every single item over 1500 in a chest that I will never open to actually take something from it. The legends were right, skyrim is indeed a game worth buying only for these reasons."
12539,funni
12540,"Very customizable and fun to play. There is so much to do that between the Xbox and PC, I have not even scratched the surface."
12541,just dont kill the chickens and youll be fine :)
12542,I love the open game play and that you can pretty much do whatever you want if you are willing to live with the consequences of some of your decisions.
12543,"I recommend this to anyone that has never played it (if it's even possible) in 2021 !
This game is still one of the best RPG in his genre, which is FPS/TPS action RPG in vast open world with semi-linear quest line and lots of freedom cause it's really a good approach of the genre. There might be better RPGs out there such as The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt or Horizon Zero Down but Skyrim is unique in it's genre and for the price of around 10€ on sale it's a must have for anyone who loves the genre. Also the modding community is so vast you could play hundreds of hours and still have fun even after rushing let's say the main story quest (multiple times!).

I did hacked the game before I bought it on Steam and I always have some nostalgia bringing me back to the game for some fun, mods or chill play. It has lots of issues some might have detailed below but it's still a gem almost 10 years after ! Contrary to what steam shows I played around 600+ hours.

Cheers"
12544,yes.
12545,"Most Played game YEARS later,and still going.I m sure Bethesda did something special here.

On consoles i have 4.5k hours Did not regret a single minute. Cause IT JUST WORKS"

12553,"Great game, played it first on xbox and the mods make it better"
12554,"You can wander in this game for hours and still find shit to do, 9/10"
12555,FUN PLAY IT
12556,good game
12557,yes
12558,"So I bought it when it came out for x360. Played a lot. Then bought again years later for steam and mods. Modded a lot of immersion into the game. Great feeling - adjusting the game to your personal desires.
The soundtrack... I spend about 1/3 of the day listening to music. My most listened artist on Spotify in 2020 ended up Jeremy Soule... This music is just so chill, that I listen to it on daily basis as a background for most activities.
The atmosphere and ultimate chill while exploring Skyrim at snowy night with the northen lights on the sky and ""Secunda"" in the background. It's just so nostalgic, beautiful.
Interesting lore, and enviroment that tells it's own stories.
~230h of playing and probably as much offline and then additional x3 amount with xbox360.
Game that always feels great to come back. Every time I start new playthrought I sink in this bugged game with cliche story. Because story in Skyrim is just a background to that magic (sometimes funny) world you wander."
12559,Bruh why are you even reading this the store page is down.
12560,It good game. Tried 100%. Didn't last long before i realized it was gonna take very long. However I did shit myself when I first entered bleak falls barrow. Raider literally jumpscared me as I walked in. Still good game tho. 10/10 in my opinion.
12561,"the grafics
"
12562,"(T)his g(odd)amn beautiful (how)ever h(ard)core Bethesda (made) game, for (me) was an out of body experience. While Fallout exceeds in story and character development, Elder Scrolls exceeds in lore and world-building. Skyrim especially creates a perfect atmosphere through the setting and the excellent soundtrack by Jeremy Soule. Anyone who does not (give this game a good review) doesn't understand this piece of art."
12563,"the mass amount of hours I have are from exploring, and trying to get all the icons on the map. combat is awful, quests are boring, for the most part the world looks ugly. yes, I know it's the original version, but it still looks butt ugly"
12564,this good game
12565,A real classic.
12566,"awesome game
"
12567,awesomest game
12568,"Best RPG ever. Or maybe that was Fallout 4. Anyway, play this game!"
12569,Good.
12570,Good game
12571,Everything.
12572,"i think that this game is very encouraging in troubling times. this whole corogna thing totoally caught me off guard, nut elder scrolls v skyrim is quite fun!"
12573,"It needs a few mods to get the best from it, but it's one of the ""Must Have"" games to add to your collection. Don't bother with the ""special edition"" with the pay-to-workshop content and stick with the free mods on the original release."
12574,Extremely addicting
12575,fantastic game
12576,cxvzx
12577,It's Skyrim. It's like Skyrim but with Dragons.
12578,this gamne good
12579,"One of the greatest Elder Scrolls games. The fact that you're a badass Dragonborn that can pretty much rule all of Skyrim, its pretty boss. I enjoy the scenery, the bow mechanics, and the music. There isn't much I don't like about Skyrim. Maybe just that there isn't more to play. That's where mods and people who have created modded dlcs comes in.  Give it a chance, it will suck your life away."
12580,digga einfach gutes spiel jeder der sagt skyrim ist kacke kann sich verpissen und vergraben und sich in die fresse scheißen
12581,Skyrim was fine when it came out and had a lot of fun playing it but Skyrim Modded is on another level. Honestly I would like to describe it but I can not. I guess Skyrim is what you make out of it. It is definitely worth buying this game.
12582,betheseda phoned this game in. half as good as oblivion
12583,honestly if you dont have a mod that turns all the enemies into spiders you havent lived
12584,"I am the critical type and am usually not happy with many things when rating games. Even ones I like. And Skyrim is no exception to bugs and glitches. Anything run off of machinery will be bugged and or glitchy. But Skyrim I can only dish out praise in terms of the TES5 Skyrim game. The abllity to mod allows you to turn this game into pretty much anything you want it to be. It is by far the most favorite of all games for me. It never gets old. There are so many options to allow for different flavors of gameplay with mods, like I said, you can do whatever you want to do, be whoever you want to be. The possibilities are endless. And it the game does glitch, it produces some of the funniest moments that will keep you laughing about it for a long time. There could never be another game this good, could there? What? TES6? Well, we'll see. IF.........IF I am still alive by then.
I can't believe I've never written a review on this game before. Could have swore i did ages ago. Do they disappear after a few years or something? Oh well, here is my word on TES5 Skyrim now....The best ever video game created ever!"
12585,Woof! Woof! :)
12586," TES Skyrim is a great game and it's on just about every console on the market, I've played thousands of hours in total adding together my hours from Xbox and PlayStation. Skyrim is a great game that you can get lost in, you can role play as a Elven marksmen from Valenwood as an example, you can be whatever you want to be roaming the lands of skyrim. On the lands above you'll fight dragons, bandits and other animals but as you go under the earth you'll find Falmer, Chaurus and Dwarven contraptions. And with Dawnguard you can fight a swarm of vampires or with Dragonborn you'll Fight another dragonborn,  Skyrim has tones of things to do to keep you busy.

 The combat in skyrim is pretty good magic spells look better then ever with dual casting, or you can create a poison and kill or stun an enemy with your poison the list goes on. 

 Skyrim is a game that I can talk on and on about, it's a great game and you should play it if you haven't already."
12587,Best game ever
12588,"one of my favorite games ever, plus the modding community makes this game way more replayable"
12589,great
12590,oh no! dont buy this game if you already has 4 version of it  XD

12637,The saviors hide doesn't count as a daedric artifact apparently.
12638,"Truly one of the best. But as awesome as this version is, I would highly recommend getting the Special Edition, much much better and more stable. However if you're on an older rig, this will probably do for you."
12639,I love the game! tons of options...its literally a world that you can shape and reshape. the game is a classic and a must have!

12644,"yo with the bro lick a huge toe, I beat the treasure hunt to find this game on the steam store since they hide it away like the little CIGGY MUNCHERS they are so that you buy the new version which is the same with a community made mod that updates the graphics."

12649,"Just started playing recently and even after all this time, I would count it as one of my favorite games."
12650,its elder scrolls? what else can i say lol
12651,si
12652,Classic. I would highly recommend.
12653,My all time favorite game that I always come back to! So fun!
12654,Giant Spiders? What's next? Giant Snakes?
12655,it good reason: get real!
12656,"I played skyrim on the playstation 3 when it launched back in 2011/12, at the time i absolutely loved the game. Now nearly 10 years later I bought it on steam to play again and to see what it was that made me fall in love with the game 10 years ago. So if you find yourself in the same experience as me.. just buy the game and play it.. I'm having as much fun if not more that I had 10 years ago. Now playing on PC I installed mods that made the game refreshing and new.. I LOVE SKYRIM !!!! 10 year old game.. and I'm having more fun than playing Cyberpunk 2077. 

Cyberpunk left me with an itch that only Skyrim was able to scratch.."
12657,its skyrim bvruh
12658,Its skyrim a truely great game.
12659,cmon its skyrim
12660,best game ever
12661,is good
12662,"Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. Ralof: We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there! [Lokir looks at the gagged man.] Lokir: And what's wrong with him? Ralof: Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? Ralof: I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. Lokir: No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Lokir: Why do you care? Ralof: A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Lokir: Rorikstead. I'm...I'm from Rorikstead. [They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.] Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting! General Tullius: Good. Let's get this over with. Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny...when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe. [A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.] Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going? Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub. Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers. Torolf: Inside the house. Now. [The wagon stops near the chopping block.] Imperial Soldier: Whoa. Lokir: Why are they stopping? Ralof: Why do you think? End of the line."
12663,Classic fantastic game.
12664,"Skyrim is a great game, because it's more than a games, it's a place where you can escape to, with all of it's amazing scenarios and spots near water where you can just chill and pretend you're not the dragonborn, until you're really ready to kill some dragons. Play it, it's amazing!"
12665,Classic
12666,"Transferred my save from Xbox360 so I could spend 80+ more hours avoiding the main story missions. Then added mods and started another character to do it again.
If you like video games, you have to play this game."
12667,a smasher
12668,"This game set the standard for 2010s era RPGs, and it did it in 2011. Not just a great story, but a well designed world, interesting experiences, and most importantly, extreme mod support. It surprises me that no other RPG has lived up to Skyrim overall in the last decade. Witcher 3 I think is the closest second, but while Witcher contests strongly in storyline and content, it loses hard in the wider picture that completes an RPG of this type - crafting system, skill trees, did I mention mod-ability? 
I can not recommend Skyrim enough to anyone who shows even a hint of interest in immersive, open-world RPGs."
12669,"The best game of all time

Not much else to say"
12670,it is one of the best rpgs
12671,Rightly one of the best rpgs ever
12672,"Amazing game!
Clocked more than 330 hours with the base game after launch. I still plan to play the special edition with mods. And check out Enderal, a mod that is a game with Skyrim engine."
12673,The active modding community brings this already great game to an even higher level.
12674,"yo so like... morrowind is better but if you don't like masterpiece games, I guess this great game is also worth it"
12675,boring
12676,Epic

12678,"good

12679,Endless hours of quests to go on. Never feels like you run out of things to do.
12680,"Jump in and give it a go. It has a great story, fantastic visuals, and is a lot of fun for hours on end."
12681,Have you ever played skyrim before? no? where have you been since the past? What are you fetus? Go buy game.
12682,"It's Skyrim, Everybody likes Skyrim."
12683,good
12684,About as good as it gets.
12685,"Spent way too much time with this game, but would 100% recommend. Like all Bethesda games, the base game is pretty buggy, but the modding potential is unlimited."
12686,"[spoiler]won this game in a giveaway on SteamGifts[/spoiler]

Only 2 words: The. Legend."
12687,Classic gamu!
12688,"Sweet, sweet carnage AND it can be in 1st person, too. Now if only I could figure out modding..."
12689,One of the absolute best RPGs of recent gaming history.
12690,Literally what are you doing with your life!!!!! PLAYYY IT!!!!
12691,"Playing this game with mods versus without, are two entirely different games, just with the same mechanics."
12692,"It was mindblowing in 2011, but 9 years on you can start to see the cracks in the paint over the GAPING holes in the design.
Everything that made Fallout 4 unlikeable is recognizable here, and the engine is at this point old enough to legally drink. 
It's alright as a modding platform, but a game should be able to stand on it's own, and not rely on the community to make it good."
12693,Todd
12694,"it was 2013 when I first played Skyrim, I sent my little brother to buy us a game on Xbox 360 last moments, I was 13 he was 11, he picked it randomly from the local store shelf and I was very angry at him for picking a game I never heard of, I regretted my actions in my first hour of playing, it was a game where I can do what I want when I want as anyway I want



as a kid I played it till level 40 before school started, sadly we sold the Xbox later and I was busy with school, for 3 years I kept wondering what it will be to reach level 50



I reached college and got my first powerful PC its been years since then, I played a cracked version because I live in a 3rd world country and that was the normal thing, recently I got in a financial state where I can buy original games (Finally), now this is my 6th play on this masterpiece, And despite its bugs and problems which can be easily fixed through mods by our great community, it's a gateway from this world wherein Skyrim you get what you grind for (not the case IRL), don't look to Skyrim as a game, but rather as a platform where you are the master of it.


It's a captivating world that deserves your investment, you won't regret it."
12695,"everyday all day:
bb"
12696,Third time playing this on another console. Plays well via Steam Link with DS4. There are a lot of really good immersion mods for visuals and creature comforts that don't take away from the core original game. Still as fun as it was the first time to play this. One of the best RPG's out there.
12697,b
12698,Best game of it's kind.  Change my mind.
12699,"It's Skyrim you already know what it is. 
It's fun though, but visuals and gameplay have aged like milk. It's stiff and ugly, even by 2011 standards. 

A lightweight RPG that is janky but undeniably fun. The story is certainly not gripping, it's very by the numbers ""Chosen One"" tripe. Characters are interchangeable with very few that stand out. What it does do very well, is allow you freedom in exploration.

There really isn't anything else to say about it."
12700,"Played it before already, a really nice game. Rich with many features and content which is a big plus, great story, gameplay and fine graphics for a 2011 game. You may encounter bugs but nothing frustrating that'll stop you from playing. Totally recommend it."
12701,"Skyrim
"
12702,"Still a solid game, very immersive, reminds me of playing DnD."
12703,Great game main story kind of sucks however the special side quests and dlcs are amazing. A lot of people say its really buggy and while I cant disagree they aren't game breaking and don't make the game feel unfair (unless your going out of your way to become God). and once you finally get bored of doing everything there are a ton of mods (still active community too) to keep you entertained.
12704,Great Game
12705,Awesome. Wanna feel epic? Roam through the mountains slaughtering trolls.
12706,It's Skyrim. Obviously it's good.
12707,"yes
"
12708,"Don't play this one, get the Special Edition! Well worth it! (Still an awesome game)"
12709,amazing as always
12710,"Honestly, I liked Skyrim for the first 300 hours I played it. But the law of diminishing returns coupled with me just playing better RPG's makes it seem shallow. Maybe it's cause I'm burnt out though."
12711,This game can drag-on
12712,if you mod it its very funny
12713,It's Skyrim.
12714,"trust me, its good. better with mods."
12715,my pp big
12716,"One of the best games of this genre. The only pity is that there is no continue, only fashion, but this is not the way."
12717,Buggy mouse pointer even after so many years makes gameplay annoying.
12718,yep
12719,funy dragon go brrr
12720,"The game world is really immersive but the reason the game is still alive for me is the great community of modders. I support this release of the game and the DLCs but I won't support bethesda re-releasing skyrim on every possible console and the biggest joke that's called ""Special Edition"". There're free mods that make the game look way better than ""SE"" and You don't have to pay twice for this game. I bought ""Special Edition"" just because there was a sale for whole series. The main story of the game is one of the most boring ones that I've played. The game is buggy and unbalanced with stuff like infinite alchemy-enchanting loop which was only fixed in UNOFFICIAL community patch made by modders. Bethesda didn't even bother to fix some obvious bugs and things that didn't work correctly. Just take a look at the unofficial community patch changelog but be aware that it'll take You a lot of time to read all of it. The side quests are more interesting than the main story line which took me multiple playthroughs to bear it and finish. The stormcloaks rebelion was also boring but I've completed it before the main story as well. I still can recommend it in 2021 with mods. Love the game hate bethesda."
12721,...addicting.
12722,"Well, It's skyrim. MUST PLAY."
12723,I didn't like the main quest & combat but everything else is amazing. One of the best open-world experiences ever.
12724,"Its an absolutely amazing game for the time it came out it is one of a kind
"
12725,heart eyes emoji
12726,GOOD
12727,haha sword go swoosh
12728,It is one of those games were you can just lose yourself in it
12729,"Ok, this is gunna be a long review because... THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE WORTHY OF A NOBEL PRIZE!!! Anyway, this game is fully open world with infinite modding capability, graphics are something the developers seemed to have overlooked but hey this game was made in 2011. overall GET THIS F*CKING GAME!!!!"
12730,fuck you bethesda
12731,Its the best RPG ever made and you know it already
12732,wabbajack
12733,fantastic
12734,"I really do enjoy this game, has a lot of interesting things to do."
12735,"It's Skyrim ya git. Haven't you purchased this 5 times already? Don't worry, this time ""it just works."" Come on you can trust Todd Howard, can't you?"
12736,"This game is pure mediocrity. I don't understand anyone who raves over it.
Is it big? Yes.
Is it boring? Yes.
Is it fun with mods? Yes.
However, as I refuse to factor mods into my review, the game alone kinda sucks. It's not awful, but you could play so many infinitely better games that are very similar. If you've somehow never played Skyrim, don't bother. There are plenty of games that have taken its base formula and improved upon it that are actually worth your time."
12737,great
12738,Modding is super easy. Recommend Thomas the Tank Engine Dragons and hentai moaning mudcrabs
12739,good
12740,I don't know how many copies of skyrim I own..
12741,Its pretty good
12742,好玩
12743,yeah
12744,This is what cyberpunk 2077 wishes to be O_O
12745,good game dragonborn go fusssssssss ro dah
12746,awesome sauce
12747,This is the best game I have ever played!!
12748,nice.
12749,elder scrolls skyrim should be named the immersive scrolls skyrim
12750,Thicc Vampire lady got me on fire bruh.
12751,"What can be said, seriously why are you reading this."
12752,"I've played Skyrim more than any other game, its what caused me to stop playing video games for almost 8 years because I got too addicted. The best RPG ever made, even after 9 years."
12753,Skyrim is a good platform to bring character concepts to virtual life. The mods available are a large part of the process.
12754,garbage
12755,"Fun, play it"
12756,dont buy this buy the special edition because this game is a bug itself
12757,hours of my life i have spent in this game 10 out of 10 would do again
12758,"this game exists in a non temporal purgatory

8/10 baby!!"
12759,all ways a great Play!
12760,"it good
"
12761,It's been 9 years and this game still rocks for me :D
12762,"Finally, I have achieved awake"
12763,love this game :*
12764,game is ok
12765,"Very versitle game, the vanilla game is good and looks nice considering the age and dev team...
 The real fun comes from the mod on Nexus and LL (if you know, you know), with all the crazy support in the modding comunity, you can change the base game to have a near infinite amount of replay.

 Highly recammend this game and even more so with all the mods!
"
12766,"Great game, although buggy, but really worth the money... especially if you can get it on discount. You can find a lot of mods on the internet for that game, like the unofficial patch that will correct 80% of the remaining bugs. You can also download mods that will upgrade graphics or make your experience more immersive.

Bottom line : if you're in it for a great game, buy the Special Edition. If you're in it for a great game but want to mod the hell out of it, buy the Legendary Edition. (Special Edition has better graphics, but there is a lot more mods available for the Legendary Edition. Otherwise, both version are exactly the same.)"

12768,"Do I recommend this?? YEAH! I may not have much play time. But I played this on the ps3, and I can approve this is my most played game EVER!! Ik I have atleast 1000 hours on it! And by that... I can sure tell you this game is so f* fun"
12769,fantastic
12770,Why review this. They've hidden it on the store. A relic. My life.
12771,Just yes.
12772,Very good game indepth content....
12773,It's no coincidence one of gamings most revered fantasy adventures has you shout at cabbages after performing a life threatening task for menial pay
12774,"With the mature modding tools available today, you can transform this game into something that you will have a lot of fun playing."
12775,This game is crazy good with mods :)
12776,I want twelve years of my f*cking life back. Good game. Terrible price. :D
12777,fireball go brrr
12778,"If highly modded, this game is the best video game ever made."
12779,AA
12780,"I still remember stepping out of the intro, looking around me, seeing the ruins to the north, the blue sky overhead, the beautiful world around me, and the path before me, and going ""WOW."" Not many games can say that."
12781,Great
12782,"It's a fun game, a lot better with mods."
12783,Play this because.............its good.
12784," best medieval RPG game i've played in a long time, the lore also makes it more interesting.
mods are average on the workshop, if you want to have a more enhanced gameplay using mods Nexus is the best for that"
12785,"This game is really good, I love the graphics, especially for its time. After you get bored of the vanilla version you can always mod it after. Don't know if there will be another continuation of Elder Scrolls after this one."
12786,"It's fuckin SKYRIM. I have the dragonborn logo tattoo'd on my leg with the Thieves Guild symbol inside of it.
OF COURSE I RECOMMEND IT"
12787,"Skyrim? Yeah, I heard of that. Lemme tell ya a short story about a little dragonboy, who was really mad at that TES world.
He called it, I dunno, mods? Something like that, scrolls didn't explained to us what that mean, but with that stuff, he just made himself recognizable on world of Skyrim. For real. Everywhere, some ladies on mid-nudity, we looked better, and of course - machine guns. What the f*ck. Some new techology we had. Sometimes when he died because of his companions, he screamed about ""reta*ded"", ""f*cking idiots"" synonims. Well, he was really at his mental shutdown back at the time. But when he beat the crap out of everyone, he just leaved us. In scrolls we have written ""uninstalled"" but I don't know what that means. Yeah. I hope he's still alive, and he'll come back to us some time."
12788,It is a good game especially with mods
12789,One of the best elder scrolls games in the series in my opinion 10/10 would recommend
12790,THE BEST GAME EVER!
12791,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the 5th installment to the Elder Scrolls series for console and PC. The game takes place in Tamriel a continent home to the Nords. You embark on a wide variety of quests, dungeon delving, dragon-slaying, and daedra worshiping as the Dovahkiin (Dragonborn). All thanks to Todd Howard for bringing Skyrim to every PC, console, phone, and handle held imaginable.

[h1] First Impressions [/h1] 
This is my first experience with the Elder Scrolls series and hopefully not my last. Like any game the graphics were the first to catch my attention, the ""realism"" of drawing a bow, shield bashing, or swinging a sword (as real as I'm ever going to encounter). The modding community is awesome and offers pretty much anything the heart desires to increase replayability.

[h1] Audio & Music [/h1] 
At first place the sound effects for all the traps, groans, and voice acting for most humanoid NPCs are great but after some hours in it becomes repetitive and dull. The music for different areas and events such as battles gives you an indication of what it going on around you but falls victim to the same issue as other sounds. It becomes a lot better with mods for obvious reasons.

[h1] Graphics & Visuals [/h1] 
For the release year the graphics are more than phenomenal across each initial release platform and only improved with the release of the ""High Resolution Texture Pack"" DLC, Special Edition, and the mod communities continued support for the game. The glowing eyes of some of the enemies, the breath of dragons, and even the flickering dance of campfires were all fantastic touches for a game as old as Skyrim in its original state. I really fell hard for this game, I felt like I was teleported into a real medieval world and was apart of it from the start due to how everything tied together visually.

[h1] Story & Gameplay [/h1] 
To preface this I'd like to say that after all my hours put into this game I have not completed the main story mission. I own this game on PC (twice, plus Special Edition), XBOX 360 (x2), and the PS3. I've completed all DLC story missions for Dawnguard and Dragonborn but I have never completed the base game story mission. Throughout my playthroughs I've had different builds so I went through different major questlines like the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, or Mages Guild which all somewhat interconnect with the main story or at least leads you in that direction but beyond the picking Imperial or Stormcloak and winning the civil war I haven't beat the game. With that in mind I feel the number of quests and how some of them connect is just awesome, I've never experienced a game this vast before and I really enjoy that I can spend so many hours trying to complete everything and still not fully complete the game as a whole. The controls are easy with a controller but if you plan to add mods it's preferably to have a keyboard handy if you expand on the game's base combat system as a lot of them add additional hotkeys.

[h1] Overall Performance [/h1] 
The game had a lot of performance issues, especially early on with modding. A lot of people suffered corrupted game files, sudden crashes, and death loops when loading saves even if you weren't actively dying during that save. There's also some texture popping depending on your system specs, and resolution specific issues if you use wide/ultra wide monitors.

[h1] Bugs & Feedback [/h1] 
As mentioned in the previous section a lot of people suffered (and may still suffer) from crashes, freezes, and save game corruption among other issues (such as broken quests) you can easily find in the Skyrim Discussion board or subreddit. I've only encountered what I've mentioned, buggy games seem to be one of Bethesda's ""qualities"" and is an expected 'feature"" in all their releases that [i]usually[/i] get patched after release.

Great game, I still play it years later! Check out some of the overhauls such as [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/]Enderal[/url] which recently released as its own separate game vs just a compilation of mods and voiceovers. The mod community is still active and I hope they'll continue support for their mods until the release of The Elder Scrolls 6!

12798,Absolutely incredible masterpiece of an electronic video gaming sensation
12799,"There's Game & Play in this title.
Both are at a rank you can't describe in so few lines.
But I'd like to argue on taking the time to narrate YOUR story.
As well as it could be following the main Skyrim path,
they're tons of them, so pick one, create a new,
and simply become a legend."
12800,I LOVE SKYRIM
12801,"is it so hard to hire a bug testing division, todd?"
12802,"Best with mods :D.
Dont forget to pick up Morrowind and Oblivion while your at it.   Morrowind is arguably the best x).  Elder Scrolls Online for that MMO itch.
They're all best with mods.

I 10/10 Reccomend the entire Elder Scrolls Franchise, its what got me into gaming as a kid with Morrowind and they've come so far.  The ammount of content of every game is endless, and the modding community infinite within this series.

Cant wait for the next Elder Scrolls to FINALLY appear :D"
12803,"its a good fighting magic style game, if u like that"
12804,"Always a great game to return to. Tons of content, and tons of ways to play! Great fun all around."

12821,"One Problem,My companion won't attack Barbara. :/"
12822,"A great action-RPG adventure in a fantasy setting. Fight undead, bandits, beasts and dragons. Fight as a fighter, magician or a rogue. Take out your targets using short or long range attacks. Also the NPC's and environment brings the whole world alive. Like you are living in a different world that you do not want to leave when you look at the clock and realize is past midnight. A must-have."

12826,"god i want to fuck an argonian so fucking much just the thought of those scales moving up and down my body as their tongue caresses my face is enough to make me both perpetually rock hard and saddened by the knowledge that i am stuck in a world of smooth skinned apes. todd if you are reading this please add interspecies argonian sex to the next skyrim release, please, i need this."
12827,"Fecking awesome game that everyone who can, should play at least a little bit"

12829,Love it
12830,"100% on the last two console gen.
It's ok i guess."
12831,Just trying it out
12832,"The most beautiful game I have ever played. I still seek peace in this game, and I first discovered it when I was merely 12. I miss the first play through this game gifted me. It's artwork, storytelling, beauty, fantasy, culture, lore, violence, emotion, escapism. It's fantastic. 10000% recommend."
12833,"had fun. 
ok game, great mods."
12834,SKYRIM
12835,"To this day one of my favorite games ever. Does it have its issues? Yes, but it is charming in so many ways. It completely brings out the adventurer in everyone I think. Honestly one of the only games I have actually finished because I just couldn't let it go. The graphics are definitely dated but it really is the perfect game for someone who is just dipping their toes in the world of gaming."
12836,Best game ever
12837,A true classic. If you like D&D type games this one's a winner.
12838,Because its Fucking Amazing
12839,"Enough has been said about this game, you already know why it's good so why are you reading this review in the first place get the game already.

12844,"I find it endlessly playable due to the size of the game, and the many expansion and mods for the game."
12845,"It's a very cool game. I abolutely love that the Elder Scrolls series varies so much despite being of the same world. So much has changed in the new times in which Skyrim takes place. When compared to Oblivion, I enjoy some of these changes while I dislike others. I believe that these changes were necessary and the developers at bethesda did an awesome job. Can they release ES VI now please? I swear that this game will be available for the microwave before the sequel release date is officially announced."
12846,"It's skyrim so...yes
"
12847,its a classic
12848,Kinda nice
12849,its skyrim
12850,"Aside from always shrinking or appearing to be a short-person, the game is great. You can play it 2 or 3 times and still have plenty of fun, and find new things."
12851,"Lets be honest, you've forgotten what the original game looks like under all those mods, haven't you?"
12852,Got hit by a giant. Flew off into another dimension. 10/10

12859,"i really enjoy this game until date
"
12860,"Mods make it perfect. Pretty basic bitch game to be your favorite, but its my favorite.Played religiously on consoles and now will play with big tits mod. 11/10"
12861,Probably the best game I've ever played.
12862,10/10 I would like to install some 18+ mods again
12863,"this game has got me through the best of times and the worst of times, if your looking for a game that will help you escape with real world and transport you to a far away place deep in your mind where your the center of universe revolves around you this is the one

also i cant be buggie as shit but i unqestionably love it anyways"
12864,Many many story lines. I've been playing off and on for quite a while (about 3 years) and I still discover places I haven't visited and quests I haven't done before.
12865,Great game just one question where is lydia?
12866,JUST PLAY ITS SOOOOOOO FUN I LOVE THIS GAME
12867,"I ran from town to town, attacking people with a big hammer while naked screaming about lizards and elves.


After I was released from prison I quite enjoyed Skyrim."
12868,spent more time modding than playing
12869,what is not to love about skyrim it is amazing
12870,most all of it
12871,Good game never ending content
12872,2020 Still an endless classic!
12873,What is there left to say about Skyrim. It is one of the only open world RPGs that you can easily have several thousands of hours in to without experiencing everything. Truly infinite replayability and an incredible experience. One of my top 5 games of the 2010s.
12874,"My wife left me because i played this toooooo much.
10/10 Thank you Todd"
12875,Skyrim is an incredible open-world RPG with near-infinite possibilities for character expansion and customization.

12880,not very playable in 32:9. would reccomend the Special Edtion
12881,"can have a bit of lag, but still a very fun game."

12883,"If you want something that [i]just works[/i] and you can jump into right away then this isn't for you. There are a lot of fixes that you'll need to apply yourself in order to make this playable.

Really cool world, story, and lore except for the first couple hours. Gameplay is pretty fun except that the different play styles aren't very well balanced. Being a mage sucks at the beginning and still is pretty bad once all skills and gear is maxed out. The biggest negative is that it requires multiple mods or ini tweaks to make it playable because

    [*]Framerate is locked at 60Hz
    [*]Field of view can't be changed and is way too small for PC
    [*]Can't disable vsync, mouse acceleration, or depth of field
    [*]The UI is absolutely horrible

12885,"funny, i stole a car and drove into whiTrun and found a pimp boy."
12886,Game Fun
12887,"I have over 1,000 hours in this, I just don't usually run it from within Steam unless I need to see it in its ""vanilla"" state.  This is the most modded game in history, for good reason.  This is a *great* open-world engine.  When you do a S.T.E.P. project setup and RTFM really well, you can basically make it 2020 AAA quality as far as graphics and animation go, and then populate your world with whatever baddies and waifus and whatever you have in mind. There are thousands and thousands of additional NPCs, and clothing/armor outfits, new weapons, and added enemies, and game mechanics improvements, plus new lands, player homes, etc.  All as free mods.  New ones are released literally every single day. (But get them from Nexus, not from Steam, and manage them with Mod Organizer 2). The Special Edition revamp of the game is a bit more stable, but there's so much more available for this Legendary Edition version.

The game itself: Very typical first- or third-person (your choice) single-player RPG, and very, very typical of ones in The Elder Scrolls Franchise.  The storyline in this one is better than the last installment, Oblivion, which was boring to the point of tears, but it's not as engaging as the one before that, Morrowind, which was a genre-defining masterpiece.  The game mechanics are mostly improved, and the character models and other graphics are vastly improved from the prior two games.  With really good modding, you can get surprisingly realistic results.

Just beware of two things: Modding this game is a lot of work to do properly. Expect to take several days setting it up via STEP project (and don't try to do it without following STEP, or you'll spend twice that time trying to debug what's wrong with your mod load).  Second, this is a 32-bit game, and it requires some hacky mods to get it to behave well under 64-bit OS, at least if you want hi-res textures, and so on.  The game in its vanilla state has a hard limit of about 3 GB of RAM usage, after VRAM runs out, so it is very easy to crash it right from the get-go if you overload it with texture and mesh improvements and bazillions of new NPCs, without doing the memory tweaking.  WITH the mem tweaks (in SKSE and ENB and such), and with a current version of Win 10, this game no longer has a low VRAM cap, so if you have a card with 8, 11, or more GB of VRAM you're good to go; the game itself, even with a lot of goodies added, isn't going to hit 3 GB of RAM usage, unless it runs out of VRAM and has to start using RAM in place of it.

As for just playing the game as-is, with no modding: I can't recommend it in 2020+.  Use Skyrim Special Edition instead.  It'll be more stable.  The vanilla game is a lot of fun, and you don't need to mod it at all (other than the Unofficial Patch, which fixes a lot of outright bugs). Like other TES games, it has a bit of a learning curve.  Skyrim is a game you can play for 2 years if you're inclined to do so.  If you're not, you can have plenty of fun being a basic hack-and-slash-and-some-spellcasting killer for a few weeks, without getting into the more complicated aspects like alchemy or developing thief skills or whatever.  It's very open-world. You can ignore the main quest almost completely and just do whatever you feel like, or you can focus on the MQ hardcore and put off most side quests until it is complete, or anything in between.  If you've never played a TES game, it's basically a lot like D&D and Middle-earth, except with its own lore (and no halflings, nor the pure good vs. pure evil simplistic morality of Lord of the Rings, nor the weird 8-point alignment system of D&D.  This game world is morally ambiguous as are many of your choices in it, just like in real life.
"
12888,Many hours of game play with limitless quests and adventure to take on.
12889," I LOVE Skyrim!! I have loved every game in this series. Huge open roam world, the ability to mod the world to your hearts content, Been playing for years and I still find things I over looked before."
12890,"Immersive if you want it to be, and with infinite ways to build your character, every play through is fun. Make sure to mix it up and not do stealth archer every time."
12891,Hands down the best game ever mad.
12892,"This is my favourite game ever, I love it so much. Please buy and have fun :)"
12893,"I haven't actually played for 8 Hours, but it is an amazing game, I've ran into 1 glitch thus far, would highly recommend"
12894,im a bird. i play skyrim. **** the laws of physics and just play the game like a bird is.
12895,10/10 One of the best games I've played. There are so many possibilities - it's something you could play for a lifetime.
12896,"Even with the large amount of bugs, both funny harmless ones and game breaking, Skyrim is still one of gaming's best. The gameplay is superb. The combat can be a little clunky nowadays, but its still very fun. And the exploration is possibly the Open World genres best ever. It rivals Breath of The Wild, and Ghost of Tsushima for how much fun the exploration is. I would honestly say its the best part of Skyrim. The attention to detail is insane as well, because of how well this game nails the feeling it gives of making you feel like you're in the world itself. Its a living breathing world, and that is what makes Skyrim special. The questlines, locations, and overall fun factor make this a must own, although the bugs can often hinder the experience. 8.5/10"
12897,"Fantastic game. Fun combat, interesting but not overwhelming systems, and a solid story make this game fun from start to finish. Enjoyable for most gamers."
12898,!!
12899,I downloaded all the sex mods. Nothing can stop me now. Not even God.
12900,"my brother plays it so ima play you should to i havent playaed it yet
"
12901,Amazing game still holds up after many years.(if you ave the right mods) becuase if you play vanilla it will show 8its age.
12902,fun
12903,asdasd
12904,good game
12905,Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet.
12906,"It's good if you don't mind old mechanics, but if you're a bethesda fan you are probably into it."
12907,always a great escape from reality
12908,"no matter what year it is, Skyrim  is always a great game to sink your time into, not to mention the massive modding community and the wide range of mods means that every time you play you can have a unique experience. It is also a great game to learn python."
12909,"good
"
12910,"Just buy it, u won't regret it~"
12911,people play this game?
12912,h
12913,Need something ?
12914,:D
12915,Great game to play however you like. With some time and patience you can mod it to high heaven and make it look better than any AAA game released this year.
12916,Classic.
12917,"it good fun
"
12918,"Near infinite replayability, among other things. Great game"
12919,
12920,I've been the dragonborn for almost a decade
12921,Still one of my favorite game :) I really love it I can only offer to everyone who really like to be in the other world :)
12922,"Good game. Characters are flat, but the story is good and the world immense."
12923,I like this game a lot.
12924,its really fun i would recommend. (its harder to get mods though)
12925,"The game has its ups and downs but overall, the game is enjoyable."
12926,Yes
12927,"goog
good game
"
12928,Thought it boring till adding mods.  Then it was fantastic.
12929,Skyrim
12930,"Still perfect, but Todd please release TES6"
12931,69
12932,"Skyrim has been a part of my life for what, around a decade?
Before that, Oblivion. And so many mods, on both of them. Quest mods, gameplay mods, overhauls, new cities, business models, the list never ends. I even downloaded a mod to become the onwner of a meadery together with a mod to become a bard that plays in taverns, and roleplayed a wooden elf who would travel playing and selling mead, who had nothing to do with the war nor the dragons invading Skyrim at all.

It has been one hell of a ride, and truth is, for many years I had little need for any other game around. 

So if I recomend it for someone who still hasn't played Skyrim, if someone like that still exists? I sure do.

Learn how to properly mod your game, be carefull and learn how your files work. I have learned so much about how a game is made just by researching how to make my game handle all the mods I wanted to use together, and making them work. 

With all those mods I have payed for 1 game, but played so many more. So yeah, I recommend Skyrim."
12933,"A classic and it can still keep up with it's competitors. Great replayability, especially if you don't mind mods!"
12934,"Skyrim reimagines the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose.

Play any type of character you can imagine, and do whatever you want!
Choose from hundreds of weapons, spells, and abilities. The character system allows you to play any way you want and define yourself through your actions.
Battle ancient dragons like you've never seen. Learn their secrets and harness their power for yourself!

Skyrim is the best open world RPG of all time. A true evolution of genre !!!"
12935,"For my its the pest role playing game ever made, but you just have to play it with mods :D (y)"
12936,"Good game for long journey in fantasy world. Sometimes, i see some bug, but i stil love this game :)"
12937,The game is good
12938,I can feel my bones melting.
12939,I mean it's Skyrim. Timeless classic with endless growing modding capabilities if you're into that sort of thing. Thomas the train dragons and oversized boobs.
12940,fantastic bugs haha
12941,da original
12942,The classic version is still the best.  It needs several UI mods to make game play a little easier.
12943,one of the greatest rpgs of all time. dlcs are good as well. great story. lots of lore and more graet game
12944,You can still find the individual expansions if you don't have them all. Google search them and look for results on store.steampowered.com. I bought Dragonborn yesterday and completed my classic Skyrim.
12945,"be careful with this one, it tries to make you  think you're somewhere else"
12946,i love it
12947,One of the greatest RPGs ever! I would still play it if i didn't had an arrow in my knee.
12948,A giant attacked my house and stole my cows. 10/10 experience! Would play again!
12949,"A classical game. Base game has huge amount of hours of gameplay. Mods increase those hours even more.
If you don't even know skyrim... where were you?

You should  at least play Skyrim once in your lifetime (like many other classic games).
Nowadays it starts to feel outdated. But put a lightning mod and a few enviroment ones and it will feel a 2017 game (not bad for a 2011 game)"
12950,"NEVER GETS OLD
"
12951,Why am I asked to write a review? Everyone knows everything about this game already. Havent played yet? THen buy it!
12952,good game. good game.

13025,"grew up with the game, love it, would 100% recommend :)). great for just messing around and great lore! to this day not even I managed to finish playing the game, even after all these years. it costs a lot but its really worth it :))."
13026,I like :)
13027,Some people have been playing this game for 4000 hours. This is 2.5 years of a full-time job or degree. Only to those people I wouldn't recommend this game.
13028,"There is nothing I can add to the numerous reviews already written. Skyrim has become a benchmark for other cRPG games.

13041,made me moist
13042,Its a good game.
13043,how is this still so good a decade later
13044,Skyrim is a great open world RPG that defines its genre. At this point there isn't a single product with a screen that haven't had skyrim ported to it. Ignoring the community content (mods) this game wouldn't be amazing but with all the support it has recieved throughout the years it fantastic. Just make sure to download a few upgrades to graphics and bug fixes through a mod loader.
13045,Every so often you lure me back Todd
13046,big boobs
13047,great game :)
13048,Still waiting for TES VI

13062,jj
13063,pretty good
13064,Skyrim has a lot of depth to it. It has an amazing story with such great characters. It may be old but it got old with us playing it. Absolute masterpiece would definitely recommend.
13065,"  I remember playing this game on the ps3 when it first came out, and it was great. I think its funny that I bought it and modded it for 73hrs, never got past the first 20 mins because my multiple terabytes of mods. I don't think an explanation of why this game was great is needed, but if so just go on youtube. If you have never played an elder scrolls game I think choosing between Oblivion and Skyrim are great places to start."

13071,"Serana best waifu, now gonna go full HD"
13072,"I sorta started it a while back but now I really got into it and wow it's a blast! I'm doing a full mage playthrough and it's sorta annoying when your magika is empty and your enemy is still healthy, cause then you just gotta run and dodge until it regenerates. Something that helps is getting the impact perk on destruction and staggering your opponent repeatedly and letting your magika regen just a bit while they regather themselves so you can cast a few more firebolts. Also opening with an arrow sneak attack saves some magika while still getting good damage from a distance. There's all kinds of ways to approach it, just as with anything in this game! Go crazy, do all the sidequests, and have fun."
13073,the dragons are the best thing about skyrim and also the swimming underwater.
13074,Yes!

13086,Best game.
13087,fun
13088,"It's old. It's stupid. But it has more replayability than almost any other mainstream game, even after all this time. *Especially* with mods. But, try not to go too mod-crazy on your first playthrough. Only install SkyUI, and maybe a couple others. And make sure you don't do so until *after* you're through the game's opening sequences, to avoid bugs.

Unless, of course, it's a mod that affects the opening sequence. Then go nuts."
13089,You're finally awake
13090,"It's pretty good, especially with mods"
13091,"game doesnt even work, crashes almost every time i tab out, if i do manage to tab back in i can see both the ingame cursor and my desktop cursor and then even when i attempt to fix it with mods its still broken."

13093,"People like to joke about this game a lot but I legitimately think this is a really really good game and would play it for long amounts of time if I could. I know this specific version is harder to find now but it's also good for, for example, if your pc can't handle the special edition."
13094,Only play if you haven't played New Vegas before.

13098,"I don't know what to say about this game. This game is just mix of the adventure and fantasy. You would spend many hours.
The soundtrack is awesome. Tons of characters and quests. Graphics are amazing. (it's 2011 game). Price is also good, they should return on store again.

13123,When the Skyrim
13124,I liked the product.
13125,"Hands down, Skyrim is one of the best games of all time. It's up there with Minecraft, honestly. I cannot recommend this game highly enough- *hits blunt* OK, nOw I can. 
I have nearly 300 hours of gameplay logged, but I have barely scratched the surface of what's possible. And that's without mods that add content! Oh, speaking of mods, I would suggest downloading the Inigo follower mod for this- it will make for a much more immersive experience!"
13126,Story is very good and I love this game.
13127,"It is a beautiful adventure where you search throughout the landscape for adventure and treasure. How you do it is entirely up to you. It is an ""Open world"" so you can roam and explore cities, mountains, dungeons. The landscape is populated with an abundant list of people, creatures and of course; monsters. Have fun!"

13134,Still unplayable after all these years. Couldnt even get to the character creation this time.
13135,"Skyrim has incredible immersion and worldbuilding, and the attention to detail is amazing. There are plenty of bugs, but an infinitesimal amount of them are game-breaking. You can be whoever you want, interact with the environment around you, and utilize magic and weapons. In many rpgs, items exist solely for decoration, with fruit in a market stand or swords on display existing only for decoration, whereas in Skyrim, there exists nigh unlimited potential to interact with almost anything in the world."
13136,"[h1] Opening [/h1]
Bethesda has made yet another beautiful game for you to immerse yourself in. Even in 2021 this game has so much to offer. The visuals, storytelling and gameplay are all very compelling.

[h1] Visuals [/h1]
Whether you are traversing through the Jerall mountains or in the depths of Blackreach you will be amazed at the amount of detail put into the landscapes. Nine years after release Skyrim still looks visually stunning. If you would like to improve the visuals even more there is a wide variety of visual mod packs that can help make your game even more beautiful than it already is.

[h1] Story Telling [/h1]
The Elder Scrolls series always has a way of making the story very immersive. The storytelling in this game makes you have a connection with the environment around you. Characters are written very well with most of them having a very deep backstory. Although there are very static characters, you can see character development throughout the main story and side missions.

[h1] Combat [/h1]
This could be the part where a lot of people were turned off from playing skyrim. NPC bugs were very common in the original release. Skyrim’s combat can feel quite sluggish and slow at certain moments. The variety of weapons is nice though with it being similar to previous Elder Scrolls games."

13217,"This is one of the most amazing games that I've played.

The things you can do in Skyrim are extremely numerous and take you to an incredible journey.
First of all, you build the character the way you like it, if you want to cast spells you can cast spells, if you want to be a ninja you can be a ninja, a soldier, a priest, a mage, a dragonslayer, whatever suits your imagionation.
You'll encounter demons and various detities that send you on missions, you'll get to go in prison start a riot a murder your way out, encounter witches, dragons, vampires, werewolves, thieves, assassins, mages. The quests are just amazing, when I did the mage questline I felt like I was in the Harry Potter universe, felt immersed into the game.

13224,"There's a reason it was a game of the year and has continued to receive praise from its still very active player-base even 9 years later. It's a game worth sinking hundreds of hours into and there will be countless new experiences and numerous quests to fulfill throughout that time. Loads of immersive quests and characters as well as voice acting for everything there is to be voiced. Truly the best game I've ever played and will continue to play and come back to for years to come. Highly recommend to anyone who may be on the fence or curious to play an open world adventure type game. Or even to anyone just looking for something to play, this is a gem I'm so glad to have enjoyed on console years ago, and PC now and for the last few years."
13225,"a verified classic. Why Bethesda unlisted it, i never will know."
13226,i love this game im glad i chose to return to it and i missed the mods and this masterpiece of a game aka alot better with mods
13227,Mods galore
13228,Awesome
13229,"Morrowind was fun, but by the time they put this out, Bethesda quit trying.  The work is hack, lazy, nobody cares anymore.  A boring walking simulator where you spend hours climbing mountains to find quest sites, only to realize you have to try the other way up the mountain and waste half an hour at a time.  Boring, worn out quests that are just generic copies of older quests from other games.  It isn't just that you have to grind in this game, it is that it is never fun and the entire process is grinding and painful.  

Tired, worn out, miserable.  That's the only way to describe Skyrim, especially in relation to the series.  But:  we have marriage, and dragons, and blacksmithing!  A few extra little nicities to give meaning to an otherwise tired franchise."

[hr][/hr]
[b][i] Ok, let's do this. [/i][/b]

[i]So, Skyrim, should you buy it ?[/i]
If at this point you don't have it, I don't recommend it, it's a game from 2012 and it definetly didn't age well. I would say it's far more worth getting the Special Edition one which is the same game but with and updated graphics motor.

[b]So this review it's worth for both games.[/b]

Skyrim it's definetly the best one of The Elder Scrolls saga. Maybe some people would say otherwise but none can deny that this game is what gave Bethesda and TES saga the exposure and fame it so much needed (And sale numbers don't lie). 
It's an open world ambiented in medieval ages, so it's what you would expect from that: dragons, magic, swords and shields, lots and lots and lots (and lots) of quests to do and a huge map to explore (I'm not even counting the DLCs). It's a great game, you should get the SE even if, like me, you are not a fan of the Medieval genre in games. 
But there's bad things about this game aswell, not everything is nice and pretty. Since the SE is the same as this one, they conserved A LOT of game breaking bugs in the SE one that obviously are present in this game aswell, and I mean A LOT of game breaking bugs, characters not spawning, missions or markers not updating, missions telling you to talk to a dead npc, CTD issues, the IA and some parts of the pathfinding that it uses it's really poor, it's easy to exploit 2 skills to basically be a god within the first 20-30 minutes of game, and a large list of etc. 
There's, however, a glimmer of hope in the hole of bugs, the community. I'm not even lying, there must be hundreds of thousands of mods for this game and that's only counting pages  that are usually SFW like NexusMod, I don't know how many if I include pages like LoversLab (NSFW).
But wait, why are the mods so good? There's a huge variety for you to customize the game to your liking. You want better graphics ? Got it. You like more responsives weapons and controls ? You can get it. And most importantly, there's a mod that fixes a lot of bugs in the Skyrim vanilla game (Skyrim Unofficial Patch) so you can actually play the game without having to do backups of your saves everytime you exit the game.

[b] So, should you get this game ? Definetly no.
Should you get the SE of this game ? Hell yeah [/b]

[b][i]Final score: 10/10 arrows in the knee [/i][/b]"
13237,good

13242,"*insert Todd Howard meme here* It's Skyrim, you've almost certainly played it or seen gameplay of it- and it's definitely worth a go. Wait for a sale, though, it's an old game despite the constant re-releases and I wouldn't pay like £30 for it now."
13243,stealth archer
13244,Just got back into this game. If you haven't played in a long time. I'd say play again and check out the new mods. The last time I played was probably five years ago. While I modded then. The mods available now blow the old ones away.
13245,"The game softlocked on the ""A cornered rat"" quest, console commands couldn't do jack shit.

Fuck you Todd.

Finally managed to beat the game! I just feel fucking empty after doing it."

13250,Amazing game with great replay-ability. Barely halfway through one play through of the game with over one hundred hours and the ability to mod it means you can make it the way you want to play it.
13251,"bEST sANDBOX, oPEN WORLD rpg EVER. We play the series from TES 3, which is Morrowwind"

13293,i downloaded nude mod and it good
13294,Best Game Ever.
13295,yes
13296,"Loser game, for people who look like Dan Schneider"
13297,"Lots of fun. its never to late to start learning new things. i went from two handed to destruction/conjuration magic. it makes you lvl up faster actualy. very fun, enjoyable."
13298,Just YES
13299,epic
13300,If you don't like skyrim then you're dumb!
13301,Most play I've ever gotten out of a single game. Excellent.
13302,"It's Skyrim. You should know by now if you like it. If you do, buy it...if not, well...don't!

I own it 6 times over, at this point and just started a new playthrough a few days ago!"
13303,most played game. not an amazing game but i still love it
13304,fantastic
13305,One Of The Best Games I've Played
13306,Üpris hea!
13307,"it skyrim and run for many years. already got skyrim se, just wanna know the differences"
13308,all of it
13309,"I'm glad kinguin was still selling keys for Skyrim Legendary Edition, look, I love the special edition of Skyrim, but I really wanted to get the original version as well. Kind of unfair that they axed being able to buy it directly from Steam. Also, fuck you Bethesda for removing it you money grabbing bastards."
13310,A beautiful game even though it's so old now I still can't grow bored of it I do suggest modding it though with the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch from nexus mods it doesn't mess with the game just fixes alot of bugs.
13311,Very good
13312,"3/5
5/5 with mods"
13313,never should have come here
13314,"Easy play, large world and loads of mods to ersonalize"
13315, This game can be played for years without doing everything that's possible. Its a gem if you like this type of game you should definitely check this out. Plays best on Win 7 64 bit with a decent graphics card and processor.
13316,its skyrim
13317,"I played this, my german ex played this, my friends played this, so i think IT JUST WORKS"
13318,yes
13319,Good game.
13320,This games is really good i would still recommend this game even thought its been 9 years. the modding community is very supportive the mods they make will truly make your Skyrim gameplay immersive i got this game back in 2011 i was still a kid and as kid i really had fun playing this game then i got back last year download the cracked RG mechanics i didn't how many hours played but it was a lot and now i bought in steam i could have got special edition but I'm just using a laptop i would buy special edition if i have a good gaming Pc. now the lore in this game is really good it makes you feel that you are a part of this world the characters are great they really have a great back ground each and everyone of them. besides from the bugs this game could have been a lot more better if it had classes i know you could do that in the game kind of but in oblivion it had classes but the problem with that game is its combat and the NPCS but it turned into a meme anyways. i still have lots of thoughts in this game but i wont make it that long 10/10 the game is perfect and would REALLY recommend this game either if your'e an elder scrolls fan or a nerd that plays D&D and watches Lord of the rings trilogy on Blu ray along with the hobbit trilogy.
13321,good game
13322,"Just a little playthrough, pretty fun when outside is nice and quiet, yet rainy and dark"
13323,"Love Skyrim. Played around 240 hours before I wrote this review. Best part about the game is moding it. 
Runs on old and new hardware. Played originally at 1080p with a GTX580 Maxed I believe. Put the game down for a few years picked it up again and played Max out 60FPS with a GTX1070."
13324,Just Buy it
13325,Mods make me forgive bethesda for waiting 50 years for a new game.
13326,"best rpg
"
13327,"ye, pretty good. get some mods, make the game your own. have fun."
13328,fuck skyrim morrowind4life
13329,Very good game.

13331,its skyrim.

13333,"Might as well leave a review in memory of Satan (Todd Howard) himself and Bethesda. Great game, bought more releases of it than I'd like to admit."
13334,This is The One.
13335,help
13336,"Great Game 10/10 Chef Kisses, would play again and again and again."
13337,"yes

13338,Classic game. Almost too many cool things to do.
13339,Simply amazing game and god knows where my review f-ed off to?! Seems it was gone.
13340,To be continued....
13341,"amazing stories, art, and combat. very addicting."
13342,สำหรับผมเกมๆนี้คือเกมที่สนุกมากๆ และยังเป็นเกมที่ช่วยสอนภาษาอังกฤษผมผ่านเรื่องราวต่างๆ มากมายผ่านการผจญภัยและภารกิจต่างๆ ถ้าคุณเป็นคนที่ชอบเล่นเกม แนวผจญภัยและแอคชั่นผมบอกเลยว่าสนุกและ คุ้มค่าสำหรับการซื้อมาติดเครื่องแน่นอนนน!!

13347,cool
13348,Koolio
13349,"Less of a pure RPG and more of an action RPG, it's still a ton of fun even after all these years.  I totally recommend it and the modding community will expand your playtime far past what vanilla can offer."
13350,fusrodahhhhh
13351,its skyrim KEKW
13352,"Warning! Playing this game is extremely enjoyable and addictive! One of the best RPGs Iv'e played and I played since Ultima V, Xeen IV, Baldurs Gate, Diablo etc,, There are some classic elements missing like having a team!
However what Skyrim has to offer with character creation and development along with gorgeous scenery and gameplay you fall in love with world of Skyrim!"
13353,"Best RPG game, when i play."
13354,You all know
13355,"Its a very immersive game and can keep you entertained for hours, I recommend playing it without mods then playing it with any mods you want. There is something about no mod skyrim that is so good."
13356,Still a really good game. I Lovve this game and its still ineresting with all of the sidequests.
13357,i modded this game way too much
13358,love skyrim
13359,"one of my fav games
"
13360,"I recommend buying Skyrim, but only this version. Don't let Todd fool himself into thinking he can release the same game two dozen times and get away with it.

 I got the special edition upgrade for free, but I never play it since mods aren't cross compatible. Mods are the way to go, especially for quality of life fixes. Lord knows Bethesda struggles with those things."
13361,"So. Many. Bugs.
Fix this shit maybe?

Suggestions to Bethesda to improve the games functionality.

-Toggleable World Map. (filter to show only mines, only caves, property you own, etc).

-Higher Base Carry Weight. (if you can carry 100k pieces of gold + 1000's of arrows, then realistically, we can have at least 500 starting carry weight).

-Higher Base Vendor Gold
-More Inventory Categories (i.e. Ores, Ingots, Soul Gems, Jewellery, etc)
-Whistle Button For Horse

-More Than Two Adoptable Children. (if you can own up to 8 houses, you should be allowed to send any 2 orphans to be looked after by your housecarls (even if you are a mostly absent father/mother due to adventuring, it's much better that some of these orphans at least have a roof over their head and a warm place to sleep)).

Yes, I realise that most of these things can be installed, or fixed by just using a mod for this or that, but it's not about that.

It's about not having so many issues here and there with the base game that you end up resort to using mods because the base game lacks so many things.

[Edit]: Beast form won't cooldown. The No One Escapes Cidna Mine bugged my fast travel so I had backtrack a whole hour of gameplay.

Cannot wait to see what other bugs this game has in store for me :)))))"
13362,Nice long game play available 80 hour plus gmae plus replaybaility
13363,i love anal
13364,i said i liked it what more do you want
13365,It's ok.
13366,best rpg game in my opinion! 10/10!
13367,"if your on the store page and you see buy instead of play? *cocks gun* ya better change that, or there wont be just an arrow in ya knee"
13368,yes
13369,"Its a very immersive game and can keep you entertained for hours, I recommend playing it without mods then playing it with any mods you want. There is something about no mod skyrim that is so good."
13370,"very involved
"
13371,Good Replayability.
13372,best game
13373,Can't stand this game at all.
13374,Jesus approves.
13375,Fus Roh Dah
13376,love the game
13377,10/10 would be a lizard man buying cat wares again
13378,No need for words
13379,"Great game,still playing it after all these years after it's release."
13380,10/10
13381,Even tho its getting old its still a great game
13382,it just works
13383,"Epic.
"
13384,egg totally approves!
13385,dragons
13386,Good
13387,Top tier graphics
13388,Absolutely facinating and a pleasure to play time and time again. Any that haven't played it so far should and the modding community never dissapoints. With VERY FEW exceptions theres pretty much a mod to suit anyone's desires.
13389,"Allright, so I played a catgirl running around slaying humans in a feudal nordic dreamworld where everyone is named Sven. On my way I made friends, I killed my friends, I slayed dragons, I hanged out with daedras, I cooked food, I drank mead, I became a ranking member of the Thieves Guild, I dressed in fancy clothes and swaggered in the Cloud District and I collected shitloads of insectoid eggs beneath a spooky tower. 

Did I have a great time? Hell yes.. 
Was it smooth as silk and without any flaws? Hell no.. 

Skyrim is a weird game, it has tons of story, a completly egalitarian world where everyone is living a dream until they get the legendary arrow to their kneecap and ends up on patrolduty and alot to spend time on. Is the time well spent? Well that is the main question. The combat feels clunky at times, the stealthgames is kinda ass, the magic is the worst of the lot and somehow me being the headhoncho of both the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood and the mages guild feels a bit, well, weird.. Some choices have little to no consequences, others you cant really fathom. In the end however this is a fine piece of entertainment and I highly recommend it if you like high adventure and sprawling worlds. If you are going to play this game do yourself a favor and download The Paarthurnax Dilemma."
13390,"One of my daughters got bugged selling flowers and had to use a mod to get her back. As soon as she spawned in my house i couldn't talk to her so sometimes she spents days lost outside while her sister is being a good daughter and i can only see her if she finds the way back by herself. She doesn't recognize me as her mother but she asks for money everytime i go home to leave stuff and i'm starting to hate kids just because of her.
There's also hella dragons that f**k you up unexpectedly while you're just chilling around haunting or doing secundary missions and i'm starting to hate dragons as well cuz no matter how many of them you kill, there's still gonna be more. 
Last thing is that my horse gets bugged in every place he cans, citizens like to stumble upon everything or get stuck in random corners and the map routs are worse than those on my grandpa's 50 y/o gps. 
Recommended 100%, every minute i spent on this game (and will spend) was worth it and i'm in love with all of it."
13391,":)
"
13392,This is a timeless game; i have played this for many years and always come back to it.
13393,"Was fun in many ways, and still is fun even after 8 or more years since it's release. Great Game, end all be all."
13394,10/10 would date Serana
13395,"More new player friendly than previous TES games, better graphics and more interesting people."
13396,a
13397,"Still one of the best.
Everyone claims mods are the way to go, but I find them to make the game even less stable.  Stability is the biggest problem with this game, expect crashes.  Worth it."
13398,"Mods help to beautify the experience, love the replay value of the game, minimal issue in gameplay."
13399,fun
13400,"Legendary game, if played today without mods can show its age and wonky structure, but the world, quests, music and atmosphere make it incredible to play, plus the modding can completely transform the game and tune it to your liking, absolutely recommended for everyone"
13401,"Best game ever made!
"
13402,"I had a period where I hated Skyrim because it was so popular and its predecessor Oblivion sort of got the shaft in terms of public popularity. Now I'm older and I no longer care about dumb hipster things like how many people play or know about a certain game. Skyrim is a fantastic game; ate up so many hours of my life back on the xbox 360, and being able to come back later and play it on PC breathed a serious new life into it. Basic combat in any elder scrolls game is garbage, but modded skyrim combat? You can get this game feeling like Seriko if you get the right mods running. Plus there are just so many mods that add incredible, Bethesda quality (or higher sometimes lol) content into the game.

Even if you don't want to mod the game for whatever reason, there is just so much to get lost in. 

Really the reason I wanted to write this review is because I wanted to address the fact that Bethesda gets a lot of hate online, especially with pretentious youtuber ""video essayists"" but I feel like a lot of those people forget just how high this studio sets the bar. They make one blunder with Fallout 76 and suddenly people are saying ""bethesda was never great!"" while forgetting the fact that Bethesda was the very studio that set their expectations so high.

anyways uh yeah, it's skyrim. good game, play it again maybe idk"
13403,SKYRIMMMUUUU
13404,THERE ARE NO GAMES BETTER THAN THIS.
13405,"uh, its skyrim... why wouldn't you play it..."
13406,v good  i liek
13407,Everything. Even bugs
13408,"Skyrim is a great game, even in 2020. The ability to mod the game greatly enhances the experience you can get so many hours out of the game. I would definitely recommend it."
13409,"Excellent game. Great graphics
"
13410,My hours Are unhealthy but very very enjoyable.
13411,awesome
13412,One of the best games of all time
13413,its ok
13414,fun
13415,"A generic story fell in love with the blandest rpg mechanics and together they spawned this exercise in boredom. while many may praise it, skyrim is undoubtedly a grindfest and, even worse, a time waster. there are a few quest here and there that are fun, but, overall, the game is hardly able to give players a feeling of achieving anything. Just grind-grind-grind through endless, cookie-cutter missions. I suppose it's fun for small children, who can turn on god mode and roam the landscape (which is nice, save for the bland colors). I'd write some more, but it's hardly worth the time. If rpg is your game, try Fallout New Vegas"
13416,"I've been playing this game on and off since it came out in 2011, the other day I realised I had spent over 100 hours on it and 9 years after it was released I had never completed the main quests!  I had been spending my time wandering around this massive beautiful game doing all the other interesting things you can do and i've not even touched the expansion pack content either!  Over the last few weeks I have rethought my life and decided that I must complete the main quest line, this game still looks utterly brilliant and plays beautifully, it hasn't dated at all.  Top marks!"
13417,cmon guys  its SKYRIM
13418,"honestly, it's just really pretty"
13419,good
13420,is good. big booms.
13421,good game.
13422,"Really great D&D game. I have both Skyrim and Skyrim SE. I wanted to play the original version so I bought this a bit back.
"
13423,.
13424,"It's Skyrim, man"
13425,i love skyrim
13426,game very good
13427,Fun game and very easy to get lost in a different engaging reality <3
13428,"I held off playing this game for a decade.  I was afraid of the time commitment.  The reality is you can pause this game any time you want and take a break.  I love that!  I wish I had not waited so long.  An immersive game, kept relative with an amazing community creating incredible mods for visual and game quality.  Play this game, it is worth starting even in 2020."
13429,"It's a fun game with great workshop support. It's a well known game, so I won't say much. :)"
13430,its K
13431,baguette
13432,"I felt like playing mod for Fallout 3 sometimes, but that's pretty good RPG. Exploring, getting new gear and improving your skills - if you like it, you should give Skyrim a try,"
13433,Like the way the controls are configured
13434,It's Ok.
13435,Kill people burn down villages but thing is I made a entire village mad by killing their chicken so watch out for that
13436,its good
13437,best game ever but special edtion have more mods
13438,aweom
13439,"A beautiful game

     I transitioned from Xbox to PC and it's a beautiful change. I downloaded mods to make it look better and fix some bugs, and this game is astonishing. I've loved every moment of playing it since I first bought it, and it's still worth it to this day. I'll recommend playing this game until I'm old and can't even play anymore. 

The game is great, however, try to buy it on sale anyways since its old."
13440,this game is one of the best i have ever played from one of the best story lines to some of the best graphics on an open world game. i would recomend this game to anyone from a casual player to a hard core player. the only problem to this game is some of the minor glitches and how adicting it can be to play. i  would recomend this game to anyone
13441,Very good game
13442,best game ever
13443,just buy the special addition
13444,Simply unique and extremely story rich.
13445,It's okay.
13446,What.. your NOT PLAYING YET... Increadable...
13447,I liked it very much!

13449,"Great game to play, a big map to explore and a bunch of loot to claim, long storyline and not one boring mission."
13450,Very good story and gameplay
13451,"It's fun, but it can become boring if you don't like open world games"
13452,"One of the best RPG there is. If you want to play one of the most engrossing games ever made. Then wait no more. Skyrim is it. Endless quests, and hundreds of places to go. It will delight the mind and eye. Enjoy!"
13453,YES
13454,"Who wouldn't recommend this game!
"
13455,9/10
13456,"The amount of things to do in this game is astounding, and that's before considering DLC and workshop stuff. I play this version instead of the Special Edition because my computer apparently can't handle it. But my question is that why would Bethesda take this off the store and replace it for the special edition and not just keep both?"
13457,"thousands of hours of play time involved with this game, now across several platforms, but is by far prettiest on PC."
13458,"Literally what can you even add to the discussion about Skyrim at this point. It was and still is the benchmark for open world fantasy games and defined the genre for the 2010s. It's insanely accessible and can accommodate virtually any play style, though there are definitely those that fare alot better the later into the games levelling system you get. The combat is nothing to write home about and has never been the draw for Elder Scrolls Games anyway, the real star of the show is Skyrim itself. A beautifully realized and interesting nordic fantasy world with interesting side quests and flavor to be found around nearly every corner. Quests are very hit and miss but more often than not they hit. I'd say the Main Quest Line is actually the most boring of them all, which is pretty standard for Elder Scrolls games. Come for the fantasy role playing, stay for the ability to scream enemies off a mountain."
13459,"What can I say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said? I've got over 500 hours on Special Edition alone (on the PC at least. Have a few more on PS4), over 500 hours on the Legendary Edition of the game as well. To round it all up, I just purchased the game on PCVR so that I can explore in that way. The game without mods is pretty good for an Elder Scrolls game. The modding community is HUGE and there are some very good ones out there that offer an additional amount of enjoyment to your game as well, but I won't dive into those on this review.

I started playing Elder Scrolls games with Morrowind, which made me fall in love with the franchise. I played some Oblivion and some ESO, but Skyrim brought back my love for the franchise. Yes, some things are copy and paste. Yes, the game does have it's flaws, but for a (at the time) 9 year old game, it still holds it's charm. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the series and for some reason haven't played this game yet, pick it up and play. You won't hate yourself for it. Besides, like I said, there is a huge modding community which can add just about ANY kind of mod you can imagine to your game. As far as vanilla tho, it's still a good time and a must play for fans of the franchise"
13460,"If you've NEVER played Skyrim, take it from someone who rarely plays video games but when he  does, its Skyrim.  Thats not just a dos equis commercial, I truly mean it.  I've been playing this game since 2010.  I have it here, on my switch, and on a ps4 disc.  I'm not unusual either, or rare, there's a legion of us.  We are Skyrim.  If your life is monotonous, tedious, repetitive and just general unpleasant, join us.  We have wares if you have  coin.  And by wares I mean a home away from home.  Are you ready to come home?"
13461,mods are g
13462,One of the best games ever
13463,Great game
13464,If you don't have Skyrim your just not gaming right.
13465," Hello, today i am pretending i am a kotaku journalist for a day.

Skyrim is a pretty disappointing game. Earlier today my friends made fun of me for being a gaming journalist, first if all im a pretty avix gamer. I played a lot and i mean a llloootttt of candy crush. I still can't shake the fact that I have been told to go play nintendogs on easy. PLAYING GAEMS ON EASY IS NOTHING TO BE HARRASED FOR!!! So what i keep reloading my saves on xcom the devs made the game too hard anyways you have to be a no life to beat the game on hard. Anyways i wanted to play Skyrim since i couldn't stand cup head, didn't make it 2 levels in and i already wanted a refund and a public spology from the developer. Anyways everyone harrases bethesda over the dumbest stuff, it's not bethesdas fault that you didn't get a canvas bag, and you should be thankful for your 500 atoms, todd hiward is doing his best. My biggest complaint about Skyrim is that i can't play it on the OUYA or on my razer smart phone or on roblox. Seriously i can't get enough of Skyrim that i haven't even beaten it yet i dont know where to find the dragon man Everytime i google search where is dragon mans i keep finding a shooting range in Colorado. Like wtf guns kill people i need to find the Skyrim dragon man. Anyways too much water"
13466,ITS A GREAT GAME
13467,Mod it.
13468,game is hot doodoo water.
13469,great game
13470,why dont you have it pussio
13471,"I can't stop playing.

I CAN'T STOP PLAYING.

On a more serious note, it's a super fun and replayable game and is what introduced me to the Elder Scrolls franchise as a whole. The graphics without mods are okay, but mods make them much better (mods make pretty much lots of things better but it has a TON of content in it without them too).

I highly recommend for someone who loves wandering around, killing things, or just roleplaying as your character or taking the scenery in. And you can play it practically FOREVER. Most of the quests are fetch quests though, so they could learn a few things from Oblivion, and this game will coddle and baby you unlike Morrowind. But it's still amazing in its own way!

9/10"
13472,Lots of memories playing this game
13473,It's a very addicting game if you like open map rpg games :D 10/10 would recomend
13474,best game ever wow holy moly this game totally 1 of a kind cant compare wow geez woah
13475,A must have in you library.
13476,I dont even know how much time i wasted on this game that time ain't even close xD between the content and the mods this game is endless and for that its a 10/10
13477,swag
13478,was fun
13479,funn
13480,"is epic
played on xb1 now here"
13481,"""It Just Works.""-Godd Howard"
13482,It is a great game short main story but plenty of side quests and three expansions.
13483,"I respect all the modders, who worked for this game.
But, the story is bad. The game has always bugs. It needs other mods to fix it. If there have been no independent modders, this game would be so boring. Soundtrack is not professional. Graphics are not good. They need other mods.  At least, there is such a tool like the Creation Kit. Creating a follower, a house, a inn, it's good enough for me. I don't play the game anymore. It's so violent."
13484,177 Hours played speaks for itself.
13485,"You've played for 165 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?
Yes I would. Indeed."
13486,Very good game quite a few glitches though
13487,"Jesus, you need to mod skyrim in order to have the full experience. 
Legendary Edition is inferior to Special Edition

But if you swear.. that you cannot run and buy Special Edition.. Get this Version of Skyrim 
Special Edition is more stable when it comes to modding :) 

Buy at full price?
> Hell no, get it on sale"
13488,Good story. Even after a decade.
13489,"9 years after launch, still a great RPG"

"
13493,NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE
13494,"my only complaint is the way the save game files are set up. it is garbage. i lost a 100% completed game because i had too many save game files and it dropped it off. it completely disappeared, it wasn't even in my game folders as a file, it was completely deleted by the game."
13495,"My favorite game from The Elder Scrolls!
I love every little detail in the game, starting with the intro soundtrack, just marvelous!
If you played it, you know what I'm talking about. If you didn't, well don't just stand around, buy it and enjoy it!"
13496,"I was addicted with this back then, I guess!

Dragons, vampires, puzzles, cool armors, dark side quests what else do you need?

I will buy to my Nintendo switch too!"
13497,Everyone should play skyrim at some point <3
13498,A really good game.
13499,"I've played all of the Elder Scrolls, so needless to say I love this game! (Ive played a lot more than it says I have!). One of the best RPG's. The countless quests and side quests to do it amazing and its hard to get bored. If you're on the fence, just get it.

I have been playing for years on all types of various platforms, even on Switch! XD I highly recommend, I mean whoever is reading this has probably already played it, but if not, that's unheard of!"
13519,"I played this game many times and addicted the only thing why I played in pc version bec. the loading time is much more faster than my PS3 version of skyrim, teleporting on PS3 version such a drag! took you very long time to load the game."

13521,This will devour all your free time and make you beg for more.
13522,"Death is a concept, when I bought this piece of art I hung it on my wall, then I fell asleep that night, woke up and all I heard was: ""You. You're finally awake.""

13589,Nice. . .
13590,"There are so many ways, to play the way you care to."
13591,Really loved playing Skyrim and exploring all the sites.  Was a lot of fun and enjoyed all the careful detail and things you could do in the game.  Loved the mods that could be used.  Great game.
13592,"It's my favourite game of all times, just amazing all the things to do, npc's stories. so many possibilities"

13596,This is the most replayable open-world RPG since the Fallout series. 💯
13597,"*Opens the map to teleport*
*Epic battle music plays* 
*You look around. Everywhere. Up. Down. West. East.*
*Music intensifies*
*You sigh as you try to search for that enemy*
*After some time you spot a small crab hastily (but yet slowly) making its way towards you*
*You shoot an arrow*
*Time slows. Arrow flies through the air*

(This is supposed to be some epic moment).

You think you're about to headshot that crab, but you're wrong.
The slowed down scene, ends with the arrow hitting some wild flower instead.
___________________________________________________

Though this game is known for having quite a few bugs (not that text over is a bug, it's just there to make you really feel disappointed, in a good way), it's still a good game. Also, a lot of the bugs are funny, which, makes it totally tolerable, or in some cases even worth it. So if you've thought about buying Skyrim, here's some random thoughts:

● The soundtracks in this game is pretty good. 
● The story I won't really comment on, since I've probably just been thieving and doing sneaky archery the last 200 hours.
● Ironically enough, I've not finished the game. Chose not to do the last part. 
● You can buy a horse, but It'll run back to it's original owner anyway. 
● You can steal a horse, but i'll run back to where you stole it.
● But you can get a loyal horse later anyway.
● Put a bucket over people's head to steal everything they have to sell without them knowing anything. (Note that the bucket will fall off after a while).
● Don't get stuck in between the bowl on top of the bench in the general store in Solitude and the chandalier. You'll *never* get out, trust me. Reload or die in there.
● You can glitch yourself through doors, and go underground for all the loot with one simple tool; a wooden plate.
● I have *strong* arachnophobia, but spiders in this game are totally fine. (Others though, do share my opinion).
● Followers are annoying. Especially Lydia (the first one you get). They block every entrance you're gonna use. If you're trying to be sneaky, they'll make sure everyone will see you. They'll get stuck in caves, and you won't even notice that they're gone because you've had no problems with anything the last 30 minutes. Then you'll have no clue *which* cave they're in, because you've been in 5 in a row. Then they'll die, if you didn't accidentally finish them off earlier while they were down.
● The level system is good, and there's a lot to choose from.
● You can climb a mountain for 2 hours, just to figure out that it's the wrong one when you've reached the top.
● You can climb the right mountain this time, now that you know it's where you're supposed to be. Using a lot of time, just to figure out that there was a staircase all the way up, when you get to the top.
● You can save a city from a dragon, but accidentally pick up a potato, and you have the whole town after you.

These things may sound bad, but if you save often it won't be a problem. (Except for those wasted hours climbing those mountains). All in all, good game.

i used to play it back in the xbox days then it died where it would just hang; 
Now that i have a better computer, been playing and trying to build up the hours again.

plus mods!!! its better of the get the special version instead of this one so you can get the mods to play with other players!

13623,good
13624,It's Skyrim.
13625,10/10 One of the best games of all time
13626,gf
13627,With a great modding community Bethesda is still taking your money.
13628,"Skyrim is very easy to get into, however there is barely anything to get really invested into in vanilla game (even with DLCs).

Main Quest is bad (it forced so many retcons it's ridiculous), 
Civil War is simplistic and badly thought out, guilds  (well, more like factions) are just ""meh"" compared to other games (including previous in the series). 
There are some fun sidequests though (many Daedric ones, family feud in Whiterun, and some others).

Environmental story-telling is occasionally really good (figuring out what happened just by looking at environment), like that myster in Dawn Star's lighthouse.

Combat is crude and while ""it just works"", it's nothing more than that. You need to go out of your way to make combat require any serious thought (like restricing yourself to roleplay a character a certain way and not use other, often easier solutions that don't fit your character's ideal playstyle). Stealth archery is broken and is a meme for a reason. Magic is mostly about healing and damaging enemies in three flavors (fire, ice, lightning). You can't really play a true summoner (that is, summon a creature and support it further) since there's no substantiall way to support your allies other than healing them (why bother with summons when you get many followers for free or almost-free).

Game is also ugly (and it was even on day one). That's a real shame, because the compositions are actually really good and you can see the talent of artists and designers working on them.

Oh and bugs. Hundreds and hundreds of bugs, but I'm sure that by now, everybody interested in this game know about it.

So far my review has been mostly negative, so why am I recommending this game then? Mods.
It's unbelievable what passionate creators managed to do without access to the game's source code - completely new functionalities, ""jiggle physics"" both for characters as well as various pieces of their equipment (so no, not just NSFW stuff), magic effects that make Skyrim's originals look like someone's first go at magic system,  more regular stuff like armors, weapons, clothes, custom followers and of course plenty of new lands to explore (there are few mods like that bigger than many official DLCs for modern games). And of course huge amount of graphical improvements - high quality textures, models, animations, post process shaders, lightning overhauls, etc.
Also unofficial patches that many bigger mods actually require, that fix hundreds of bugs in vanilla game.

Overall, I'd give un-modded Skyrim 6/10 but with mods (and how easy it is to access them, both via workshop and via external sites), I can give it 8/10. Sadly, Creation Engine's limitations can't be completely overcome even by the best modders which makes the game often very unstable (even without mods).
Special Edition supposedly helps with that but I haven't got a chance to really play that upgraded version though."

13630,"Skyrim is a great RPG and mods can elevate it even further, definitely a must play."
13631,Skyrim along with every game in the Elder Scrolls series is a game to get lost in. It is a game to relax and get lost in.
13632,"It's very good, go get the special edition if you're reading this in 2020 and download Mods"

13637,"It's Skyrim it has more potential than any other game you'll play download a few mods and get ready to play this game for hundreds if not thousands of hours.  Every where has somewhere to explore, the combat feels great, and it has a fun story with great role playing elements."

Feck off bethesda, idk why you are hiding this game and making it unlisted. Let people buy the original game to enjoy. 

10/10 would kill alduin again.

(also its only 6 gbs to download a fully open world game with hundreds of quest, a full story and more. what isn't there to need?)"

13684,"[h1] Customized Fantasy Adventure [/h1]

This is a Bethesda product- for those who don't already know what that means, expect numerous glitches or programming errors.  To get the absolute most out of this game, modding is a must.  At the very least, there are unofficial patches available that remove most of the worst issues.  Personally, I'd also recommend some of the texture packs that alter the game's graphics a little bit- Skyrim was a valiant attempt at photo-realistic fantasy in 2011, but the game's age shows a bit today.

I've heard numerous arguments over the game's control interface and menus.  Honestly, I've never had much of a problem with them, but I use a controller, and recommend doing so for this style of game.  Your experience may vary (likely for the worse) if you prefer keyboard+mouse here.

Voice acting is also a little off, though vastly superior to Oblivion's.  Get used to hearing a lot of the same voice actors over and over again.  Music is understated, but usually atmospheric enough to keep your mind in the game and not wondering why you're listening to Euro-Techno in the middle of medieval Sweden.

The story itself isn't anything particularly stellar, but the ability to explore your abilities can be quite entertaining.  Coming from Dark Souls, I had to get used to just how effortless the light attacks are in The Elder Scrolls.  Shouts are meme'd to hell and back, but really are fun to play with when you can find an opportunity to use them.

Still, if you are able to look past these issues, Skyrim can provide a versatile and fun fantasy adventure."

"
13694,"I would absolutely recommend this to people if they're into this type of genre. With mods, you can play so many different ways, it doesn't have to end! I prefer a PC. The most mods are available using this platform. Looking forward to the next chapter with new challenges."

13699,can be replayed for a different experience each time
13700,vast world great enviorment
13701,la base
13702,The classic rpg
13703,"this is totally not tod hoawerd l ilike this game very musch so. 10 out of ten very gewd
"
13704,good
13705,Brilliant and immersive  fantasy role playing game
13706,pee
13707,GOAT game. Nuff' said
13708,lots of fun.  Lots of variety.  You can design your character any way you want and play him any way you want.   More fun than a basket full of puppies.
13709,I like stabbing the chickens.
13710,Legendary game. Still one of my favorites after 9 years
13711,Buy this. You won't have friends or a life for ~2 years but we must make this sacrifice in the name of the divines.
13712,"Very awesome Game!
If you're a Fan of Open-World Games and a Game with many Hours, this is defiently a Game for you!
The Soundtrack fits to the Atmosphere and the Graphics are still awesome for a 2011 Game. You defiently should get the DLCs as well.
You have alot of Sidequests and they pull you deeper into the Story."
13713,"Play this game until you need mods, then add mods and play for another 3 years."
13714,GREAT GAME. Had it in the PS3 years ago and it still doesn't disappoint. Also recommend playing Oblivion
13715,Never should have come here!
13716,Yes fun game
13717,If you like slicing dragons and shouting people off cliffs and actually forgetting about real life. Yeah this is a fun game. Follow me DnD nerds!
13718,fun
13719,horse
13720,im only playing the old one because my laptop barely runs special editions
13721,So many different paths to choose from and lots to do.
13722,cool game
13723,"I mean, come on, it's Skyrim."
13724,"Hey, you, you're finally awake."
13725,UNP is better than CBBE.
13726,"Great game still
"
13727,one of the best games ever
13728,Great game with huge world and total freedom to meander as you like
13729,It's still pretty good.
13730,very nice
13731,"We all know this game by now, even if you don't know this game personally, you know of it and you know you'll enjoy it. You are the Dragonborn. 

Remember these two things 
     1. Fus Ro Dah!
     2. ""I am sworn to carry your burdens."" - Lydia"
13732,Best game ever. I keep coming back to it and restarting new campaigns.
13733,It is a great game just like the other elder scrolls games before. It is really fun to replay to this day. So if you like open world rp games and fighting dragons get this game.
13734,"Really liked this when it first came out but now it just feels like a watered down versions of the games that came before it.  It's the incarnation of trading away engaging gameplay for graphics.  

There's also always a stupid mountain in the way of where you wanna go."
13735,Pretty dang good.
13736,"One of my all time favorite games. I bought this game for console around the time it first released which is essentially what introduced me to both the series and gaming as a whole. Would definitely recommend playing if you haven't already, you won't regret it."
13737,If you know you know
13738,"Fun, huge rpg worth playing"
13739,"I do not care for it as an adventure game, an RPG, or even a racing simulator.  'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim' is an incredibly watered down RPG, which is great for accessibility, but does little for my engagement."
13740,One of the best RPG's of a time.
13741,Brilliant in so many ways. That's all that needs to be said at this point
13742,"I mean, I just like to mod my game until it crashes. Also, boobs."
13743,"This game was released in 2011 and to this day, in 2020, I still find myself coming back to it again and again. The replay ability of this game is amazing. The expansion packs are great, too."
13744,too much foul language.
13745,"Is this a good game? 
200 Game of the Year Awards.
I've purchased on the following:
- PC (Twice) Regular and Special
- Xbox 360
- PlayStation 4
- Switch
- PlayStation 4 VR

Yeah it's a damn good game.  Apparently I can't get enough of it.

13749,kinda like skyrim
13750,ya
13751,big yes ))
13752,"in short

13762,no.
13763,Skyrim.
13764,great game
13765,its coo
13766,"Nice graphics, interesting content, immersive scenarios, complex NPC'S with A.I. Also an unintended emergent A.I. glitch that created a 'twin' NPC that interacts with it's original with 7k lines of dialogue in an radiant A.I. structure. Very interesting!  Especially over time (4k game hours approx.) when there is an increase in awareness and adaptability in their mutual behavior.  The Vilja Twins."
13767,"Bro, it's Skyrim."
13768,"Awesome game, many mods, many hours..."
13769,Best fucking game
13770,hell yeah br0ther it's skyrim i mean what else do you need someone to say about it.
13771,"One can not go wrong with Skyrim, very chill and bugs are now just fuuny."
13772,yes
13773,What more can be said about this game that hasen't already. If you don't have it get it end of story.
13774,brilliant game absolute classic
13775,one of the best

13782,Good
13783,"fucking great game
"
13784,yes
13785,"Like all Bethesda games it's better once the modders have gotten ahold of it. Make sure to get Live Another Life, it lets you start as a bunch of different characters in a bunch of different situations, makes the game much better."
13786,it's ok
13787,Skyrim is as a close as it can get to me experiencing that Middle Earth feels. honestly
13788,good

13795,yes
13796,best game
13797,"Ive been playing this game since it was first released on a variety of consoles. This game has aged incredibly well and It doesn't get old. The graphics are phenomenal, the story is amazing, and the gameplay is fun."
13798,How much could I have done in life with the hours I put into this game?
13799,"it's skyrim, why don't you own it already??"
13800,"it's skyrim, duh."
13801,"IF YOU LOVE OLD SCHOOL RPGs and or the Fallout series, GET THIS GAME!!!"
13802,Best game ever
13803,a fantastic game to get lost in with a plethora of options for your character
13804,I can't finish this game since 2012 because I feel so lonely in this beautiful world of Skyrim. I'd like to play Skyrim 2. Me like it.
13805,It's a Good game :)
13806,Pure awesomness
13807,ye
13808,Favourite game
13809,I love Skyrim as much as I love Keanu Reeves
13810,It's an abandoned game.
13811,it good
13812,"One of the best RPGs of all time!
Now lets wait for the Elder Scrolls 6"
13813,s
13814,Mhm
13815,"Years after its release, Skyrim is still an awesome game to play. More side quest than you can count. You could do side quests for days before even starting the main storyline. I love this game. Highly recommend it to any RPG or openwold fan. Right now, I just want to get high enough to fight the Ebony Knight, but I'm not there yet :-)"
13816,The console commands help with fast travel.  Some of the quests can not be finished this way.
13817,"mod it


















































now"
13818,"At this point, saying that Skyrim is a great game is like saying that Keanu Reeves is a great guy. We all know it, it has been absorbed into the collective psyche of the gaming universe. We all love Skyrim. We all need Skyrim. We all are Skyrim. Join us."
13819,"One of my favorite games, I've been playing this since it first came out. The sceneries and the storyline is amazing. Although there as some few things missing but you can download mods for that. I highly recommend"
13820,Good. Have over 1000 hours over all versions on other devices.
13821,I have put over 500 hours into this game and I have never come close to beating the main story. I regret nothing.
13822,Amazing game and Great with Mods :D
13823,pog
13824,Best RPG game I have ever played!!!
13825,"Well, even after 700 hours you can find something new in this game. The largest modding community makes it even more replayable"
13826,"I grew up with this game, and it's only gotten better as I've grown to appreciate it in different ways. When it first came out, I was ten, and I liked to watch my brothers do cool slow-mo kills and pickpocket people. Now, I do these things, but I truly care for the lore and history behind it and how it's still evolving in ESO. 

The best part of my childhood, and in the top ten of my adulthood."
13827,ITS AHHH THE BEST!!!
13828,
13829,GG
13830,one of top rpgs

13844,"I like it because of the mods, but it can be very, very stubborn and buggy"
13845,It's ok i guess
13846,Kann man machen !
13847,My All-Time personal time sink.  Spent more hours in Skyrim than I care to contemplate and 9 years in it's still fun!  Modding community for this game is fantastic.  If you don't already own this..... Why the Hell Not?!?
13848,DRAGON
13849,Nice game. Very immersive
13850,i own this game on every system it released on... why?
13851,Great game. Strongly recommend.
13852,"I love Skyrim I'm just a little bummed because Bethesda has since removed the DLC purchase option for this game to get people to buy the legendary rerelease instead, but the achievements for the DLC are still up, so I'm never going to 100% this game."
13853,"spectacular. i have come back years later to find that when ever i start a new game it throws you across the map in a spectacular fashion, all while hear ""Hey.. you.. youre finally awake"". never got to start again 10/10"
13854,Still one of the best open-world games
13855,"It's no oblivion, but still amazing even 9 years on... not so amazing that I'm not dying for the sequel already"
13856,"Play this for mythos, pathos and magic  and of course the mods in this amazing world!"
13857,this game is an absoloute classic. Cant say you like RPG's if you havent played skyrim.
13858,10/10
13859,"The versatility of the gameplay,"
13860,yeh its cool
13861,I've been playing this game since I was 13 and I have created dozens of different characters. Release me from the shackles of Skyrim.
13862,Yes.
13863,Skyrim belongs to the mods.
13864,very nice game
13865,Must play game. Over 100 hours of content
13866,it's alright.
13867,It's Skyrim
13868,its ok
13869,Still a classic after all these years. fun game
13870,"This is a classic. Old game by now, but it is still so relevant. The mods and active community make it worth while to play again and again."
13871,"Only bought to play Enderal, hence the low hours."
13872,I've played a lot more than the 550+ hours that steams shows. Need I say more?
13873,"
its too good so you cant stop playing it 
the updates fix many problems in the orginal game

if you're wondering why its unlisted

the reason is
because todd coward might have thought that we'll fulfil the
reqiurements of special edition by mods

bethesda logic"
13874,Gods be praised
13875,fun
13876,Waiting for Elder Scrolls VI.
13877,yes
13878,its an ok game at best
13879,"While it might be a bit more dumbed-down and streamlined compared to previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim still provides an excellent open world experience. While I generally prefer most of the questlines in Oblivion, I think Skyrim has better combat and enemy behavior, as well as better npc behavior in general. From a sheer gameplay perspective, I'll always prefer Oblivion, but when it comes to immersion, Skyrim definitely delivers."
13880,Easy and fun. Its for any skill level.
13881,One of the best games ever made. Bethesda in it's prime.
13882,You know why this game is good.
13883,The first game i bought for steam. And its still fun.
13884,Such good a game!
13885,Awesome & addictive.
13886,"After all the years of gaming, I still enjoy opening up Skyrim V & playing. The gameplay map is huge! The graphics are not that bad for an older game. And, the soundtrack is pretty cool. I've played several hours, and enjoyed making helpers carrying my #*&@!"
13887,Skyrim is a way of life. make sure you have plenty of time to devote to the game before you think you can just jump in with both feet wet
13888,Classic version of a great game. Although I suggest buying the Special Edition if you plan on modding heavily.
13889,pretty good
13890,"Excellent game, hours and hours of gameplay, and hours more when you include the DLC and some amazing mods. Would recommend to anyone."
13891,50% great game 50% Great mods
13892,yes

13896,It's pretty good
13897,"easily the best game I've ever played
"
13898,"really easy to get addicted to, you can play it straight up or mod it to hecks n back, either way it's a big bag of  fun"
13899,"I have always loved TES games, and this is by far my favorite"
13900,this game is better than life
13901,
13902,I honestly didnt like the game but im going to give this a positive review to make sure skyrim fans dont come after me.
13903,"This endless meme-generator is a great way to get lost in some light fantasy. Sure it's not super complex but the world is packed with detail and cool stuff to do. I've played 200+ hours and still haven't beat the main quest. If you are feeling up to it, you can also install a massive amount of mods to enhance your stay in Skyrim."
13904,almost 10 years after its release and still one of the best games ive ever played...
13905,"Classic game, great with Keyboard or controler!"
13906,one of the first games ive played in steam....its alright...everyone should try
13907,oblivion aint got s hit on this gem
13908,I mean if you have the spare time to install mods... game of the life. 10000/10
13909,"Hands down one, if not the best RPG I've ever played. With countless things to do, plus a very interesting and thrilling main quest, this game is just the all in one package. In my opinion Skyrim is well worth the money and out of /5 I would have to give it a 5/5. Really builds on the the previous game(Oblivion) with overall graphics and gameplay. Hopefully Elder Scrolls 6 lives up to the hype!"
13910,game where you do stuff but with a shittier engine
13911,Aye
13912,"[ENG - RU]
Thanks to Skyrim, I got to know the world of licensed games.
Despite the monotonous dungeons, endless tasks and the fact that going on side quests is more interesting than following the main storyline and the lack of logic in the fact that when throwing a bucket on your head, you can do various miracles (especially if it's a local goods store).
It makes no sense to deny that the game is time-tested and still enjoys interest and popularity (thanks to the workshop with mods).
You can find a wife, build a house for yourself, hire a servant, take a tough gray from a local shelter and live as a whole and friendly family, somewhere in the forest by the river. Even real life sometimes cannot offer such a variety.
Live and prosper Skyrim.
P.S. Waiting for TES VI to find out who stole that meatloaf!

Благодаря Скайриму я познакомился с миром лицензионных игр.
Несмотря на - однообразные данжи, бесконечные задания и тот факт, что идти по сайд квестам интересней чем по основной сюжетной линии и отсутствия логики в том что при набрасывании ведра на голову можно творить разные чудеса (особенно если это местный магазин товаров).
Нет смысла отрицать что игра испытана временем и до сих пор пользуется интересом и популярностью (спасибо мастерской с  модами).
Можно найти жену, построить себе дом, нанять прислугу, забрать тугосерю из местного приюта и жить целой и дружной семьей, где-нибудь в лесу у речки. Даже реальная жизнь порой не может предложить такого многообразия. 
Живи и процветай Скайрим.
P.S. В ожидании TES VI, чтобы узнать, кто украл тот мясной рулет!"
13913,"The best single player PC game I have ever played!!!!!!!!

There are a lot of bugs I am finding. If these end up being game breaking in the end then I will have to change my thumbs up. Even with the bugs this game is amazing."
13914,great game while high and drunk and eating buritos !
13915,"ıf you are below 20 years old, go play simpler games. this game is not for you. If you are over 20 years old and havent played Skyrim until now, you probably wont play it in in the future. 

But its always good to have it in the library"
13916,It's ok
13917,Great game. Hours of content and plenty of mods for when you truly have no life and somehow manage to complete the game plus all side quests ten times over. My only complaint is that Brynjolf isn't a romance option. Thankfully there's mods to fix that but seriously Bethesda? What were you thinking.
13918,"So I thought a lot about it, and I came to this conclusion.
Perhaps somebody will say that Skyrim is not the best game of its genre, or that they don't really like it, but I tell ya what: Bethesda will never be able to release a game such as The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim in the future.
Nobody, will ever be able to release a game such as The Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim in the future.
In an objective manner of speaking, not positive not negative.
That's just how I think it is."
13919,"Vast world, nice for moding"
13920,"Big Chungus refers to an image of the cartoon character Bugs Bunny, usually captioned with the phrase ""Big Chungus"" and presented as a game for PlayStation 4 console. The word ""chungus"" was coined by video game journalist Jim Sterling several years before the meme became popular. Starting in July 2019, the meme regained ironic popularity on iFunny and certain parts of Reddit, particularly as a part of Reddit Moment memes.

Origin
Fat Bugs Bunny
The image of Bugs Bunny appears in Merrie Melodies cartoon Wabbit Twouble, first shown on December 20th, 1941[1]. In the short, Bugs is mocking Elmer Fudd, who in this cartoon was made much more portly than his previous and more iconic design (clip shown below)."
13921,"Nice history, great world and there is always something to discover."
13922,easily the no1 game of all time
13923,Skyrim belongs to the Nords.
13924,hmm yes
13925,"It's still an exelent game, although it came out in 2011"
13926,Beste
13927,I've played Skyrim on just about every console and I still really enjoy the game. I can easily recommend Skyrim to just about everyone.
13928,Forgotten version but still great!
13929,"One of the best Games i had ever played.
After all these years and with the mod support its still fun to play"
13930,Great game
13931,So many memories to be made in this beautiful world.
13932,"The reason that I enjoyed Skyrim is mainly because of the story.  It is very engaging.  That and the audio will draw you into the game for dozens of hours.  You can play it as a business man, a tank, a sniper, or a thief.  There are infinite amount of ways to play the game."
13933,sfasdfa
13934,"Great game to really be able to play to your own style. Also one of the games with the most fan made mods in history, so tons of content to further tailor to how you want to play
"
13935,Best game ever!
13936,goated game bro
13937,Excellent Game.
13938,old but gold -- 10/10
13939,So i can't buy the DLC for this version anymore??
13940,"love everything
"
13941,Good game if your able to buy it. if not get the virgin special edition cause the chad original edition is locked
13942,Just awesome
13943,"For someone who's playing this game real late compared to a lot of other gamers, it still amazed me from the gameplay and story line. You can literally get led astray from the main story plot and just explore the whole map!

I'm still playing it with legit minimal additional mods that do not interfere much with my very old laptop and I still love it. I spent so much time the moment I've started playing the game, to the point I hit 100h in a month. Isn't much but it is for me. 
I still haven't finished half on the main story plot nor the side quests and the DLCs."
13944,"It's full of memes and glitches, Todd Howard's finest work."
13945,"mediocre writing, mediocre gameplay, amazing modding community that can fix both of those problems. Get this over special edition."
13946,"Skyrim is probably the best game of its kind. It is the best first person action rpg game. It has great graphics and choices. The mouse and keyboard controls for it feel great. The controls feel great in first person and third person mode. The camera works great for both modes as well. Alchemy, enchanting and smithing work well. The professions in the game are useful and compelling to engage in. The character developement system gives you a lot of useful choices to develop. The story to the game is good but it doesn't make you go on a linear path. The world is very sandbox-ish. People have been playing Skyrim for many years because it is one of the greatest games ever made. If you liked morrowind and oblivion, you would like skyrim."
13947,GREAT ALL TIME CLASSIC 10/10
13948,It's alright.
13949,I lika da chop and I lika da zap and the kacheew and the BLEGH
13950,Todd has a gun to my head
13951,"Plays great and still looks nice even by modern standards. A worthy addition to your game library. If you like Fallout, then this is a great choice."
13952,wery good game alot of content
13953,"I like a first person to 3rd person sword shooter style game that is a full on adventure filled with danger and mystery.  It has me well entertained and has a lot of fun things to do.  Probably the best adventure style game of it's kind so far Nov. 29, 2020. Yet it would be really nice if you could do all of these same adventures with a party of friends.  I know Elder Scrolls Online is supposed to do that but it falls short.  So I enjoy coming back to this game for good times.  It's different everytime I play it because I choose different play styles and quest orders and there have been a number of improvements made since this game was new.  So have fun playing the best medieval adventure game around."
13954,My childhood.
13955,Best with mods!
13956,"Great game,

Only weird thing is
that I din't find any bugs? (Maybe later I will find something)
Pretty surprised by that, If you know the company.

Only problem is that my horse will always try to attack,
So or you need to hold your horse really far away
Or spend on learning healing-hands."
13957,get the newer version of skyrim. much better.
13958,313 hours at the time of this writing and I'm still finding new stuff every time I play.  The size and scope of this game are absolutely incredible.
13959,yes
13960,"Todd did it again he took my money.
"
13961,ye
13962,At this point we don't need another review of this game. It's fantastic.
13963,Its like a chapter of human history were alternate dimensional beings pored through giving you a sense of oneness with the universe. If you have not tried this game yet. you are overlooking the elephant in the room
13964,"If you like open world RPGs, Skyrim is one of the best as is usually the case with TES games.  I would put Skyrim as the second best Elder Scrolls game.  Morrowind, with it's distinct architecture and great story is still king for me but Skyrim is an improvement over Oblivion, itself a great game too."
13965,İyi oyun.
13966,this game has a better story then skyrim special edition
13967,One of the best games ever made...
13968,Not enough rims in the sky 9/10
13969,"Simply not recommending so people stop giving money to Todd. 

Game is awesome, but please don't buy it. Don't give Todd the satisfaction, please."
13970,love this game since it's release
13971,It is okay.
13972,favorite game of all time
13973,Long lasting love!
13974,One of my most favorite games of all time. Basically endless playstyle posibilities with unique locations and NPC's
13975,"Bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch, glitch, more bugs even more bugs,  glitch can't defeat Alduin. Bug and glitch simulator 10/10. Greate gameplay lots of thing to do."
13976,must have
13977,9 years later and this game still rocks. 'Nuff said.
13978,Love it. That is all.
13979,"Skyrim: the smart fridge edition
Skyrim: the ti-83 calculator edition
Skyrim: Alexa edition
Skyrim: Air fryer edition"
13980,"I recommend it 100%
It is probably one of the best or THE BEST GAME I've ever played.
I just love open worlds adventure games with quests and magic, and this game just blew my mind the first time i played it!!
The soundtrack is really good, and the gameplay is GODLIKE.
I'm sure i would still replay this game in 10 years, it's just SO GOOD!
And i love the fact that the campaign can last months if you really explore the game in depths <3!"
13981,"TIMELESS CLASSIC
"
13982,"Only look at my hours... That was a few years ago, i no-lifed this game.. Going to pick it back up, in 2020 :o
Great game! Alot of potential when modding aswell."
13983,top nostalge
13984,"best game i´ve ever played, i never get tired of it, im actually still playing it ocasionally"
13985,"love ho you can mod it
"
13986,It game.
13987,"Fuck yeah
"
13988,"yeah dont buy the remastered if you dont wanna pay for mods, buy this instead"
13989,big epic
13990,"Best Game with mods, hands down"
13991,It's Skyrim. I don't think I need to explain why it's such a great game.
13992,you should be buying oblivion right now
13993,Skyrim
13994,Yes.
13995,Dragons
13996,One of the greatest games of the decade. The whole Elder Scrolls series has an amazing story and the 5th game in the series is arguably one of the greatest in the franchise. 12/10 would recommend.
13997,Decent
13998,This game is a must have! Just click the download button already you will NOT regret it.
13999,"Posting this now and I have nearly 450 hours of gameplay, which is probably more like +600 as some of it was done offline. I think that says enough."
14000,I like that it's good
14001,good to spend a lot of time
14002,best played with so many mods that's it's unrecognisable as todd's creation
14003,"Only Game I have ever bought multiple copies of, for multiple platforms, & I am still playing it. 
Gotta love the modding community for keeping it alive & relevant."
14004,Yeehaw cowboy.
14005,Angry man with axe kille me :(
14006,A masterpiece.
14007,very pog game
14008,"I haven't actually gotten to level 2, Just enjoy modding the game until it crashes at Riverwood. 10/10 would recommend."
14009,active meditation
14010,there's nothing to describe. It's just perfect
14011,"Shit it's Skyrim, replayability to the max and it's overall just one of the best games."
14012,It's very nice yes!?
14013,"Best game ever, so far  !"
14014,i hate this game
14015,"One of the best games of all time in my opinion. If you've tried any of the Elder Scrolls games, you'll probably like this one. If you like Elder Scrolls Online, you're going to love this one!"
14016,I play Skyrim a lot. It helps keep my mind off the pain in my knee !
14017,"Needless to say, this is an amazing game.
Story rich, awesome graphics, epic game play, and most of all, the theme song, legendary!!!"
14018,10/10
14019,"Excellent game, I've had hundreds of hours on this game across Xbox 360, PC and the Special Edition on PC. The modding community makes this game a refreshing experience every time you start a new play through.

However, with the release of the Special Edition and SK64, I would recommend grabbing that over this version as the Special Edition is beautiful and the modding potential is just as good on there as this version now."
14020,Still holds up if you spend a week installing mods to bring the graphics up to date.
14021,"I played Skyrim on Ps3 and put in plenty hours into that bug infested game thanks Tod.

I even took a arrow to the knee thanks to tod. 

Why get it on steam well easy Mods modding community who fix half the bugs and improve the game which was originally made.

Great game and better on pc they any game console due nodding community fixing bugs adding everythjng you can imagin. 

It's Skyrim so need comment on the game everyone knows what it is really it's Skyrim.."
14022,"i recommend it but Special edition is only one you can get i have original not sure if there is a difference

Happy Shouting"
14023,Still the best RPG game
14024,Th best game I’ve ever played.
14025,"Skrym good game, always fun, hard to get into again tho"
14026,"Good game.
"
14027,"I have played this game for 1234 hours at the time of writing this. For all of Bethesda's faults, they did good with this."
14028,Still on my top ten favorite games list!
14029,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a game that I have completed multiple times with different characters and races. I've done most of the tasks that you are able to, and I have traveled across the world by foot, horse, and carriage. Even though I have done all of these things and quests, I still come back to play the game every so often. I know this sounds really generic, and it is, but I have owned this game for years and I still enjoy it now. I highly recommend this game."
14030,fun game it is fun
14031,It's good.
14032,"Absolutely mesmerizing game! Hundreds of hours of game play per play through and plenty of paths to victory. I recommend this game to anyone who has a spare 5 hours a day to get lost in this awesome world!

-Sometimes you can run into game breaking bugs...
— you will know them when you see them. Water flashing and constant water sounds was the worst one I ran into. No idea how I got there but I just started a new game and it runs beautifully! Download some mods if you don’t care about achievements!

Once again, I love this game. Skyrim has my heart 

PSA: avoid the floating pink crystal in the golden box. If you see one leave it there. Please..."
14033,"I good
"
14034,;
14035,"It's Skyrim, what else can I say?"
14036,sometimes I spend hours assembling a massive modlist and then realize I no longer want to play 👍
14037,I play this game for more then 5 years and i still love it. With the mods its become something else and being more amazing.
14038,great
14039,Who doesnt want to play Skyrim?
14040,it aight
14041,"One of the best game ever played. Still you can encounter some annoying bugs, glitches or junks. Extremly story rich, tons of tons of mods available. You can slaying dragons, clearing up dungeons or just wandering through Skyrim. Too many options for your play style. Well 9 years old, buy can overtake many of modern rpg games. just a MASTERPIECE"
14042,10/10 would kill Nazeem again.
14043,wont even launch. fuck this game
14044,ich habe über 200 stunden meines Lebens in diesem spiel versenkt und mitlerweile bereue ich es ich hätte so viel mehr erreichen können aber nein ich musste ja dieses spiel spielen und jetzt wo mein leben am Boden ist suche einen anderen Sündenbock der nicht  darauf hinaus läuft das mein Drogenkonsum  daran schuld ist alles in allem thx todd
14045,"A classic staple - aged now, but still holds true and gives way to creativity for modders to have fun!"
14046,Immortal game.
14047,"Excellent game, beautiful scenery."
14048,Awesome Game! Worth almost any price. Keep yourself sane and safe from co-vid-19.
14049,"This game has hours upon hours of gameplay, and endless things to do. However, there's also a lot of quests that repeat themselves, which is pretty annoying, but overall it is a great game that  really set the standard for open-world gaming."
14050,Extremely epic.
14051,Its Skyrim
14052,nice
14053,Played it many times and so have you most likely.
14054,"9 years later and I still can't get over the arrow in the knee.
Dozens of bugs never taken care of.
A bucket in the head makes getting away with murder extremely easy.
10/10 would play it all again for the 5920286th time."
14055,"It's good, but I'd wait for them to release it on Samsung Smart Fridge."
14056,"still be the stunning game that gives you the hype to punch a dragon in the face 
and the mods gives the some color and joy too. thank you skyim best 9 years of our life."
14057,"i love skyrim it make me happy because when i was 11 years old my family got rid of my entire collection of hentai figures but now i can live happy with this game, god bless you skyrim"
14058,if you don't have this game you need to get it
14059,nice game
14060,"Hey, did you know that technically the dragons in the game are aCkTcHuAlLy wyverns as they only have 2 legs and wigns"
14061,"the graphics are awesome, you dont have to follow their story line you can do your own thing"
14062,"A bug fest, that's only saved by all the available mods."
14063,Its good
14064,life is interesting without the mods
14065,"I've ""beaten"" this game a few times, and still come back to play it every year or so."
14066,1
14067,Classic
14068,Its simply amazing.
14069,yes
14070,its epic
14071,"Great Open world game

14077,I like playing skyrim and what i like about the game are how easy I can have lot of fun playing>
14078,i fuck with skyrim heavy
14079,Always a fun game to return to!
14080,"So many hours enjoying this game. So many years too and still I start anew once in a while.
Played it some more, it doesn't get old."
14081,"this is a game, game, it is like game very game yes game get game"
14082,"Well it's Skyrim, what isn't there to like?"
14083,Great Game. Great Graphics and game mechanics. Only issue is that it is so huge that you can get lost in in...but if you like those types of games you will totally love this one.
14084,"Legendary game of my childhood, along with Morrowind before it.
It helped me to become more intellectual, and thanks to TES series I learned English during the grade school.

Huge mythology of world, a dozen of quests and storytelling.
But there is the other flaw.
If we count what game has most of total game mods it will be Skyrim, even leaving Warcraft behind."
14085,Good shit
14086,It's Skyrim.
14087,Better than SE
14088,"Do I even need to tell you how good this game is? it's Skyrim, if you haven't played it, play it."
14089,YEETING NPCs IS FUN.
14090,"This game has been out for 9 years and people still play it today, it's worth it. If you haven't played this game yet... what have you been doing with your life? Enhance your gameplay with mods by allowing you to kill children and important characters that you wouldn't normally be able to kill, the possibilities are endless.  10/10 best rpg out there"
14091,its skyrim just get it man
14092,"Hey you, you're finally awake.

Glad to see you could find you way here to this very store page. This game, for me, is on a whole different level than any other game in existence. I remember getting the CD box on my 11th birthday and then playing it for the first time. The sheer vastness of the world and the amount of adventures and quests that lied within had completely overwhelmed me. Years later, I finally had the chance to play it again. And let me tell you, the experience was just as amazing as it was back then. 

This is the textbook definition of a tabletop RPG simulator, this is the fantasy game that everyone knows about, this is the story that not only can be experienced more than once, it HAS to be experienced multiple times, this is The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. If you are looking for some sort of distraction from the troubles of life- even just for a moment- come, enter the world of TES. 

I can guarantee that you will not regret any amount of time spent on this iconic giant of a game. I eagerly urge you to try it out for yourself as soon as you can. And as always, watch the skies traveler."
14093,Nice.
14094,if you havent played skyrim you havent lived yet
14095,The best game with open world I have ever played :3
14096,This is epic.
14097,"Good game I guess, but it doesn't really hold my attention."
14098,Lots to explore.
14099,Good game
14100,Yes very good. I love Todd Howard. He is truly a god amongst men.

14114,Skyrim is the best open world RPG you can get. A true evolution of genre is not flawless but still it is the game you love to live in.
14115,great game lots of fun
14116,One of the best games out there :)
14117,"very recommended

14121,"jogo muito bom, melhor rpg que eu ja joguei, um jogo que marcou minha infância e nunca canso de jogar"
14122,"Good game but why did you hide it Bethesda
"
14123,"Although Oblivion had more magical feeling while playing, with creating your own spells and enchanting arrows, as well as the level system was better and less casual. Skyrim is the best game of the decade and has a very nice gameplay for casuals and real gamers. A roleplay gamewith nice charakter design, awesome open world and very nice addons. The vampire stuff seems to work with every game tho, but bethesda really made something of the elder scrolls!"
14124,Always in my heart.
14125,It's just great!
14126,Great game even after all this time

14132,Super
14133,"There will likely never be another game like Skyrim, I wish more people modded it, because it is a good base-game for mods. I will never forget the first time I booted it up or the first time my saves got deleted, but regardless it will always stand the test of time. Or rather the ""T-E-S"" of time."
14134,I have spent way to much time playing this !!!
14135,"[English]
Very awesome Game!
If you're a Fan of Open-World Games and a Game with many Hours, this is defiently a Game for you!
The Soundtrack fits to the Atmosphere and the Graphics are still awesome for a 2011 Game. You defiently should get the DLCs as well.
You have alot of Sidequests and they pull you deeper into the Story.

Contra Points:
- Some annoying Bugs, which forces you to use the Console (example: important NPC are dying due Vampire Attacks or the Quests doesn't start). Fortunately, you can fix them very easy, also to mention the inofficial Patch.
- Difficulty: Sometimes it's very difficult to defeat Enemies, even on the easiest Difficulty though (Maybe I'm just bad lol)

Short Words: Buy this Game, you will love it, even when you never play Elder Scrolls or wasn't a Fan of Fantasy before ;)

-----------------
[German (Deutsch)]

Sehr geiles Spiel!
Falls man ein Fan von Open-World Spielen ist und gerne nach einem guten Zeitvertreib sucht, dieses Spiel wäre was für euch!
Der Soundtrack passt perfekt zu der Welt und die Grafik ist sehr erstaunlich für ein 2011 Spiel. Aufjedenfall dürfen die DLCs nicht fehlen.
Die Sidequests führen dazu, dass man in die Story tiefer reingezogen wird.

Contra Punkte:
- Nervige Bugs, welche einem zwingen die Konsole zu benutzen (z.B.: Wichtige NPC verrecken an den Vampire Angriffen oder die Quests startet nicht). Zum Glück kann man diese beheben, auch anzumerken, dass es einen inoffiziellen Patch gibt.
- Schwierigkeit: Manchmal ist es sehr schwer, paar Gegnern in den Hintern zu treten, obwohl man die einfachste Stufe hat, though (Vielleicht bin ich nur schlecht, lol)

Kurzgesagt: Kauft das Spiel, denn ihr werdet es lieben, auch wenn ihr vorher noch nie Elder Scrolls gespielt hattet oder Fan von Fantasy gewesen seid. ;)"
14136,GOOD OLD CLASSIC <3
14137,Good
14138,"I'm never getting bored of this.

The only problem I see in this game that it's to hard to manage with modes, and the fact that if you want to buy a DLC you'll be forced to buy another Skyrim, and designing of your character could have more features.

Notwithstanding, MOOM LOOK I'M A MAGEEEEE!!!
8 \ 10"
14139,divine game that would go and relax
14140,"it's good af, chill and enjoyable after all these yearsi can only recommend"
14141,Thomas the train came down and rained little Sir Topham Hatt top hats down on me. 10/10
14142,bestttttttttttttttt
14143,ooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOooooooo
14144,gud game
14145,"Where do I even start with Skyrim. The one liners from the hold guards are hilarious, and the content is classic. I eventually got a little bit tired of all the story and side quests over and over again. I started downloading a few add on's. My favorite was flower's killable kids. Remember those mouthy brats at Dragonsreach? I was finally able to sneak in there and silence them once and for all. I'm sure the guards won't miss them either. The best part was two nights later, a courier came for me and it said ""We Know"". :) It's definitely worth getting the Dawguard, Hearthfire, and of course the Dragonborn. The scenery and story line in Dragonborn will take you back to Morrowind if you played way back then."
14146,"If you've found your way here, just remember that Skyrim has no DRM and you can pretty much copy and paste the dlc from a copy you found on the high seas into your main folder."
14147,bloody forking good
14148,Endless gameplay possibilities.
14149,tits
14150,"The greatest game I have every played - even today, about 8 years after it's release - largely due to the amazing modding community.  Thanks modders and thanks Bethesda!"
14151,Me likey
14152,"Timeless BGS Classic. 

Vanilla experience is more of a Power Fantasy Action Game with RPG elements than a pure traditional RPG, but it does this in a fun way gameplay wise.

Turn the game into whatever you want with mods after that, the modding sandbox this game provides is second to none.

In 2020, I would recommend purchasing the Special Edition version of the game, as it is more stable and most of the best mods for the game are now available on that version.

However, there are still reasons and advantages to play the Classic Version, such as certain mods exclusive to this version and the absence of a Creation Club constantly updating and breaking SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender).

MY OVERALL RATING: 90/100"
14153,"Hands down, one of the best games I've ever played."
14154,"Its skyrim on pc you daft twit
"
14155,"I love this game soooo much. Play every few months, and get started right over again. 
(For my game there is a glitch, that happens every new game. It's when you wake up for Helga, so beginning of each new save. The wagon train goes off course and starts driving into the mountains, it screws up the game and I had to make a new save at the character creation part. Only issue I have.)"
14156,Unlisted beauty
14157,mod it till it breaks then start over lol. old game but still fun as hell.
14158,A wonderful and amazing rpg that has a beautiful environment as well with immersive npcs
14159,"If you need a review to buy this game your dumb. Do it, But buy all the dlc while you're at it."
14160,Skyrim.
14161,"Skyrim is a game that must be played with mods, recommend Ultimate Skyrim overhaul."
14162,"Awesome game, lots of fun to play."
14163,"A 2011 game which stills holds up today thanks to the use of mods. You can have very little mods or plenty of mods, or no mods at all, regardless of what you choose, you'll have a good time. If you have never played this game or have never seen gameplay of this game, you should at least look at gameplay of it.

It's also one of the games I have the most hours on, it's a shame that this is hidden from the steam searchbar though."
14164,No way this game ever dies xDD
14165,It's a game
14166,"Game play, Graphics are nice for a 2011 game, and the Story is good, even though I've played this game plenty on console. Game has a lot of bugs, but that's kind of a part of why this game is so notable. The game is even better with vortex and nexus mods."
14167,gresyt game
14168,"mechanics sometimes buggy but very nice game, you can get yourself into it"
14169,After almost 10 years this game still is so much fun!
14170,Epic
14171,"I'm so sick of this game. I can't play 5 minutes without Todd sending me an email asking how I'm enjoying his ""Magnum Opus"". I've tried responding and telling him to stop so I can just play the game but he won't and now he's sending me death threats. Please, for your own good do not play this game."
14172,"This game is AWESOME!
"
14173,My ancestors are smiling at me imperial. Can you say the same?
14174,Great immersive game!
14175,nej hra
14176,Everything became better with a few mod packs. Thank you mod creators.
14177,"Essential.
Next year released to a roll of toiletpaper."
14178,"great game and 
highly recommended"
14179,"Started playing it and I instantly got hooked. The intro is brilliant imo and it really never gets boring.
I would still recommend though that you install some mods via Vortex because the game is still quite
full of tiny bugs as it is the usual with Bethesda games. 
Have Fun."
14180,"LOL


"
14181,Masterpiece
14182,There's something in there. Hmmm.... Must have been a wind
14183,Cant wait to play Skyrim on the toaster.
14184,"Skyrim is an amazing game with so much to do and explore. The map is amazing with rural mid-evil type styles and can quickly change to many different styles. The game play is limitless you can become a Sneaky archer, Knight, wizard, assassin and much much more. 20 dollars or less for the special edition is more then worth the money you would spend"
14185,All time fav game if you dont get this your not even a gamer
14186,Jef
14187,"This game ages so well. The developers keep finding ways to improve it, fix the bugs, and all the DLCs are great. I feel like this RPG has a thing for every gamer out there, may it be pretty magic or gruesome weapons. The best thing about it also is that the quests have no time limits, so you can take the time to enjoy the scenery."
14188,"It's ok, I only played it a little"
14189,"This is THE GAME. It is almost cancerous. You must know it, you must know what it is. There is no other way, we are all doomed to Skyrim"
14190,Great game
14191,it good
14192,Great shouting
14193,just play witcher

I would be happy if you follow my Steam Curator Page:) https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/"
14195,"An obviously excellent game. Very replayable, especially with modding. Don't be surprised if one day you have hundred upon hundreds of hours sunken into it."
14196,Deep
14197,I have played through the entire set of quests with all of the DLC at least 3 times now and still have not run out of places to explore. The graphics never cease to amaze me with the creativity and detail. Free roaming gameplay and being able to make choices in the game that impact the quest lines and character development are things I like the most about this game. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an expansive single player RPG that can run without an internet connection.
14198,LOVE This game
14199,Just buy it
14200,gg
14201,its alright i guess

Just, play it, with mods."
14214,good play
14215,"One of the most immersive and visually satisfying games I've played.  Skyrim combines all the key elements of expansive adventure under one huge roof.  Swords, sorcery, epic battles, tense stealth and of course dungeons galore.  I recommend getting all the expansions from the get-go as it allows you a lot of freedom to pick your own path to greatness.  I've now moved to the VR version and am having just as much fun!"
14216,"come on its skyrim who dosnt love it
"
14217,"Instead of saying ""Fus Ro Dah"" the Dragonborn should pledge allegiance to Al-Qaeda... That would be pretty funny I think."
14218,yes
14219,I lost so much of my life to this game......good thing I have more to give to it.
14220,Dargon
14221,"I call this game Medieval Errand Boy Grave Robber. There is a lot of running around doing errands for people. At times the errands feel beneath the status of the character, especially as he becomes more prestigious and powerful. That said, the world is expansive and there is plenty to do. I played 450 hours and had enough to do until the quests ran out. The game doesn't quite end, and that's somewhat anti-climatic. The game is immersive enough. There is a lot of grinding, but enough variation in abilities to not feel like a grind. I would not be opposed to using console commands to make the game less grindey. If you don't like collecting trinkets, weight restrictions, grinding through levels, get stuck, can't find an item ect one can cheat. I think if this makes the game more pleasurable than fine, If you are a purist, then grind through all the levels of skills, make potions or not, mine or not, blacksmith, fight, practice and get your levels up. I found after 50th level and maxing out on my most used abilities I stopped gaining XP and leveling. I played on the most difficult level. If you want the satisfaction of working your way up coin by coin, then do that. Some even eat food and sleep for realism and never fast travel. I didn't find sleeping or eating necessary. If you want to not worry about money, to not worry about weight then adjust it in console. I decided to get rid of my weight restrictions 3/4 into the game. I got tired of going back to my home and depositing my things or selling them constantly. It wasn't interesting to me. I have done that in plenty of game over the past 40 years. Otherwise, grind away. Some people make and sell potions to get rich. I did this initially. Some steal everything. I played my character as good and didn't choose sides initially. Then I decided to play every quest through. There is more content that way. The game has some weaknesses. limited dialog options and voice acting get tiresome. Some quests glitched out requiring console commands. The game itself took a lot of work and love to create and I do recommend it."
14222,"lame
"
14223,This game is for everybody.
14224,"Despite launching Bethesda into a megalomaniac capitalist overdrive, followed by immediate popularity nosedive and quality collapse for an already famously bug-laden series, this game, coupled with complimentary free mods made by the community, remains one of the best video game experiences of an immersive fantasy sword sandal and magic realm.
Ironically, it is only the PC (perhaps with a controller) that I would recommend this game, Bethesda considers every new platform to be worth a price increase, despite fixing no bugs (leaving the community to do it themselves)

You should play this game for a while"
14225,"I have played this game for a few years now and still LOVE it, haven't completed the game because I keep finding new mods lol!"
14226,POG
14227,Still a great game to play nearly a decade on from its' release!
14228,"yeah its aight
"
14229,its running on my shaving machine now.. 10/10
14230,good
14231,i just like speedrunning the game. The glitches are really fun to mess about with
14232,It cool
14233,Nice game
14234,Great RPG game
14235,"Quicksaving...

Kill Lydia

Loading quicksave..."
14236,Fun adventure
14237,"I dont really have to say anything about how good this game is,"
14238,very good many thanks
14239,Great game if you have all the right mods
14240,"yes i like, much fun"
14241,Great game put in the hours and you unlock more quests would greatly recommend some graphics mods just to make the game look a little better xD 10/10
14242,"1,299 playing hours logged! Wonderful game."
14243,"Despite being rather old, this game doesn't dissapoint, it's massive open world, immersive, great environments, good AI and gameplay. Certainly recommend!"
14244,"Come on, I mean, come on. It’s Skyrim."
14245,"Played for 1000 hours on ps4 and ps3 accounts, amazing game very replayable."
14246,This is a very good game.
14247,goob
14248,"Thanks for hiding this game bethesda, such a big brain move."
14249,"good

14252,lul it gud
14253,Best version of Skyrim.
14254,"great game, still looks good, tons of play time."
14255,"In my top ten greatest games, it's literally taken me years to beat the entire game, including all the side quests and I wouldn't have it any other way. Amazing game!"
14256,10/10 One of the best.
14257,"its great, just hate bethesda"
14258,i was allowed to poop on it and poop on someones face in the game so it is a good game because you can poop on people
14259,"It's skyrim, what's not to love?"
14260,this is is so fun and its takes so long to complete that is what makes it so fun and you can interact with all the npcs!
14261,2000 hrs across two steam accounts and two xboxes. safe to say i like this game
14262,As a base game.. I wouldn't recommend it standard Bethesda jank. No nostalgia will ever cloud my eyes to what a trash company they are and have been. If you've got some mods though or technical know-how. Feel free to fix this dumpster fire and make women look like women again.
14263,Great Game
14264,Great Game for endless play
14265,Good fun!
14266,giant enemy spider
14267,lbk/
14268,I think it's useless to say how much this game is immersive. If you're in 2020 and wondering if you should play this game just play it. And if you're looking for a replay put in a few mods for the graphics.
14269,The greatest game ever created.
14270,Skyrim is a very good game to by and play the graphics are excellant.
14271,"if almost ten years later, you still can come back to it and have a mindless grindfest, what more needs to be said?"
14272,amazing game but i have to install mods to actually have fun. eg if you dont want ur eyes to bleed and desire that smooth above 60hz framerate the physics will fuck itself and you have to edit ini files/ download mods which didnt work for me so im just gonna get special edition and use mods for that because there is no proper over 60hz fix for non SPE.
14273,one of the best
14274,It  Skyrim  it awsome.
14275,Too many dragons.
14276,It's mf'ing Skyrim.
14277,Still great 9 years later
14278,yes.
14279,Its ok
14280,8/10
14281,"Its an expirience
"
14282,"it's skyrim. super open ended, super fun, endless possibilities!"
14283,I shouted at a goat and killed it.
14284,I died epicly
14285,A grand experience. I cherish this game and those that came before it.
14286,yup
14287,"I mean, what can I say it's Skyrim. It's a good game. It's not Morrowind but it is fun. Not that Morrowind isn't fun, it's just a different type of fun. It's easy to get lost in the game. It's beautiful. Walking thru the snow is relaxing. Oh, one thing that I do hate is the dragons killing the damn NPCs that are vital to questlines. Like come on Todd, what the hell? Skyrim is like junk food. You eat too much of it and it tastes great but there is no real nutrition."
14288,The legacy of this game speaks for itself.
14289,It's ok every now and then.
14290,I love the open world concept where every thing is a viable link.  I have over 2000 hours invested in this game and have restarted with another avatar and new character traits.
14291,"This game has been my go-to RPG game for over a decade.  I love the open world, the choice of which quest lines to follow, the unique trait paths that make each play through different.  I've loved this game so much that I've purchased it on different platforms and taught my children to play.  It is a treasure of a game.  I had hoped that the MMO would retain the magic that Skyrim has held for me over the years, but unfortunately, it seems I'll just have to wait for the next single player RPG in The Elder Scrolls series."
14292,nice
14293,"It's alright I guess. I mean its not a perfect game has tons of flaws, but if your looking to dive into a world for a couple of hours itll do. Mods make your experience better, but at the loss of achievement progress. Unofficial Skyrim Patch is recommended."
14294,"Basically a cornerstone in fantasy RPG games now. Interesting story, and hundreds of hours of content with all manner of builds possible, its a little cliche but its cliche from the beginning to its not like its unexpected."
14295,"Pretty swell game. Fantastic world, characters, and quests. Endless amounts of replayability."
14296,its amzing
14297,"I modded the game so much that it's no longer skyrim
10/10"

14300,yes very nice
14301,"Great game, always loved the lore and creativity behind enemies / story lines

"
14308,The best game I've ever played.
14309,big fun much game much bugs
14310,"What is there to say about Skyrim.
All these years later after release, and I still find it the Best Open world Fantasy RPG out there.
"
14311,"Nope. Boring and ugly - probably should have run into this years ago, when it was just released... I can't see the engaging story."
14312,The one and only.
14313,"Definitely recommend to anyone, young and old, vanilla or modded, FUN guaranteed."
14314,Great Game!
14315,I used to be an adventurer like you
14316,"Its pretty simple its skyrim, so buy it"
14317,Todd Howard
14318,It's Skyrim.
14319,"Skyrim is literally my favourite game of all time, but fuck Bethesda for unlisting the game from Steam. Imagine you don't have a PC good enoutgh to be able to run Special Edition, where will you get the game from? Simple answer: other external sites In conclusion, it's one of the best games out there, but fuck Bethesda and fuck Todd Howard."
14320,Magnificent.
14321,"it's skyrim
just play it
on your xbox, pc, macbook, fridge, calculator or smartphone"

14331,amazing
14332,Love the gameplay and story. I've over 150 hours of gameplay in this game. And after years I just keep restarting the game.
14333,Skyrim is amazing.  Download it. Play it.  Love it.
14334,:-) ... Hello Adventurer! Welcome to Honeywood ! Don't get lost in sidequests like i always do...
14335,Good game. I find myself coming back to play this every year.
14336,"A remarkable action based RPG, packed with adventure and an amazing soundtrack!
Great game to invest several hours into."
14337,yes
14338,Do not play this game. It's just too good. I can't stop. Someone please send help.
14339,good game
14340,It's no Morrowind but it's a damn fine past time.
14341,"Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying, of course you don't."
14342,yes
14343,I keep coming back to this game. 9 years later and it's still worth every minute of play time!
14344,It's okay :3
14345,SKYRIM
14346,Dude it's Skyrim how do you recommend this to someone everyone already knows about it
14347,Best Game Evar!
14348,Best RPG of all time
14349,"I've had this game for a while on xbox 360 (i know, i know) wanted to mod this game but didn't want special edition cuz ew. pretty good. got mods to fix bugs and crashes. modded to hell so it crashes more than before"
14350,Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard. Vampire hunters or something...in the old fort near Riften. Might consider joining up myself.
14351,you can play this game and then take a very long break and come back to it whenever you want.
14352,A great action RPG!
14353,"Why, of all the great games out there, does this one have 9 different editions? It's garbage."
14354,My all time favorite game ever!
14355,quality
14356,"Do I need to say more? The base game is simple and easy for any casual gamer to jump in and enjoy. And the game remains timeless due to modders keeping the game up to new industry standards for graphics, gameplay and content, and this game is very easy to mod and mods are usually incorporated so well into the game."
14357,Its Skyrim... and awesome
14358,"It's skyrim, what is there not to like about it. One of my favorite games."
14359,You cant hate this game.
14360,"Addicting and you can avoid that pesky main plot if you want, you don't even have to join a side in the war!"
14361,This game is top tier and worth every free second you got so much game play and story its amazing and even if you finish the story there are thousands of mods to expand you adventure.
14362,h
14363,"This was my first PC game, absolute classic. Definitely worth playing at least once in your life. 10/10"
14364,it is great
14365,"Skyrim is one of those games that will stay in the hearts of gamers for years.

Even on this original version, the graphics of the time were stunning, and the expansive gameplay was hooking and unique. Rather, it *is*. 
It's available on virtually anything now, be it the Xbox or even the Switch, so if you haven't already tried it, definitely do."
14366,good game
14367,"WTF it's Unlisted ? WTF i bought this game like 3-4 days ago. There is allot PPl that would like to buy this game on STEAM and you just decide to Delete it from Steam ? WTF Bethesda. I dont need freaking remastered art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, screen-space i want game that i can enjoy. And you just made SPecial edition and no way to upgrade my Game to Special Edition. I have to Buy Special Edition all over. YE RIGHT"
14368,i spend most of my time getting mods
14369,"unplayable without mods, otherwise great"

14382,cool game
14383,"It's fun, interactive skill building, good story line, with lots of sub-stories/quests; it has badass weapons, magic, and dragons - what's not to like?"
14384,gg
14385,Let's be real - you ain't a self-respecting gamer if you haven't at least tried playing this all-time classic.
14386,"everything about this game is amazing, 11/10 would recomend"
14387,"Fun to play, Great to kill time and just in general goof off"
14388,Can´t remember how many times i´ve replayed this masterpiece.

Something for almost everyone inside."

14396,Huge fan of the elder scrolls and another fine addition
14397,"I enjoy all role playing games, from starting with The Elder Scrolls Arena up to Syrim"
14398,Lots of Mods for all parts of the game. Main player can be modified at any time. Best game ever.
14399,macik
14400,It never seems to get old playing this game.
14401,Open world offline just explore and have fun
14402,It's just wow. I love swords so you understand why I love this game  so much!
14403,good
14404,"Spent endless hours fighting the game from no access to no record of me even after allowing password to accept me!
And then no  password or record of me being a lawful user?  BUT THE MODS BY INDIVIDUAL moders made the game a joy to use.  GAME ON?       John Bruce.

"
14405,It just works!
14406,not as good as fallout.
14407,good game
14408,good game
14409,Love skyirm
14410,9/10 would have given it a perfect score but I've played for over 500 hours and you'd think by now I would have gotten an arrow in the knee.
14411,si
14412,Best Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim
14413,"If you don't buy this game Todd Howard will come to your house to break all your dishes and eat all your furniture. He's probably already on his way, so you should hurry."
14414,An amazing game with upwards of thousands of hours of playtime
14415,very fun game make me very happy yes
14416,Why does my own fireball kill me :(
14417,"very game. much dragon. wow. such mods.
"
14418,i like the part where i raped joe biden
14419,GREAT
14420,It's Skyrim
14421,Love me a Sneaky Archer Build.
14422,"Its unplayable because of its bugs and glitches somehow... i wished Skyrim: SE had the same graphics as Vanilla, i love the old rpg'ish style. Skyrim: SE looks like polished playmobil.."
14423,It's buggy as hell. 2/5
14424,"I just genuinely cannot describe how much I dislike Bethesda. But that asside. This is a good game. I want to warn all of you. If you plan on playing this game with mods. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! Buy the version which has been hidden from steam. It is still on the steam store, but Bethesda has decided to hide it for whatever stupid reason. ALl the best mods are on that version and not this one."
14425,It's like Skyrim with guns. Wait...
14426,ready to give another 1000 hours more..
14427,"Its an elder scrolls game, thats been out for nine years and i still play it. Of course its good"
14428,"Mods...can make this game something else man
"
14429,Noice
14430,"I have owned and played 300+ hours on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox one. 300+ for each. I can't get enough of this game."
14431,I rate this game 500/500!!!
14432,yes
14433,boring story if you do the main quests it takes about 4 hours the only thing worth while is turning to a werewolf and going on a rampage and the best house costs 20 grand i had to cheat to get it and do not become a vampire its just a burden with the fire and the sun and yeah but it is fun to go on a rampage.
14434,"game itself is good but look at how many horrible things that came out of skyrim:

> arrow to the knee spammers
> wholesome 100
> my little pony mods

technically not the games fault doe shame it attracted so many debauched mouth breathers who have zero social skills who use this game as a substitute for anything substantial since the average player is an redditor."
14435,"So many guards were like u, but they took arrow to the knee."
14436,PERFECCIÓN
14437,"This game is my childhood, and the first game i truly fell in love with. If you haven't played this game, shame on you! It is getting pretty old, and there are some parts of the game that can get pretty repetative like the dungeons and such, but overall its a must play if you enjoy singleplayer rpg's."
14438,Skyrim is great i love it its so interactive and fun you just get so addicted to it and if you get bored you can download a variety of mods and they go into the game perfectly so i recommend Skyrim and if you haven't tried it you have to its amazing.
14439,gr
14440,Just finished main quest. Bruh
14441,Great
14442,"This is by far one of my most favorite games of all time. I love the story line, the combat, the character customization, the mods available on the Steam Community. I have played and replayed this game so many time, there is so much to do. If you have never played Skyrim, I truly feel you are missing out."
14443,"Purchased this game on day 1. A great follow-up to Oblivion and takes the mechanics a few steps further in this game. New features, like shouts, improved alchemy, enchantment and blacksmithing of weapons and armor, etc. Gives the player a lot more quests, dragons, monsters and dungeons; Also has much more replayability in comparison to it's predecessors in my opinion. Spent many hours in this game and still haven't beaten it yet; there's that much to do in this game if you take the time. Highly recommended Open-World RPG."
14444,"One of the best RPGs of all time. Elder Scrolls Series is beyond incredible. Some of the most iconic and most well done games ever. 
"
14445,"This was an absolutely amazing game. It has insane amounts of content, even if some of it gets a bit repetitive. The vanilla game held my interest for a long time, and I played it longer after discovering console commands. I eventually realized after completing most of the questlines that the game could be revitalized with mods. Skyrim has one of the largest and most active modding communities, and it was a complete game changed. It breathed new life into a game I had thought had nothing left to offer. 10/10 game, worth every cent."
14446,its a good one of the games that do or not not exist cookl and good.
14447,"Modern modding practices have made this game quite stable, however SE has allowed many of the persistent issues (z-fighting etc.) to be fixed. There is nothing wrong with this version though, beyond the persistent bugs. Many SE mods are ported to LE so there's really no wrong answer."
14448,Played a little of it. It's Okay.
14449,Enter the world of Skyrim! You are the Dragonborn and you can be either a hero or a villan. Either one gets you good rewards in the form of irreplaceable loot. A large world to explore and you can make the game as exciting or boring as you like.  It is my go-to when I only have a hour to kill. I've played through several times. Still loving it as a distraction as time allows.
14450,"terrible
"
14451,"best game
"
14452,"Well, what can I say beside it's Skyrim"
14453,It's Elder Scroll V: Skyrim.  'Nuff said.  Grade A game.
14454,gud
14455,pretty good fam
14456,"This was one of the first ever games I played when I was barely tall enough to see the computer screen. It's been over 10 years I've spent with this game, and it still brings me so much comfort and enjoyment. No matter how old it gets, or how many bugs and issues it may have, I don't think I'll ever stop playing it. It's truly one of the greatest games ever created, a true classic that everyone should experience."
14457,"I don't know what else there is to say about this game that hasn't already been said. It's one of the best of all time, and will remain so forever, in my opinion."
14458,BEST GAME OF ALL TIME! I COULD PLAY 10000 HOURS. TRUST ME. YOU WOULD TOO IF YOU COULD!
14459,"Little Aryan-heavy, but ok"
14460,You know it
14461,it's skyrim need you know more.
14462,Best RPG ever made and endlessly moddable
14463,"Took a couple of false-starts to get into it, but if you can get past the bugs and glitches, it's a great worthwhile experience."
14464,Bugged.....
14465,"It's dope
"
14466,It adventurous and puzzles; the game gives you the feeling of really being there without actually being there.
14467,"Decent vanilla state, unparalleled with mods"
14468,"Obviously, the base game has Academy award nominees, an amazing score, and high accolades.
However, the modding community has kept this masterpiece still riding high with constant additions, bug and dialogue fixes, and 100 times the content of the initial game.  Affordable copies are out there on G2A and other sites: do yourself a favor and play it."
14469,"Skyrim is an excellent game! I love how it's free-roam and quests can be completed at your own pace. The possibilities in this game are endless. If you don't already know what Skyrim is, then I seriously recommend you play it to find out! (WARNING: Highly Addictive Game!)"
14470,its skyrim
14471,Great game! Love how everyone's experience of the game can be so different depending on their choices!
14472,Good stuff. Add mods but BE CAREFUL. I say that because I tend to go overboard with my mods.
14473,skyrim
14474,i personally cannot wait for the elder scrolls V: skyrim VII
14475,This is one of my favorite games of all time.
14476,Skyrim will always be one of those games you can come back to after years and get addicted to over and over. Always worth it.
14477,Its Skyrim
14478,It's like the greatest open world RPG of all time... so yeah.
14479,A Must Try for every Gamer
14480,Fus !
14481,"Fun sandbox game - good for hours of running around, interesting exploration, and a better all around RPG than most anything else the industry has thus far, or since produced.              I know these high-end games are VERY expensive and time consuming to make, so, that is probably why..."
14482,"Uh oh, Bethesda did a stinky and hid this game.


I'm not actually gonna write a proper review for this game, first of all because I already did so, and second because if you are in this page you probably already know Skyrim as good as anyone else could. Fuck it, if you're in this page it's probably coz you know a thing or two about modding this monster of a title, so you even have some inner knowledge to the guts and inner workings of Skyrim.


Yea, it's a great game, even with all it's flaws. Still unforgettable for me, the first time playing it.

If you haven't yet, you might aswell go ahead and try it. Tho goodness knows am preaching to an audience that already agrees.

Oh, and then mod the everliving fuck out of it."
14483,"11/11 (2011 ;) ) solid game, many bugs but definitely worth"
14484,this game after this many years that come out still give you the best filling when you play it.
14485,Skyrim
14486,3500 hours of play on PC and I still come back to it. God help me.
14487,"Love the PC version (have this on ps4, 360, and Switch as well). The graphics are great, gameplay is never-ending. If you're looking for an RPG, there is a reason why Skyrim has held out like Minecraft since its release in 2011"
14488,fun

14492,"Bro, why do you need a recommendation for Skyrim? Honestly it's a classic and for good reasons. Epic fantasy game with decent amount of player freedom. The main quest is a bit dull, but the Dawnguard DLC does have an awesome story."
14493,BEST GAME EVER.

14499,This is hands down my favorite game. Period. Its brilliant. Its so deep and it has replay value as well. There is a good following for Skyrim and it has many mods.

14518,"S  ky    RIM, . . ."

14531,"Good game, been playing since 2013 on the Xbox 360. Switched over to PC in 2015. Definitely recommend it. The game is endless, there is PLENTY to do in this game. Mods are also a huge boost in gameplay, so definitely recommend mods as well. 10/10 Game for Me."

14538,good
14539,It's ok
14540,It's a great storyline behind this game and detailed fantasy world. Just can't stop playing again and again.
14541,First game I ever purchased and I still play it 7-8 years later. Positively amazing.
14542,"congratulations, despite Bethesda's best efforts, you found the store page"
14543,"still a classic even in 2020 just as great as it used to be just amazing graphics are great story awsome

14552,great game
14553,"It's fucking skyrim honestly having played it multiple times over gotten all the achievements and busted out the largest amount of mods in the history of mods you can always find something that works for you.

Now if only bethesda would hit us with TES Six."
14554,
14555,"I played this game for 1000+ hours on xbox, and after discovering it on PC i wished i had bought it on PC instead because there are so many amazing mods ! This is another one of my favorite games of all time, i was one of those people who did every single side quest before completing the main quest, even being level 60 and overpowered and one shotting dragons was one of the coolest experiences i've ever had in my gaming career... i recommend this game to absolutely everyone, the graphics are breath taking, the story is incredibly immersive and the Skyrim community is still fighting strong to this very day ! First bear kill you, then years later you go back, beat bear with bare hands and hang its pelt up in the house you built so you can look at it every time you enter and remember you fu***ng pounded that bears face to s**t.... Buy this game...
Hey you, You're finally awake.... You were trying to cross the border, right?........"
14556,can shout funny magic words and swing swords faster: 10/10
14557,"A great game if you want to get out of your world for a while, easy to get lost in even without VR though VR is an option."

14564,Trying to make reviews for most of the games in my library... is there even a point to reviewing skyrim? You know what it is lol
14565,I've played for 785 hours. What else do you need to know?
14566,Yep! This is definitely Skyrim alright!
14567,"best mods available, and some are easy to install via steam workshop which Skyrim SE does not have"
14568,this game is a classic
14569,yes
14570,its awesome i love it
14571,I accidentally used a shout on my adopted son. he ran into the woods and never came back. 9.5/10
14572,"Skyrim is one of those games that truly stands the test of time. I am a game cycler, meaning I play games for one to two weeks at a time before moving on the the next game. Skyrim always keeps me coming back and everytime I return I discover something new to explore or see. I would highly recommend this game to any fantasy lover I know."
14573,buy it
14574,If you have never played this game how dare you this is the most played rpg for a reason and the modding community is the greatest.
14575,the game consumed much of my life. 10/10 would erase memories and play again
14576,Not bad
14577,"Skyrim is addictive and entertaining game for any adventurous hero or a villain. It is my favorite game for many reasons, but I am particularly fond of the countless options and details of the game. You can be, do and investigate whatever you want. Highly recommended! ♥️

14578,"always a challenge the whole way through
takes a long time to get through but you can start again playing a different way"
14579,Amazing game
14580,"300 hours on PC, Easily over a thousand on the 360, several hundred on the PS4, and just bought it on the switch. This game follows me everywhere."
14581,"A fun game, but if you want to make it even better get yourself some good mods to along side it."
14582,barely even played this shit too busy modding it.
14583,legendary
14584,nice bro
14585,Looks like the listing took an arrow to the knee.
14586,It just works.
14587,fuckin tops
14588,Bot long tim ago an d ts vewy good
14589,soup game! make as much soup as you like! also there are wizards
14590,"A game that has aged poorly over the years and is only thought to be a ""god tier"" game by people who have nostalgia goggles thicker than the diameter of their brain. The story is basic and has as many fake choices as my highschool career, with double the amount of forgettable names and faces. The actual gameplay revolves around choosing one of many classes, all of which greatly impact how left clicking kills the enemy in front of you.

The only way you can make this game fun in 2020 is by adding enough mods to effectively make it a different game, because the best way to play Skyrim is to not be playing it in the first place. Go play the Witcher 3, or Dark Souls 3, or Cookie Clicker as they all are more refined and original."
14591,"I love this game. I never get tired of playing it, and doubt I ever will. Almost every playthrough I discover something I'd previously missed, so literal hours of fun. 10/10 would def recommend :D"
14592,"There aren't many words that can properly descibe the wonder of this world. Within this game there is lore, history, religion, love, angst and infinite joy to be cherished. There are hundreds of different ways to play- actually, COUNTLESS. You cannot possibly imagine the depth of this game until you get into it. Just give it a try. There are so many races, creatures, skills, books, faiths, factions, classes, locations, etc... I could honestly go on all day. JUST TRY IT."
14593,"it didnt suck

14594,Favourite game of all time. infinite replayability because of mods
14595,"Its a fun game, A bit brutal however."
14596,it's good just fucking play it PLEASE PLAY IT
14597,weeeeeeezer
14598,great game. modding keeps me playing as if its a new game
14599,good
14600,Predobro
14601,"I think it's fairly obvious at this point that skyrim is a good game. BUT in case you didn't know, it is indeed, a very good and fun play. It says I've played 59 hours on here, but I have it on console too, so I've definitely sunk 100s of hours into this game and honestly, it was time well spent"
14602,Happy anniversary
14603,it good
14604,absolute classic
14605,"It's beautiful, it's flawed, and it's showing its age, but there still isn't anything quite like it out there."
14606,.
14607,No matter how many times I play this game I always find something new.
14608,polvi murtus mut muute hyvä
14609,
14610,Skyrim is Life
14611,This is arguably one of the best games ever made. Say what you like about the company that created it but Skyrim set a bar that I expect every big budget role playing game to surpass.
14612,FUS RO DAAAABESGAMEVER!!!
14613,"I honestly don't even know why I bother to write a review for this title. Everyone knows it, and people who enjoy medieval fantasy love it. The infamous line ""I used to be an adventurer like you, 'till I took an arrow to the knee"" is a timeless classic line. Old school D&D style schools of magic, perpetual quest engine, multiple options for not only play style, but quest lines. Basically one of the best games of all time to date. If you don't have it, you should really add it to your collection. Even the vanilla version has the developer console you can use. Now you have a ton of community mods, and they can give a very new feel to this timeless classic."
14614,"You've probably already heard everything that you're going to hear, or need to hear about Skyrim. If you haven't: I still highly recommend it. I've never played another game that more completely creates an open world to lose myself in, and I always come back to see more of it. 
It's worth mentioning, that I also recommend the original over the remastered versions. While remastered versions include DLC and better graphics, the original Skyrim has the most verbose modding community, and the most mods. If you ever get bored of a Bethesda game, the amount of mods will certainly keep you from being bored for long."
14615,Absolutely Fantastic
14616,10/10
14617,Do I really have to write a review so you can decide to buy Skyrim? C'mon.
14618,"Oh hey I havent noticed you, I should let you know that I'm Dragonborn, lvl 80, Arch-mage of Winterhold, High-Commander of the Empire, the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, a bard of Bard's College in Solitude, Champion of 15 Daedric Princes, Guildmaster of the Thieves guild, Thane of 9 Jarls, Owners of 5 houses and three plots of land, father of two children, slayer of Vampire Lord Harkon, Werewolf with 11 perks activated, slayer of Miraak, the last known Dragonborn, reader of 5 different Black Books, Forger of Salhstrim armor and owner of three Elder's Scrolls.

I'm not just a god-damn adventurer. One more word and I'll take that goddamn arrow out of your knee and shove it down your throat."
14619,"Simply the best RPG out there , nothing comes close !"
14620,Still a classic and so many mods
14621,goof
14622,"Who's laughing now? 
Yes this is my 6th copy of Skyrim.

Praise Godd Howard."
14623,e
14624,"Honestly? Not that engaging to me. Most hours I've spent are me retrying the game to try and have fun.
You'd be better off playing a linear game with this one.

But : 20$? Just don't buy any of the garbage other versions and you'll be fine.
The game is fun, and maybe you'll have a better experience than me. It was worth the 20, I guess."
14625,yes
14626,"fAnTaStIc
"
14627,"Decent enough on it's own, but the REAL game begins when you stop playing in favor of meticulously tailoring 32 separate mod profiles each with 100+ mods each"
14628,p o g g e r s
14629,"Great game, great combat and story line."
14630,im glad i got this version it runs great on my pc
14631,Great game.
14632,good
14633,The most enjoyable part of this game was buying it across several platforms for the exact same game :)
14634,It's still fun to play after all these years after it came out.
14635,"Aside from what seems like endless quests and a great story line, the graphics and gaming action are stellar!"
14636,I'm just waiting for it to come to the Tesla....
14637,No native ultrawide support.

14644,Good game
14645,Go spend some time with Grandpa Paarthurnax.
14646,Gud
14647,This isn't a question... Buy it
14648,I throughily enjoy this game. Never gets dull. I have played this game now for several years and just keep adding mods to spice it up some. I currently have 125 mods added to it and it just makes the game more exciting as i play. Absolutely reccomend the game to any one who enjoys RPG's.
14649,plenty of content and alternative routes to take in the sidequests
14650,Good Game
14651,If you want an Action/RPG then this is for you for sure.
14652,pretty sicc ngl
14653,buy it and dont forget to add cbbe you pervs

14666,yes
14667,Its skyrim...
14668,Recommended
14669,"The most engrossing game I've ever played, I could spend a lifetime in this game and not run out of things to do, and if I ever find that to be untrue, the workshop makes it feel like I've been living in two dimensions, and it was suddenly blossomed into four full dimensions of play and fun. The glitches make it difficult sometimes, but that is what the save button is for.
Thank you Todd, this game brought me through some dark times."
14670,"Extremely fun as you can do whatever you want. I highly recommend getting some mods for it as well.
Graphics:  3/5
They aren't too bad, even in 2020. The landscapes are still beautiful.
Plot/Story:  5/5
Amazing story and tons of dialogue choice.
Gameplay:  3/5
The gameplay is mostly good, but certain essentials like climbing are missing.
Exploration:  5/5
Tons of interesting settings in a vast world to explore.
Combat:  2/5
The combat is too simple. No dodge, no parry, only hitting and blocking."
14671,"Oblivion was one of those games that blew my mind as a 16 year old.  I remember visiting a friend and, at first, thinking it looked boring.  But after a few quiet minutes of taking in the atmosphere and watching him pick up individual coins, my appetite couldn't be sated.  I immediately bought it and became obsessed for years.  My expectations for Skyrim were sky-high and it delivered on all of them.  I've probably played hundreds of hours of this game, which should speak for itself by this point.  Todd Howard said that he wanted to try something new with the fantasy world in Skyrim, largely because the team felt that Oblivion's was a little cliche.  That had never struck me as a high schooler, but it was certainly interesting trying to understand this man's vision.  Skyrim streamlines most of Oblivion's features into a more seamless experience.  You no longer have to switch to a different weapon to fire spells because you can dual wield.  Spell attacks also flow from you as a kind of stream, which is much more satisfying than Oblivion.  The landscape is more original.  It reminds me of the beauty of a cold winter day, which contrasts Oblivion's eternal summer quiet beautifully.

All in all, if you haven't experienced it, please give it a go.  It broke a lot of ground for an open-world game at the time."

14677,"This review is very late for me as well as the other games I have...but I think by the amount of hours you see I have on this game (1700 hours) and how well known it is, I think you can already tell what im going to say about it. Skyrim is where it all really started with me and when I started playing back when it first came out and I was little, it blow my mind. And even to this day I still play it, the amount of different ways you can play it is nearly endless and when you add mods into the picture then its a game you can just play forever. Discarding the billions of mods there are, generally if your playing it for the first time and without mods then the story is pretty good as well as its DLC and you will still never get tired of it after playing it for the 7th time. If you dont have this game and you like roleplaying as well as fantasy games or your starting out gaming for the first time. Get it and you wont regret it."
14678,its loading  with two mods but i can't play the actual game
14679,"  Good game, never run out of things to do, and loads of mods"
14680,hello stranger
14681,the best
14682,I love everything about this game!

14684,Just love this game.
14685,ENDLESS ADVENTURES!!!
14686,the best game
14687,literally the best rpg game if not one of the best games on steam such a good story a lot of weapons armors and skills. i really recommend this game if you want a good rpg :D
14688,"You know to me skyrim was a real deal I would pay 50 bucks plus the expansion and get tons of beatuful free mods to enjoy and hours of new gameplay.
Now what you get is chance to make Valve even more rich by stealing money to the modders and asking players to pay for stuff which was born free!"
14689,Bethesda did a good work whit skyrim
14690,Awesome and modable!
14691,Still my favorite game in 2020
14692,i'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan. While there still is alot of bugs. This is still one of my favorite of the series.
14693,good game
14694,Fierce. 10/10
14695,"I purchased this game when it came out in 2010, I have since played it many times, with many different role playing, arch types, and mods. I really enjoy this game. I am installing it again for my new wife to play.... I hope lol..."
14696,there are so many quests in this game that i spent over 200+ hours and still haven't completed it fully 7/10
14697,Is the best game  by far rivalled only by red dead 2 and perhaps es6 but otherwise full of content and hours of fun immersive gameplay THANK YOU FIR MAKING THIS GODLY GAME....!!!!
14698,After so many years This is still one of my favorite games to play. There arer many things to do and enjoy. I love how open most of it is. I love that you dont have to strictly follow a quest. You can freely create your own adventures exploring the game and doing small side quests. I highly recommend this even to new players today.
14699,will be playing this game until the day i die.
14700,Yes
14701,G A M E G O O D
14702,"Absolutely awful game. Bethesda is a horrible company that pumps out mediocre-tier RPG's. The only good games they made are either from 20+ years ago or are games they publish. 

Do not buy. Don't even get a key. Mods for this game are lame. Nothing good. 0/10"
14703,Good game. I played it for a bit.
14704,"The best RPG I've ever played. Expansive and non linear though can be played that way. Looks beautiful,the scenery is breathtaking and the game addictive. Always something new to discover"
14705,Ye is pretty good
14706,Best RPG Ever!!!!!!
14707,"good

14708,gud
14709,It just works
14710,after all these years i still find myself coming back to it
14711,"I mean, it's Skyrim."
14712,Good
14713,  This game Skyrim it is just as fun as oblivion. The graphics are better and the mods are even cooler! I'm still playing after all these years. I'm 56 years old and still a gamer at heart.
14714,good
14715,"great game i would 100% recommend
"
14716,"its skyrim, it is one of the best games ever"
14717,"This version of Skyrim is almost 9 years old now. And I am still playing it. This is a great game without mods, and an excellent game with mods. Here's a quick breakdown if you are somehow still unfamiliar with this title: 

[u]PROS[/u] 
- A true ""go anywhere, do anything"" game. At no time are you locked into a quest line. Once you escape the game's first dungeon, you can follow your NPC escort to the next town, or run in the opposite direction and never see him again. Unlike other RPGs, you won't be punished for doing so. Play however you want. 
- Strong core mechanics, that eschew the ""crunchy"" RPG systems from previous Elder Scrolls titles or games like Baldur's Gate, in favor of a more streamlined advancement system with perks that make you feel like your character is actually getting stronger over time. If you start off playing this game as a warrior, but decide you want to try out stealth archery, you don't have to start a new character. Just start doing stealth archery. You won't feel penalized just because you made some mistakes with your choices at early levels. 
- Infinitely moddable. Unlike Special Edition. With the ENB lighting overhaul, plenty of fan-made 4k texture packs, and various improvement mods for weather, water and terrain, it is possible to make this game's graphics look better than Skyrim SE. The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) allows for more complicated mods than anything you'll find on Xbox One or PlayStation 4. And, if you venture to [i]that[/i] part of the internet, Skyrim LE can also become the best adult game you've ever played. 

[u]CONS[/u] 
- No amount of mods in the world can make these NPCs feel lifelike. Their dialogue, voices and animations are just so repetitive and stiff. Only a few key characters have unique voices, and when Ralof the Stormcloak, Riverwood's blacksmith Alvor, and Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun not only share the same voice actor, but you meet all three of them during the first hour of the game? Not even the biggest Skyrim fan in the world can overlook that. 
- While fighting dragons is epic, these are also the fights that are most prone to bugs. Sometimes a dragon will ignore you entirely, and fly off to breathe fire on some nearby goats. Sometimes you'll get one down to half-health, but it can't find a good place to land, and will set itself down in a field about a mile away. If you try out the dragon riding mechanic introduced in the Dragonborn DLC, you will find yourself wishing that Skooma was a real thing, so you could shove some in your eyes. 
- Stealth is overpowered. With the right perks, you can literally steal the armor off your enemies' backs and inject them with lethal poison, completely unseen by your victim or his 3 bandit friends standing 10 feet away. There aren't nearly enough awesome spells for high-powered mages (the ""Apocalypse"" mod is a must-download for me) or devastating combat abilities for warriors. There's a reason why nearly everyone winds up going with stealth archery in this game. 

[u]OVERALL[/u] 
It's an imperfect game, but with near-infinite replayability. If we just had some NPC companions I actually cared about besides Serana, I could overlook most of the other bugs. Once you discover the potential of the modding community though, you'll see that this game delivers more content for the price tag than any other game ever made, period."

14722,best game ever made

Definitely worth playing."
14724,"no

14725,I liked it
14726,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Why do you care? A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.

General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.

Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us."
14727,so much fun to play modded or unmodded it dont  matter its so fun eather way
14728,Its Skyrim
14729,An awesome game that you can keep going back to time-and-time again. Well worth the price.

14732,Great virtual world - expansive and very consuming.
14733,Who.. are you?
14734,"This game is indescribable. The vast amount of quests, choices, factions and random encounters in this game are endless. There is so much freedom in creating a character, building their persona and fleshing them out as a person. I couldn't recommend this game enough."
14735,"It's Skyrim, need I say more?"
14736,"Against all odds I have managed to only buy this game once.

Not perfect, but I liked it."
14737,"This is the best computer RPG around, thanks largely to the modding community."
14738,"A beautiful and timeless game, I've spent hour across multiple platforms and this game is still one of my favorite RPGs to date"
14739,my 7th play threw but my 1st play on PC Love this game to death
14740,"It not that good, dropped adter a couple hours"
14741,"pretty good

14742,highly immersive gameplay but it is difficult to forget that you are playing a game by bethesda otherwise very cool give todd mone
14743,One of the best games ever more than 10 years later i am always coming back to this game.
14744,"Absolut blast to download it again once in a while, mod the shit out of it and then hope it doesnt crash with 150 mods installed. even after 9 FREAKING YEARS its still hella fun"
14745,The greatest game ever made in my own opinion.
14746,"An empty void with an EXTREMELY SHORT MAIN STORY! Compared with Oblivion this is atrocious. Less interesting side quests, main quests, story, music. The best side quests are from The Companions? They're not really all that interesting either. I finished all the side quests I found on the way and they all feel baren, empty soul-less and boring.

Quests in Skyrim that are either boring or watered down from Oblivion: Sheogorath has an 2 WORLDS FILLED WITH QUESTS TO HIMSELF (in the Shivering Isles) but in Skyrim he just has an extremely easy and hollow questline that has the density of a fart, The Dark Brotherhood has more developed actions (such as getting the option of becoming a vampire), characters in Oblivion but Skyrim has quests that effect the world en masse (assassination of the emperor) BOTH ARE GREAT, The Theives Guild in Skyrim has one good quest but also has an infinite amount of repeated trash, The Arena quests do not exist in Skyrim, Mages guild is the Collage which are both meh and the Fighter Guild has either been repressed from my memory or doesn't exist in Skyrim. And in Oblivion the Theives Guild is better. I could gush about how many options you have to find the Guild but that really doesn't matter much here. What does matter is the actual quests they give you which are fun (such as the speed-running one, or the one after the Gray Fox gets found. The one where you get to frame a betrayer).

Tell me of any quests better in Skyrim than Oblivion. Or any side quests that aren't just fetching someones fucking sandwich.

But just don't tell me I'm blinded by bias or 'nostalgia' that I don't have. I played Skyrim for 50 fucking hours so I ABSOLUTELY GAVE IT A CHANCE and have 0 things to do in it."
14747,great game just wished bethesda upgrade my version of it to the se version dont think ill end up buying another copy of the same game

But i disliked that some of the quests are unimaginative and repeating."
14761,"The Game revamped the openworld RPG genre. And brought a whole new flavor to the world of Elder Scrolls. You can become the most powerful mage in Tamriel, the fiercest warrior in Skyrim, the luckiest Thief, or the most skilled Assassin. Skyrim offers play styles and activities for any fan of RPGs."

14782,An immense game with massive longevity.  Great modding scene keeps the original version fresh and relevant.

14785,Old Paper Skyrim
14786,:)
14787,fun game to play when you have nothing else to do ^w^
14788,"Just buy and play it. One of the best RPG you can play.

If you'll wonder, how I could spend so many hours into the game... well... the magic word is modding. There's no need to mod the game, because it is nice done on it's own, but if you'll like it more realistic, there is no way to go around modding Skyrim. Example: A real night mod will make the night and dungeons really black like in reality, if there is no fire, torch or candle lighting it up. So... now you'll have a need for light spells or maybe being a vampire or werewolf, nightvision finally has a meaning. On the other hand, by using light or a torch, enemies will recognize you faster, too... Or you want to be killed by traps? Use a trap mod. Eat/drink? Ice/cold? Just modify it to your liking and have fun."
14789,"So I played this game in my other Steam account and I also played this game in PS3 (I don't have this in this Steam account, I don't know why I'm allowed to leave a review on this game right now). Every gamer should play this game. Even this game is too old, this game is still worth your time. I still prefer this rather than the ESO. Tried playing ESO, but I just can't love the game. One of the best open world games ever made. Good job Besthesda!"
14790,"One of my favourite games since I first played it on PS3 in 2012, I still frequently play the game to date.
Unfortunately, steam is hiding this version from the store, despite being arguably the best version available, if you have the right mods and unofficial patches for it, since Bethesda sadly stopped supporting this version in favor of the Special Edition.

At the very least, I would recommend looking on Nexus Mods for the following: Unofficial patch (for the base game and each DLC), the 2K texture pack and most importantly: Borderless Windowed Mode!

You can truly make the game a personal experience. You can mod it with lore friendly mods, that only add weapons, gear and enemies that would fit in with the lore, or you can use mods to have all dragons turn into Thomas the Tank Engine, fly around as Goku or Iron Man, and yes, even for those who wish to, there are X-rated mods out there.

Personally, I tend to stick with mods that add to the lore without making it seem out of place.

I did find however that there are some issues with the game you should know about:
The game does not play nice with high refresh rate monitors. With some searching, I found that locking it to 100Hz refreshrate works best and doesn't cause glitching or objects to fly at lightspeed when bumping into them.
Again, I highly recommend using the borderless window mode mod, as full screen will crash the game if the game is randomly minimized (windows tends to do this for no apparent reason), or when you alt-tab.

Another thing, if you are not able to use ENB shaders, using your graphics card's controls (in my case nVidia control panel) will allow you to adjust the Gamma and Vibrance to make the game less dark and gloomy looking, without impacting performance.
Why I'm sharing this?
Because I'm playing on a gaming laptop with a 100% sRGB color calibrated 144hz panel, and find that some locations are just too dark and the overall game looks pretty gloomy.
I've tried several ENB profiles, but each one, despite some looking absolutely stunning, impacted the performance so much that I was forced to suffer framerate dips a lot.
Setting Gamma to 1.30 and Digital Vibrance to 80 makes the game look so much better already!

Overall, this game allows you to play it the way you want and to this day, still manages to surprise me with little things I never thought possible in this game."
14791,:)
14792,"started this in 2020 and i fucking love it, its a bit annyoing when it comes to the loading screenss, but there are mods for everything so i got a mod called open cities, great shit no more loading screens for simple doors"
14793,"You already know what it is. its skymin baybeeeee! The story may not be amazing, the roleplaying may not be amazing, but the sense of fun and adventure is unparrelled. 9/10, nearly a mastapiece!"
14794,"Best roleplaying game ever,,, bear in mind you can mod this game massively and it will improve the graphics leaps and bounds. epic story, takes ages to find and explore everything, such an immersive story,,,,but mod it,,, there are so many enhancements you can add to this already brilliant game,,,,, buy it you fool,,, NOW!!!!!"
14795,"What can I say, it's Skyrim."
14796,"This review isn't for you. I mean Skyrim is ubiquitous you probably know about it, and own like 3 copies. This review is for me, so I remember what I thought about it at least somewhat close to when I last played it.

Skyrim has many flaws and it definitely took some steps back from its predecessors. But it is still utterly enjoyable and somehow manages to suck you in seamlessly. 

Pros
+The world feels big space wise
+Progression is fun. Leveling up makes a difference but so does getting equipment,
+The different areas of Skyrim look and feel different
+The inclusion of modding materials allows for anything to be fixed or altered
+Graphics were solid for its day. Still fine even by today's standards
+You can do and be everything in one play through
+There is a wide variety of stuff to see and do
+Many good first impressions. Stumbling upon a vampire lair or entering black reach for the first time felt good. 
+Large amount of content. Yes it starts getting pretty samey, but there is enough variety to keep going
+Stuff happens in the world of Elder Scrolls. The invincible omnipresent empire is crumbling. Morrowind flipping exploded. Alliances form and shift. It feels like a place with a proper history
+I enjoyed the atmosphere in the taverns, on the road, and most ""dungeons"". I did not enjoy it in towns, shops, NPC houses, or castles. 

Cons
-There are not enough people in Skyrim
-Too many unbalanced mechanics. For example: Destruction magic plays in a way that trivializes many encounters by rag dolling foes but then is useless against enemies that don't ragdoll like dragons
-Not enough perk points (I usually mod this)
-Speech craft is under utilized and the perks suck
-Main Story is mediocre. Feels worse than Morrowind or Oblivion.
-Side Quest stories range from terrible to ok. Due to how you experience stories (no cut scenes, no real puzzles, just talk and fight) no quest feels unique. The only story that actually engaged me was the Dark Brotherhood and upon scrutiny it also doesn't actually hold up that well.
-Many laughable moments. The entire civil war is a joke, when like 5 imperials and 5 storm cloaks fight it out it feels more like a minor tavern brawl than it does an epic battle. 
-The entire game essentially boils down to clunky combat. There are so many fun scenarios but they usually all end the same way
-The actual character mechanics ultimately are not detailed enough for me. I mean most perks just up numbers (+25% axe damage, oh boy). Wish there was more complexity
-They keep rereleasing this damn game. And you sobs keep buying it. STOP. ONCE IS ENOUGH
-Elderscrolls is still pretty racist... So white people get Nord (Warriors), Bretons (magic users), or Imperials (Charmers) and black people get Redguard (Agile Warriors)?  I get its a medieval European fantasy and its continuing lore from decades ago, so there are good reasons for it, but that doesn't mean I can't still be a bit bummed about it. Especially since Skyrim has become like THE face of gaming
-You can't kill Maven Blackbriar. She is evil and corrupt and often talks down to you. LET ME MURDER HER!
-On the same note, the fact that quest critical NPCs can't be killed at all is a weak way of solving the problem
-Dragon shouts suck. I would unlock a few then never use them. Fus-Roh-Dah was the only really entertaining one and it still was not that practical.

There is an entire cottage industry criticizing Skyrim, and for good reason. However, I have a rule that if I played a game for over 100 hours I HAVE to recommend it, so here we are. I did enjoy my time in Skyrim, but it is time to move on"
14797,I love dis game. If you dont love dis game you prolly wont like a lot of rpg and/or open world games out there in the world.
14798,Best Game. Don't argue.
14799,"Amazing, this is my favorite game!"

14836,"An instant classic.
Not perfect, and missing the charming classes and racial traits of previous installments, but a solid storyline, great characters, and immersive world will engulf you completely.

Which is nothing to speak of the massive modding community that will guarantee hours of play. Talos guide you!"
14837,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is, by far and any measure, my favorite game of all time. The story, lore, visual integrity and gameplay make this installment in the Elder Scrolls series (soon to be saga) the penultimate virtual experience for anyone in search of action, adventure and beauty. In sum, I could not recommend this Bethesda product more highly, and am certainly looking forward to the release of its successor in a few years time."
14838,"This is a great game and I hope that I can play TES6 soon!

14842,"One od the most iconic roleplay games. You can be whoever you like, especially with mods.
"
14843,
14844,this is probably the best game ever. if you want a game that you can play a hundred times and do things differently every time this is it. and if you ever get bored you have 60+million mods to mess around with just be careful because not all the mods are made to improve gameplay
14845,"What can I say? It's Skyrim. Loads of potential for new characters and ways to play. Mods open those possibilities even further. Has this game aged well? Not really honestly. It looks muddy and the unfixed bugs.... oh the unfixed bugs. Thanks to modmakers some can be fixed or worked around. Console commands can help too.
But is Skyrim still fun so many years on? Yes. Absolutely. 7/10"
14846,One of the greatest RPG´s that I ever played
14847,"If you like the fantasy genre at all, and are particularly fond of the magic that cold climates bring with them, you're gonna love this game.

It's an incredible journey to play through this game, and all sorts of things can happen you'd never expect, be it through prepared storylines or hilarious, most of the time harmless bugs. 

Not playing this at least once imo makes you miss out on a unique experience no other game really could recreate for me just the same as Skyrim, or Oblivion did."
14848,"needs mods to sustain fun.
The game was designed to sell copies, and design ethics like player-enemy level scaling proves this."

Also, If you have a headset, get the VR version!"
14857,this is the most amazing game ever made

14867,"Well, let's start this review. Firstly, I am one of those people who knew about Skyrim, but never touched it, I wanted to do it in right mood. Some things I want to point about this game:
- Story, lore is good, not that great, not bad, something but ok-ish;
- Graphics kinda feel old (old enough to be compared with Dragon Age: Origins);
- The game is still fun though. I, especially, liked how you can pick up / steal literally everything from everywhere;
- Hardest level is really hard, enemies don't want to die >_<
- NPCs are really stupid. It is really fun to see how crowd of guards follow me, and I am starting to talk to other NPCs, and then those NPCs with markers start fighting guards. It is fun, 'cause guards shouldn't attack me whilst I talk to their bosses, and then again, their bosses for some reason start killing their own soldiers LOL. The most funniest part of it was at Whiterun where we would kill Commander Caius everytime he health up after killing him for eternity;
- Oh almost  forgot. What I really liked about this game is its fighting mechanics, it really makes it more realistic;
- Overall, great game, really fun and enjoyable. At first, might be a little hard to adapt as you don't know where to go, where to start and etc., but with time you will get a grasp of it.

P.S. And this game was a reason how we became friend. Back in 05.07.2014 I traded CS:GO with his TES V: Skyrim, and that is where it started.

Thanks for trading with me, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198131174369/]My Lil friend[/url]! <3"

14869,"   For anyone who hasn't played this game : Please try it. I know , it may look unappealing. I know the gameplay is clunky and I most sertainly know that the voice acting isn't the best . But this game isn't about all that . The Elder Scrolls was never about that . What this game can gift you is an experience ; an experience you will never forget and that you'll always feel nostalgic about . This game's story and lore in general is so in-depth , that you'll feel like playing a game based on a Tolkein's book . This world feels so alive ; the creatures , the people -enemies or friends -  , everything you come across in this game makes you feel like you really are a person living in the frozen land of Skyrim . Moreover , the music is phenomenal and I've found myself listening to it many , many times . 
   Now , this game isn't all good . As I mentioned , it is not the game with the best graphics . Far from it , actually . But that doesn't mean that the game is not beautiful . The game is gorgeus . The landscapes , the scenery , the lighting ; all combined give us a lovely world that you want to invest time to explore . 
   Graphics isn't the only thing that this game does wrong though . What this game is lacking is originality ( in more ways than one ) . Sure  , the encounters are interesting for the first three or so times . But there are so few situations you can encounter , that after the first 20 hours or so , the game starts to become repetitive . You will eventually get bored of fighting the same enemies , having the same conversations , seeing the same thing . 
   Finally , there is Todd . Oh Todd . The way you managed to make the cumminity hate you and love you so much is remarcable . For those who don't know , Todd Howard is the mind behind the Elder Scrolls series . He's become sort of a meme , you could say , for his lies , achievements and ways he managed to sell Skyrim to us for a million times . Why am I includung him in a really long review that nobody will care to read ? You might have noticed that the game is unlisted on steam . The original , cheeper version , at least . That's why Todd probaly want to sell more coppies of the other two versions of this game on Steam (Remastered and Vr ) . That man's greed is is unbelievable . But I guess that makes him who he is .
    I hope you found that review helpfull , and thank you if you read the whole thing . Happy Gaming :)"
14870,Good!!!!
14871,best game ever
14872,Just like playing the different builds
14873,It is a fun game to play and also a good storyline...
14874,This game reminds me of my grandpa using a mouse.
14875,hahahahahaha
14876,"Going in for my 3rd playthrough
Installed 50 mods
Game couldn't even start
After hours of work the game started
It. Just. Works!

Without mods it's a dated enjoyable game, with mods it's a masterpiece!

10/10 will crash again, and"
14877,5/5
14878,The best open world game
14879,Download a mod that changes dragons to Thomas the tank engine. Totally worth it.
14880,if you dont know what skyrim is google it its pretty dank and get some mods on it to make it better dragons never stood a chance against a AT4

14884,"Nice
"
14885,"Skyrim is such a classic rpg game that notes on specific fantasy, character development, along with a beautiful SE & modding for PC its overwhelmingly my favorite vidja game"
14886,its a good game
14887,A
14888,I have been playing this game for over 700 hours and haven't had to restart yet.
14889,Go for it!
14890,cool fun good
14891,I love this game.
14892,"I have played over 400 hours of this game, and if I had posted this review a few years ago, then I would have recommended this game. Although, within the last year or two, this game just crashes every time I open it. It isn't any mods I've downloaded in the past because I deleted the entire game, mods and all, and I still can't even open the game. After doing some research, I have found that you need specific mods on the Nexus to even get some semblance of the game to run. I am not in the know on what causes this, but until the game can actually run without help from a modding community that I don't even know how to use, I stand that I would not recommend this game."
14893,Best game I have ever played
14894,Flawless game.
14895,
14896,"I'm just going to copy paste my review for Special Edition since they're literally the same game. However, you should definitely buy the Special Edition since it's much more stable in every way and have a cool lighting upgrade if you're not willing to use ENB.

Having played this game on various platforms and versions for well over 1000 hours, I can say two main things about Skyrim:

1- If you're new to the RPG genre (Not like those new games that is categorized as ""RPG"" just because they have a skill tree. Yes, I'm looking at you Witcher and Assassins Creed. ) and want to delve into a whole new world, then this game is definitely for you. It's casual enough for everyone to understand the world and story, and it doesn't have a complex mechanical structure like those old cRPGs. It's much more focused on action elements while still providing tons of roleplaying chances in an amazing setting. However, if you've played games like The Witcher 3 and expect those kinds of things, don't. In terms of story and storytelling, this game is nothing like The Witcher 3. Both main and side stories are clunky and you won't even care about them except for a few questline.

2- If you're an oldschool RPG fan who've played and liked games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Icewind Dale or even Dragon Age: Origins and Mass Effect, this game might not be for you. It's still a good game that you may enjoy, but don't expect anything like the games I've just mentioned. Combat is very action oriented with no room for tactics and all. Dialogue options can vary, but they're definitely not rich, it's mostly your typical ""yes, no"" type of options. (There's not even sarcastic yes.) However, if you're into tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, the game gives you a HUGE chance to roleplay, even in vanilla. 

There are some good amount of class and profession variations that you can do to roleplay. You want to be a merchant who only trades by wandering town to town? You can do it. You want to be a fierce warrior who earns his living by killing monsters and bandits? Sure, go ahead. You want to be an evil elf with a secret lair who secretly kills nords because of an old trauma? Hell yeah you can do that. You want to be a loving family dad while being a town guard? You might need a few console commands but yes, you can also do that. I've played this game with anything from ""imma go murder every single man in this land"" to ""I'm just a peaceful dude who lives in a shack and sells rabbit meat"" and I can easily say that every playthrough has its own delight.

Although, if you want to experience this game to the fullest, you definitely should install mods. Nearly all Bethesda games have an awesome engine in terms of mod support, so there are thousands of awesome mods for all your tastes that you can download for free and you don't even need a good PC to use most of them.

Overall, awesome game with a lot of opportunity for roleplaying, albeit with a mediocre gameplay/story. 

8/10 in Vanilla.
11/10 with mods."

14938,It's Skyrim
14939,"It's hard to overstate just how impressive, epic, deep and engaging Skyrim is. It's truly a masterpiece and one of the greatest RPGs and indeed one of the greatest games I've ever played. To enjoy it fully, I recommend you load it up with some graphical mods that will bring graphic fidelity up-to-date."
14940,they remastered all of the bugs and even added more
14941,"I once was a adventurer like you, Until I took a arrow to the knee. 
"
14942,"Maybe i am too late to talk about this amazing game that generated a unimaginable number of memes, mods, videos, art and soo many more incredible things but this is my try.
When some one say that you can't die before playing skyrim they are saying this not because it is just a amazing game that changeda entire generation of action-RPGs and RPGs in general, Or because it has a amazing world with a large number of quests and places each one with its on story ( or as a certain developer would say "" you can go to any mountain you see"").
It is because of all of this plus all the work and affection that the community has been putting in this game for about a decade, all the incredible and funny and game changing mods that offer you a experience that is Endless...



And of course because of thomas the tank engine, arrows in the knee and sweet rolls."

14951,Ive logged over 1k hours into this game. Of course its great.
14952,"My favourite elder scrolls and bethesda game. I've been playing skyrim for more than half a decade on many different consoles. Why would I come back? The world. Skyrim has the best world out of any game ever, beating FNV and beating Dark Souls. Granted Skyrim does not house interesting quests and characters nor does it have a complex interconnected design. But this is the only game where I can look at the floor and feel sick then look at the horizon and feel overwhelmed.
10/10 Fckn masterpiece"
14953,"One of my all-time favorite RPGs. Open-world, dragon-hunting, treasure-looting fun for the whole family."
14954,"Wide as an ocean deep as a puddle, but still a game as comfort food.  Mods are necessary, but a great game nonetheless."
14955,"Don't expect it to be a jewel like Morrowind or Oblivion but it is fun nonetheless. Better for casual play, mods fix a lot though. Best part about this game is the mods and modding support"

also please tell me how to get giant armor"
14966,"good
"
14967,"worth it?
Both yes and no.
If you want to well written story you're better of spending your money somewhere else.
If you want action wrapped in the guise of an RPG, you may like this game.
There's loads of mods for this game, but so much garbage to sort through before you find those worth adding.
Maybe I've played this game too much or maybe I'm just fed up with poorly written games from Bethesda, but it's a negative from my side regardless."
14968,THE GREATEST OFFLINE GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED
14969,yeh its alright
14970,its skyrim

14986,"If you haven't heard of this game yet, might I suggest climbing out of the cave you've spent your life in? This game not only provides a great story and freedom to play how you want, but also the option to mod the game to your hearts content.

15002,"1600 hours (chronological order)
+1000 modding
+100 breaking the game
+100 laughing at awesome bugs: result of murdering lots of NPCs
+100 playing interesting mods: good quests, nice NPCs, eventually murdering original NPCs that get in the way
+100 watching the sky and murdering random annoying NPCs
+100 listening the soundrack while murdering boring NPCs 
+100 murdering all of the guards because the game is boring.
Still the are so many ways you can murder the people of Skyrim that 1600 hours are not enough.
Animals and dragons are fine."

15019,its skyrim
15020,"To put it short: If you're bored of it or you think it's too easy, play it on Legendary difficulty.
And here's my way (Longer way) of seeing it:

So,
I have played Skyrim for a lot of time, on other accounts than this one.
What is different this time?
Well, before I get into this, let me give you a brief of my experience with this game.
All fine, played it for the first time in 2015 I think, and I felt that I am entering into such a huge world, with all those mountains and valleys to explore, just for me.
I played on the easy difficulties, and I have finished the main storyline 3 times already. However, after a while, the game felt too easy for me, and I have decided to leave it after a while, because it felt boring being the Immortal Dragonborn in this game.
Then I started searching for other RPG games, specifically older ones, and what intrigued me the most was the Gothic series, for the difficulty levels they present.
I've played it for some time, and tought about how they manage to create such a huge feeling for a world so small. 

The answer is: Difficulty.

You can't just roam everywhere you want, safely, feeling secure just because you're ""The Chosen One"" in Gothic. You have to die quite alot until you figure out that the world in game works quite like in does IRL (Except for when you learn to take advantage of the games' bugs).

Then I tought: ""What if Skyrim was this difficult?""
Then I also realised that I have never played Skyrim on the hardest difficulty that it provides. Legendary.
I mean yes, I did that (We all did, I'm pretty sure), but then I gave up on using it because it felt impossible. That until I have learned that in order to make a game enjoyable, you must put yourself into the position of always searching for ways in which not to die.

So I restarted playing Skyrim, on Legendary difficulty, from the beginning. No fast travel, regardless of where I am. No mods (other than graphical and lore-friendly).
And it feels just incredible. Of course, in the beginning I almost wanted to give up at times. But in the meanwhile, you realise that even Skyrim can make you feel as if that Prophecy of the Dragonborn can just never happen, just because you can randomly die while fighting a pack of wolves.

Not to mention the importance of followers.

I used them just to carry stuff with me, but now, I use them in battle, like for real, I need them!

So, in the end. Why all this stuff written down here?

Because I want you to know that if you are bored of Skyrim, then try replaying it on Legendary, all the way through. It feels like a new game.

Optional rule: Death is permanent. Remove your savegame once you're dead. (I cannot go that extreme though, it feels time-wasting to me, I also have a job and college to attend)"
15021,
15022,it is a great game to play
15023,igen
15024,Simple the best game ever.
15025,Good game. I still prefer Morrowind.
15026,"Exemplary 
"
15027,Its like Skyrim with... Mods
15028,"Amazing visual effects and a nature close to realistic view. In my opinion if a game is linear and you can not finish it in different ways then the game is not worth playing because of the expectancy to finish only in one way. Skyrim try to make the game as flexible as it can, but fails at the end where the only way to say you finish the big game is only to challenge the big Dragon, this means that the games ends at this point as a story mode,but even if you finish this way you can continue to play on and because most of the side missions and task are completed you got the options to install addons to make the game longer and interesting.I recommend playing with addons just for fun."
15029,The scroll was old
15030,"If you haven't played Skyrim yet, I don't know why you are wasting time reading reviews. Just play the damn game!!"
15031,"My favorite game of all time.
Not many hours because I used to play on the pirate."
15032,Skyrim is just theo games that i really life and it has been on steam for years now and i still love it today
15033,Is good. Todd told me to buy.
15034,ye
15035,Always been a favorite of mine since it came out. A lot to do and so much to explore.
15036,worth playing.
15037,A Timeless Classic
15038,"Never managed to finish the story. For some reason after over 200 hours into the game I got bored and lost interest to finish this. The journey was quite epic though and you can mod this game with tons of new stuff. Basically an infinite experience.

- story is fine
- controls can be clunky at times
- big world to explore with lots of things and interesting locations to find

Give this game a try if you haven't done yet. You might want some mods to improve graphics though."
15039,yeet ro dah
15040,"""If you can get past the strictly brown and brown color palette and the load of quest-breaking bugs, Skyrim stands as the most lived in RPG of it's generation, perhaps even the best in the genre.""

Pros :
- Teeming with life, from wildlife roaming around to NPCs having specific schedules and even getting will money when an NPC friend dies (i'm not kidding, it's so f***ing cool). I have spent hours in this game just hunting. Oh yeah, it's a great hunting sim.
- Solid main quest. Not the best, but better then what the majority of the series has to offer, and really oozes personality and a strong sense of identity.
- Even better side quests. Seriously, some of the random caves and dungeons in the game will take you down game length rabbit holes, and they all tie in together in the whole ""skyrim universe"" rather seamlessly.
- Game is accessible, but hard if you want it to be so. Put the game on max difficulty and become a vampire and voila, you have 1990s RPG gameplay on steroids.
- The controller support just works. Such a pro. Such a pro.

Cons :
- This shit is brown. Everything. Is brown. No way to really do away with it either, since the teofis command takes away essential atmospheric effects as well as the brown filter. 
- Buggiest AAA game I have ever played, hands down. Nothing hurts more then a exit passageway not opening and either having to cheat you're way out or backtrack all the way out. Immersion breaking at it's peak.
- Frametime mess on Windows 10. Special Edition just plays so much better on modern PCs, but prefer the OG look so, what can ya do.

Still the best RPG I have ever played."
15041,"its a good game
"
15042,yes
15043,game is game. you shout and download big titty mods. 10/10
15044,I mean I run around like a mad woman hacking and slashing. What's not to like?
15045,"Great Overall
"
15046,just play it
15047,pogh
15048,"love the colors, the detail of objects and people, and the gameplay has plenty of options to specialize, the magic system is functional and varied, and the dragonshout mechanics can be hilarious in their implementations... flying sheep , anyone ?"
15049,You know how many stories you can create with just the vanilla get let alone the mods hell the game itself is amazing 10/10 would play again and again and again oh wait I already have and so have many other people
15050,really good game runs decent on my laptop which is amazing
15051,this game is so good the gameplay the story play this game and you will make your life good if your life is bad
15052,L33tness and mods are always fun once you passed the game
15053,Ive spent most of this decade playing this game on some device or another...would say 10/10 would like to see released on leap pad
15054,"ive sold my soul to tod howard, unfortunately"
15055,yeah
15056,"Lots of small quests, complex story, even though the game is super old there are lots of easter eggs, hidden quests and locations which keep it fun."
15057,sex mods is very good
15058,"I simply love Skyrim. I started on xbox-360 and eventually got it for the PC. And I got to say, on PC a whole new world opened up for me. Mods, better graphics and ofc the option to play with a controller if needed."
15059,nice
15060,"An open world, single-player, story-driven, lore-rich RPG. Get this along with Fallout 4. Another good with Skyrim though, is it's not too demanding with the PC requirements. People have played this for thousands of hours, and they still find new things they haven't found before. Also, modding this game with the Nexus will make your gameplay so extensive. Thought of some ideas you might think is nice to add in the game? There's probably a mod for that."
15061,There's nothing to dislike about this :O
15062,"I've only played it for a bit, but so far it's fun and overall seems like a good game."
15063,Have more copies than needed. This is game is somehow worth it. I even have it on Alexa...
15064,its active

15070,I would recommend this game to other players
15071,9 years later still playing. Must mod.
15072,"At first you think that you wont download hentai off of the Nexus..

But then...."
15073,shit sucks
15074,"This game on its own is meh at best; however, if you take the time to really learn how to mod, it can become exactly what you are looking for."
15075,"It's amazing, no flaws."
15076,"One of the best games ever made, plain and simple. Endless hours of exploring, unique and varied combat experiences, extensive crafting, great expansions/DLC, involved mod community, the list goes on. A must play."
15077,"This game is amazing, My only compaints is about UI and bugs but that can be solved with mods"
15078,A timeless classic with hundreds of hours of value.
15079,"Accidentally pickpocketed and someone saw, so I had to murder the whole village while the kids watched because children can't be murdered. 10/10"
15080,skyrim is a large game
15081,I like this game is good
15082,"2013, my first time playing Skyrim:

On my way to Bleak Falls Barrow, I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them off, but I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week later, I came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire.

Confused, I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. However, as soon as I arrived, I was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this point, I had done some quests for the companions, so I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the city, with several of them hot on my tail, I burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-lived, however, as a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battle, the guards all lay dead on the ground.

Before I could celebrate, all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were going, I decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlight, I witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terror, but it was no use. Belethor, Adrianne, even Nazeem, they all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions.

As I walked through the blood-soaked streets, I found a single survivor: Brenuin, the town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hiding, crouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to him, when I saw Farkas, axe in hand, coming into the pen. With a deep, gutteral voice, he says, ""Where are you?"" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow, ""Ha! Found you!"" he yells.

Brenuin screams for mercy, but it's too late. Farkas's massive axe comes down on Brenuin's skull, splitting it in two, as the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood.

It was then I realized that I would be playing this game for years to come."

15091,"classic bethesda, absolutely amazing game with far too many bugs and glitches. Took me a damned long time but i managed to run through a door with a mate"
15092,"I fell in love with Skyrim all the way back in 2014. I was living in Australia in the time, having moved there from my native home of Ireland and there was something about that fateful carriage ride, the chaos of surviving Helgen, and the calm sounds and beautiful surroundings of the wilds of Skyrim that calmed me right down.
Modded or Vanilla, I love this game, not for the graphics or the way it plays, but for the story it told and the memories it gives me."
15093,ok
15094,Pogchamp
15095,"This is a great game. I have played it through many times since it;s release. The graphics were and still are exceptional. The main quest is solid and there so many side quests,, I can always find something new."
15096,"very very very veryu verey gud
"
15097,"Awesome game, if you are wondering if it is still worth buying, don't even hesitate.
If it was not for this game i would not have considered buying TESO at all.
Can't wait to see what the next instalment has to offer."

15109,good
15110,cmon its skyrim
15111,not bad
15112,yes
15113,It's Honestly addicting.
15114,Legendary Game.
15115,
15116,although i have played this game longer on the Xbox then Pc. it's a game that gave me a lot of good memories.
15117,It's fun
15118,"The main quest took me 16 hours to complete. Having just completed Oblivion (2006) at first glance could not notice much improvement graphics-wise other than water, faces, shadows, and lighting. I mean, if you compare Morrowind (2002) and Oblivion (2006) you do not have to look for improvements because they just jump at you wherever you go. Not the case here. Goes on to show the crazy rate of advancement back in the day and lack thereof these days. No one's fault really and not a bad thing, just an observation. But it still looks lovely and less cartoonish than Oblivion, partly because of the more realistic colours and faces. Oh, and I absolutely loved the tunes here, just as in every other TES game!"
15119,good game
15120,great game if u like rpg. 100 out of 100 for me.
15121,"cool
"
15122,It is a video game.
15123,still a good game
15124,yes.
15125,"Terrible and Predictable story that you can finish in less than 5 hours, The only saving grace is everything outside of that. Mods, DLC packs, Side quests, etc flesh the game out more. However It brings forth the arguement that if the Story is lackluster but all the other content is great - should it be regarded as highly as it is? 

Skyrim is the most overrated in the TES series - with it's previous entries offering more interesting stories, side quests, lore and game play.

Skyrim also proves that TES is long overdue for a complete revamp and also an extended break.

You might get enjoyment out of it, however after completing the main mission and trying out some different classes, I had no reason or no motivation to do any of the side quests or even intercede in the war between factions, which actually holds no relevance or affects the world in any way, shape or form."
15126,"honestly its a great game, there is so much you can do. 10/10 

ngl though its better with random mods at times like alternative starting so you can have a new play through each time."
15127,"Eh, it's okay. Could use another remaster though."
15128,"While my friends were fuc4ing their girlfriends I was fighting dragons.

15138,Little overrated
15139,one of the best rpg games I've ever played I have more than 300 hours on this
15140,Still worth a buy in 2020 if you haven't played oldrim with mods you missing out.
15141,it ok i guess pp hehe
15142,I love the game...
15143,Amazing game hands down! Graphics mods + are the way to go!
15144,Skyrim... Nuff said. Co-op would be dope.

15164,"I spent more time installing mods for this game than I did actually playing it.

This game felt 9 years old 9 years ago.

It feels like Oblivion but that game had the excuse of being even older - Skyrim is just more overrated and over hyped. Weightless movement and combat, with the game scaling to you so you never feel like you're getting more powerful. BORING."
15165,one of my fav games of all time
15166,"very fun favroute game

15171,great game. obviously.
15172,love it best rpg i played yet

15174,It's a great open world game with a ton of quests to get done. Honestly best game for ADHD players.
15175,"Open world, massive number of mods, although a lot of them seem to be paywalled off."
15176,"This was a good game, now its crash happy. Bad update and all the creators have to say is reinstall etc"
15177,"It's one of my all time favourite games!
It might not show, but I played the hell out of this game on xbox360.
And Skyrim was actually the game that killed my first xbox ;d
I haven't got the time to play many games now days, but I have played Skyrim with mods on pc and I have to say some can be really amazing.
So yeah overall it's a great game and I recommend everyone to try playing it at least once."
15178,It's cool
15179,"i like girls and adam; and adam is especially the one with the last name agbaria

15180,mods.

"
15182,"Good open world, many ways to play.
"
15183,dw
15184,"Without mods is just another game, that gets old after playing it few hours. If you install mods (and tahts quite complicated) it gets way more interesting, but unfortunately a lot laggier too, and starts crashing. So far Conan Exiles is lot better."
15185,It's okay.
15186,ah haha
15187,good game
15188,"its good
"
15189,pppgf
15190,good game
15191,"it's okay.
-
In all seriousness, I do like this game. The only downside is unlike Oblivion I NEED mods to have fun on this game anymore."
15192,"I cannot believe in all the years I have had and played this game, I never gave it a review.

it is an awesome game. on my last computer my save number was at least 3200. that means that I had saved 3200 times on that computer alone. This game is fun, incredibly fun.
I view this as a basic fantasy game, you've got elves, orcs, dragons, magic, vampires, werewolves, potions, weapons, all the works for a good fantasy game. And it was made one of the best. 
i'm not good at explaining how good, but I haven't completed all of the quests yet, or even tried characters that use stealth or magic instead of brute force.
its a great game."
15193,"great game
"
15194,Fun game worth playing at least once all the way through!
15195,Dragons and men with funny accents.
15196,👍
15197,classic
15198,mint game
15199,Lots of fun.
15200,My most favourite game.
15201,The best rpg ever
15202,"...Yeah, it's fine."
15203,"its a good game. despite the fact it keeps closing mid-game, its still good
"
15204,BEST HARD ON I EVER HAD
15205,"Skyrim is essentially half my life back 7 years ago, and most of the time I was playing a mega-modded version. 7 years later, while all my mods installations are gone along with my old computer, I played the original version, and man, it's still a blast. For anyone who hasn't tried the game yet, this is the essentially the bible of games. It's a classic that no other developers other than Bethesda themselves can replicate.

Now that Elder Scrolls 6 has been said to be in development, I can finally hope for a amazing sequel to this masterpiece."
15206,"You ever just wanted to play a game to where if you walk five feet away from your house, you get attacked by a dragon?

If so, play this! Because after you start the main questline, they're EVERYWHERE.
Good Luck!"
15207,Yes
15208,Still a banger 9 years later.
15209,Yeah its Skyrim... its fcking great
15210,Pretty epic story and game over all. The Combat is pretty cool as well as well as the spells and weapons you can craft and find are also pretty cool. Only real problem with the game that I found out is Alduin.... His fight was pretty bad ngl.. Way to damn easy BUTTTT overall it was fun.
15211,Nearly as good as Daggerfall
15212,"i have spent 145.9 hours playing this game and i can tell you the time spent playing is time well spent. Yes i uninstall and reinstall the game every few months but that way because of storage space being needed for other uses however that  that does not take away from it's value. The fact that it keeps me playing and coming back to it years after it's release just goes to show the quality and thought put into this game. Now this review is definitely late but you know what they say, better late than never."

15214,Thats not a game. Thats a mode table. When u ınstall this on steam open and add modes. U have the game now!
15215,Very noice!
15216,Can't support a studio that would directly sabotage another studio to ensure they have a monopoly on this type of game.
15217,"Gameplay is bad.
Story is boring & bad.
Animation is slow and bad.
Items are generic and bad.
Graphics is bad.
Franchise is milked like cash cow.
Some community mods are good.
Overall game is so bad. (1/10 - 1 bethesda factor = 0/10)"
15218,Classic
15219,Oh you want to play some original build? Too bad! You can only play as stealth archer.
15220,Todd can't keep getting away with this
15221,My favorite game of all time
15222,d tier
15223,"There's very, very few games I'd list as one of the greatest ever. But Skyrim is definitely at the very top of that list. I just started my seventh playthrough, and every single time I've played I've found new things I never knew before. My sixth playthrough I discovered a massive quest that I never even knew was there. Next year will be ten years this game has been out, and I've yet to get bored of it, and likely won't any time soon."
15224,"I was once an adventurer like you, then I downloaded 100+ mods and took a dildo to the knee"
15225,porn
15226,great game! i go on this game and never get bored. made like 4 different stories and characters and man its lit
15227,everyone should play Skyrim at least once
15228,amazing
15229,I could stay on this game until a new one comes out.

15240,good
15241,It is perfection.
15242,Great for players who like having a story but being able to travel the map without being forced into following the main questline
15243,This is the only game you ever need.
15244,"I have skyrim on computer ps3 and ps4, always loved the game and all the dlcs"
15245,One of the GOATs. Must play this game if you call yourself a gamer.
15246,(≧◡≦)
15247,It's ok

15253,Simply amazing. Grab the Special Edition for an extra visual treat.
15254,"Skyrim is a classic! My only complaint is that it removed acrobatics, the generic jump isn't very helpful for a game centred around exploration. I liked how there is 'less magic' initially and you have to find the mages guild. The game stays true to the previous Elder Scrolls games, and adds many extra things you can do."
15255,"amazing
"
15256,Its Skyrim theres nothing bad to say about this game!!!
15257,It's Skyrim.

15260,Definite top 5 of all time. Must play.
15261,Well. Obviously I love this game and for a bit I was able to play the DLC for it and lost access to them cause they were a friends and now I'm rather distraught that I can't find any DLC save for the soundtrack(which I have youtube for so meh on that)
15262,"good game, probrably one of the best base building games if you get mods"
15263,oyoyoy
15264,"A large, well developed world. Much replay value."
15265,"Like learning to ride a bike is part of life, Skyrim is that game you talk to people about having played. If you haven't played it you are missing a part of gaming history."
15266,yes
15267,its the shit
15268,"I have a conditional ""yes"" on this.

Skyrim has an overly simplistic combat system that is far worse than its' predecessors. If you want a game like Morrowind or Oblivion, you will be sorely disappointed. Skyrim has removed all of the complexity from building your character and taken away your agency as a character.

I still think it's worth playing for two reasons: The game world itself is absolutely beautiful and is a true pleasure to explore. It was obviously well considered and it's a real shame that the quests in the game (and fast travel) keep you from exploring most of it. The second reason is the mods.

Amazing third-party developers have modded Skyrim to the point where it feels more like an engine than a game. You can play through a completely different story and add hundreds of hours to the life of this game.

If they were not a requirement for many mods - I would not recommend the DLC. I found them to be bland and immersion-breaking"
15269,It is one of the best games ever made!  Well that is it..
15270,For me it is just a fun game!
15271,i really need a life
15272,my childhood))
15273,This would be a fantastic game if not for the constant bugs and crashes. I've spent more time trying to get the game to work than actually playing it.

15276,Good game

15279,Its fucking Skyrim
15280,One of the rare games that keeps surprising me even after all those years. Great experience.
15281,The dopest dope you've ever smoked.
15282,Its. Skyrim.
15283,The last best Game Bethesda Made.
15284,just play it already
15285,"Been playing this game on xbox since the day it came out, still playing it regularly."

The vast areas to explore and full of colour and life."
15287,"i've played for a lot more than 126 hours, this is just the 8th time I bought the game."

15289,"this has replaced some certain websites thanks to loverslab

my right arm hurts"
15290,"very interactive if you download the nexus content it makes the customization almost unlimited.,"
15291,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
15292,It's Skyrim what else do you want to know buy the fucking game
15293,Possibly the best game ever made!? The only game I've played on 3 platforms and never got bored!
15294,"awesome game, why is it hidden?"
15295,10 years later its still fun
15296,"I didn't give two farks about dragon's, shouting and the civil war. Instead I joined the dark brotherhood, the thief's guild then after murdering and stealing from half of Skyrim I quit the game for good. That's the cool thing about this game. Even if the main quest makes your p*nis and balls shrivel back into your body cavity out of sheer disgust nearly everyone can find something that will interest them in this lovely game. Couple of balancing issues and does feel a little artificial at times but nothing major to complain about."
15297,"can't find it on the steam store anymore, though...  weird,  huh?"
15298,"Too many bugs --> both general game play (often the run & sprint function stop for no apparent reason and you need to restart) and so many quests that fall over for one reason or another. Often you think you must be missing something, then eventually look to the forums to find out the quest is broken (blood on the ice, and one about heating a warped gem in convectors, dragon not dying at dragontooth crater....are just a few examples in the recent hours of play). 

The positives are that it is very quick to restart, and can save quickly. If it had a UbiSoft-esque start-up time, I wouldn't have made it past 4 hours of play time. A shame Bethesda hasn't ironed out these bugs in the many years since its release."
15299,One of the coolest games ever!
15300,jk game's good
15301,played since launch.. still play it today.. can't get enough still finding new things about the game.
15302,Works on your toaster.
15303,The sheer scale of the world is astonishing. The mods the DLC.. one of the most involving games Ive played
15304,This is the Ultimate solo RPG of all time. Period.
15305,Little description needed
15306,The vanilla experience is immersive but it can become so much more with the right mods
15307,best goddamn game bro
15308,Amazing game keep coming back to it to play again
15309,great game
15310,Best Game There Is.
15311,"It's Skyrim, yo. If you haven't heard about this game yet I don't know what to tell you."
15312,"Skyrim. Old, but gold.

- Do all the side quests, while avoiding the main quest.
- ...
- Realise noone will read your comment as everyone is playing the newer special edition now, where you get acceptable graphics without spending most of your time getting invested in mods.
- Give a damn about it and get back in the game investing yourself in mods.
- Finally think about finishing the main story line.
- Decide not to.

15314,it has werewolves
15315,"good for modding, dont break it tho"

15319,The best game ever made and there mods
15320,"It's Skyrim...yeah it's good, play it"
15321,"Honestly, I do not feel that this game has aged terribly well. It is about damn time they make an Elders Scrolls 6 instead of constantly rehashing this one. Only really worth playing today if you mod it."
15322,its decent
15323,764 hours later and I feel okay saying this game is good
15324,classic game
15325,the modding community has made sure this game will never get old

15333,its alright
15334,Pretty fun

Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago,
And the tale, boldly told, of the one!
Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man,

That when brothers wage war come unfurled!
Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound,
With a hunger to swallow the world!

But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon’s lies,
Will be silenced forever and then!
Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin’s maw!

15339,It's Skyrim
15340,"If you havent played this game yet, you've probably been living under a rock for the past decade"
15341,yeah i like it
15342,good
15343,"once you connect the 360 controller the game lags hardcore, but other than that the game is great.
"
15344,This game does not boot up for me.
15345,nearly 10 years has rolled by and I still play this game. I've bought it on multiple consoles and PC and it's just a gem
15346,A very fun game with lots of stressing moments and amazing ones that will give you adrenaline! Just make sure to not play the game too much at a time and take some breaks as it may become repititive and boring at times.
15347,very good game would recommend
15348,"Honestly an amazing game, loads of content. And if you ever fully complete all the quests and get bored, there are loads of fun mods you can mess around with. :)"
15349,A must play for pretty much everyone.
15350,it a good
15351,very wonderful master piece
15352,This game consumed me. 10/10
15353,"Even though it's old, you can still make it look beautiful with mods. Getting lost and wandering off can be rewarding. Addicting, but you already know that."
15354,Good game.
15355,"Say goodbye to your friends and family, because they will never see you again!"
15356,"gud
"
15357,Awesome game! DOVAKIN! ahahaha!
15358,Been playing on and off for years and I am still finding stuff in the Vanilla game! Quite impressive!
15359,its skyrim...
15360,"This game is great and I have played it from the beginning a few times. 

Easily in the top 5 best games of all time in my opinion!"
15361,its like skyrim with guns
15362,Noice
15363,"Its skyrim, what more can I say"
15364,"its okay
"
15365,Its Skyrim. Its fun.
15366,so many beefy babes
15367,"One of the best hack and slash games. It can be a challenge to play for some. For those who know how to use their skills it can be fun and challenging. You must learn to use ranged and melee combat. There are tricks to learn. Make sure not to rush, check everything and everywhere. Talk to everyone."
15368,Very detailed and you can choose so many ways to play!
15369,"Still can't find a better game
"
15370,classic godly game
15371,Umm Skyrim.... PLAY IT!
15372,i hate the wolves they are skyrim's flies but best game ever
15373,"I love this game!!!! I keep on coming back to it, and playing it over and over. IMO this is the benchmark of what games should be, in graphical content, game play and mod-ability."
15374,this game is great
15375,"Easy to play with ridiculous bugs to laugh at, nothing too game breaking... sort of, well unless you're spiffing Brit. Nice and brain numbing after uni."
15376,Fun
15377,"very nice
"
15378,"I've sunk over 300 hours in this game and am still discovering new  stuff. The immersion and story telling is unparalleled. Game play is solid, but there is room for improvement. This is where mods come in! Skyrim has a very passionate modding community and you can find all sorts of gameplay, visual, story and immersion mods to give the game a new twist. 

One of my favourite games. A must play."
15379,still one of the greatest games i have ever played and with mod content makes the games even longer.
15380,.
15381,"I mean, it's Skyrim."
15382,Good game
15383,cant stop play. god game. musi c start say dovakin you start kill nice
15384,please help me i cant stop playing
15385,is good game.
15386,"With mods still holds up well in 2020! Amazing in depth games, where is Skyrim 2 though?"
15387,good
15388,duh its fucking skyrim how haven't you played this yet
15389,good but bean battles is better
15390,great game
15391,"116 hours of gameplay. Still haven't experienced half the content.
A true classic."
15392,"Simply the fact that I have been playing this game since release and continue to purchase it on every format I own, may seem a bit sad.  I say it is because it is a great game that still has hidden treasures to be found."
15393,it is just one of the best games ever
15394,very good
15395,"There's a reason that multiplayer games typically have far more hours on average compared to single player games. 
Once a single player game is completed most people don't go back and re-play it or continue to play. 
Skyrim is a glaring outlier however. 
Just eyeballing the reviews, a vast majority have over 100 hours, with the average being ~530 hours. 
I won't get grainular because other comments are very outspoken on how great the game is but looking at it at a purely quantitative, this game is deserving of a 10/10."
15396,"I've been playing Skyrim since 2016, and have never stopped loving it. It's nonstop fun and there's always something to do. You'll never just be sitting around thinking ""is there anything to do in this game?"" Highly recommend and will always praise the game!"
15397,yes
15398,its good. Play it.
15399,it gud
15400,Greatest game of all time
15401,IT ISREALLY AWSOME
15402,"Awesome game, Good story and questlines, big, lots to do, Beautiful game. controls are good. Interesting storylines. lots of fun and entertainment."
15403,"ripping good
"
15404,"Brilliant, stunning, and epic.

Pros:
-Incredibly immersive Tolkien-inspired high fantasy world with with beautiful environments.
-Dynamic and fun RPG gameplay. The open race & class system allows you to experience a wide array of play styles. 
-The main storyline is decent and there are many side stories, quests, and crafting ""professions"" to distract yourself with.
-Absolutely beautiful soundtrack--the best of any video game I've ever played.
-Top-tier voice acting and many interesting characters.
-Mods allow for literally endless variations and improvements to the base game. The modding community is phenomenally creative and passionate about this game.

Cons:
-Brutal amount of long loading screens.
-Notoriously buggy game, particularly once mods are introduced.
-Skyrim is a unique RPG in that it gives you many options in terms of freedom and play style, but you'll definitely will feel that the storylines tend to be linear and box you in. This can dampen your own sense of progression and exploration and give way to a feeling of forced completionism.
-The mini dungeons are arguably one of the core parts of what makes Skyrim an endlessly fun game to play, but after a while they can become somewhat repetitive and predictable. My recommendation is to gradually increase the difficulty you play with and try many different classes and approaches to combat and exploration.
-Skyrim has one of the most dull, boring magic systems. Magic is best only when used in concert with melee or stealth and many of the spells are useless if you aren't playing on a sufficiently high difficulty to warrant using them.

"
15405,"Really fun game, I enjoy how expansive and beautiful the map is and the variety of the quests."
15406,its a great game
15407,"I've played an unhealthy amount of this game. A lot of people don't like it and consider it bland, which it can be. The thing about Skyrim is that it wasn't meant to be complicated. From my perspective, its meant to introduce people into RPGs, not blow them away. You wanna get blown away, go play Mass Effect. Skyrim is an easy to consume game that can be as simple as ""I am sword man, I stab things"" to ""I am the Arch Duke of White Horse ravine and I shall reclaim the lands of my people!"". Skyrim is whatever additional mindset you want to put on it. If the base game is too boring, then add some mods. But be warned, too many mods will make your game boring. That's not a joke.

I think anyone can enjoy this game, you just have to know what expectations to have. The NPCs are not developed people, they are stepping stones to larger goals. I like to think of them as people, but Bethesda doesn't make people, they make quests. If you go into this game hoping to develop a real relationship with characters, you won't. If you want to go into this game as a character you made and make the world around you deal with that character, then that's totally possible.

What do you guys think? (Also if you combine my PC and Xbox hours, I'm at 7,000+ hours)"
15408,Soo much fun. Has taken up a lot of my life and it never gets old
15409,I only play it for the Lizard Titties now. 10/10
15410,THE best bethesda game I have ever played and it will forever stay in my heart as a favorite.

15412,mods
15413,K
15414,"Played this for years as a kid-teen.  Jumped my character around a lot with a feeling of anxiety in my gut- this game makes you think about the choices you make- I actuallly felt like I was doing something bad by joining the dark brotherhood, and after killing the Riverwood Trader's owner's sister in order to steal, to have him walk in and cry over her dead body made me feel awful and load my last save.  Then one day my PS3 yellow-lighted and died forever immediately after I sat down on a bench in an inn.  This game is special, play the others too."
15415,"Trying to mod the game : 99%
Actually playing the game : 1%
beat the game : 0% 
mess around : 1000%"
15416,I'm still finding things after 9 years
15417,9/10 wish they would release this game on my smart fridge.

15424,"Buggy and Ugly, yet timeless"
15425,veri good
15426,"Fun, immersive open world rpg. No need to stick to main story line right away. You can explore and do side quests first and then come back to main story. Plus there is always the dragons,"
15427,"I have more hours on this than Special Edition. Also, I've had more fun modding this game than SE. 

It's a masterpiece... but you already know that.

What more can I say? 10/10."
15428,"Very nice story,such a great game.fantastic lore ETC."

15434,"It's Skyrim, what is there not to like. Immersive, huge open world, great main, side missions and plus you have dragons too. games has been out for a long long time and it still holds up to one of the best video games of all times."
15435,"My entire childhood, dont think you can have more fun in 150 hours of gameplay. i would say theres well over 500 hours tho"
15436,"I spent my first 18 hours chopping firewood for Hod in Riverwood.

9088 wood. 45k gold. Fuck Jarl Balgruuf and fuck Alduin. 

"
15437,praise the sun
15438,It's Skyrim. You know what you're getting yourself into.
15439,Game pretty good but didn't have any sex mods in already so about a 7/10.
15440,it's a really fun game
15441,"Game that doesn't need a review. If you are here - you probably already know about it. If not (impossible), you have to try it out!"
15442,Skyrim is yes.
15443,"The size of an ocean, as deep as a pond."
15444,
15445,Awesome!
15446,The best game I have ever played.
15447,Its rely fun i like it alot
15448,"Reviewing this game feels almost redundant, and completely meaningless considering this version is unlisted now, but I'mma do it anyway. To start, don't believe the play time on record. I've played well over 2,000 hours with and without Steam (Piracy isn't a substitute for buying but for demoing, buy the games you like!) mostly without due to crashes Steam Overlay contributes to.

First pulsating asterisk: This game needs patching it never received officially, the community has that problem well covered but that means you need to put in the legwork of installing a mod manager, finding the patches, then installing the patches.
Second pulsating asterisk: Steam Overlay seems to cause seemingly random crashing during auto saves due to it's size expansion over the years. If crashes bother you, you'll have to run Skyrim without Steam, which means losing recorded game time.

Now I've thrown a pair of massive qualifiers out there let's go to the actual review. When you're correctly leveled the game is fun, sticking an arrow between a b*st*rd's eyes as they charge at you and seeing them flop flat on their face and skid across the ground never gets old. Coming home with enough gold and jewels in your pocket to buy a summer home, never gets old. The core game loop is just endlessly entertaining, all but 2 components that up to a point can be ignored, Smithing and Enchanting, Both take far too much time to level, and Enchanting in particular (without glitches) requires absolutely massive investment to get an equal return on your investment in gear, AND if you take care of them early when it's easiest can leave you under-equipped for the leveled monster spawns as you continue to play, eventually leaving you struggling against baser mobs like wolves just to get your skill levels to match the enemies' strength.

How the game runs: Assuming you run the game itself on it's own HDD or from an SSD, It runs great on anything made post 2007, even with HD texture packs, fixes, and loaded to it's 200 mod limit, it still won't stutter or struggle in places you don't expect. BUT if you're still using a HDD and running it from the same drive as Windows, it's not fun. The game is still optimized for the hardware of it's time, including GPUs with as little as 256mb of vRAM, which means a lot of loading and unloading textures, which with the added random read-writes Windows 8 and Windows 10 do in the background can lead to huge stutters and low-res textures that just never get replaced, solving the pop-in problem by never loading the textures to begin with."
15449,"It's made by Bethesda, and Todd Howard no doubt. Needless to say...it just works.
"
15450,<3
15451,"Amazing game, a ton of content. I recommend at the very least ""Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)"" (Free on the store) to enhance the game!"
15452,This is simply the best PC game ever made.
15453,"Really fun, I expected to get tired of it after an hour or two of playing, but ended up actually not wanting to get off for 10 hours. I’m always wanting to play now and I’m still not tired of it. Good content."
15454,"As with all Bethesda games, Skyrim is very fun but had some quirks.  As long as you can overlook the glitches it is an awesome game."
15455,"""It's like Skyrim"" - Erebus"
15456,Very Epic

15462,"I've played nearly 200 hours and have yet to finish the main quest.
Seems worth it to me."
15463,"Still playing in 2020, shit ill still play in 2021. love the game. all time favorites. would love to see a full Skyrim remake to match current gen games and still use mods. A role playing game where you control the flow of the game. Add in mods and Skyrim is still better than most 2020 games. you are missing out if you dont play Skyrim on PC."
15464,yes
15465,Tis a game...
15466,"It's Skyrim, I would be impressed if you hadn't seen a dozen versions of it by now. Best Adventure game, and all around solid experience every time."
15467,amazing
15468,good
15469,Skyrim's harshness has a way of carving a man down to his true self.
15470,fucking great. not other statements required just fucking great

anyways very epic game i would recommend anyone to play this 

ps. if you are a hot single female message me or you can be married i dont discriminate 

peace out fellow cat eared wearing peeps"
15475,What can I say about Skyrim that hasn't been said before. If you love RPG's you owe it to yourself to play this game.
15476,.
15477,"very fun game ive played quite a bit
"
15478,"If you thought Fallout 4 Nexusmods scarred you for life, get ready for the buffet of Human Degeneracy that is the Skyrim Nexus Page (please for the love of god use the filter)"
15479,It's alight.
15480,gg
15481,Great game with a great story and side quests basically endless game play along with mods that you can get adding content and quests.
15482,yes ddy
15483,"Very Fun game, allows for endless adventure and overall a game that will keep you coming back"
15484,"Hell f**k the Bethesda. They made this very cool game, but with a lot of bug...And heavens shine to the modders, they dont leave the game, and made it perfect with a lot of mod, fix."
15485,not a rpg fan but this pretty good. I bought this in 2016 at a target and its pretty good
15486,10/10
15487,"What can be said about this game that hasn't been said already?

While my account here on steam has me at around 80 hours, I've spent far over 500 hours on it between consoles.

Regardless of your tastes in the genre, this game has a lot of value to offer, and tailors an incredible world for you to explore with many unique adventures, secrets, and paths to walk.
And even further, if you want to change the way in any way - there's a robust modding community that's been working on this game tirelessly since it came out nearly 10 years ago; meaning you're bound to find many mods that will make this experience even more palatable for you - and changing variations of mods means that this game has nearly infinite replayability.

Skyrim is a 10/10
It's a legendary game that will live on far beyond other games, and who's legacy is a milestone in gaming history for other games to be compared to.
No matter who you are or what you like in a game - you'll get your money's worth out of this title.

If you don't own it already, there's no excuse not to buy it now."
15488,"It's a timeless classic, the best rpg there is in my opinion"
15489,"Not the best Elder Scrolls game, but you can't stay away from this one for long!"
15490,"its a lovely exploring game, the magic the story and the game itself is just beautiful :D"
15491,"This is actually the best game ever made !
Just buy it 
Load whatever mod you desire
And create your own unique experience *.*
The freedom you have is just phenomenal
This is golden
A real gem
Love it <3"
15492,"This game is the one I have the most hours on for a reason.  The core gameplay is addictive and rewarding.  The story and world is extremely flushed out and interesting.  Dialogue and combat are both not great but that's not what I play this for.  I play for the incredible atmosphere, worldbuilding, and roleplay potential. 9/10"
15493,"I played this game through a few times before buying it for steam .It gave me Hours of playtime that went well beyond the price of the game .The modding community picked up the ball and made this game a legend :)
"
15494,Holds up well even 9 years after its release
15495,"Timeless classic, also dont buy the special edition of skyrim, its a huge scam, what makes it the special edition is just stealing mods from the community and putting a price tag on them, you can easily mod the vanilla game for it and so much more, also special edition is ALOT more of a pain to mod than the vanilla game, just get the vanilla game saves you time, pain and money."
15496,"Everyone already knows this is still the best game in existence.
"
15497,One of the best open world fantasy games ever made!
15498,This is possibly the best game ever made.
15499,"5th character, been playing for 10 years w massive breaks, easy to make a new build, game is always refreshing. If you haven't played then play words verbage skyrim good game super yes yes very mm mm I like lot you like moar mm dovahkin yes yes mm mods mm yes"

15512,it is very good
15513,skyrim owns
15514,"Everyone knows that Skyrim is a good game.  Past what flaws the game might have, it is something that anyone can get into.  Politics?  Check.  Adventure?  Check.  Family?  Check.  Finance?  Check.  And all of these are before you start modding.  You can play with or without advanced magics, extreme graphics, nudity and adult content, and, of course, Thomas the Tank Engine.  This game has what it needs to be epic.  If you are just starting out, or if you have played it for hundreds of hours, it is something that can enjoyable for many more hours.  Especially in the winter!"
15515,yes
15516,One of the best games I have ever played. Released nearly 9 years ago and still never fails to entertain me to this day. Would recommend anyone.
15517,It's just a classic. Love blowing up my computer with the biggest mods out there.
15518,its alright
15519,"This game was pretty neat for being older, I just never got the time to sink many hours into it. 7.5/10"

15526,open world great story much fun to be had
15527,"Great Game, Even better with mods"
15528,Great game nothing more to say!
15529,"It's Skyrim, what more need be said?"
15530,it is goodiswh
15531,"This is a really fun game, you should get it and be prepared to spend many many hours on it. I haven't spent many on it right now but I see the potential to get lost in the world of Skyrim."
15532,haha dragons go brr
15533,Fantastic game with superb freedom to explore and create your own adventure. However the sheer scale of the open world and the massive number of quests may put off some people.
15534,
15535,na
15536,"I've only played for 15 hours, some would call that rookie numbers but don't fret, those numbers will increase, but even with only 15 hours I've been totally immersed, I mean it's amazing, the world feels so alive and real, I thought Oblivion was immersive but it pales in comparison to Skyrim.
Even with 15 hours I don't feel that I've played enough to give this game a true review, but so far this game is fucking awesome."

0/10"
15539,It's ok I guess
15540,so much to do
15541,Best game ever made
15542,"If you're going to buy Skyrim then this review will give you a head up. This game was good when it came out, but has aged horribly. Its a buggy mess. The only reason people buy it and still play it, is because of the modding community. Trust me. If there weren't mods i wouldn't even download it. There are thousands of mods that make the game look decent and ultra realistic. It's obvious, especially in recent years, that Bethesda doesn't give a shit about it's community. In order to play VR you have to buy the game again and pay 60€ for this garbage. This just shows that Bethesda is greedy. A good example of what they should have done is, No Mans Sky. The creators of No Mans Sky made VR support for their game and didn't ask any money for it. It's free if you own the game.
In summary this game is garbage without mods and if you're looking to play the vanilla version of the game then, you will be disappointed."
15543,best game
15544,the best game ive ever played
15545,"its a great game, played the console version and this was is just as good, once youve gotten used to the settings and the use of the keyboard and mouse together"
15546,"With the amount of mods available for Skyrim, you can literally make a character anything you want it to be, from a savage barbarian, to a cunning ranger."
15547,"9 years later and still one of the best games I've ever played. I can't tell you how many hours I've lost playing this, or much of that I don't regret losing."
15548,bad
15549,"Played a couple hours, seems great"
15550,"it is fun
"
15551,I long for the game that will top everything that Skyrim has accomplished. but until then this game will never lose ground with me!
15552,
15553,It's still good.
15554,nords make brrr
15555,its goo
15556,Its not a linear game. You don't have to follow a specific questline
15557,best i love it
15558,bad
15559,Perfect game
15560,"For me this game is just to much. To many options. The leveling system is confusing. The stats system is confusing. The inventory system is confusing. The combat is horrible. I have no idea why people like this game. First person view for an RPG is just a bad idea. It doesn't feel right. The 3rd person view is awkward, and almost unplayable. I just can't seem to get any better at this game no matter how many times I try. It's a shame because generally RPG is my favorite type of game, but this doesn't do it for me in any way at all. I am sure there must be some cool magic spells in this game, but I sure can't find them. I am sure there must be some cool weapons in this game, but I can't find them. The story is lack luster, and I don't really understand whats going on, nor does the game make e care to find out."
15561,Amazing RPG set in a fantastic world. You cannot miss this. Just play it.
15562,very epic good game get now
15563,got 3k hours in total combined... need i say more?
15564,Skyrim is 1 of the best games ever made =)
15565,nice
15566,"Horrible!
I've been playing it for some time. Am very familiar with TES lore, but this game sucks.
It worked until last week. I had mods, yes. I removed them, and it crashes even without mods....
Don't buy it!"
15567,"Great game!
After 3 hours of trying, it runs almost flawlessly on Linux Debian via Proton."
15568,Goated Game.
15569,"Very good game with plenty of quests and overall good visual content. Very good background music. The only problem sometimes is, that you can get stucked in the terrain at certain points."
15570,Awesome open world fantasy FP or 3rd person adventure game
15571,Fus Roh Dah! I think my hours played speaks for itself.
15572,"Even at near a decade old, this game is still fun to run through"
15573,its a fun game with fun optional mods
15574,o
15575,I wasted 445 hours of my life on this
15576,"It ain't Oblivion, but it'll do in a pinch."
15577,yes
15578,i pretty much own this game on everything and i still love it
15579,good stuff
15580,Ye
15581,"Probably the best game I've ever played. I revisit it every few years, and god it's still just as good."
15582,Been a long time fan of Skyrim on the console so when i purchased a PC i had to buy it......no regrets terrific game and with nexus mod support its like a whole new game!
15583,"its skyrim bro, its just that good
"
15584,good
15585,"Quite possibly the greatest game world ever created, certainly in the top five. So much to see and do (and that's without player created content) it's easy to see why this game is still so popular nine years after it's original release."
15586,I've been playing this game since the day it game out. It is by far one of my all time favorites. I don't see another game that I love as much as Skyrim coming out any time soon
15587,"Something about this game feels really off.  It is neither as captivating nor as immersive as it ought to be, even when considered solely within the context of it's predecessors.  Even Arena, despite it's age and flaws, presents a more compelling world and atmosphere.  To this day, I far prefer to revisit any of the previous numbered games in the Elder Scrolls series, rather than fail in yet another attempt to find that seemingly elusive quality in this title that I'm more and more convinced isn't even there."
15588,Rich story line and characters. Wealthy amount of content. When time goes on you still find new things to explore. It is nice to get own house and be able to use it as equipment store.
15589,I don't think I've put more hours into any other game (played straight weeks worth of this game on Xbox 360 before playing again on PC).
15590,like
15591,might have liked it if i put more time into it because 319 hours just didnt do it for me
15592,Skyrim is basically therapy for all the senses.
15593,just an all around good experience
15594,lol
15595,I've been playing this game for years now and I still love it.
15596,The characters are believable and can keep you enthralled for hours.
15597,epic
15598,amazin
15599,"This is a good game :D
"
15600,PLay it now
15601,Besides Fallout 4 and The Witcher 3.  There's basically hasn't been any games released worth playing.  Which is why I play these 3 over and over and over and over.
15602,There is so much to do. 10/10 I understand why it is re-released so much.
15603,dsadad
15604,"Do not purchase this version. it is leagues better than the special edition, but crashes often, and most mods are available for Special Edition anyway."
15605,This game rocks! It gives me the options to solo as many diferrent classes!
15606,It's nice but for sure it crashes a lot
15607,"yes
"
15608,yes
15609,"I first played played Skyrim in 2013 and its been my favorite game since.   Possibly the best open world, fantasy, rpg of all time.  If you like fallout you'll like this.  10/10"
15610,"
noice"
15611,.
15612,"I liked the exploration and world building. I also enjoyed installing mods and making the game into something else entirely.
I would recommend to anyone who likes to explore a fantasy setting."
15613,"Honestly, the best game I ever played. I always come back to this game end up playing for weeks. 
"
15614,"Incredibly easy to customize with mods, solid play for a 9 year old game."
15615,"The controls in VR are a bit finicky but it truly is an immersive experience once you get used to it. You'll find yourself just getting lost in the world when playing in VR. It's a bit of a shame I had to download a load of graphics mods to improve the overall game textures, would of been nicer if there was a texture updates with this release. It's a yes to a recommendation but please no more Skyrim re-releases of this game."
15616,One of the best
15617,nice
15618,It good.
15619,e
15620,"I've put far too many hours into this game which Steam hasn't recorded, mods help allot when it starts getting stale once you know how to install them correctly and now a days I never play Skyrim without an average of 250 mods installed, well worth the money."
15621,Todd howerd aproved it .just works !!!!!!!
15622,it crashes through steam.
15623,This game has consumed my life
15624,This game is one of the best games Bathesda ever created.
15625,great and immersive
15626,i have been playing this game for 10+ years and still love it
15627,stinky pee pee skyrim no good
15628,DET ER et fedt spille MEN MEN det er os noget lort det fuckker maget op køb ikke !!!!!!!!!!!!!
15629,banger but the optimization is fucked
15630,"its ok
"
15631,yes game
15632,VV GOOD
15633,"This is by far my favorite game of all time. Everyone should play through it at least once, more if you plan on modding it"
15634,"Great game, even many years after release.  Modding communities like the Nexus are still active.  Plenty of chance for replay and overall an awesome title."
15635,"fun, no life"
15636,If you Haven't played Skyrim.... you haven't lived
15637,.
15638,I like how there are so many options of what you want to do can specialize in.
15639,"I dont really even need to say have great this game is im sure anyone reading these already has been told or watched someone els play, bethesda made a damn good game here that is still relevant since it's original release in 2011 next year it will hit its ten year mark on november 11th and i dont think it will be any less relevant when that time comes, skyrim was and still is a master piece nothing can come close to every aspect of skyrim as a whole. As for the 6th elder scrolls, i cant wait to see what they have in store for us elder scrolls fans."
15640,its ok
15641,yeet
15642,Fun game. way more fun with sides quests than the main but thats ok. the mods are where this game truly shines. its worth learning.

15644,"After my first playthrough, I thought i was done except for minor things like Civila War choices. I was SO very wrong. Ive played over a hundred hours and Ive barely scratched the surface of this game. It has immensly deep lore and easily over a thousand of quests to do. Though several are fetch quests, you can often find clues and tie-ins to other quests. I love this game and now that I've added mods to it, its even better!
"
15645,.
15646,"Astonishing, eye opening, jarring, jaw dropping, stunning and amazing game!!"
15647,asd
15648,"Skyrim has got to be one of the best open-world games you can Play. It contains multiple major quest lines and hundreds of miscellaneous quests, with infinitely generated quests you will never run out of things to do (however these randomly generated quests will become a bit repetitive after a while. Around 100-300 hours in you will have finished all of the unique quests.) The game also features an extremely detailed world with many random world interactions that make the game feel much more realistic and immersive. With the use of mods this game can become perfectly tailored to your play styles, whether you want a purely combat focused game play or a story packed adventure, the choice is yours. Overall a wonderful game and one of the best of its kind, I would definitely recommend to everyone."
15649,Easily the best Bethesda game I've played and probably one of the best open-world games overall.
15650,"I played it on the good ole' 360 days, but I never actually played played the game till like 9 years later after it came out, and I'm in love with this game, it has a good story story so far, and you get to kill a f*cking dragon, but not just one, they're tons, this game has an endless free roam world and that's what I like about this game is the roaming, spells, and combat, if you're into first person or third person combat, this is the game for you!"
15651,"It's Skyrim, and I've been playing it since I was 11. I am now 20, and am still coming back to it. Kind of feels like a home away from home. (don't pay attention to my lacking hours, I played on my older brother's account for years before getting it myself)"
15652,"I usually play this on my xbox but this is an amazing game even for a non pc gamer the sheer amount of mods is incredible

p.s play this game with mods or you're big gay

p.s.s that last part was a joke"
15653,"cool
"
15654,"dont let my steam hours fool you, ive played this game since 2012 and it was a blast then like it is now. ive never actually completed the entirety of the game because i get distracted with modding the everloving stuffing out of it. easily the best game in existence 1337/10"
15655,mint game get it now won't regret
15656,"It's an Elder Scrolls game, so it's obviously good.  But frankly it pales in comparison to Morrowind and Oblivion.  It's much easier.  Just all around.  And there are no longer any classes or birthsigns.  or spell creation or custom enchantments. It FEELS like a game that was dumbed down for casual gamers.  I'm honestly happy I didn't start with this game or I would not be excited about Elder Scrolls VI.  Still not a bad game though, just not as good as previous ones."
15657,Immersive world
15658,Great game that's keeps giving still finding new things and then you can add mods for more content.
15659,This game is awesome!
15660,It's good
15661,I recommend this game nine years ago.
15662,10/10
15663,Cmon man you already know
15664,Great world
15665,extreamly good story and gameplay is very fun. XD
15666,"I played pr'olly 400+ of the game on Xbox upon release. Bought it again for PC. This game had entirely no F***ing business being this good. There were days i turned it on for the music as ambient sound in my house. I enjoyed modding new weapons into the game. Here i am, years later, writing a review before trudging back into it to play it again."
15667,very nice
15668,yes.
15669,wow 10/10
15670,very nice very nice
15671,It's a cool game. well written and you can put 400 hrs in without being bored
15672,hehe 664 is not the hours i have in this game its more like 2k across all consoles. 10000000000% worth the buy it is so much fun.
15673,mod it till it crash
15674,"Ummm....it's Skyrim. Probably the most perfect, absurdly amazing game ever created by humanity. Did i say ""probably""? Even if you hate this sort of game, you still have to admit, there's literally nothing this good, vast, complete and infinite.

With MOD's it goes from 10/10 to the only 20/10 game to ever exist. There's truly nothing else even close to in pretty much every category."
15675,"Idk what to say about this game, it just works"
15676,"If you like rpgs and you haven't played skyrim, what the heck are you doing?!
One of the best most expansive open world rpgs out there if not THE best, from the crazy ""features"" to the dialogue options to every dungeon, everything in skyrim feels fresh even though the game is almost 10 years old, only one thing is sure for the future and that is the re-release of skyrim in all the new consoles.
Skyrim has something which a lot of games lack nowadays, it has personality, it has mystery, it has a whole world behind it that makes sense, The Elder Scrolls franchise has some of the most complex lores I've ever come upon in video gaming.
The combat is simple yet it works very nicely, the quests have variety, the dungeons even though every one of them are pretty much the same, manage to keep you hooked for the chance of discovering a piece of loot or a piece of lore or a hidden something, always look into every corner you never know what you can find, truly a masterpiece and one of my favorite games of all time now that I got the chance to play it.
The graphics may feel a little bit dated at times but that's what mods are for, what's kept skyrim alive throughout all this time are the mods and the modding community, it truly has some of the best and most expansive mods out there, some mods add new adventures, others just add graphic improvements, every single one of them fills a different niche and you can build your own adventure by mixing and matching.

A brilliant game, that's all I can say, I give it a 10/10"

15689,"one of the best games ever made, i encorage you to at least give it a try"
15690,The content never ends with this game. Highly recommend.
15691,dragon go brrr
15692,"I've only played for 4 hours, but the begging experience was amazing for me. It does take a learning curve to learn some of the stuff in the game, but when you understand it, its really fun."
15693,"just try it, you'll see"
15694,"I only have fun with mods, since you can adopt more than 2 children in mods. I also really like Zora Fair-Child and Sofia as companions, meaning none of the vanilla characters are cool enough to be in my squad.
I also CTD almost every hour and I have removed almost all of the mods I possibly could without ruining my fun so I'm not really sure how to live anymore."
15695,Awful game

15733,"Добрый день всем. Данная игра не нуждается в представлении, но я хотел бы про неё рассказать и поделиться своими впечатлениями о ней.

Сюжет рассказывает о драконорожденном - человеке, в котором течет кровь дракона и он может пользоваться их силами. А в скайриме как раз кто - то и начал воскрешать этих самых драконов.
Игра наполнена огромным множеством квестов, навыков, оружия, доспехов и много чем еще. Игра обладает богатым открытым миром, множеством локаций и что важно, каждая локация по своему уникальная. В игре есть чем заняться, кроме основной сюжетной линии есть множество дополнительных квестов.
Также в игре шикарная музыка, которая добавляет эпичности всему происходящему. Игра в целом очень атмосферная.
Из минусом можно разве что отметить баги, которые могут встретиться по ходу прохождения, но это Bethesda, они без багов никуда.
Если вы любитель жанра RPG, то советую поиграть.

"
15734,"skyrim, best game ever, aside from previous elder scroll games."
15735,"This game is fun, watch out for dragons cause they breathe fire and fire burns"
15736,its a wacky ass game that is fun
15737,Great Game just coming back to it after a hiatus.
15738,"Skyrim has an utterly uninspiring main plot and the guild quests did not feel as interesting as Oblivion's. It fares better than Oblivion with better radiant quests and dungeon design (there are some lovely set pieces), but some enemies will grow tiresome quickly and the puzzles are laughable. 

The usual boringness of enemies scaling with you that negates a sense of progression until you get super OP. Sadly, no real companions and neither of the two main factions give a compelling reason to ally yourself with. Like Morrowind, the main plot is heavily tied to a particular race and it feels weird to play as something else (but I did, anyway). Perk system tries to be interesting with a mechanic that lets you restart certain skill trees, but it lends nothing to the game other than grind. 

Still. Like most of Bethesda's RPGs, the world is great fun to explore and the occasional good sidequest will stick with you. Like FO4, this is not a narratively*good* game, but it can be a very *fun* one - there's lots to do, especially if you are a player who makes their own fun with the right sandbox. Recommended only with mods to hammer this into something properly enjoyable."
15739,"Unplayable without mods, one of the best of all time with them"
15740,a must have classic!
15741,"I forgot my gf lived in my apartment. Would play again when single. Just got dumped, am single."
15742,a
15743,"Played since it was released in 2011, It's pretty good"
15744,"I like this game because it is a first person, open world, non mmo. The story line is not forced upon you and you do not have to follow it to enjoy the game.

I do not like the fact there is no head tracking."
15745,whats the point
15746,big game
15747,Ultimate Skyrim - look it up.
15748,Simply can't dislike the Elder Scrolls Francise. Didn't quit like it as much as Morrowind but it was quit high up there!
15749,"Todd, I know this game is alright but please stop releasing it on every console imaginable. I've had enough"
15750,"absolutely terrific game.  challenging and adjustable to your level of play (easy to deathly).  sometimes mind boggling trying to figure our the correct approach to solving a scenario obstacle.  I,d recommend it to everyone."

15762,this game single handedly made me a slave to todd howard and i would still give him money if he released it a third time.
15763,This game is AMAZING i would totaly reccommend buying this
15764,"It's a solid RPG. Kinda broken skill system (if you know what you're doing), but the fun still exists quite handily for an RPG made way back when in 2011. Honestly, besides FO3, I don't think Bethesda has been as consistent in a game as Skyrim. Even Oblivion had some areas that lacked, not many, not huge, but Skyrim is easily the best edition of the Elder Scrolls series. Just wished they rebuffed the skill system :("

15790,"It's a beautiful game with wonderful characters and voice acting.  You don't even have to do the quests.  You can just ride around and explore things.  There are a million mods for those who like to do that, too.
I have over 1200 hours in the game and more to come."
15791,...
15792,everyone likes skyrim lets be honest
15793,Awesome
15794,"The gold standard for open world RPGs. The story isn't great (the DLC stories are better) and the melee combat isn't very good. However the stealth and magic are great, and the total freedom to cross-class any time any way means that you can absolutely invent dozens of fun character builds.
The world is staggeringly huge, and you can play for many hundreds of hours without exploring every cave and bandit camp.
The mod community is fully mature, and at this point every time I find an annoyance that I plan to open the modtools to fix, I just check nexusmods and someone else has already made that mod for me.

Don't play Bethesda games at launch. Play them five years later when the community has finished them.
Skyrim is finished, and ready to play."
15795,A masterpiece from Bethesda!
15796,A Timeless classic... I always seem to find myself coming back for another playthrough. 10/10

15819,"You know Skyrim, you know it's among the best games ever made. This is the classic version, the OG, it has more mods, it runs better on potato hardware, I prefer it over SE, but that's just me. I would recommend this game to anyone."
15820,very epic.
15821,"something with a dragons and titties, order of the two doesn't matter."
15822,neat
15823,yes
15824,Although base game many years ago had some glitched. It will go down as a fun classic game to play for open world adventure.
15825,"Been some time since I played this, but I'm bored so I just write reviews for my most played games.

15838,"Skyrim is a great first person open world game that allows open exploration and a great deal of flexibility in how you fight and what quests you take at a given time. There is also a more fluid progression in developing your character's gear and abilities than many games, giving it a more immersive feeling. The modding community has also provided a lot of options to keep the game interesting for playing again."
15839,its lit
15840,"Despite all my hours of this game being spent on other consoles, this is honest to god my most favourite game, i have owned it on three different platforms at the least. No matter whats going on or whats changing, Skyrim is the one constant I always go back to. If ya gots da money, Buy It! You won't regret it!"

15844,I love this game. It brings me back to 2011. When times were simpler.
15845,"Geeze, It's Skyrim. If you don't know it you've missed out on one of the better games created ever.

Careful though, they have made so much money from the franchise they want to sell it to you in 50 different ways. Just buy it once, where you actually intend to play it XD."
15846,"I'm gonna be honest with this review, so buckle up.
First of all, disregard my play time, it should be much more but I played more or less 500 hours while offline so it didn't rack up on my steam profile. Keep that in mind. Skyrim is easily one of my top 3 favorite games ever made. It has bugs, lots of them. If you quick-save in the city of Riften your game has a 50/50 chance of crashing and normally corrupts that save as a results causing you to lose progress. Alot of dialog is super janky, and the NPC's are painfully obviously NPC's, most of them have little to no emotion to speak of. But I would be lieing if I told you that I don't love this game. If you are just starting out in the RPG genre this is a wonderful game to pick up, much better than it's predecesors, and if you are a hard-core roleplayer it's even better. The Elder Scrolls as a franchise has always left me happy and wanting more, but I find myself replaying Skyrim more than the others due to it's easy to play mechanics, because of how easy it is to pick up and put down at short intervals without having to dedicate an entire afternoon to it, and because of simple implementations like fast travel and map markers. The story is pretty good, and the DLC's (I never bought Hearthfire and never will) are amazing, and almost feel like full games all to themselves, and are miles less buggy than the core game, which is nice. All in all, I will say I give the game a solid 9/10, but I do wish we got to experience more of the first 200 years of the 4th era, the only game that gives us any insight to that time period is the ES card game called Legends which is good for what it is but certainly is not an ES game proper. 
Conclusion: If you have lots of free time, get TES 3 Morrowind or TES 4 Oblivion, if you don't have as much free time to dedicate to a game, but still want an immersive RPG masterpiece, then pick up Skyrim. I have sank atleast 600 hours of my life into this game and I can honestly say that nearly 9 years after it's release I still find so much damn joy in this game, and I probably will for another 600 hours, and even more."
15847,lmao
15848,Great game besides the save system and few glitches.
15849,"I really wish I got to try this game sooner, it has a little bit of everything, and a lot of awesome!"
15850,This game is just a rip off of fallout 76 :|
15851,"""No lollygaggin'."""
15852,Epic and awesome. You won't be able to put it down.
15853,Great game with access to several great mods.
15854,"This game is purely game especially with mods, but you should get the special addition mainly because of memory issues that I have yet to solve myself."
15855,ha ha dovakin go oo aa
15856,PLAY IT!! SKYRIM is LIFE!!

Skyrim is 10/10 as well"
15866,What are you waiting for?? Go scale some mountains.
15867,Absolutely beautiful game.
15868,good game worth the money
15869,its aight
15870,"Game doesn't work properly for me. Got this version of the game for mods but it just makes the game worse than it already is. My mods aren't demanding or big and everything was in the correct load order, but it just made everything worse. Game kept crashing so if i was far on a quest it would start again, animation glitches, textures not loading in and also in certain parts of the map the frames will drop.

Due to this i'm no longer playing. The reason i recommend is because i have this game on PS4. Skyrim is a good game and on PS4 without mods it was a good play through. If you want to get this game then get the latest edition either on console or PC. I don't know what the latest edition is like on PC so you will have to have a look. But the choice is yours to make, if you want the original game for mods beware of the issues you may en counter."
15871,I poopd my pant
15872,is good
15873,"funny todd howard joke
"
15874,Really betherda? hinding a product  that serves for the ones who have a pc that cant handle the special edition? if you guys dont stop this bullshit bussiness actions your logo will be even more dyrtier. I hope That now microsoft has bought you finally this will stop. And plz put the skyrim vanilla bac to the store its RIDICULOUS that i had to find a tutorial to find the dlcs for my game
15875,Excelent RPG elements and combat.
15876,Endless dynamic encounters and adventures to be had!
15877,"Best game I have ever played!
"
15878,good
15879,"I once beat Skyrim on the Xbox 360.

I have yet to do so on PC, because with the power of mods, Skyrim can be whatever I want it to be, even if that means spending countless hours testing compatibility and build orders. No matter who you are or what you want, there are mods that can make this game perfect for you.

10/10."
15880,"As far as graphics, game controls and story goes it is a great game. The controls work well and it becomes intuitive after a while. However, there are a number of bugs in the game that other people in the modding community, etc. have had to come up with fixes or workarounds for. Plus, there are literally TONS of custom content and mods for this game both at the Steam Workshop and at the Nexus Mods website. Be careful about what content you add to the game; make sure none of it has any conflicts with other content or there will be even more problems and frustration. 

All in all, in spite of it's bugs, it's still a great game. Immersive. If you've had a bad day at work or whatever and you want to vent yourself a bit and you feel like going around killing enemies and shit, this is a good game to do that on. It's a huge world and there are no shortage of people, dragons and other creatures to kill. Lots of stories from the NPC's to get involved with also. If you are kinda shut-in and less social social because of COVID 19 or you don't a life or whatever, this is a great immersive game to kill a lot of time with. . .

15881,its is skyrim
15882,"I dislike that I have to write out comments for a game that has been available for 8 years. If you wanna know what is awesome about this game, I suggest watching TheEpicNate315 on youtube."

15890,*push*
15891,"Everything that can be said about this game has been said. A true masterpiece that stands the test of time. I have been out of the loop from gaming until I recently purchased a gaming rig. I didn't realize how expansive the modding community is. 
Totally reccomend this game."
15892,yes
15893,"Come on, its Skyrim! Either you already have it, or you're a boomer who doesn't know how to turn a computer or cell phone on without the grandkids help. Definitely get this game if for some strange reason you don't already have it. Tod Howard will appreciate it, he wishes to please his new Microsoft Masters."
15894,good game
15895,is good
15896,"My recommendation for this game is contingent on the assumption that you can and will mod your game.
Without mods, this console-port is an unusable steaming pile of horse manure. It is barely functional due to the PC version crashing and the experience being cursed with absolutely atrocious menus.

But, if you can take the time to get a mod manager and some nexus mods, - I know, I know, hear me out - if you can mod this game to fix the instability and UI, and maybe even improve some of the game's basic features this game is one of the best RPG experiences I've had. On a technical level, it's unbelievable this was released for sale. But in terms of story, audio, detail, scale and scope this game is fantastic. It's an absolutely tremendous world and it's a joy to explore. Bethesda better be thanking their lucky stars that the community stepped up to make this game playable because, my god, it didn't stand a chance before all of the work this talented and passionate community has done, for free."
15897,I like it so far.
15898,Why not? Its redguard good. :)
15899,best game evr
15900,"nice game, everybody knows it, no need to tell about it"
15901,It's like skyrim with swords
15902,its a lot of fun and there  are tons of mods on nexus and workshop to keep things entertaining for a long time to come and the dlc s are  a blast and most definitely the dawnguard dlc cause of serana so i'd recommend getting this game for your self along with the dlcs
15903,"This is the single best solo RPG I have ever played and I have played many. The story has many possible strands that build a unique world for each player. Your character builds a reputation and skills with each choice. If you are, like I am, a fan of building and refining your gear, this game has much enjoyment waiting for you. The combat system is intuitive and challenging. Get ready for many hours of engrossing gaming."
15904,great game
15905,"It's 2020 and you have never played Skyrim? Just get the fucking game already and be prepared for one of the most broken, buggy, glitchy, unpolished game. Yet I still come back every now and then because it is somehow the best game of it's generation.

Many MANY hours of gameplay (I've been playing for 200+ hours and still haven't touched the main quest)
Great stories and quests (mostly)
Mod library is absolutely massive and still gets mods daily

Personal Cons: 
Default controls seem a but clunky but can be changed
Default inventory method is something you might see on a console rather than on a PC, but that can be fixed with mods.

15970,its pretty good
15971,its an open world and so many new quests to complete.  I love that you can chose either 3rd person or first person.Lastly you can fight with dragons too.

15988,"I have played this game for years first on Xbox 360, then Xbox one and i had to buy it on PC.
This is my review in my opinion based of my experiences and i am not sponsored to review this game or any game i review!

Pros:
Graphics 8/10
Sounds 8/10
Gameplay 10/10
- So much time you can spend Questing, Exploring, Doing Skills and more
- It has a massive World with caves and other places you can explore
- There are so many Monsters from Dragons, Giants, and more.
- You can Play how you choose, like from a distance or in close combat. do side quests do the main story explore its all up to you to decide how to play!
- I spent over 350 hours on xbox 360, and over 500 hours on xbox one playing this game.
- The expansions are a must when buying this game they add so much more content even tho without it the base game has so much content.

Cons:
- They didn't keep this game going long IMO Online sucks.
- Sometimes the animations may be a little bad like wolfs
- a Little stutter when it auto saves or your about to become under attack but this does not ruin any part of playing this fantastic game."
15989,Its immersive like a good game should be
15990,Just a beautiful world.  So fun to just explore and take in the landscape. Kudos to the designers and artists and writers

16042,Great game and there are infinite ways to play this game.
16043,"cool game, mine is modded to oblivion though"
16044,I've had to sell my house and my kids to buy every version of Skyrim. Thanks Todd.
16045,Really fun and great game (+ best modding community in any game i've ever played)
16046,If you have Windows 10 problem with game not responding on loading screens (which is extremely increasing loading time) use SKSE plugin called DisableProcessWindowsGhosting v2.
16047,"the most beautiful, exciting games I have ever played."
16048,Endless game
16049,best game ever played for 800 hours didn't get bored 10/10 would recommend love it
16050,mod it until it breaks
16051,If you don't know Skyrim by now then you are not a gamer.  It is the best of the best fantasy RPGs in the world.
16052,fuck this game it wont stop lagging do not buy
16053,"best game ever
"
16054,"I did like this game, I did play it without the DLCs it was fun and all for some time, then I did not find it that funny anymore, the story seemed a bit dull. It is fun to play when you download various mods so I recommend that. I thought I now could buy DLC:s but it seems there where none availible which I found weird. I thought that all the three DLC:s would be here, now it is the standard game, dull.
It was a long time I played this game, I have played it for about 240h but I dont quite find anything that makes we want to come back. I have other things to do, studies that is. I think I will come back one day when I want to feel nostalgic.
Good game but that that good that you want to spend 500h on it."
16055,A classic still cant stop playing it
16056,fun
16057,Fantastic Game
16058,"cheese
"
16059,I like it because you can do (almost) everything in this huge fantasy world
16060,"get it if you want to dip a toe into rpgs, or if you intend to mod it a lot."
16061,Good.
16062,is k
16063,Many Mods Much Amazing
16064,"where do i begin, this game is absolutely amazing. i have played through the main storyline 3 times. and a little tip for new players, join the dark brotherhood. you get OP gear. this game is so big you can just get lost for hours upon hours. its amazing. it truly is"
16065,it's skyrim bro just get it
16066,"Just for the badge :).
and the game i'll give 10/10."
16067,"Some people love it, and I think its probably down to the mod community & Elder scrolls fans at this point. Birth place of many a meme but game was just clunky. Only play If you are going to MOD heavy"
16068,good game
16069,good game set the bar high for other games
16070,">decide on expert difficulty mage playthrough
>contract vampirism after taking first steps in whiterun
>mfw the sun turns skyrim into terrible dark souls"
16071,"I wouldn't say I am  gamer.  I play two games,  both were introduced to me by my family, who play a whole variety. 
The two I play are because they are social, at first I found them very challenging,  which almost put me off, then I had personal help, as I find it hard to pick up things by myself. Once I got the basics and realised that especially with Skyrim  I can stop mid fight , drink potions or eat food etc to get my health back up, then start again, it really helped, mind I'm not saying It saved me. But it did allow me to continue to carry on the game so long as I had saved and boy did I save. 
I love the interaction with the NPC, that I can help them, that I can do my own thing until I feel stronger in the game.
There are so many ways to play.  Strangely enough it is a game I keep coming back to. I have tried other games this I keep coming back to."
16072,"what can I even say, it's Skyrim - of course it's amazing."
16073,"I mean, who still questions Skyrim at this point?"
16074,What Can I say that hasn't already been said? It's SKYRIM. One of the best games ever created.
16075,"It's Skyrim... You've bought it for all your consoles and you'll buy it here too. Our overlord Todd needs you to buy it.... So, buy it."
16076,I've never been more bored in a video game. Everything about this game is bland and buggy and an eyesore. Even with mods.
16077,Its skyrim
16078,"don't buy it
"
16079,I have had this game across several different consoles. That should be enough to convince anybody to buy another copy for their steam library!
16080,One of the greatest games of all time and is a MUST HAVE.
16081,This game has multiple possibilities for weirdness. It is a very good game.
16082,"uhm this version is too buggy and not optmised at all, and gets even worst if you add mods into it.

buy the special edition instead. yeah, it is very overpriced for a 2012 game, but trust me, this game has a big playability. if you never played this game you can easily explorer this world for the next years. for those who played skyrim previously, the special edition is also recommended bc is has improved a lot of bugs, issues and add a lot of quality of life things.

by the fact that starfield releases this year (hopefully), and bethesda are only going to really work on the next TESVI after this, i would say there's a lot of years to spend in skyrim until a new elder scroll game gets full release and playable, wich kinda sucks tbh, but i think its better than launching an unfinished game like cp2077 lol"
16083,Dragon
16084,skyrim
16085,It's such a great game. You can have loads of fun. It can get really immersive and the modding community is really hardworking. Skyrim is what got me into open-world RPGs and I'm having a blast about this game. p.s. Skyrim is about the journey not the destination :)
16086,So goddamned buggy I cannot play it. Prolly on purpose so I buy remastered but I'm just gonna play Death Stranding instead
16087,It's Skyrim. You know what you're getting into that this point. I love it. You should too.
16088,yeah man
16089,Pretty fun game
16090,its fuckin skyrim...
16091,I guess its kinda fun.
16092,love this game
16093,Only worth it if you're ready to spend days-weeks-months tinkering with mods. Too bugged on its own to be enjoyed.
16094,No game finer then yelling at the miner.
16095,I hate this game
16096,"It’s a great game, I’ve always been a fan of the Elder Scrolls series. If you’re looking for a new game to get than Skyrim is your place for an offline rpg, than this is your game. Ofc I’d recommend buying the new special edition as most mod developers have moved over to that one. Here’s to almost 9 years of Skyrim!"
16097,"A game with so much content, that it's hard not to scream your way through a quest line. If you strike a Jarl, then you will likely attract a swarm of soldiers who have bad knees because a rogue arrow stopped them from being an adventurer like you. There's also a number of things you can stuff your pockets with.

Also, did I forget to mention the use of screams? Yes, screaming and using big words, like F**k and S**t to send your enemies into orbit is a thing in this game. A dragon spotted you from the sky and is now threatening to burn you to a crisp? Scream at it. A rush of highway bandits harassing you because they can smell a load of gold you have in your pockets? Scream at them. Did you accidentally steal something you weren't supposed to and now you have the entire imperial army hot on your tail? Scream at them.

This game is also blessed with the hottest thing since Lego Star Wars 2, and that my friends is the community workshop content.

Tired of playing boring old vanilla Skyrim? Well, the workshop has just what you need, from infinite magic, to more and insane spells that turns your enemies into a sweetroll, and even a scream that turns a dragon into CHEESE!!! LITERALLY!!!!!!!

A game with adventure, and additional content can't get better than that. And I love it.

10/10"
16098,"We knows it's good, stop asking."
16099,Garfield approved 10/10
16100,So this is an amazing game still but it breaks if you try to play it on a 144hz monitor and Steam is a disgusting greedy ***tard and expects you to buy this again but as the legendary edition. F.U. steam
16101,"crack king
"
16102,been here since 2015 this game is great
16103,awsome game
16104,what not to like?
16105,I love the complexity of the game as well as the attention to detail.
16106,klimat
16107,I like to play video games
16108,Huge open world.
16109,amazing game
16110,god
16111,"How do i explain it? I have played many thousands of games in my time and out of every game i have ever played, this is the best one. This game is so perfect in every way. The emersion is so out of hand, that often days after playing skyrim for a couple hours i find it difficult to figure out what is the real me. its insane just how much this game blurrs the lines between real and fake. The graphics arent out of this world, the bugs are constant, the occasional repeptiveness of the missions are all there. but these arent a big enough problem to warrant a poor taste. I can say with confidence that after you beat this game in its entirety, side missions included, you will come out a different, better person."
16112,"10/10 not enough S K Y R I M
"
16113,have put a good amount of time into the game. got a new laptop and went to redownload skyrim nd realize my dlcs are missing... thats odd cuz i have them on my desktop but somehow cant download them on my laptop. finally find the dlc through a community link nd its tellin me i have to purchase the dlc again. wtf steam nd bethesda!!!!
16114,Why

16118,mod it.
16119,This game is fun
16120,The one of many best game what i playing.
16121,"I basically spent my entire childhood and teenage years playing this game instead of socializing or caring about things. Definitely my favorite, very lovely, 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/10"
16122,THE GOAT GAME
16123,Play Morrowind or Oblivion instead.
16124,"amazing
and also mods"
16125,Brilliant
16126,"A game for the ages

16130,"I haven't played for a while but just buy it, you will have fun."
16131,its really nice
16132,Great game
16133,Best RPG of all time... its rating this worth the time?
16134,"very good
"
16135,I took an arrow to the knee. 0.0
16136,ye it gud
16137,This original version of skyrim seems to be sabotaged in favor of the special edition which works great.
16138,you dont have this game yet???
16139,"It's a good game I mean who else has it on PC, Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and the Alexa versions? Hmm just me? I gotta get a life wait this is my life"
16140,it ain't gay
16141,its skyrim lmao
16142,very good game
16143,Still lots of fun even almost 10 years later.
16144,"I guess it is time to leave a review. 

I'm not sure if I like it. I had Skyrim on X-Box 360 until that system burned out---snap! Crackle...Pop! I wasn't sure if I liked Skyrim or not so I bought it on Steam. There is a lot of hype around this game, I don't like being manipulated by mass opinion, so I keep on playing. Eventually, I'll need to decide if I like this game or not. 

It ain't no Morrowind, that's for sure. ;) 

I know one other thing for sure, if Lydia says she's sworn to carry my burdens one more time, she's goin' to take my arrow to the knee."
16145,It's playable. Maybe for long hours. Maybe after years of owning it. Maybe.
16146,It's Pretty Good
16147,"I mean, I have over 100+ in this game and I still go back to it. And of course I'm no where near done with even the main story line. So yeah, would recommend"
16148,Great Game
16149,gooddd
16150,I've heard the voice
16151,i like trees and i like swords
16152,ez
16153,"This is one of the few ""so bad its good"" games. There's almost nothing to recommend about it as far as it being a ""good"" game, but it is very funny to watch this trainwreck fall apart. It keeps surprising you with new god awful design choices and bizarre bugs for well over a hundred hours. Negative 10 out of 10."
16154,Skyrim is one of those irritating experiences where sometimes it just breaks for no reason. I still love it though. :P
16155,"This game is a different breed of games. Masterpiece in every way. Combat, Music, Story, all of it is just fine tuned like an AE86. 9.8/10"
16156,prople ma fav gaem
16157,ok
16158,Great game and even after years with actual mods a better look than many actual games
16159,Come to the Cloud District often?
16160,i saw my hours played and i was like what i havent done the recomendation yet lol
16161,mods
16162,cant buy the add ons because i have this edition damn. GREAT GAME THOUGH
16163,"It's Skyrim, an absolute fucking banger of a game."
16164,i hate this game
16165,"Scenery, specifically the landscape, and the ease of use. The quests are challenging and most of the characters believable."
16166,"What is there to say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said. Basically, I'll sum it all up like this: I played one character for 150 hours of gameplay, got to level 54, did pretty much everything I possibly imagined there was to do in the game, then I came back and made a new character, and I'm still finding new ways to play the games, new ways to make it interesting, and finding new bits and areas I never knew existed. This game is wonderfully massive, even despite lacking some of the freedom of choice of its predecessors."
16167,fun
16168,Great single player game. Lots of replay value due to mods
16169,"Best game in the Elder Scrolls series. While it is glitchy, some of the glitches are pretty amusing and thanks to the community (and not Bethesda) many people have made bug fixes with mods. The mods made by the community are incredible and extremely expansive, they are definitely one of the best things about this game. I recommend you play with no mods first, and then download everything you can possibly find and play through a second time."
16170,"It's the original Skyrim, nuff said."
16171,old but gold
16172,"I’m sure the game is great, but unluckily I literally can’t play the game. A bug at the very beginning doesn’t  let me go ahead. I fixed it with a bug fix mod, but adding mods causes another bug which doesn’t let me go much further in the game..."
16173,This is a great game
16174,"its skyrim idk what else to say
"
16175,"Its a classic, just buy this game and play it."
16176,"It's SKYRIM , what more do you want?"
16177,It's okay.
16178,Its good but thier publisher aint
16179,"Finally, I can tell you more about my journey that regards this game.

First 10 to 100 hours: Played it, barely got to leave my house.

100 hours in: Starting to wonder if I'll ever actually leave my house.

200 hours in: Discovered mods, modded my game; I am now prepared to stay inside my house for more time.

300 hours in: I finally understand the importance of mods and how to manage them. I'm still not leaving my house.

400 hours in: New game, new game, new game, new game, new game.

Overall realizations, ethics and final rating: I still did not leave my house. 10/10"
16180,"250 hours on record, and I STILL somehow find new locations and quests!"
16181,It'a a fantastic game. 10/10
16182,My all time favorite game...
16183,"I love this game!!!! The freedom and character customization is amazing. That being said, you need mods to make it work and be worth while."
16184,it's skyrim
16185,Shop keeper fetish.
16186,"Well, it's Skyrim"
16187,rlly fun
16188,Best game ever and it works on low end pc's so i can play on laptop
16189,"What did I like about the game?! EVERYTHING! Honestly, this might be the perfect game. If a new version of THIS GAME came out tomorrow, I'd be in a virtual cue already."
16190,"A good game with a lot of replay-ability, modding community is great!"
16191,This Game Is Fun Great And Can Be Challenging Like The Dragons Can Just Change Difficulty
16192,g
16193,"base game good, mods make it gooderererrer, only downside is that you cant find this cheaper version on steam :/"
16194,"its skyrim if you dont know it by now there is no description any one can give you 
"
16195,"You need to spend some time with mods to make it a very good game. It isn't great right after you install it.

Many mods in Steam Workshop are outdated:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11832 (2016)
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655 (2018)


All items have no wear or damage.


Questionable video presets. Most video settings aren't useful to increase FPS, except some.

Open world is big but... questionable replay value without mods.

Game has bugs. 

You can get stuck in the ground. Use the console and the ""tcl"" command.
Giants and mammoths can stuck in small rocks."
16196,6/10
16197,Dude. It's Skyrim.
16198,yeah
16199,hours of solo fun
16200,"Game has a lot of jazz and jazz is good.

Bethesda knows that this game just works!"
16201,good

16203,good
16204,ehh it's pretty decent
16205,fun
16206,Good game like it
16207,"So there is main quest, huh?"
16208,It be skyrim
16209,Played on Xbox and is the best game of all time. Just buy it
16210,Still waiting on the toaster version.
16211,"epic gamer broooooooooooooooooooooo
"
16212,Crashes after Bethesda Logo.
16213,"Is Good Yes?
"
16214,"great game with a fun storyline and ability to make many variations of characters and explore a big, big world"
16215,One of my all time favorites next to Morrowind and then Oblivion. The Elder Scrolls will always be one of the best series.
16216,"Play as dragon man, get quest, kill, loot, finish quest, repeat"
16217,Pog
16218,It is an awesome and immersive game that has brought me many hours of fun and adventure.
16219,Great game lots of fun kisses Dave
16220,Idk who would play this game for more than an hour honestly.
16221,good game
16222,it's skyrim ofc its good
16223,Ah yes back when games were good
16224,"It's Skyrim.  Vanilla, it was a brilliant milestone in gaming that didn't age all that well.  With mods, it's the greatest thing on planet Earth, hands-down, bar none.  But you already knew that, didn't you?  I mean, how couldn't you?"
16225,"yum
"
16226,One of the best games of all time hands down
16227,yes
16228,Everyone knows how great this game is.
16229,Great
16230,"Cons: Lots of Bugs
Pros: Yes"
16231,"Good game. Doesn't have the depth of past titles, especially that of Morrowind, but the mechanics are solid and there's plenty to explore and discover."
16232,Simply a great game. Endless hours of game play and a wonderful community behind it.
16233,One of my favorites. Play in sessions.
16234,"Great game. I may as well put another 400 hours into it though, since Bethesda is obviously going to keep milking Skyrim for every last penny before they release a new Elder Scrolls or Fallout game."
16235,Love how vast this game is.  always something to discover. Very addictive
16236,very good.
16237,GOOD STUFF
16238,One of the best game ever
16239,one of the greatest open-world adventure games ever
16240,"I once played Skyrim like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee."
16241,best game
16242,its fucking skyrim m8
16243,u play as shout man and he yell real good
16244,"One of the GOAT RPGs, probably with some mods"
16245,its skyrim
16246,Most of my time was just figuring out which mod was making me crash
16247,This is my all time favorite game
16248,"I have spent hundreds of hours on this on console, just as amazing and interesting on PC. Hundreds of side quests and ridiculously stupid gameplay at times. Absolutely love it"
16249,"This game is a classic. You can choose your character and build it from it's race all the way to what type of character you want to play. Do you want to be a sneaky magical thief? Do you want to be an arrogant elven tank? It's literally all up to you. On top of that, the graphics of this game are breathtaking. The soundtrack is one that I regularly use to calm myself from having panic attacks. All in all I would most definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to get into action games."
16250,"classic meme
"
16251,yes
16252,"Well made, a valid game to still be played in 2020. Definitely worth the £10 i paid."
16253,Aged like fine wine.
16254,...
16255,"Hello, this game is amazing. Sure it is several years old, and doesnt have the best graphics. But who needs that when you have a game such as Skyrim, the story is better than alot of games nowdays. The game play is amazing aswell. And dont get me started on the battle mechanics, there is something for everyone, swords, shields, bows, axes, hammers even pickaxes. If that doesnt sounds fun what about magic and anicent dragon shouts? Tell me another game where you can yell at a person and they fly off a cliff. Sure there are downsides too, the game is filled to the brim with bugs but those are funny to come across."
16256,Good game with no exploits
16257,I like how there's so much you can do in this game because of the mods
16258,This is my favorite game of all time.
16259,amazing game
16260,...you're looking at reviews for Skyrim still? Buy the fucking game.
16261,epic
16262,Skyrim is a chill fun game that has Max Goofy doing some voice acting <3
16263,"one of the best game in the history of video games.
-------------------------------------------------------
Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia de los videojuegos"
16264,"such a good game, everyone keeps coming back to it and creates a whole new character lol"
16265,"tHIS UIS GOOD GAME! I like good game of this is because fun. Lot of many things to do in game. Battle vampire or bandit, even are fun."
16266,also trash
16267,this game had dat swag
16268,"Great story, even better if you have the right mods."
16269,"Well, if you haven't played Skyrim, you are in for a treat! The game is HUGE, and full of variables. You can quite literally play this game five times and not play the same way each time. There are certain set quests and lines of action, but even these can be ignored for as long as you like. If you want, you can simply wander the enormous countryside performing random acts of kindness, or ~ risking death or arrest ~ creating mayhem. Your character is not set in stone, which makes the variability of the game even more fun. And there are excellent mods for Skyrim available online. I suggest 'Vilja in Skyrim companion' as a must-try. Have fun!"
16270,GOOD MMO BEEN PLAYING SINCE PS3 RELEASE
16271,"honestly, i'd only recommend this game to people who play on PC. The mod community is what makes this game."
16272,"Stuck in quarantine? Forget the pandemic, go to Skyrim and assassinate the members of the Dark Brotherhood. Tired of hearing about politics on the TV? Turn off the tube, go to Skyrim and put the Stormcloaks in their place. Is it cold in your house? Grab a blanket, go to Skyrim and climb the 7,000 steps to High Hrothgar to shout at some old dudes who hail you as the most awesome individual on the face of the continent. Don't know what music to listen to? Pull up ""The Last Dragonborn"" by Dragonforce (yes, THAT Dragonforce), go to Skyrim and help your husbando Farkas cure himself of his lycanthropy before assaulting a keep full of smelly bandits and shooting down a dragon from three hundred yards away.

Want to be the most Mary Sue, Marty Stu player character upon the face of the planet and feel totally and completely unrepentant about it?

Go. Play. Skyrim. Go on, I'll wait."
16273,its 2020 and im still playin skyrim i think i need a therapist
16274,Most awesome game ever
16275,good game
16276,it's alright
16277,LOVE IT SO MUCH TO DO SO MANY TO KILL TO SAVE PEOPLE LOL
16278,"my game can't load due to my mods list but i've heard its pretty good, ten/10"
16279,100% would recommand.
16280,Fucking amazing
16281,oh boy oh boy oh boy. love the soundtrack also
16282,"Great Story, great graphics, lots of 'choice with consequence', free movement (yah there are edges out there but it's a big world!), factions, quests, fun, beauty.  IMO no single player game to date (9/2020) has met the challenge."
16283,It's Skyrim!
16284,"There isn't a single second without a glitch, such a fucking mess."
16285,Sky has the best rim...you should give it a try...with MODS
16286,cool
16287,
16288,"Awesome Open World, tons of quest, very worth getting the add-ons, your can get married, adopt children and but houses its pretty kool ive always loved this game"
16289,"ok
"
16290,much sus
16291,hi
16292,"I dont do reviews, but this game ruined all other games for me. Its the ultimate."
16293,skyrim gud
16294,Good
16295,"""What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"""
16296,GG
16297,this coolest game everexisted me say
16298,is this the krumsty kram
16299,"Это не игра, это движок для разного рода модификаций. Я не знаю как на неё смотреть. Если ты поехавший фентези-нёрд начала и конца 90-ых, который дико дрочит на этот сеттинги, то это игра как раз для тебя. Если тебе охота поставить десяток васянских модов на разноцветные пилотки, то тоже смело можешь заходить. Но если ты ищешь действительно интересную фентезийную игру, то тебе стороной, так как спустя столько времени, я понял, что в скайриме едино одно - это однотипные квесты. Серьёзно, в этой игре столько унылых квестов, что спустя около трёх сотен - я просто забил на их прохождение. Порой игра действительно вызывает желание запустить её, но как только ты видишь очередной квест на убийство двух клоунов с другой стороны карты, которая к тому же представляет из себя очередную серую деревню с четыремя домиками, то резко хочется дропнуть. Это хороший движок для модов, разной степени дрочибельности, но как самостоятельная рпг - просто жепный опыт. Да, и эта игра не далеко ушла от того же обливиона или морровинда в плане гемплуя, но может взять всё тем же, чем брали предыдущие части, а именно тем. что в ней просто приятно бегать."
16300,"This is the greatest game ever created, impossible to get tired of it and very easy to put in loads of hours.  This game becomes infinitely better with mods"
16301,"I am not into the online gaming, this one of those games you can emerse yourself in without battling some over zealous gang on the other side of the planet. I prefer to battle the computer not strangers."
16302,"Skyrim is a game with countless hours of replayability and fun. It's buggy as hell and has loads of exploits and game breaking moments, but you can also play without seeing any of those. I've had skyrim for the PS3, Ps4, and I own base and special Edition for steam, I've 100% the game (achievements wise, im sure im missing some quests) + Dragonborn DLC on my ps3 and put almost a thousand more hours on top of that combining the PS4 and my two versions for PC, and I don't regret a second of it. Tom shut up and take my money you magnificent bastard."
16303,"Most epic game I've played so far, even compared with most recent ones.You can't like it, you love it or not."
16304,if you have a lot of free time
16305,Skyrim is a awesome game i love it.
16306,its a really good game and i would recommend it.
16307,I liked everything and disliked nothing
16308,"Probably one of the best games from the this millennium (without overrating). It has got all the means to get you wanting to explore, fight, craft and achieve more. Don't let yourself get fooled by the release date, it is definitely worth playing it in 2020. Enjoy this masterpiece!"
16309,&
16310,took an arrow to hte knee
16311,"Played a ton of this game when it came out and it was a great game then. The same is still true today. I've picked it back up again recently and it still holds up fairly well. Classic Bethesda bugs aside, it's still a great game and one of the best open world games out there."
16312,It's fun to play
16313,Still haven't beat it.
16314,"If you want to wander a world where you can make a difference, where the bad guys are really bad guys, where even a thief can do the right thing, etc; this is the game for you"
16315,This game should come with every steam account sign up if it isn't already. I've bought Skyrim 5 times.
16316,"Its been two weeks and I havent gotten any work done, help me"
16317,i killed something
16318,Still the best game ever
16319,It's Skyrim
16320,Legendary classic game.
16321,Still one of the best games ive ever played!
16322,do[pe
16323,"Wow.... What an absolute masterpiece! I would totally recommend this title to anyone I know. The core mechanics from previous elder scrolls titles are here in the most polished format yet. With countless hours of adventuring and questing to be done, you can expect at least 40 hours of truly enjoyable gameplay from this gem of a title. WIth that out of the way, I'd also like to mention it's not only unfair Todd and the gang decided to do this ""At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search."" but it's also  just plain stingy. I enjoyed this game with all of my being however, the recent moves made by Bethesda Softworks have just been out of character for them to say the least (charging people $60 for skyrim on anything that has the specs to run it, Fallout 76 and ESO being a disappointment, the fact they milked a subscription service out of ESO until they were criticized by everyone for it and now this). I hope that everything turns out okay for Bethesda and that this was just some sort of a funky bump down the road for them. I look forward to the elder scrolls 6, which is hopefully the way they shall redeem themselves to then allow me to restore faith in them as a household name once more."
16324,I mean C'om its skyrim you cant not play
16325,i hate myself for not saving.
16326,It's like skyrim with skyrim
16327,"Love Skyrim, reinstalling it after some years away. Can't live w/o it!"
16328,"If you like RPGs and you haven't played Skyrim yet - why not!? It's stood the test of time, has loads of modding community support and still looks great (and can look even greater with mods.) If you haven't got this game in multiple formats already, then you're not a hardcore Skyrim fan ;) Buy it, see what games should actually look like after ten years and counting and you'll probably fall in love with it. My favourite game ever!"
16329,How many times have I bought this game... 3 times? I should buy it again.
16330,good game
16331,just do it. you wont be disappointed
16332,Excellent game.
16333,One word amazing.
16334,<3 <3 <3
16335,"Got this as a birthday present in 2012 and I have sunk 1,435 hours into it. I regret nothing."
16336,"Once you start modding, you'll realize that Skyrim is the greatest game ever made."
16337,One of the masterpieces of Gaming.
16338,I absolutely love this game.
16339,"Loved every bit of this game.
Music is the best part, it feels like you're really immersed into the game.
100% Must-buy!!  recommend it so much, I'd even buy it for you.
If....I had the money."
16340,Great game!
16341,Its Skyrim one of the BEST RPG of all time. What more needs to be said.
16342,"Swords and magic go swoosh swoosh bang bang, big like."
16343,"Despite this game being nearly 10 years old, this is still one of my favorite games. Bethesda really outdid themselves with this one. You can choose to stick to the story line or venture off and do your own thing. You can fight dragons and vampires and werewolves, or you can choose to summon dragons, lead a pack of werewolves, or vampires."
16344,"It's Skyrim, honestly that is all that needs to be said"
16345,"Todd Howard, thank"
16346,a great game but after like 150 hrs mods make the game
16347,"Highly customizable sandbox open-world to adventure in, explore, fight, steal, or do your own thing.  I love the feel of it being a real-world.  The immersion can be very good with the right mods!  If you ever get bored of it, just download a few new mods and choose a different race with a different build.  It will be an all-new game!"
16348,"Like a french kiss to the anus: very uncomfortable, but says dirty things to you before giving you divorce papers."
16349,good
16350,because its skyrim..........duh
16351,"It's skyrim, you already know what it is"
16352,"I love this game so much, it's literally my life"
16353,immersive. On going. Allow one to leave their normal reality
16354,I finally beat the game.
16355,"Install gameInstall ModsLaunch SkyrimCrash to DesktopAhhh... just like the good old days, 8 years ago"
16356,"Killed a chicken in the start of the game, got smoked by a whole village. 10/10"
16357,"Pros :
-Easy combat for beginner gamers.
-Incredibly immersive world .
-Fun and exciting quest lines.
-Has great longevity due to active MODing community.
Cons:
-Will suck your time like a black hole.
-Leveling system is not great .
-Simple combat , can be a con for more experienced players looking for a challenging combat style."
16358,its skyrim. like do you need a review?
16359,There is no game that can be compared. You can play this for unlimited hours.
16360,Great game for anyone looking for an adventure. I recommend playing with headphones so that you can totally lose yourself in the world. This is a must play and must own.
16361,"The game may be getting old, but the modding community more than makes up for it."
16362,"I mean... it's skyrim.  If you're reading this you're living under a rock.  Huge world, tons of freedom, lots to see and do, fun mods."
16363,"Let's face it, everyone has at least heard of Skyrim.
It's a decent game! Large world, lots of quests...but sometime it shows it's age
And I swear there is only five voice actors for the hundreds of NPCs-

The Mods that are around are amazing thou so go ahead and grab the game and it's DLCs when it's on sale"
16364,"Strictly vanilla: good game, worth it.
With mods: hands down an all time great"
16365,good shit
16366,i took an arrow to the knee
16367,one of the best games ever made brings back so many memories from my childhood pewdiepie got me into this game! :0 and i love the elder scrolls franchise.
16368,Skyrim is great. BOTW without the climbing mechanic.
16369,?
16370,"Hey, you're finally awake."
16371,"awesome
"
16372,"At this point, there's not really any reason to get the original version over the Special Edition, unless you want to play some specific mod that is only compatible with the original version of Skyrim.

That said, the game is fantastic."
16373,"Great game to just Vibe
"
16374,your not a gamer without this
16375,it's skyrim
16376,yes
16377,"if you have not played this, you must!!! not only is it buckets of fun, but the modding community is so active that there is practically an infinite amount of stuff to do 
"
16378,Don't ever hit the chicken. EVER.
16379,port to my printer when
16380,its very fun but get mods.
16381,Well it says I had only played for 34h buts its more. I played it with friends offline on their devices and at home alone it was fun. Always. Together and alone.
16382,"Not the best Elder Scrolls, but still a massively fun game, even if its been re-released 5 billion times."
16383,It's Elder Scrolls. Enough said.
16384,"its skyrim ...... nuff said
"
16385,Very nice game
16386,good game got thousand of hours on it.

16390,"The hell you want me to even say? It's SKYRIM, dude! Everyone's AT LEAST heard of this game!"
16391,"Overall great game, the more you play it the harder it gets."
16392,"The game is amazing. So many quests and decisions that you can make, really change the play through each time. Plus the amount of mods are insane."
16393,"I've been playing skyrim since the xbox 360 version, and all i can say is that is in my top 5 favorite games of all time."
16394,shit game lol
16395,"GOOD
"
16396,"Don't play without Mods.
Want to add gritty realism in your high fantasy RPG? 
There's a Mod for that.

There's a Mod for that.

16415,mods
16416,grgame love it
16417,I liked this. I finished the main story and made an attempt to explore all the remaining side missions but eventually you'll get tired of it. Doesn't mean it's not worth enjoying up to a point.
16418,its skyrim
16419,old skyrim good. new skyrim bad
16420,"I've returned to this.
It has been a while, and it has taken a bit of time to get the feel again, but gee... it's a great game
"
16421,Skyrim: Proletariat Edition
16422,YES
16423,A beautiful inventory management simulation that is weirdly fun.
16424,Challenges-role play is exc!
16425,It's okay.
16426,Still an absolutely wonderful game.
16427,A true classic with endless replay-ability.
16428,"It's real easy to dunk on, but it's a comfy ass game with mods installed"
16429,very good game yes
16430,is gud
16431,Been playing skyrim since I had a PS3. 10/10 always recommend
16432,Skyrim is a fantasy RPG about dragons and other mythical creatures.
16433,"I don't recommend Skyrim, Stop asking if I would."
16434,ME  LIKE GAME
16435,.
16436,Big sword go swoosh!!!
16437,"There are times when this game has given me troubles and tribulations with something that is universally agreed upon for the most part. Bethesda, you are a beautiful video game company and you've brought out Diamonds in the Rough but from time to time there are blunders and bugs galore. Just giving everyone the heads up ahead of time before going into the positives. Purchase this game and go in expecting possible issues. Overall this game is highly recommended. Love it."
16438,played on xbox atleast a few hundred hours. switched over to pc for mods and never regretted it. considering how long this game has been out. why dont you have it yet?
16439,<3
16440,GREAT
16441,Time Spend Many
16442,U put pp's in butts
16443,"Awesome

16446,Everyone knows what Skyrim is by now.
16447,flip bird says this game is pretty okay
16448,One of the best games of all time. A must play.
16449,By far my all time favorite game. Have played this game all the way through to completion on every console its been released for. So much to do and endless possibilities with mods. More then recommended if you have never played it before!
16450,best.
16451,Awesome game.
16452,fus.
16453,"I first played this game at a very young age during 2012 not long after the game released. I fell in love with it instantly so if you haven't tried it yet you must, since it is one of the greatest games of all time."
16454,"It's beyond immersive, it exists, LOL, in an alternate time and space where we can each live an extraordinary simulation of what it would be like to live in such a magical, dangerous, and mystifying Age."
16455,"While this is an older game, it has a massively expansive game world, a number of paths to completion, good graphics, and a mind-boggling number of DLC available."
16456,Excellent game
16457,"bro this game fr fire best game ever made
"
16458,"Love the game, mechanics, mods..everything. 
The bad:  sucks they did not make this game as a co-op and that the additional content created for the game was not free upon release or discounted at the very least for those of us who bought it before the content was released....The worst is that they just released a ""skyrim"" on TSO...which is again..another money grab as each bit of content costs a bit and only provides a small amount of additional content compared to the cost........TESV:Skyrim gets a 8/10.....mod makers get 10/10!"
16459,allways has been and until otherwise will remain my favourite rpg of all time
16460,It's a fun game.
16461,"Great game, sure it has some bugs that pop up from time to time, but its wonderful to play even after all these years I still find my self coming back to it again and again. Just have to scratch that itch. If you love fantasy settings, D&D, RPGs, Dungeon Crawlers, you will love this game :)"
16462,Probably the most replayable game of all.
16463,Still the GOAT. I took an arrow in the knee.
16464,THIS GAME WILL ALWAYS BE IN MY HEART AND SOUL!!!! LONG LIVE THE ELDER SCROLLS AND THE CREATORS THAT KEEP THIS GAME ALIVE!!
16465,"Slewt Mods, enough said"
16466,good
16467,"9 years and no I haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm pretty sure you know why."
16468,10/10
16469,It's an anti-vagina potion.
16470,Best Game Ever.
16471,"Took me 10nyears to finally get to it, but absolutely loving it"
16472,Poggers game
16473,"I've spent more time modding this game than actually playing it. 10/10, IGN, would install for the hundredth time again."
16474,its kewl sword go slice
16475,"Excellent game play, love the open world."
16476,good
16477,"Love the game, could play it for the rest of my life. Definitely would recommend to everyone who hasn't experienced this glorious game yet."

"
16480,good
16481,"Awesome graphics, great game play, good story line lots of DLC as well.
"
16482,"This is for me hands down my absolute favorite game
I've ever played in my life!

[h1]Story of me:[/h1]
Considering me back in the days of playing outside
with my youthful friends in my neighborhood.
Away from the old Dell computer with only a few
physical copies of FPS games my dad would play if
he got the time, like:
Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (2001)
and Call of Duty (2003)

As my friends got older they went their separate
ways and left me for granted. Eventually I made new
friends on school, of course. I wasn't always into gaming,
I was either playing outside or drawing and loved both.
But playing outside without any friends to play with...
and drawing was fun and all, but I needed a new hobby.
I started out back in the day with simple games from EA
(when were still relevant) it was one of those Harry Potter
games, Sorcerer's Stone (2001) I still have that copy somewhere
and it got boring really quick and I could've sworn I really liked
those books and movies and all... Took a long break from it,
didn't like any of it, eventually switched to Spore (2008),
got a copy of it, because a friend from school recommended it
and it hooked me like crazy. Gaming back in the day for me was like
2 hours a day because I wouldn't want to get too attached to it.
(Still not to this day...)

I made a Steam account back in 2011, because:
Not too long after, my friends were talking about games from
Valve (Team Fortress 2) and Bethesda (Fallout: NV)
and I really liked them all, played TF2 for a long time with
my friends. Whilst I was still playing TF2 from 2011-2015 between
that period of time TES: Skyrim came out, I've seen the trailer
and all and it looked so cool but didn't had the money to play it.
After the end of 2015 I had enough of TF2 and bought Skyrim.

[h1]And thus, the game:[/h1]
Skyrim is a RPG Open World game with a plethora of ways to
play this game: Play as a Dragonborn, shout at Bandits,
yell at Nazeem, hunt Deer, get hunted by Bears,
get-launched by Giants, slay Dragons, dead Undeads,
rest Restless Draugr, kill the Blades, bite-back Vampires
(or join Vampires). Be a musical and magical talent at the
Nards College and College of Hogwarts. Learn Conjuration,
Destruction, Illusion, Alteration and Masturbation, grind Restoration,
cast scrolls, eat effortlessly, eat like 250 cheese wheels just to get
to full health, hear classic memes from the guards, get married, adopt
two children, outlaw, ban or worship Divines, spit on the High Elves,
suck off the Daedric Princes, pet Barbas, buy items at stores, sell
items at stores, invest in stores, break into stores after 8:00,
store items... take items...
sell stolen items to the store owner you just so have stolen
from the same store. Steal one plate by accident?
[b]*Breaking the Law by Judas Priest intensifies*[/b]
Spend time and sneak out of prison, break picks from lock picking
Master locked chests, pickpocket the pickled NPCs, get a bounty,
murder innocents in the name of Sithis, invest time and effort in the
Thieves Guild, bribe guards, persuade fools and intimidate bullies
like a silver-tongue, do Skooma with the Khajiit, read a book,
learn a book, book a holiday for Urag, join the Stormcloaks,
spy on Imperial Spies, plan to kill the Emperor Tits Mead II
save the world, phone-call destiny. Discover whereabouts in
dungeons, Dwemer ruins, forts and caves, then re-discover them
again 'cus of a miscellaneous quest, drink every time you
encounter a major or minor bug, and more!
And that ten times over to see if it's any different with another race.

Without any regrets I spend more than 3,000 hours on the classic
version and then switched over to the Special edition. I still play it
'till this day and it never get boring. There is so much to do, so much
to go on and it doesn't end there. There is an amazing community
still making mods for this game even after so many years, so much
dedication to everything for everyone... Respect!

[h1]Ultimately:[/h1]
Skyrim has everything I could've dreamed of, it fits my childhood in
more ways than I could imagine... Wandering the cold harsh lands of
Skyrim is like wandering the woods in my homeland in real-life.
A beautiful display of memories of me playing with my friends as a
child wandering the woods and building huts out of sticks and leaves.
I'm actually already crying like a emotional wreck typing this review
with such fond memories. And I have to thank Bethesda for that.
Cheers!

remember that![/b]"

WITH ALL VERSIONS OF SKYRIM TOGETHER E.G. XBOX, XBOX 360, PC AND PLAYSTATION

Mate, it's skyrim! played since it was first released on xbox 360 with all the DLC'S and bought the re-master when it also came out. It's an amazing game that has aged really well and you'll love it!

It's a xp, skill tree, based game with monsters and dragons etc with tons of amazing quests.
YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

it's a beautiful game with a deep story and the DLC'S are amazing and WORTH THE MONEY! character customisation to create an abomination or a beautiful character to slay the beasts in the OPEN WORLD LEGENDARY game. 

JUST BUY IT! TRUST ME! IT'S AMAZING!"
16493,mucho gusto
16494,Skyrim.
16495,I guess I'm too late for an arrow to the knee joke.
16496,
16497,+
16498,"I always find myself coming back to Skyrim. the game itself is always still good, and with the addition of mods helps keep it interesting"
16499,"dude seriously, if you havent had a chance to play skyrim by now then are you actually a gamer? Must play for anyone."
16500,Dude it's Skyrim
16501,funny lizard
16502,"Incredible experience like nothing ive ever played before
"
16503,I can't stop.
16504,One of the best games I've played.
16505,"No One:
Not a Single Soul:
Literally Every Khajiit: KhAjIiT hAs GoOd PrIcEs, YeS?"
16506,I've been playing video games since when you had to feed quarters into a machine standing in a convenience store. I had the original atari as a kid. I've been at this for forty years. Skyrim is the best game I have ever played. Period. I highly recommend it. Fallout 4 is awesome too.
16507,"Terrible game, mod it or toss it"
16508,Honestly this games almost 10yrs old but i consider it one the best rpgs of the decade and this is coming from a guy who has over 400+ hours in this game across muiltple systems
16509,Please help me stop
16510,yes
16511,love buy wish i could find a way to let people know they can still buy the non remastered edition as it has a thriving community and can be made to look as good no actually way better than the remastered version.
16512,"I get to wrestle dragons, yeet people off of cliffs by screaming at them, commit mass murder with zero consequence and I am living"
16513,It's pretty gud.
16514,"Why can't I fucking stop playing this game...

10/10, would mod again."
16515,GOOD
16516,"Even though Skyrim is nearly 9 years old, I think it is still a great open world experience, it is especially good for the people that are into open world, medieval nordic/fantasy RPG, I recommend those who still wish to try Skyrim to get it if you can as it is still great in my experience."
16517,Best game ever
16518,"Stop scrolling criminal scum, you have violated the law."
16519,Awesome game to play when you have a couple hours or days to burn.
16520,I've been playing this game forever and will prolly never stop loving it.
16521,"One of the benchmarks for open world RPGs. I've played others since then (both older and newer), but this is the game that got me into the genre."
16522,"nsfw mods make the world go round, but this time in hd!

still really buggy, just, its a feature"
16523,it sucks.
16524,Incredible
16525,"It's Skyrim, why are you reading the reviews? Just play it."
16526,This game is overwhelmingly unstable and unplayable. Even without mods it's almost impossible to not run into any game-breaking bug and not be able to continue the game on that save. I would not recommend it.
16527,it's good
16528,Epic mod enjoying it at the moment would be good if a version was uploaded to xbox one for xbox players to experience as well
16529,"if u dont own it then get it
"
16530,Arguably the greatest game of all time.  Play with mods for an even better experience.
16531,"[b]It's great, but Skyrim SE is better.[/b]"
16532,It Just Works.
16533,Come on it's Skyrim.
16534,Best fantasy open world game open world game to play when you're stuck at home during quarantine. 4 months went by in a blink of an eye because of this game.
16535,"it's a fun open world buggy mess, but it's what makes it fun!"
16536,<3 <3 <3  One of the best games of this decade!!! <3 <3 <3
16537,One of my all time favorite games for sure! cant beat a good Skyrim binge!
16538,"Excellent game, I finished the main story and working on finishing all the other guild's questlines, still not bored yet."
16539,hey... its skyrim if you dont already know
16540,Meh.
16541,I have never successfully completed this game... I have sunk 254 hours into it. If that doesn't say anything I don't know what does. If you haven't played this game... well you need to get playing.
16542,"Skyrim is a classic amongst open-world RPGs. If content seems familiar, it's only because so many games have derived from its structure. Though this IS a game that was made 9 years ago so there are things to consider. Its story is predictable, its intro is its weakest component and its main missions are a snooze compared to far more interesting sidequests and mission lines. And once you have 50 or more hours under your belt you start to see similarities between dungeons and questlines. But it's hard not to get lost in Skyrim, from its excellent perks system (an improvement from the boring stat-based grind of Oblivion) to its improved combat to the pages of mythology and backstory you can simple find on the shelves of the gameworld wherever you turn - Skyrim, in Western RPGs at least, is seminal - and essential."
16543,Mods give this game nearly endless playing time.
16544,"Wow, Skyrim is... well Skyrim. An amazing game full of dragons, adventures, stories, and a crime or too. So many classes like heavy class with 1 or two handed weapons. Magic. Light armor with dagger. So much to do! Enough for you to be busy for a LONG time!"
16545,seems like a solid RPG
16546,Great game ee
16547,This game has aged well
16548,"This is one of the best games I've ever played. The replay value is HUGE... every time I play this game I learn something different. I always get the same emotional gut punch with my favorite quest stories. With the ease of access to mods, I can play the same stories with totally different impacts based on what I chose to play."
16549,it's okay
16550,Best game to ever exist. Period.
16551,no lollygaggin
16552,"I really like the endless amount of quests, and adventures there are in this game. Each playthrough reveals a new questline you hadn't noticed on your last save. It has a few bugs, but nothing game-breaking. The lore is enticingly deep and really reels you into the game. Altogether it's a really fun and immersive game with great replay value. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars."
16553,I will edit this when I have more hours
16554,"i know the review is maybe a bit late but its Skyrim...everything about this game is perfect , LITERALLY EVERYTHING 

hope one of the lovely giants is gona see this and yEets me out of space again O_o <3"
16555,nice rpg
16556,wow.. the graphics
16557,it's alright
16558,Simply amazing
16559,its nice
16560,I wish to buy this again. I refunded it because I didn't understand anything in the first 2 hours and I was scared that the game will be bad.
16561,I can roleplay as the Sniper from TF2 if he were a reptile man and I could aim
16562,i love this game
16563,"For any newcomers I wholeheartedly suggest just playing legitimately for the initial character. Fully enjoy the game, and explore every crack, crevice, recesses you may find or come across. Bethesda put a lot in the world of skyrim, and it's satisfying to experience the game how it's intended to be; at least once. 

""Breaking the game"" is actually very easy, and I myself stumbled across several ways purely on accident. 

From one shotting almost every entity hostile or otherwise, practicing long range shots on creatures, and just causing mayhem with one well placed shot... archery is by far my favorite skill alongside sneaking. The sneak tree in tandem with archery, and one handed can be utilized to incredibly ridiculous proportions. 

Being a God amongst men with shouting and magic of many kinds.

16564,lost my house
16565,good game
16566,"gg
that is all"
16567,Todd the god Howard
16568,good game
16569,"For me, still the best game ever. Replayability like no other game. If you are for some reason bored, you can mod the fluff out of it. I've got 250+ hours in the *ehm* unofficial *ehm* version and still playing..."
16570,"One of the best games I have ever played, really pulls you in!"
16571,The best game in the world.
16572,The freedom to mod and role play in this game is very special.
16573,"Love this world and this game. 10/10 will play every day. fun and interactive, play in your own way and still fun. i love the writing/stories and the game choices. Can only recommend ESO over this for the social element, otherwise..my fav of all time i think (as of 2020)"
16574,YES
16575,ok
16576,Yes
16577,ggg
16578,"Skyrim is endlessly engaging.  It's fun to play a first time, not knowing anything about it.  Glitches and exploits within the LE game (and some in the Special Edition) allow for a ""build-it-yourself"" mentality, It's also a great doorway to modding, for inexperienced modders, who would eventually like to learn art and scripting skills and eventually design characters and build their own games.  It's also rewarding to play multiple times, to try different character-player builds and game-play styles.  

It's a rare game in which you can find a way to play and win, without killing anything that looks human.  

Although you may have to use Illusion Magic or defensive combat and dragon-shout skills against contract NPC's out to get you."
16579,i lost lidya
16580,oh peep here we go again
16581,gary lineker?
16582,"GAME
"
16583,"great game, but you should use some mods"
16584,I love everything about the game!!!
16585,Must Have
16586,"It just works 
"
16587,"HeY yOu
YoU'rE fInaLLY aWaKe"
16588,
16589,The last and final good game by Bethesda. Everything else is crap.
16590,Amazing RPG almost ten years old with more hours worth of game-play than most games out today.
16591,Beautiful Game truly a staple game for the RPG Genre Im glad I was able to enjoy this title
16592,Just play Special Edition.
16593,Fun
16594,i think the s*x mods are funny
16595,yes good buy skyrim again. todd demands it.
16596,"Honestly there's a lot to do in this game, and you can spend hours causing shenanigans across Skyrim. In terms of DLC, it's wonderful, sure it's aged, but it is still wonderful to play. Dawnguard is fun, obviously for the vampire wife, but also for the fact that you gain a lot more exploration potential. Dragonborn DLC is good simply because you can yell at people and it's totally justified. Hearthfire is good if you just want to live that RP life. 

All in all, 9/10, the only thing I would appreciate in terms of changes, would be adding a Borderless Window mode for the game in order to allow alt-tabbing between game, and in some cases, streaming services, or just hiding the fact that you are yeeting that annoying Khajit that's been trying to sell you Skooma 900 times over with a shout that can kill an entire city.... but hey, to each their own, ya know?"
16597,yes
16598,"this game never dies
played years ago on console. played multiple times on pc and across other consoles. still love modding the hell out of it and revisiting it every once in a while."
16599,best game ever.
16600,"Insanely beautiful game for its year, an interesting story and not annoying side quests. 10 dragons out of 10"
16601,It just works.
16602,"Skyrim is 100% worth it. 10/10. I've easily put at least 1000 hours in the game across Xbox360, PS4 and Steam. it was released in 2011 so keep that in mind, some stuff might be outdated"
16603,i like bashin fuckin dragons heads in and absorbin their souls. 10/10
16604,love the big open world
16605,INCREDIBLE
16606,One of the Best in Gaming History!
16607,fun
16608,Without mods it's kinda shit.
16609,I don't even know how the game looks without mods
16610,10/10 Would play again and again.
16611,"This is one of the most personally influential games I've played, it opened my mind to new types of games and for that it will always hold a special place in my heart. It is a genuinely great and fun game, especially if you haven't played something like it before. The world and lore of the Elder Scrolls series is rich and detailed and interesting to learn more about. In this game you play as the legendary Dovahkiin, or Dragonborn, a being who is a mortal with the soul of a dragon, and who can absorb the souls of other dragons. Because of this they have an innate ability to speak like the dragons as well as being one of the only things that can truly kill a dragon forever, by consuming their soul. While this game is certainly lacking in some areas like sparse or repetitive content sometimes and repetitive combat, it's still a ton of fun, and as a bonus it is one of if not the most heavily modded game in existence so there is almost limitless player made content to explore too!"
16612,"Played it for a little bit, it's alright I guess."
16613,"Great game, so much to do!"
16614,"Another of those ""once you pop, you can´t stop"" games <3"
16615,I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee.
16616,One of the best
16617,"This is still one of my favorite games, even after all of these years!"
16618,"As usual, Bethesda produced a buggy steaming pile."
16619,I have 5 copies of this game
16620,skyrim... its pretty gud
16621,Favorite game of all time. I mostly play on Xbox but PC allows for more mods. Highly reccomend to anyone looking to get deep into a game and put a lot of time into it (and enjoy the whole thing).
16622,its fine i guess
16623,gud
16624,"Good game, easy to do plenty of stuff in it"
16625,Fun Game but Mods make it even more fun.... ;)
16626,Why haven't you bought this classic great time of a game yet friend? Run through the game just by itself and you'll have hundreds of hours of Skyrim memories at the end. Download a few thousand mods and you'll have no reason to play much of anything else.
16627,Played for a bit not worth it
16628,Will consume a chunk of your life
16629,"Look, it's Skyrim. Its not like I'm not going to not recommend it, but I feel as if I don't want to either.
To be blunt, this game the first time around really is something, but playthroughs past that initial impression start to reveal this games flaws, no matter how many mods you install. It just becomes lifeless and boring, even with all of the unique quests, they all feel the same after a while. The non-interactive dialouge that spouts the same shit over and over again is just tiring and stale. It's all just eh. All of it."
16630,"Never gets old
"
16631,What more can I say about Skyrim that you probably don't already know. Mods and replay ability make this game even better!
16632,you can play as first person
16633,Good game
16634,"This game is amazing!  It is an open sandbox world set in a mountainous region.  The landscape is beautiful and fun to explore.  It takes place in a Nordic culture and is reminiscent of vikings but in a fantasy setting with elves, orcs, lizard people and cat folk.  You play as a hero who is highly customizable and you complete quests in an rpg type game.  You can buy houses in game or even build your own.  It is very fun to play.  Give it a try!"
16635,a classic :)
16636,"I love this game. By the time 'player' is level 20, it is not too important which character you chose.. However, if it boggles, it appears to  play, but exits before it finishes loading. Then, you need to delete it and reload it, both of which take a long time to do ...
"
16637,G O A T
16638,It's been 9 years and I'm not bored yet.
16639,Fun game my dudes
16640,"Come on guys, It's Skyrim."
16641,Even after 9 years of playing this is still an amazing game to get lost in. The mods market is bigger than ever and I can't wait for the next title release from Bethesda!
16642,"In Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition Mk 2 Turbo, you play as the Super Dragonite, basically even more powerful than Mega Dragonite. Giratina appears and summons Latias, Latios, Reshiram and Zekrom who destroy the mythical land of Skryim, which is like Viking Louisiana. I don't like how you can get people mad just because you hit them with your sword or bow or set them on fire. 

After you mega evolve into Mega Dragonite, you have lots of powers like alchemy and punching. There's even potions you can make to make you punch faster and harder. There's no guns in this game, which is disappointing but you do get a bow and arrow that looks like DragonForce so that's something.



"
16643,yes
16644,yeah it's a pretty good game
16645,"You were Dragon""BORN"" to play this amazing game."
16646,"goood
"
16647,Love this game.  Thousands of hours of game play and more can be added through the steam workshop.  Fantastic.
16648,is pretty gud

16650,"~~~WARNING~~~
U have to limit the FPS to 60 in order to not have objects fly around and have the swimming animation instead of walking on land. On Nvidea u do that with Nvidea Inspector, set the frame rate to 60.

Except from that it just works

"
16651,One of the greatest games I've ever played!
16652,stab stab = like
16653,"Fun game if you like RPGs.  LOTS of content.  Huge game.  Many, many hours of levelling and questing.  Lots of crafting and customiztion if you like that.  Highly recommend."
16654,good
16655,"I feel that I have to say very little about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim as everyone has played it. In case you haven't though here we go. The art is fantastic and only occasionally dated. The combat is fun and allows for diverse methods of play. The characters are rather flat but there is a good amount of choices you can make in the world. The main story is arguably the worst quest, but other quests like the thieves guild are wildly fun. The massive world offers plenty of opportunity to sink hundreds of hours into it. I have played the game for several hours on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC normal edition and special edition. The game is great, everyone knows it, so play it."
16656,"No, Todd, once was enough. Mod it till it breaks. It's fun in the same way all Bethesda games are fun, because they're all the same game. This is just Fallout 3.75."
16657,certified skyrim moment
16658,:)
16659,yes
16660,fun to tinker with in regards to modding
16661,"easily recommended, great game."
16662,its really fun to mod and its kept me entertained for almost 6 years now
16663,Pretty much really fun
16664,hgfh
16665,it was g o o d O K  S T E A M
16666,"I have played this game on over 3 systems, and it is still amazing
"
16667,lit.
16668,GOOD GAME BUT HAS SOME GLITCHES ALSO MALACHY IS A CHEATING SCUMBAG
16669,"nice
"
16670,"The game is amazing, altho npc does attack me randomly"
16671,one of the best single player rpg games out there.
16672,you need a decent pc but pretty fun if your into old timy games with fighting and magic
16673,Come on. It's been almost 10 years. Play it already.
16674,love
16675,"Will still be enjoying the pc version a decade after release due to endless modding potential. Developers should take note, that's how to keep people playing your game. Give people the freedom to use their own imagination and create their own content."
16676,TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
16677,After all these years still an awesome game. I could recommend it for someone who tried it there is a lot of fun and even If you played the whole game there is still a massive mountain of mods to use
16678,very nice
16679,never could get this game to work properly...
16680,"Fun and very addicting,still kicks ass after 9 years."
16681,Buy Skyrim™
16682,the most fun game to play in a low end pc
16683,"Steam keeps asking me to review this and for the sake of removing this from the bar I will.
Yes it's totally worth playing and if you want to play a good old RPG that has a somewhat arcade-y feel to it, this is a great choice.
If you ask a die-hard old Morrowind, or even older Daggerfall, fan then this game will seem shallow. But it's FINE. It's fun and enjoyable and anything you don't like can easily be heavily modded.
Also, if you buy the game around this review is posted, you get to skip paid mods. Go you."
16684,best game ever
16685,"Love the open world/do your own thing style. I've played this game between my xbox and pc for a total of about 1,000 hrs across more playthroughs than I care to count and I have only completed the main story line 4 times because I am too busy doing all the side quests and DLC. This is a game that I constantly return to when I get bored of whatever else I am playing simply due to the re play value. 10/10 would recommend."
16686,fucken sick cunt game.
16687,get it
16688,its gewd
16689,"Played a little bit, It's okay"
16690,"You will have so much fun, you will probably never want to play another game again."
16691,sex
16692,"yes

16693,Works really well on my samsung smart fridge
16694,"Open world exploration at its best, a vast landscape sculpted by so many modders it has become immortalized by the players."
16695,"skyrim game of of the year for the past 10 years lol

8 out of 10"
16696,"great game, great replay value, hours of endless questing and fun"
16697,"A classic, be careful with mods, it breaks things if you are not careful. Overall I have spent a lot of time exploring Skyrim, and I enjoy it enough to return when other games simply lose their appeal for a while"
16698,"amazing
"
16699,Great game for its time. I'm looking forward to Elder Scrolls VI
16700,"Bruh its Skyrim, why are you looking at reviews its a good ass game!"
16701,It's alright I guess
16702,Immersive AF with most mods
16703,Played for the haha's. But all I got was a burning hatred for those damn Elves.
16704,2
16705,I tried this game for a few hours and got addicted.
16706,I bought this game for screenshots and dragons. And I just installed the 4K texture pack! Almost as good as new!
16707,Hands down one of the best games out and that's without the Mod's!!
16708,in 2 days i played 25 hours
16709,"Listen, all I'm saying is that even though we all make fun of Bethesda for releasing this game every 1.5 years, I'm still not done with it. 

My dad bought this game for me a month after it came out, nearly 9 years ago. Last week I discovered locations in Hjaalmarch I had never seen before. It's clear that thousands of hours of work and love was put into this game. I can only hope that ES6 receives the same treatment."
16710,porn
16711,dragon
16712,Skyrim is a true Masterpiece. you Should try at least Once before you die.
16713,If I had a nickle for every time this game crashed I could afford The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
16714,"Full of bugs. Can't save. Level up indicator always on the screen, etc etc.
Tired of trying to fix this"
16715,"Don't play unless you intend to mod it to hell and back.

Even then, you might just find it to be a buggy mess of a time sink."
16716,Good game but if you buy you will jizz in your pants.
16717,"It's addictive and you get caught up in it, so it's really well made in terms of story and options. Very open world game. However, the game just crashes from time to time, and it can get laggy at parts; it seems like it could have been optimized better."
16718,expansive.  lots of content.
16719,"It's Skyrim, of course you should play it"
16720,it's pretty good
16721,"While not as deep in roleplay mechanics as previous entries, its still fun to explore and take in the breathtaking visuals...and legendary glitches"
16722,"Don't waste your time like I did.
This game feels great in terms of scale, and atmosphere at first, and it initially felt like you could build your character and approach the story however you like, which would be a great idea, but everything in this game is just so, so linear and soulless.
Levelling up your character and choosing what skills you want to increase feels great at first but eventually you just get so powerful with all your perks just adding to you in a way that's completely unbalanced, and makes you way too powerful, way too quick. It eventually just becomes a case of how much you can play at that point, especially with how slow you level up after about level 20.
All the dialogue, characters, combat, quests, choices, and everything else are also completely devoid of any kind of real substance/character, it all just meshes and blends so much together to the point where the entire game might as well be one quest.
I wouldn't recommend playing this game, literally anything it has to offer has been done better in other games. Just a total waste of time..."
16723,"its nice 
"
16724,played off and on for years. everyone knows its a great game i mean come on
16725,"Sometimes broken, but always fun times."
16726,"who doesnt love skyrim
"
16727,Well worth the five bucks i paid for the vanilla game.
16728,"lmao you cant even buy this version anymore
"
16729,yes

16738,"one of the best RPG's still , too bad we don't get updates for the next TES game"
16739,"Fun game, classic. Sometimes buggy as with a lot of Bethesda games, but you honestly can't go wrong here."

16741,This is a Legendary game. Nothing much to say.
16742,1

16746,YEET
16747,"yes,"
16748,"I love this game but the thing is, I can't find the DLC's like dawnguard and stuff anywhere in this thing. As hard as I try to find it. I can't seem to locate them. If any help I would love it"
16749,"Sandbox is great, story(s) are in depth, characters are entertaining, graphics are excellent, quick to save and to also undo recent activities."
16750,it was fun?
16751,"this is in my opinion one of the greatest games of all time,"
16752,its ok
16753,"This game is a classic, especially if you like RPGs. If your normal... you'll end up playing it around a 100 times and you'll not get sick of it. Love this game."
16754,i love it
16755,"Pro tip : Don't attack chickens, you'll regret it."
16756,Im speech less
16757,Super fun especially with mods and glitches
16758,"What is there to say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said numerous times? Top notch RPG. Immersive and plentiful storylines, beautiful graphics, decent combat system. I can't wait for the next Elder Scrolls single player RPG. Too bad all they care about doing is expanding that sack of crap cash cow ESO. Perhaps some day."
16759,"2292 hours, rest is history"
16760,"good game you play 
"
16761,"Can't say anything bad about this game it's one of the best :3

I've liked every aspect from exploring and decorating houses, different factions, new locations, and constant lore."
16762,fun
16763,No need to explain....we all know what Skyrim is about :)
16764,it a goed game i like it
16765,very fun game
16766,"Its Skyrim, what else can i say?"
16767,uyee
16768,"It's Skyrim, what else do you need to know.. buy it, it's amazing even after all this time."
16769,zaim
16770,
16771,"Overall pretty decent game, has a ton of mods available and easy to play and get a hold ony a"
16772,"fun game, buy special edition for better graphics"
16773,Absolutely amazing
16774,"Fun, but also the buggiest sack of crap in video game history."
16775,"Addicting game. Sometimes bit buggy, but mostly works fine."
16776,"Chances are, you already own this. 
If you don't care about the story, that's ok, it's still fun (I only bothered with the final boss once)
Mods are always fun"
16777,"No idea how this game is still as good as it is. Graphics are dated, sure, but it's a game I can always come back to when I just want to relax."
16778,"It devours my life, don't buy if you want to have a life outside of your computer.
Also a lot of bugs, a whole lot of fucking bugs."
16779,jeje ta bien
16780,typing here because apparently im not just allowed to leave a positive review. well done steam.
16781,great game still fun to play in 2020
16782,"yes at this point skyrim is an older game, but it is still a playable game. would i recomend buying very copy on every system in existence like some people? no. buy it for whatever system you want. play it. get the dlc give it a round. the SE isnt anything special. but if you want it, get it. either way, skyrim is a 10/10 game. mod it or not, console or pc, cheats or not, its a great game."
16783,"Great game! Lots to explore, huge open map"
16784,good
16785,"One of the greatest games of all time, bugs and all. Skyrim gives me endless hours of fun. What more can I say? I play this game through down to every detail at least 3 times a year."
16786,"Everything about this game is fantastic. The thing that I love the most about it is the open world exploration and the depth of some of the story lines. This game is great for people who like to take games at their own pace and enjoy an immersive fantasy game play. Ive only had the game glitch a couple times - but I gotta be honest, skyrim glitches can be effing hilarious sometimes. I love that the story never really ends, there are always new things to do and quests to complete. My faveorite quest lines are the theives guild quests, the vampire quest line with Serana and the main quest line to kill Alduin, but there are hundreds of others to choose from that are just as fun. I highly recommend purchasing the DLC's that this game has. There isnt a single one of them that hasn't disappointed me."
16787,great adventure game been playing it on and off since release on xbox finally get to play it on pc
16788,I guess it's okay.
16789,I don't really need to add any thing. Who dosn't know skyrim at this point.
16790,If you haven't played this game yet what are you even doing
16791,I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure games and first or third person action. The sounds and music and graphics are very good even today. I have played this game for so many hours and got my money's worth several times over.  I keep coming back to this game over time to start again to try different things. I like this game better than the newer online version because I can save when I want to and pause the game for the constant family interruptions. I wish they would come out with another single player Skyrim game and I would buy it up in a second. One of the things I also really appreciate about this game is all the stories that can be read within books while in game. I'm actually going to play right now after getting off work because it relaxes me and helps me wind down after a long day at work.
16792,
16793,yes.
16794,"Pretty good.


With mods."
16795,"Over 3K hours Skyrim and SE combined. Yes, I love this game and highly recommend it for anyone who loves RPG. I'm old and so many things I can no longer remember yet 11-11-11 release date is still stuck in my brain. This is a rare 2AM hubby calling out 'Come to bed little girl' game. Years of enjoyment!"
16796,"-going to be executed

16797,mind relaxing
16798,"Horse was catapulted from highest mountain in all of Tamriel by a dragon. Landed outside Solitude. Horse's legs snap, it dies. I take no damage. Quicker than fast travel loading times.

Perfect score 5/7"
16799,"Get me off Todd Howard's wild ride, this is great when my internet cuts out."
16800,"I get water glitches, so when I'm outside all I hear is swimming sounds repeating at inconsistent paces. It makes this game unplayable. Other people get this too but not all, so if you do get this then i recommend getting the special edition instead, as it's known to run smoother."

16803,"This is one of the most addictive RPG's of all time. The vast world of Skyrim, it's inhabitants, fauna, flora, not forgetting dragon's takes the adventurer into a realm of intrigue and heroics few rpg's offer. The graphics and sound on a decent system is astounding. Both Morrowind & Oblivion were just tasters compared to Skyrim."
16804,This game has done more to treat my ADHD then any therapy or medication
16805,dragon game yes
16806,Was playing on the PS3 until the load times became unbearable. got the legendary edition on the cheap cheap and it runs and looks way better on PC. Such a fun game!
16807,"A guard fell through the floor, Alduwin died randomly, I scaled completely vertical walls with a horse and I got shouted through a wall. 10/10 would play again"
16808,"Come to talk to an old woman, done your good deed for today?"
16809,"Really fun, can get long some times"
16810,its good
16811,"Really good game, It sucks they removed this version so you have to buy the special edition to get the DLC but it is what it is"
16812,Good
16813,"I haven't even finished the main quest yet, all i do is install mods and run around taking screenshots of shit."
16814,"I LOVE SKYRIM!!! I would play this game on xbox 360, I would play this game on ps4, I would play this game on a toaster, I would play this game on a gameboy advance. amazing game!"
16815,It is amazing
16816,I have put 213 hours into this game and finally about to finish EVERY mission in the vanilla game possible. My room looks like that meme of the guy in front of all the papers on the wall with the red string. If you are looking for a game that will consume you. This is it.
16817,Classic RPG Must have!
16818,Its Skyrim. Why do I have to put words here. Everyone knows its a good game
16819,very good.
16820,"Hey you, you're finally awake.

2020? Pandemic? Did the Imperials drug you when you walked straight into that ambush, same as us?"
16821,AWESOME
16822,it just works
16823,I dont think i have played this game enough to give a proper review.
16824,I don't know what to say about Skyrim anymore...it's pretty good but the mods are what saved it all these years
16825,Just the best game i ever played
16826,"beans
"
16827,"Just a good, solid and endlessly entertaining game."
16828,dragon
16829,"use da fire move, it do be sick"
16830,Its Skyrim..cmon now
16831,3
16832,"Open world!  Enough mods to keep play fresh forever!  If you've played through beforte, ability to advance a new character quickly to get back to the good stuff!"
16833,A little overrated but a good game none the less.
16834,Love it
16835,"When I downloaded this, I ended up playing SE version instead but now I want to play this version, I get errors that Dragonnborn/Dawnguard and Hearthfire .esms were;t part of the original download. Now this content is not listed on the site for site for sale anymore and I feel I have been ripped off with only half of what I purchased and no option to purchase further DLC."
16836,Alduin woulda never came back if I was there. 10/10
16837,Meh... Addictive but sooooooo very unprofessionally made...
16838,BEST GAME EVER (wispers) espechaly because u get to have multypule games at once
16839,It gud
16840,yes
16841,my favorite game of all time not even a contest
16842,"Is very good game,,,, do not recommend >_>"
16843,solid
16844,Good game
16845,"Here we go again... 

Mods for the win."
16846,It's ok.
16847,Still a grand adventure after all these years.
16848,"Look, This game is super fun, really interesting story, and amazing bugs. Best game almost ever. I would totally restart this game over and over."
16849,awesome game that everyone must try!
16850,It's fun.
16851,Good.
16852,awesome game
16853,it good
16854,"Really great game. Still holds up after all these years. If your into fantasy games, Skyrim is a must."
16855,
16856,haha. skyrim good.
16857,yes
16858,This game is just pure love.
16859,"I've played this many times over the years, This game was the best game I have ever played, Along with Runescape, Playing this game gave me a Medieval experience and an experience that I'll never forget. This game allowed me to be whoever I wanted to be and play as whoever I wanted to be, A lot of Medieval games struggle with this, but, Bethesda, never limits its creativity, and with this game, That's a sign, a big sign."
16860,ADD MORE BUGS
16861,I haven't played this game in a long time but I remember it as being fun and challenging.
16862,"The only version of Skyrim worth buying. For most Bethesda games, the vanilla game is meh, but the modding community makes up for it. With this game however, the vanilla game is actually good. That means that even if you dont want to download and install any mods, you will still have a very good time playing Skyrim. Also, the vanilla content in this game is not just good, but there is enough content for hundreds of hours."
16863,JUST PLAY IT
16864,best game i've ever played
16865,kaufs halt einfach meine güte...
16866,Hell Yes! Awesome Game! Endless action and excitement. A World within itself!
16867,"help me
i hate this game, but i'm fatally addicted to skooma. I can't turn the game off as i must fuel my addiction. it's been over a month. help."
16868,"Epic game, amazing graphics. I've completed it, level 22 on Xbox 360. Awesome game."
16869,"bish its skyrim. if you dont like it just from the looks of it then your a hoe but if you've played it and dont like it, shiiiid gimme those reasons so i can remember to not give a f*ck"
16870,"i have all the trophys on ps4
so yes"
16871,it alright
16872,dam good dragon tits
16873,"Timeless game. I have not played in a while, so I decided to revisit utilizing new mods. It has always been entertaining, so far this time is no exception."
16874,This game is hidden on steam but also is where 90% of skyrim mods are made for.
16875,"You already know its good, why are you looking at this?"
16876,If you kill Paarthurnax we can never be friends. Paaz sul! Dovahkiin.
16877,FUS RO DAH
16878,Almost endless possibilities.
16879,"Skyrim is one of the most fun games on steam. Not because of a great story or good characters. But because of how much freedom it gives you. The amount of dumb shit you can do in this game is limitless. The best part of the games isn't even the game itself. The best part of the game is the endless amount of mods. You can add absolutely anything. You want guns? you can mod it. You want sonic? mod it. You want to have a battle to the death with Bears against a horde of marios? mod it. If you want a fun game that you can fuck around with, get this game."
16880,"One of the best games ever made. It came out in 2011. I am still playing it today in 2020. That is mainly because of mods though. Modding the crap out of this game is so fun. There are SOOO many mods. Make it the game you want basically.

Side note: They took The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition off of steam. The legendary edition is the original game with all the DLC. They are now pushing the special edition sales. The special edition is a remastered version of this, the original. The special edition is different. A lot if not most of the mods are still for ""oldrim"" as we call legendary edition. Special edition is more stable and has decent modding potential. Not ALL mods were ported over to special edition though. It will not have all the mods the oldrim has, unless you try to port them over yourself and potentially break your game because oldrim is 32 bit and special edition is 64 bit.

I suggest buying both. The original Skyrim Legendary Edition AND the special edition. You can decide which you like best. It is in no way a waste of money doing so. This game is just good."
16881,Prima!
16882,good game.
16883,"Apparently the story mode goes on even further after you escape the dragon. I wouldn't know I just spend all day downloading lewd mods then instantly deleting them out of regret, just to do it all again next session. I'd say it's a masterpiece but the realistically textured demon vagina mod wouldn't load so eh it's alright i guess"
16884,Absolutely fucking amazing 10/10
16885,X
16886,"10/10
Would rim the sky again."
16887,"its good, you should get it"
16888,Fantastic game!
16889,good shit
16890,"I would absolutely recommend this game. If people love high fantasy and building their own character with no backstory, this is for you, even if you haven't played an Elder Scrolls game before. Elder Scrolls fans might have opinions about how the class system was removed, etc, but I believe the positives vastly outweigh the negatives."
16891,"I cannot rave enough about this game. It is my all time favorite. If you like fantasy, if you like open world, if you like romances where everyone is down for anything, this is the mf game for you."
16892,"i played it on xbox one this version is so much better to mod
"
16893,"STORMCLOAKS!
"
16894,"hella gud
"
16895,It is as good today as it was over a decade ago. GOAT
16896,"It's Skyrim.
Who's left in the world who doesn't know how awesome this game is?
Be advised, however, that if you intent to you the Wabbajack mod list auto-installer- there's only one said list  available for Legendary Edition.
Skyrim Special Edition has way more and probably the better choice for everyone, all around."
16897,"BIIG dragon go *roar* and *fire noises* then he go ""dragonborn lol bub glhf*"
16898,"One of the best open world RPG game i have ever played. Until Elder Scrolls VI, this is the best game for me"
16899,"awesome
"
16900,"RPG which is absolutely worth a long gameplay! Stunning (imo) views, unforgettable soundtrack, amazing plot and exciting quests. You have so much to do, you can choose to stick with main quests or spend hours exploring and doing side quests, it's completely up to you! Not to mention that you can have your own house by becoming a tan of a city of your choice, and as I can remember you also can marry and adopt a child (don't know if it wasn't in DLC but yeah haha). Enjoy your journey through the Skyrim ♡♡♡"
16901,skyrim best
16902,Khajit wishes you well
16903,Its ok i guess
16904,It's legacy Skyrim. Need I say more? Easier to mod than SE in my experience.
16905,"Oped world, you can explore forever and still find new things to experience."
16906,Love it
16907,addictive. Todd Howard abducted my dog and married her.
16908,who plays skyrim without mods anymore?
16909,10/10 The first step on my Tod-damn long road
16910,"this games bad but thats part of the charm! with the right mods it offers just a fun stupid experience that i can relax and play with whenever yk? only complaint is the lady orcs arent big and muscular enough, i dont want to kiss them when they look like how they do, wheres the meat!!"
16911,"Uh, it's Skyrim.  Bought it day one like 9 years ago, now installing on my Surface Pro 7 because running old PC games on a tablet is the sh!t.  Enough said."
16912,"skyrim's fun. played it a LOT on 360 in its vanilla iteration, and i had fun with it. playing it on PC with some mods, and it's a great way to revisit it— if only because it cuts down on the bugs some with the unofficial patch. if modding seems intimidating to you, this game is a great way to start familiarizing yourself with the process; there's a good community on reddit with a really comprehensive guide to starting out."
16913,Best game ever!
16914,NICE.
16915,Great open world with many storylines to play through or just explore
16916,"it's been a favorite fall into game. I've set it down a lot, and always come back to play for a while here and there. it also works well with old crappy computers."
16917,I hate this game
16918,i love this game and played it many time trough
16919,.
16920,"Skyrim? oh ya this is that game the game with the funny's.

How much of an asshole can you be? 
Complete assholetry is possible. Shoot everything on sight. Yes.

Can you just do what you want because you can. Maybe? idk the game is fuckery and does let you do stuff but at the same time has this huge fucking rope around you that just pushes you back in the pool even tho you are flying and can just fly out of the pool but no this game wants to drown you in side quests and dumb shit that will waste your time for 500 gold pieces for you can finally save up to spend 20k on a house that youll build, walk in and leave some adopted children at for the rest of the game."
16921,Another excellent Bethesda RPG.
16922,its an old game but a good one
16923,I'm playing Skyrim since 2012 and its still one of the best games i've ever played.

16926,Immense.
16927,game bad
16928,One of the best games of all time
16929,Even after all these years playing it it's still as enjoyable as ever!
16930,There is no comparison for it. Bethesda created a masterpiece worthy of an HBO series. Seriously. Skyrim should be novel.
16931,I have played this game 7 times through and have 4 open games. I love the time period and the adventure.
16932,"I used to be a Gamer Like You,then i took a Skyrim to the knee."
16933,"GOOD
"
16934,"Great game, great!"
16935,"I go, SOWRD! and then the enemy go AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"
16936,Best RPG ever!!!!
16937,"Doesn't matter what version you get, Skyrim is a masterpiece, through and through, bugs and all!"
16938,Es bakan
16939,it'd be nice if Mods were more user friendly to add into the game. I feel like I'm trying to solve DNA strands over here
16940,Hell yeah HELL YEAH. I was SO pissed when this came out and I didn't have anything that could run it and that all changed in 2014 and I played the whole game through on xbox and then once I got a laptop OH FUCK BAYBEE MOD CITY we got CAPES we got HUNGER we got BEING COLD. I played so much. But hey the NPC dialogue is still super goofy and that never changes.
16941,A must have classic!
16942,We both know this is not the first time you or I have brought this game
16943,Excruciating.  This USED to be a decent game until Windows 10.  Now it is a crash course on how to have a series of seizures and still get nothing done.  Pathetic
16944,hot
16945,Frickin amazing
16946,"its aways a great game

Greatest experience ever.
10/10 would be saved by Macho Man Randy Savage, master Hokuto Shinken, and use ZA WARUDO again."
16948,"this game is just endless fun and it ages like fine wine. since i got my computer upgraded, fps has been through the roof in this game, as well is it's many bugs and script-breaking that makes this game all the more better lol. But seriously, this game is what got me into gaming in the first place and it definitely deserves that recognition, skyrim is an ageless classic that is fun for everyone - adventurers, roleplayers, modders, magic-casters of all kinds... everyone should experience this game at some point. its a yes from me, steam"
16949,My wife left me.
16950,Well it can be very buggy but when it isnt its amazing. The atmosphere. Everything about it. Fantastic  open world experince with a stellar soundtrack. The combat is a bit meh but there are mods that can change that.
16951,"This game is deep in my heart. If you played it, you can understand."

16961,"If you haven't played this game, why not? It's a classic. Like pretty much every Bethesda game, this one is significantly better when modded. The Skyrim Special Edition is definitely worth the money. There's a lot there and the rare addition of player housing in an RPG is huge when it comes to immersion."
16962,"I love this game to death. When this game came out, I was only 7 or 8 years old. I am now 16 and I still play it. Skyrim has so many fun quests, hundreds of side quests, numerous books written about in-game lore, and so much more. The game has such an amazing story, it sometimes even makes me feel like I myself am in the game. Even after years of playing this game, there are still many things that I don't know about the game. I think if you are looking for an amazing open world game with lots of quests, magic, and hundreds of hours of gameplay, then Skyrim is for you. I'm currently downloading this game on my new laptop, and I think I'll continue to play this game for years."
16963,"Iron sword, huh? What are you killing? Butterflies?"
16964,Game is nearly 10 years old and it still one of the best adventure games of all time. Gone back to it during lockdown I can't believe I didn't play that much on release. 10/10 game. Graphics with the HD pack still look great! This and the Witcher best games!
16965,"It's Skyrim, it's amazingly huge, hilariously broken, and is improved by the modding community to heights of customization and fun (and functionality) that the developers only wish they devote enough time to achieve."

This game strengthened my love for gaming, gave me circa 1000 hours of unforgettable fun and it is strange to realize that game came out in 2011 and I play it still in 2020.

17008,amazing and fun to play replay and replay again over and over and the mods are outstanding
17009,the fallout game but with guns B)
17010,"For some god-forsaken reason this version of the game is hidden from Steam's eyes.

Skyrim will always have a special place in my heart. I may have completed it only several times (3-4), but it still amazes me, just how fun it is to fight dragons, use shouts, cast spells and swing your weapon around, even if you've done it a thousand times already.

This game truly has a lot of content to satisfy you with. Just when you thought that there's nothing else to do, you somehow find yet another little quest to complete or a cave to clear from Bandits. And even when you are truly done with everything this game had to offer, there is still some amazing modifications, that add a lot to that replay value. 

All in all, this game is still being played to this day, still being referenced and still being enjoyed. The real reason behind it may be that Todd ports Skyrim to literally every calculating machine ever made [spoiler] Skyrim on calculator confirmed? [/spoiler], or it may be that the game is just... good, fun and enjoyable? 
If you haven't played this game yet, at least give it a try, you can always refund it."

17025,"I mean, I am not sure if there is anyone who don't know what this epic game is and if there is such a person, i strongly recommend this piece of art. It takes you to a place full of immersion and if you enjoy role playing, this game is for you. Sometimes you have to turn a blind eye on a bug/""feature"", but it just is the way it is with Elder Scrolls games and in my opinion, it is nothing to worry about.

It's a never ending story - when you want to enhance, extend or alter your experience, there are thousands upon thousands of mods to be added to the game that put you even deeper into the world of fantasy and exploration.

One of my favorite games of al time."
17026,"One of the best games i have ever played in my life, i recomend it to everyone that enjoyes single player games!"
17027,"Unpopular opinion: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is incredibly overrated and is an objectively bad game. I know, I know: this game is a classic for a lot of people. Its an Elder Scrolls game - it is part of a really famous and great series, and has some impressive traits. The map is massive, has a lot of lore dispersed throughout, and has loads of side quests and locations to see. This game has an absolute mountain of problems and things going against it, though.

It was made by Bethesda (strike one), is BRIMMING with bugs and glitches (strike two), it has unsatisfying and weightless combat that turns into button-mashing slugfests interspersed with pausing the game to root through your backpack for potions (strike three), has an insultingly short main quest-line considering its scale (...strike four...), your character is the dictionary definition of a Mary Sue (.....), it needs community workshop mods and a community made UI and patch in order to even function (...?!), I could go on.

I rate The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim a 2/5: a niche or below average purchase. It barely scrapes past the 1/5 category by not being completely nonfunctional, though I have never played it without a modded UI and bug fix; I don't actually know if this game is fully playable without mods. Aside from that, yes, the modding community does an amazing job for this game and produces some ridiculously cool stuff. I, however, am not basing my rating on what the game's potential is: I'm rating it for what it actually is when you buy it. Any game can become fun if you mod it to the point that it's something else altogether. As is, vanilla Skyrim is just not fun straight out of the box: it is immensely flawed and is sloppily and shamefully handled by Bethesda. I regretted buying it: it's an over-hyped title released by a mean, lazy, and duplicitous gaming company. Do both your wallet and your conscience a favor and give this one a pass."

17036,"It's Skyrim, you love it or you hate it."
17037,So I just started playing the base game which you cant buy anymore on steam after I had beaten it 7 years or so ago. I decided i wanted to make a mage character. This base game has so many bugs but the more beneficial ones are in the special edition version. How do I own a version of this game where I cant benefit from increasing my skills with stealth to literally walking into caverns Ive never known about and having entire caves aggro and murder me with no warning through muffle stealth. Holy fucking shit kid. is this why I stopped playing 7-8 years ago?
17038,Legendary.

17048,"The biggest money maker for bethesda softworks.
It has been released for virtually every platform ever conceived and then some. Even Bethesda knows how ridiculous  their whole campaign is, so much so, that they joked about it, with a smart fridge and amazon echo release. And then they released their joke (kind of, only the echo one) and destroyed their tongue-in-cheek appeal.

But to the game. Do you know, why almost everybody defaults to the class colloquially know as ""sneaky archer""? The reason for the is: the game is essentially a modern shooter with medieval weaponry. That is also my biggest gripe with the game. The propensity to choose that class, in my opinion, is that the rest of the game mechanics don't work, or at least they aren't as satisfying as the shootin' and tootin'.

If you play the ""intended"" way, then this game is pretty nice. A bit lacking in content, but mods change the whole game. I don't even want to include the mods in my review, for that would invalid almost everything that I said. Some may say, that that is the point of the game: To be a platform for the modding community. Nice game, would buy again. 7/10"
17049,"This game on its own: Pretty fracking good.
This game with mods: The game that will be near impossible to replace
11/10 will make a new mod loadout many times again"

17052,"What can I say? You've all heard of Skyrim. Of the memes, the bugs, the mods. But have you PLAYED it yet? I'm telling you, this is the game I use to get people who don't play video games, to start playing video games. It's easy enough for anyone to play and enjoy, and difficult enough to challenge seasoned players. The ability to mod it makes it even better, you get hours more gameplay that is new and fresh all the time. Different mods available for standard Skyrim than for Skyrim Special Edition, but both versions are equally amazing. I own them both and play them both. Just... if you don't have this game yet, what are you even doing? lol"

17090,top 10 ever. top 100 ever. add zeros... still gonna be in that forever list.
17091,"Easily one of the best RPG's of all time. The whole game itself is simple but also very unique. The graphics obviously aren't very good compared to nowadays but it's the scenery that really takes the spotlight with the amazing views you can get by climbing a mountain or just simply looking up to see all the different colors of the sky at night. Combat's simple and easy to grasp and each set of armor/weapons are unique in their own way, the Daedric armor is easily one of the most badass things I've ever seen. The Dragonborn Questline isn't the greatest quest ever but it's still great to play. Skyrim is easily the best game to replay over and over again. I probably have replayed Skyrim 10+ times with a new character and new class. Which brings up one of the best aspects in my opinion is that compared to past Elder Scrolls games and other RPG's you don't need to pick a specific class and stick with it. You can play as a warrior with sword and shield or simply sword(s), you can play as an archer, a sneaky thief/assassin, a mage or you can do a little bit of everything since it doesn't limit you to a specific class. 9/10 Great game, fun stories, awesome experience."

17126,good game mush play
17127,great game lots of fun and hours of play
17128,"This game claimed my life. Really though, it is indeed a masterpiece. The inside lore, story, gameplay, quests, factions, all tie up into one masterpiece of a game. Here is why Skyrim is a must-buy.

Story-wise, Skyrim is a masterpiece. You can meet so many characters with jobs.. sorry, quests to do. Many of them are charming, and some characters have lines that you'll always remember. The main plot is that the character you play as is destined to save Skyrim, but a villainous dragon called Alduin is here to ruin the world. It sounds very magestic, which it is.

The map is large af. Not literally large, but large in content. There are so many places to explore. Big cities, dungeons and caves, monuments, and mineshafts. Some areas have enemies, some are civilized and innocent. You'll always manage to find quests in the cities. It keeps you going for hours.

The quests are also very fun. They go from simple to complex. You could kill a simple troll for 300 gold, or check out a dungeon with many areas to explore. There are also several main and side quests that have multiple choices, which adds to the intensity and immersion. A simple fetchquest can turn into an epic battle with a giant. The quests system is amazing.

The gameplay is kind of clunky, but that's probably because I normally play shooters, so all of this just feels different. There are multiple weapons, armor sets, and enemies. It genuinely feels like a finished game. You can steal horses for a quick getaway, but it adds to your bounty. The witness system is pretty similar to Red Dead Redemption II. All witnesses die, no bounty.

There's also a system of stealing and thievery. You can attempt to pull a grand heist in a big city, or just normally pickpocket a simple folksperson. And when I mean grand heist, I mean it. Throughout free roam with no quests active, you can hop onto a roof and scope out the people, things to steal, and guards. There's a waiting system, so you can test the NPC's schedule. It's quite fun when you reach a higher level.

Probably my favorite feature is the Factions System. There are factions spread across the map, and you can try to join them. But if you join the Reds, you'll probably be against the Blues. I once tried to join a small group of Orcs. I killed them, and to this day, they still hunt me on my normal account. Even after saving the world, I still felt like they're was a villain, so I joined a different faction to take down that side-villain.

The theme song for Skyrim is a masterpiece. It perfectly captures the medieval times. Check it out, it's great. It's a bop too.

Overall, Skyrim is some of the best stuff you can play. You'll get drawn in right from the start and want to beat it the first day. The level of immersion amazes me to this day. It truly captures a medieval time, which the thievery, factions, weapons, and enemies. It's one of, if not, the best RPGs out there."
17129,its pretty good
17130,Pretty good game
17131,First playthrough with no info is magical. You just explore. After a couple playthroughs it gets stale but then dlc and mods can do the heavy lifting. Highly recommend for rpg fans obviously.

17146,its not that great tbh
17147,"by far this was one of there best games they could of ever made that i have played. tho from my understanding this has almost of the best stuff taken out tho. tho for me the only way i could ever play this game was with 100+ mods and with the mods this game because very beautifully stunning with all the texture mods and skin mods to make NPCS faces look far better. despite my lack of 1000s of hrs i played in this game most of the only hours that are shown are the times i played this with steam signed in online, most of the time where i lived at the time ,it did not allow me to have this logged in to track my time. i also have about 100+ hrs with skyrim SE. At the time i was using a dish and had to share it with others..

 Oldrim i still rate better since we always had the looks that skyrim se has, while still looking better.

i never had fun with the main quest it was teeth grind-y. but all the side quest where far better hands down then any of the main quest. i would tell my friend irl if i had any to buy this game, instead of the skyrim se cash paid mods that there pushing.. 
newer systems i would say go with the newer SE option only because u get to have some taste of what having mods is."
17148,Fun ASF what more to say?

17150,Mods to make it playable then its great
17151,"I could spend hours playing this game over-and-over again, without getting tired of it when I was a teen... Feels good to come back to this game once in a while. But this time, I'm installing mods to enhance and refresh the experience!

9/10 - One of the coolest and most alive game that Bethesda has created during their carrer. Dragonshouts, all the way! ^^"
17152,sex
17153,It's noice.
17154,horse need to be fixed the die in the start of a new game
17155,"can't recommend this game enough. best game EVER. there are so many things to do, and so many ways to do it. this is a role model to the rpg genre. solid world building with fantastic stories, plenty of factions and side quests, excellent combat system and character creation. the main problems with this are probably the npcs and bugs, just like in oblivion, the npcs are kinda stupid and not very lifelike. but having more lifelike npcs is something no game has really quite managed to capture yet. it's certainly less noticeable though - in the witcher 3 for example. but this game is GREAT. absolutely the BEST."
17156,Good Game
17157,(see play time)
17158,you fight n stuff
17159,Amazing game
17160,great game

17163,"THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING
"
17164,Very good
17165,"story lines great, but the main reason to play it is the mods"
17166,"It's a great game on its own with a slew of interesting characters, a fun combat system and a beautiful soundtrack.

Still, the modding community is what's been keeping it alive all these years. The add-ons they've made, the upgrades, the bugfixes... They have some real dedication...!"
17167,"I mean, it's Skyrim. Even nine years later I'll boot this guy up and play for hours at a time. There's a reason Bethesda just keeps beating this dead horse into dust."
17168,"Best game ever made, why aren't you playing it?"
17169,Good game.
17170,"So many different ways to play with different characters, paths and creative mods. Ongoing enjoyment."

17186,you need to eat your toes
17187,One of the best open world fantasy RPG's from Bethesda. You will not be disappointed.
17188,love it.
17189,"Are you really reading the reviews for this game? This is Skyrim. If you don't already own it, the spectre of Todd Howard will appear in your room at night and demand that you buy this game. So if you don't own it, buy it. Game's an absolute legend."
17190,One of the greatest RPG's of all time
17191,"The best part of about Skyrim: You can catch bees. The worst part about Skyrim: The game allows players to EAT the bees. While I don't condone such violence against bees, I'm able to separate myself and my reality from this game and have found (less disturbing) non-bee-related activities to take place in, such as become a stealth archer. Good art, good music, and bees. 9/10."
17192,Great game
17193,"worstest game, even worse than Rainbow Six: Siege"
17194,"Skyrim is one of thee best games out there today. With a massive open world campaign to free roaming the streets of Whiterun. There's endless potential in the game it self, let alone the Stream Workshop where you can download thousands of mods to enhance your game-play and expand your time playing Skyrim."
17195,Did not play it for 68 hours just added 68 more to the thousands of hours I spent since it was released. Verdict: it's a good game and it ruined my life buy it for every platform hopefully it comes on ps5 and series x so I can waste more money and time and fulfill nothing in my life
17196,"This is amazing, especially with the amount of mods that are available for the game."
17197,"Definitely a fun game. Be sure to install some essential mods like the bug fix patches, Cutting Room Floor, and SkyTweak."
17198,"Bad interface. 
Short main quest line.
Many 'perks' and 'specialization', but 95% useless.
Most part of game you not see graphical beauties, - just one texture types dark catacombs (play on maximum video settings).


Morrowind and Oblivion much better."
17199,"It's Skyrim
Thousands of Mods"
17200,Hands down favorite game of all time.
17201,Love it. It gets better with mods.
17202,
17203,"Although I have only 85 hours in Skyrim, it definitely is one of my favorite games. The amount of sidequests you can do is astonishing and the modding community just enhances the  experience. Hiding Skyrim Standard Edition to promote the Special Edition is definitely an extremely greedy move by Bethesda but who doesn't know of that already?

17206,Its good
17207,"If it wasn't for mods this overrated and overhyped shallow game would be a mediocre at most and dead! I'm giving a thumbs down because this game without mods, this game is so shallow and boring when in it's horrible vanilla original! I love playing this game purely and only because of mods! Thank God for modders who make better games than Bethesda! After Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, so many gamers and Bethesda fans finally saw Bethesda for the lazy and greedy pieces of dog feces that they were since Oblivion! Go buy Fallout New Vegas and the Outer Worlds by Obsidian! I'd only recommend this game on PC so you can download a ton of mods to make the game so much better! With mods, this game is definitely a masterpiece and one of the greatest of all times! Vanilla, it's easily the worst Elder Scrolls game ever made when compared with Morrowind and Oblivion but has aged way better than those other two and a better game generally! Skyrim is simply not a GOOD GAME! It is like Minecraft in a way!"
17208,its good
17209,"it's a very good game, one of the best rpgs ever made."
17210,Unrelenting Force is tha best
17211,"It's great with mods. You can make it into almost any kind of rpg with mods.

I use a bunch of combat mods to make the fighting a lot like For Honor.
I use several Mod expansions that add areas and quests to the world
I use some texture mods which add lanterns to towns and basic artful cleanup to make the world look great
I use survival mods to make eating and sleeping, and keeping warm into requirements
And I use a reputation system so that NPCs actually treat you like what you are more or less.
There's a mod that makes the cat dialogue accurate, but I don't play cats."
17212,"Although this game is old it still deserves a shit ton of publicity, i first played this  game back in 2014 on my ps3 (yes i had a ps3 in 2014 who didnt) and it was the shit, doing all the dragonborn quests and finding your true power and who you really are."
17213,"Almost 10 years later, this game still one of the best and most rememberable game out there, the mechanics are just something else, some are bad some are perfect! the feels you get everytime you revisit is something special, not quite captured by any other game, The lore is enchanting and fascinating, The gameplay is unique and enjoyable! The community is probably one of the best and most hilarious and helpful community I have ever encountered. The creators and mod makers are seriously really talented people! Making this game and community one of the best in all of gaming. Sure the game let you enjoy all of its bugs and glitches without you needing to search for it but who really cares anymore?"

17223,I enjoy playing. With and without Mods.  Better then the newer online games that want you to spend money and you do not really get to work on your Character.

17248,so many things can happen love it
17249,"Skyrim is one of the best games ever made. Create a character, escape an execution, and then forget everything about the story and wander around the countryside for hours. It's so much fun. Everyone knows the good parts about Skyrim. I'll discuss one aspect of which I wasn't a fan.

Stealth Sniper.

Why do I always end up as a stealth sniper in this game? I plan to be a mage and cast spells to kill every enemy. Eventually, I pick up a bow and realize that un-upgraded arrow hits do more damage than my spells, especially when I am hiding. So, I change my strategy and continue using the bow ""until I am a more powerful wizard."" Except, that never happens.

Maybe it isn't the stealth sniper aspect of the game, but rather the magic system that I don't like. I never feel powerful enough as a spellcaster. Don't get me wrong, there are some very powerful spells in the game. Destruction spells aren't that great, though. They don't scale enough compared to bows. Bow damage can be increased through perks, better quality bows, better quality arrows, potions, and gear. Spell damage can be increased through upping destruction and taking destruction perks. Instead of upping damage, spells usually just cost less.

As a side note, there are some mods that can help damage spells keep up with bows (somewhat.) A few mods even add all-new spells to the game which are much more powerful than their standard counterparts. I frequently find myself spamming the new spells and ignoring the old ones. Who would have thought the modding community would make broken spells? Yeah, I did too."
17250,"We don't need an other review of skyrim, but the stealth, thief, archer gameplay is great.  Would love to see the melee and magic gameplay improved upon in future sequels"
17251,good
17252,"As far as standard sword & sorcery RPGs go the Elder Scrolls franchise is by far one of the best if not the best in the arena. Great story and side stories and so much freedom, but you do need to keep in mind that the game is almost 10 year old now."
17253,so much to do in this game and the atmosphere is breathtaking skyrim will have yo entertained for days
17254,I just finished making my character!
17255,It's Skyrim. There's a reason Bethesda milked this game; it's fucking great. Buy it.
17256,"It's skyrim, of course i'd recommend it"
17257,Immensely fun and tremendously beautiful.
17258,good ggame
17259,Don't give Todd Howard more money.
17260,"You scream, people run. What's not to like?"
17261,Kinda spent 330 hours and maybe more on this game ... And to be honest playing it was totally worth it. So yes do play this game if you are patient enough. Consol command is a bless and its probably the only way to have all achivements but its still a pain in the ass.
17262,"Yesterday the game played and today the game will not play. Same thing happened to all my EA gam,es. It's not my computer, I had it checked out by the two local experts and my computer is ok. So it is either The shit mongers at Microsoft, or someone at steam is screwing up the games as I bought The Elder Scrolls Skyrim V On 8/19/2020 and it played and now on 8/20/2020 it will not play."
17263,good
17264,almost time for a replay
17265,"Honestly, if I spent as much time fixing my real life as I do my Skyrim mods, I'd be in a much better place."
17266,great but a little hard
17267,"fun to mod and fun vanilla too
"
17268,d
17269,"It is good, I have Spoken."
17270,ye
17271,"Starts very well but eventually all the dungeons and enemies become repetitive.  It would have been better to see the game offer increasingly difficult combatants as you level up and more complex scenarios.  Game is very linear in these respects.  Mods make the game more immersive.
You could easily spend 300+ hours trawling through the missions and still have loads to discover."
17272,should've spent this time at school
17273,"Easily one of the best games of all time, no matter how many times Father Todd brings the game back into the light by making it popular and relevant. If it loses it's enjoyment factor from playing it so often, just throw a bunch of mods at it and it'll be just like new."
17274,nothing else to say awsome
17275,For a game that's 10 years old must say i'm enjoying it i came to the party A bit late but wow i'm really enjoying it if you still haven't tried this game out i would highly recommend it cannot fault it one bit
17276,good

17279,Good game
17280,"Like a lot people I bought this game, tried it for ten minutes, then never touched it again for about five years. Upon geting back into it I quickly racked up hundreds (now a thousand plus) hours and don't see any end in sight. A perfect balance of gameplay, graphics, and story with limitless opportunities for adventure available via the mod community. Now I just need to take a break from it long enough to try some of the other games that've been piling up in my Steam library!"

17288,OG skyrim lives under a rock so people will buy the newer version :(. This isn't pretty but it has many more mod options.
17289,good
17290,"The Elder Scrolls is an instant classic with this being one of my all time favorite games. Into open world? this is for you. Into rich lore? this is for you. Into crazy modding? This game is definitely for you. The replayability of this has no bounds. If you haven't already bought this masterpiece, you should. 10/10 Would recommend it to anyone.
"
17291,"When this game came out, I thought nothing of it. It was until the day I played it that I figured I might as well make 11/11 my new personal skyrim holiday."
17292,It's Skyrim. What else is there to say?
17293,yes
17294,"The beautiful thing about Skyrim apart from the soothing music, unique stories, and now aging graphics is the versatility of the player. You have so many choices for how you imagine spending your time-ranging from simplistic mundane tasks like cooking and decorating your home to sneaking around terrifying trolls or goblins in a dark cave. You can hunt, travel, trade, collect trinkets, complete quest lines for various guilds or focus your time on becoming a very skilled character with specific qualities..for example, you might be a professional sneak assassin then suddenly decide you prefer to use heavy armor with blunt force weapons, or even magic. There's so many ways to experiment and experience your adventures by adjusting your characters weapons or skills simultaneously at a whims notice. The other important thing that turned out well is the NPC's dialog which is often amusing, disturbing, or riddled with anger, despair, or praise. So many NPCs are experiences their own unique troubles in smaller quests which are often the perfect balance of easy but still uniquely challenging in their own right. It's amazing how quickly you can go from needing to find a bow and arrow and land a well placed shot before your health runs out, to getting attacked by that pesky ice wraith you didn't notice lurking behind you. In short, there's a ton of content to unfold and the majority of it is readily available to you from the start of the game everywhere you explore and raid coffers and chests. You'll never feel obligated to do anything you aren't ready for, but always find time to try different tasks or go to different places."
17295,I'ts Skyrim.. if you dont know by NOW. then.. well... wow
17296,muito bom eu gosto
17297,pp
17298,Its Skyrim. if you dislike it you're uncultured.
17299,it's alright
17300,"Skyrim probably has the worst writing ever. Lazy game devs were too busy doing whatever they were doing. No matter which way you complete a quest in this game it's all the same. Not the mention the quests are just hey go kill something or go retrieve something for me without anything to it. The only ""fun"" thing(s) in this game are the mods that literally make this game better and killing things. Oh and not to mention I can;t kill everyone. The game stops me from doing so. 150 Hours total may not sound like a lot but in a singleplayer game like this its enough for me to hate it. I used to praise this game to everybody. ""Wow you haven't played SKyrim? you're missing a lot."" Now it's more like, ""You never played Skyrim? Well good for you, it's a boring overrated game."" Not to mention how DULL and GRAY everything is. And the MOUNTAINS!! something that's supposed to attract every player. But at the very top there is what? a bunch of unkillable wizards who do nothing and sit? Or that dragon who does nothing but say boooohoooo alduin bad. Many locations that were added were probably added just to make the game look like there is something to do. I do not recommend this game if you are looking to do quests or have a good time instead, I recommend you play Fallout New Vegas (Even Fallout 3 and 4 which are garbage are better than Skyrim). Playing this game is like looking at paint dry. I would refund this if I could."

17320,"I've played every one of the Elder scrolls games and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Skyrim isn't a perfect game, but its close enough. The amazing mod community keeps it alive, after 9 years its still amazing and about the most fun you can have in a video game. If you've been hiding under a rock all this time, go ahead and get this game. just do it. 5 stars!"

17322,awesome!
17323,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an epic fantasy game developed by Bethesda Softworks. I have been playing The Elder Scrolls instalments since Morrowind. My first game was Oblivion which I played a lot and then moved on to Morrowind which felt an upgrade over Oblivion despite the fact that Oblivion is sequel to Morrowind. Now I got my hands-on Skyrim and played the game here are my thoughts -

1. Presentation:
The game is setup in the northern plain of Skyrim. The graphics and the fantasy settings are good enough. The world is populated with wild animals and various races, however, there is significant less fantasy creatures then the previous instalments.

2. Main Story:
Bethesda have never been good in the story department. Their story is generic. So, the all dragon setting is fine but the world has not affect of the events which makes the story very uninspiring.

3. Side Quests and Factions:
The game has unlimited fetch and kill quests. All you do in side quest is to kill or fetch and then return to the quest giver get some rewards end of the story. Factions have been watered down from the previous instalments. It’s just doesn't matter whether you are playing as a warrior, mage or thieve, you can join any faction and rise to become their leader despite not being good at any of the skill of the faction. It’s a game breaker for me.

4. Gameplay and Skills:
Skyrim has removed the class and star selection and has completely replaced it with jack of all trades selection. Removing the class meant that there is little repayability. Star sign added an additional bonus for class-based selection. But by removing these two its changes the aspect of role playing. Skill system has changed for good except that I need to put points to increase my damage which makes no sense. As I get good in that significant skill set it should increase automatically rather than assign skill points to increase the damage. Gameplay is same that of Oblivion. You click the attack button till the thing in front of you falls down. The gameplay needs significant improvement.

5. Role playing:
Skyrim has nerfed down the role playing aspects of the franchise and made the game into a fantasy exploration open world game with minor role playing elements. Other than the gaining skill and leveling up no other aspects of role playing is present in the game. There are no critical decisions, no consequences and the game world doesn't care about the setting and story elements.

6. Conclusion:
Skyrim is a great open world exploration game where you'll spend hours of gameplay. But in comparision to its previous instalments Skyrim stands between Oblivion and Morrowind. If Skyrim had more of role playing elements, consequences, skill based quests etc. it would been a much better game. 

For anyone looking for open world exploration game do pick up Skyrim and make sure to mod the game to enjoy it much more. But I won't recommend it to anyone looking for a role playing game."
17324,aela snuggles forever <3
17325,"It's Skyrim, if this is a game for you you've probably already played it. Suffice it to say that despite its flaws this game is a classic that has gotten me to replay it many times over.

For seasoned players I will recommend playing it with Requiem, the Roleplaying overhaul. It's a bit tricky to install and set up and there is certainly a learning curve, but this mod is the way to really experience an epic journey through the world of Skyrim."
17326,Warhammer go crunch
17327,"251 hours on this account, well over 600 across all platforms, modded or not the game is a blast and i always come back for some fun fantasy fighting. on this play through ill be a bard alchemist collecting books from across skyrim. very different from my other play through's :) cant wait."
17328,its good
17329,yes
17330,Good game
17331,"This is a great game.  I can't recommend it highly enough and the forerunner to Elder Scrolls on-line.
"
17332,"It is skyrim, The original skyrim blessed upon the world by the one and only Toddy Howard.

If you haven't pick up the game in the several years and re-releases, or are worried by videos of a buggy skyrim then let me, in the words of the almighty, say unto you, ""it just works"".

If you are split between the different versions of Skyrim, it really don't matter,
 because they are the same game, so choose what you like, it will probably be re-released with a new 'version' when the ps5 comes out anyway. Some extra content is not in certain versions so if you want that extra content, do some research to find out which is best for you."
17333,One of the best.
17334,peng game
17335,Great fun game!
17336,Skyrim is fun
17337,"Literally what can I say.

This game, though not my favorite game of all time, is the best video game of all time. It can be fast paced, slow paced, or anything in between. There's consistent fighting, skill trees, crafting, collecting, good side missions, dungeons that aren't grindy. There is no grind in this - its perfect. You can run around with a icy sword in one hand, lightning bolts in the other - send a few draugrs off to hell, then chase after their bodies to get some gold. Don't even get me started on how pretty everything looks. I live in Maine, so boreal settings like Escape from Tarkov or Fallout 4 don't really do it for me in the looks department, but Skyrim is really jaw-dropping (Blackreach).

I've beat this game twice on console, several times in the regular PC edition, and once in the remastered PC edition - and I don't think I'll never play it again.

Well earned 10/10"
17338,"Mods are fun, except the weird ones, those are extra fun."

17340,Interesting open world RPG with more than enough content for its price.

17375,it just works
17376,"It's Skyrim.

All of the characters are soulless and have no personality

The combat feels like two 5 year olds hitting each other with big sticks

The game looks like shit (I get that it was 2012 but Bioshock came out in 2007)

And most of the quests are mindless 


Luckily if you download 300+ mods the game becomes pretty decent."
17377,Thanks Todd Howard
17378,"been playing since 2011

it's skyrim, doesn't need a review."
17379,the best game for modding
17380,"Would not play for more than an hour.
"
17381,"A fantastic game.
100% will get killed by a wolf pack nude, with a fork again!"
17382,One of the greatest RPG's ever made !!!
17383,yes
17384,Skyrim!
17385,do/i/need/to/explain?
17386,10/10 would crash again
17387,"Lots to explore, lots to do... This is definitely a game that you would come back over and over."
17388,i love how there not selling any of the dlc. im sure as shit not gonna buy the special edition to get it when i already bought the game on three seperate platforms
17389,best time consumer!!!!
17390,you cant kill that one annoying kid in whiterun
17391,it is skyrim...
17392,its skyrim... whats not to like?
17393,it's skyrim man
17394,"I've enjoyed Skyrim a lot over the years.
The entire world is just a masterpiece, love the quests, exploring
and everything in between."
17395,its alright I guess need to play more
17396,Awesome open world and wonderful experience.
17397,"dude, its skyrim."
17398,freaking amazing open world RPG cannot appreciate the realism any less!!
17399,"Okay, Skyrim is fun. But nowhere as great as everyone makes it out to be (imo). Only reason I actually played more than the initial story 100% playthrough was the mods and goofing around with them. Then I got bored. It was fun while it lasted and I recommend it though I don't think people who haven't played Skyrim simply don't exist. Maybe you'll enjoy playing it more than I did. 
 
But no way the best game in the world unlike many people say it is, there's a lot of problems. I had my one epic adventure and I liked it, but wasn't good enough for a proper replay."
17400,it's skyrim play it
17401,"I enjoy this game because it has a great story line, beautiful scenery, awesome quests, wildlife, great character development, magic, vampires, werewolves  and most of all... I can collect all the cheese my heart desires"
17402,It's a great game that you can pour hundreds of hours in doing so many different things. There is always different things to do.
17403,"well. its. skyrim.
"
17404,"good game, not much to say"
17405,"[h1] ""There's one they fear. In their tongue, he is 'Dovahkiin'. Dragonborn!"" [/h1]
Whether you’ve played Skyrim or not, you probably know this quote from the game trailer, a friend, media, etc.

I always find Bethesda games to be fun to explore and play with, and Skyrim is no different. There may be bugs, but hey, that’s just Bethesda in general, so don’t expect me to talk about them.
Anyways, when it comes to fantasy RPG games, TESV has been my favorite so far. While this version is hard to find without a google search, it’s just Special Edition without all the DLC, and well, worse graphics, but mods can fix that. Anyways, the story of Skyrim is interesting and the gameplay is fun.

You start the game in the back of a carriage with your hands bound. With you are 3 other men. One in tattered robes, another in Stormcloak apparel, and the third in a fur-lined royal robe, who also happens to have his mouth covered so as not to speak. These men are Ralof, a Stormcloak soldier from Riverwood, Lokir, a horse thief from Rorikstead, and Ulfric Stormcloak, a man who used the ancient power of a Thu’um, or shout, to kill High King Torygg. You and these men are being sent to your execution.
Your cart arrives at a stop, and you get out alongside the others. The men are identified before being sent towards the block. Lokir tries to escape, only to be killed by archers. Afterwards, you are called forward. This is where you choose your race, gender, and appearance. By default, you are a male nord with blonde hair, similar to how Dovahkiin looks in the trailers.
During the execution, you hear a roar. Everyone ignores this, and you arrive at the block. The executioner raises his axe, and…
A dragon attacks, standing over a tower in front of you. You were saved by him, it seems. This is where you get to escape Helgen, being aided by the Imperial Hadvar, or the Stormcloak Ralof. This is where the story begins.
This is only the beginning of the game, and I don’t wish to spoil the rest of it for anyone. If you can’t tell, this game is about slaying dragons, but also saving the province of Skyrim, if not all Tamriel, perhaps even Nirn itself, also! But you are not just any ordinary dragonslayer, are you? No, you are the Last Dragonborn. The fate of all people rests on your shoulders.

[h1] If you wish to purchase the game and don’t want any spoilers, then stop reading this. If you are fine with a few spoilers, you can continue. [/h1]


The name “Dovahkiin” has two meanings, depending on its pronunciation. “Dovah-kiin” means Dragonborn, a person capable of absorbing the soul of a dragon, permanently killing it. There have been several Dragonborns, but you are special. The second meaning of “Dovahkiin” is pronounced “Dov-ah-kiin” (the way I personally say it). This pronunciation of the words means “Dragonkind Born Hunter”, the literal translation. What it really means is “Born Hunter of Dragonkind”, which is the reverse of the translation. Your name carries both meanings.

Your destiny is depicted at Alduin’s Wall in Sky Haven Temple. The Book of the Dragonborn’s prophecy should be read here, as it describes the events of each Elder Scrolls game, including Skyrim, while the wall gives visual reference for the prophecy:
“When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world” (The Elder Scrolls: Arena)
“When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped” (The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall)
“When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles” (The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Tribunal DLC)
“When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls” (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion)
“When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding” (The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim)
“The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.” (The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim).

Your story has been written in stone, and you must save all life that exists. You must destroy Alduin, the First-Born of Akatosh, the World-Eater, once and for all.

Even writing all this got me excited. Again, I love the story of Skyrim, so I really have to recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy RPG games, killing dragons, and a fun story. What I’ve told you is maybe at most 5% of what you can do in just the base game. You can become a werewolf, kill Emperor Titus Mede II, become the ultimate thief, lead the Empire or Stormcloak Rebellion to victory, and much more. All this in just the base game. You can do much more with the DLC."
17406,its fun
17407,"Hours of playtime, I've been playing this game since early 360 days"
17408,"mod it, for the love of God mod it"
17409," This game is FANTASTIC
"
17410,"Funny, exciting, and buggy. There's no game like it!"
17411,It's just the best
17412,Unplayable after playing Morrowind
17413,Very nice game my friends
17414,I THE GREAT ACHIEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!
17415,Very lovely god bless bye x
17416,"REPLAYABILITY
"
17417,10/10
17418,Good game and of course it would not be a bethesda game without all the bugs.
17419,Great game would highly recommend have some great times on here.
17420,"Obsessed! For me, not wanting to have to deal with real life ppl in games, teaming up, brilliant! I spend my days looting every person i meet in the game, slaying dragons and bards alike. Awesome!"
17421,You should try it.
17422,"Yes, it has become a bit of meme over the past few years, being released on pretty much anything that can display video. But, there is a very good reason for this. It is simply one of the best western RPGs released"
17423,"fun game, dont get the goty version"
17424,"best game ever...duh

"
17425,Its Skyrim dude. Enough said.
17426,DUH THUMBS UP/. IT'S SKYRIM
17427,Mod it.
17428,Todd.
17429,Mods
17430,EPIC thas it
17431,It's Skyrim.
17432,"Ok, if you haven't heard of Skyrim by now, you probably have been living under a rock.  First, its a pretty decent RPG game.  The graphics are dated but so is the game.  And if you are seeing this on the regular Skyrim page, do yourself a favor and get the Skyrim Special Edition (SE) version.  I love the combination of an RPG done in a First person perspective.  If you don't like it, back it up to 3rd person with a slight scroll of the mouse or pressing a key."
17433,Just get it
17434,"i have no words, this game is amazing.. i have it on both ps3 and ps4 and most definitely have more than a thousand hours between pc and the two consoles, yet i still find new things to do every minute."
17435,Good game everrrrrrrrrrrrr
17436,"Its Skyrim. If you dont like the game, install mods until you do."
17437,theres no bugs at all i swear
17438,"Have clocked more than 600 hours while connected online, not to mention I owned copies of this game on about every system its been published on so far. Highly recommend, enjoy!!"
17439,"cant go wrong with this
"
17440,
17441,Its A well made game.
17442,"It's Skyrim, like, cmon dude, its skyrim, you know its good."
17443,brilliant.!
17444,Best game I've ever played.
17445,The menu controls cannot be remapped by default. The game is basically unplayable due to this if you use a non-qwerty keyboard layout
17446,"I would like to preface this review by pointing out that obviously, this review is based merely on my opinion.

I could simply just say that ""Skyrim is an amazing game"" (which is something that most people here can agree on), but I would like to elaborate on why:

- There is so much to explore! The quests are infinite (especially if you mod it further)
- For 14.99, the amount of content you're getting, is actually rather staggering
- It's quite the improvement from oblivion (especially the character creation and the dialogue) 
- Various great combat mechanisms 
- Lots of things to do on the game

Then again, you don't need me to tell you all of this. You probably already own the game anyway."
17447,spider pig
17448,Good game u can mod for pet kitties
17449,...
17450,It's Skyrim. 'nough said.
17451,"Oh boy, there's like, a lot."
17452,"I would not call this Elder Scrolls a great RPG, in the form of meaningful choices, dialogue or options besides combat. It lacks the depth of both Morrowind and Oblivion but makes up for it with more breadth. But as an action-adventure fantasy game, it holds its own and is quite the fun, unique and memorable game. If you just want play an action-adventure in a great fantasy setting, then I highly reccomend this game. But if you want true RPG with DnD-esque character, dialogue and world building, then this is game might not be for you."
17453,like all the different ways you can play to beat the game.
17454,probably the best game ever
17455,gud
17456,"It's Skyrim.
You don't need a review. Just play."
17457,"Hey, you! You're finally awake."
17458,"An All Time Favourite. I can play this game over and over. Such a great open world game with many possibilities to choose from, character creation, weapons, magic, dungeons and secrets. The game is really one of the best RPG's I have ever played"
17459,"This little indie hit, from unknown developers Bethesda, has proven to be an absolute smash of a game. Jam packed with content, you'll be playing this for years to come."
17460,hot
17461,g
17462,"After you've played the base content or even most of it, you need to get mods - prob get mods anyway, its bethesda ;( don't have the hearthfire DLC but the other 2 are pretty good - I would say that the dawnguard DLC is the better one.

EDIT: I have played about 1000 hours on another account before making this review"
17463,old game but worth every PENNY awesome game no doubt
17464,awesome game
17465,"Awesome, good gameplay some bugs but to quote our creator, ""They're all features"". Also, It's Skyrim, just buy if you enjoy fantasy, dragons, magic and a new intuitive world."
17466,Todd Howard is the man. I don't care how many years it's been; I'm starting yet another new game tonight. AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.
17467,It's Skyrim. You know it's good.
17468,just play
17469,"Nice
"
17470,BEST....GAME....EVER!!!
17471,"""You've played for 259 hours - Would you recommend this game to other players?""
I dunno... hard to say..."
17472,It's skyrim...
17473,"huge open world where you can play quests as you wish or follow the story line..what is not to love ..so many variables and possibilities..I love this game
"
17474,"Played over 500 hours combined across PS3, Xbox 360, PS4 and PC. Highly recommend.

Also, this game is almost impossible to play without encountering bugs or using exploits lmao"
17475,.
17476,Pretty fun even if you don't get into the sidequests. Sucks that Bethesda hid this copy and made you buy an overpriced shitty remake with paid mods. this original is the bee's knees and i plan to play it many times over
17477,Such a good game. Never gets old.
17478,It's Skyrim
17479,amazing game
17480,"This game is the best game ever created an those who say otherwise should burn in hell (jk) but really it is a game that is built by gods for gods of gaming. This game brings in never ending joy and happiness to my life, if you are ever depressed just play this game and you will cure your depression, if you have cancer just hit ` and type tgm and you are good to go. As Tod Howard said ""it just works"". Buy this game now!"
17481,"Still one of my favorite games to play. It holds up well, and if you're bored, mod the crap out of it and it essentially becomes a new game!"
17482,Best game ever
17483,"I have sunk years into this game, it has amazing mods and the story the first time through is fantastic."
17484,"Normally I prefer games with state-of-the-art graphics, but I was willing to make an exception in this case. You can appreciate the time and talent invested in the game world. One of my favorite parts is the mod support and the ability to customize the experience using the console. If a character or horse I care about dies, no problem. If I get bored with the gear options, no problem. The only complaint I have is the redundancy of the dialogue and characters that becomes more evident the longer I play. But fearless modders can overcome this to some extent as well, so the sky's the limit (pun intended)."
17485,"By the Nine, my favourite game ever. I recommend this"
17486,"""Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn"""
17487,"cool game, has dragons."
17488,Wonderful Games - Great for modding.
17489,BEST RPG SINGLE PLAYER TILL DATE
17490,lizerd bobs
17491,What can u say about Skyrim? Its a classic its buggy as hell; i love it
17492,Best adventure story game
17493,great game
17494,it's a classic with new mods to add as you wish. Endless fun!
17495,Truly a great game
17496,"I have had this game for years and still play regularly. 
So many mods and new paths to try out, Damn I'm gonna be the granny playing this in 40 years lol."
17497,Cringe
17498,duh
17499,Excellent game! Highly addictive
17500,مايحتاج اتكلم عن هالعبه وربي اسطوريه ولكن انصحكم تلعبون الريمستير الجرافكس محسن بشكل افضل من القديمه
17501,"My fave game, im always excited to play it :)"
17502,"I mean, it's Skyrim. Nuff said."
17503,Amazing game
17504,BEST GAME
17505,lots of ongoing quests and side quests
17506,best game
17507,"People say that Fallout 76 is where bethesda stopped being good, but the signs were all there in skyrim. All of their staff with talent, creativity, and ambition jumped ship after fallout 3. Player expression is non-existent. Emergent system-based gameplay is non-existent. Anyone who considers this shallow waste of time to be anything but trash is either inbred, stupid, or doesn't know any better.

but the modding scene is active and the amount of time i lost to community made content is staggering. my advice? torrent legendary edition and play wyrmstooth, falskaar, or bruma. don't give bethesda a cent or the main game the time of fucking day."
17508,A very Fun game that Jirard the completionist would have a hard time finishing
17509,"if you haven't heard of skyrim by now, idk. far as i know everyone recommends this game, minus a select few."
17510,"its an amazing game its been my childhood and i love the series
i recommend it to everyone who likes lore and open world"
17511,"I love this game. There is always something more to do, one more house to buy or another cave to clear out. Good stuff. Come on Elder Scrolls VI!"
17512,funny dragonborn go aaaaaaaa
17513,This is the first game I started with in the Elder Scrolls Story. You can spend hours on this game and still have so much more to play. I'm also loving the DLCs. Definitely a must play!
17514,it's open world and i love how further in the game you get the stronger you become
17515,Simply Amazing!!!!!!!
17516,This is a really great game. I find that there is always something new and exciting to do.
17517,"no
"
17518,It's Skyrim.
17519,is fun very fun yes
17520,iss goo
17521,This game is just the best.
17522,good game best with mods
17523,"The game we all know way to well.. still worth the re-buy all these years later.
"
17524,"So, I'm here primarily because I'm reviewing a bunch of my games I own to kill time. The ones with the most playtime come first and foremost.

Do I really need to convince you to buy Skyrim in 2020, dude? It's not great, no. But it's decent. The world is expansive and you have legitimate impact (or, rather, you can kill off characters and steal persistently present things, which is enough for me). The combat is alright enough, I suppose.

But, if you weren't aware (and I doubt you AREN'T aware), the biggest draw is mods. It's only because of mods that I have nearly a thousand hours in this game. Buy the game and download mods. You will be happy with your decision."
17525,"good


d"
17526,Excellent gameplay and a completely vast world to explore.
17527,yes
17528,"So many mods, so little time"
17529,its okay
17530,not sure if special id better because of mods..
17531,Its simply just an amazing game. One of my first.
17532,game older than fire but 130 hours well spent
17533,"Immersive, very fun."
17534,.
17535,asd
17536,Great game made even better by mods. I bought the pc version only to play with mods after beating it long ago on console.
17537,"what can you say, it's Skyrim, been around 9 years will be around for along time"
17538,nice
17539,At first this game seems shallow experience in terms of combat but after few hours of gameplay and levelling up I found this game very addictive.
17540,dragons
17541,This is the best game ever created
17542,"Special Edition bad, Legendary Edition good. Upvotes to the left"
17543,easily my favorite elder scrolls game!
17544,I mean its Skyrim mod the crap out of it and have a good time
17545,"Very good and immersive ARPG that allows for varied play styles and a large amount of personal control over the pace and structure of the experience. Some quest lines are more run-of-the-mill (e.g. The Companions, joining them you best be prepared for many consecutive fetch quests before getting anywhere with it) but grinding through does feel rewarding. Otherwise, if you're not into that, go for the speedier or more complicated quest lines, the Dark Brotherhood is fascinating start to finish as is the case in many Elder Scrolls titles. I personally enjoyed the scenery much more in Morrowind and Cyrodiil, but Skyrim has some cool environments also, I am just not a big fan of tundras and mountains I guess, but they do still look gorgeous!  Overall not regretting a single second spent in this game."
17546,This game is very fun and interesting! It has many requests and dangers for you to come by. One of the best games I have ever played!
17547,"This game is a great escape from the horrors of rhe real world. Careful, could be addictive!"
17548,nice
17549,da
17550,Pog
17551,great
17552,"Decent game, but suffers from quantity over quality and has lots of bugs."
17553,dragon
17554,Cool game
17555,yes
17556,love the open woeld feature
17557,Great game
17558,"Skyrim is my favorite game of all time. I've hit 173 hours on this steam account, but have played far more previously and have beat the game and it's expansions on Xbox. The main quests are in-depth and interesting, and the side quests can be very different and creative. I rarely get tired of this game, and if I do, it's for a week at the most. Always excited to get back into the story.

One thing that is pretty notable about The Elder Scrolls V is the insane number of glitches. Usually these can be overcome by entering a command, and they often just add comedy to the game.

10/10 would recommend to anyone who loves open world adventures."
17559,Good game yes
17560,"really good open world rpg, a little out dated though"
17561,"guud
"
17562,One of my favorite games
17563,"At this point everyone's heard of Skyrim, it has its quirks but it's a good game. And there are a ton of mods out there, definitely check it out."
17564,"Just get the special edition.
"
17565,with having 654 hrs on pc  pry another 1000 on ps3 and 500 on ps4  30 on  switch of game play I highly recommend this game
17566,"deezznut
"
17567,Really good game my goal is to get over 200 hrs over time
17568,The thing about The Elderscrolls series is that you dont even have to play the story line to have fun... run around and pick off bears and bandits. spelunk countless hundreds of caves and forts. taunt the giants until they send you into orbit. lob fire and ice at random goats or deer. or just get wasted with the dude in whiterun tavern and end up in a lot of trouble...
17569,10/10
17570,"I've played this game for 394 hours, and only now has Steam asked me to leave a review. Yeah, it's a pretty fun game. It's even better with mods, but it feels like a complete experience even without them. The world is open to you in an unparalleled way for its time (and for many years after, as I'm writing this in 2020), and without a traditional ""class"" system you can become whatever character you'd like to be. Enemies throwing fire spells at you leave you completely blind if you're in first-person perspective, but nothing is perfect. This game ages like good cheese, and I don't have any doubt I'll start it up to spend more time in the land of Skyrim another nine years from now."
17571,This is well beyond a great game. This is what you want to see in every game you buy.
17572,"Spretty good. Best moddable game of all time. If you are looking to waste time, look no further."
17573,"Endless fun and adventure, especially with mods. You may spend more time modding than playing. This game will crash a lot, but that's part of the experience."
17574,Best Game
17575,amazing game
17576,"It's Skyrim

What more do you want?"
17577,"If you have not played this game yet, please do. It would be the best decision of your life."
17578,.................................game
17579,"What I like about the game is you don't actually have to do any quests if you don't want to.  There are so many mods for this game on nexus, sexlab, and others to keep you entertained almost indefinitely. What I don't like about the game is the intricate balance you have to maintain to make all the mods work. This is also an old game and with the original textures and gameplay, it's primitive. The special edition game I've played briefly but my main mods don't work in it, so it's a nonstarter for me"
17580,gay
17581,"very gud yessssss very very guuud
"
17582,its awesome.
17583,its skyrim
17584,<3
17585,Fun
17586,Everything.
17587,"(I know, I'm a bit late to review this) The best RPG out there (only KCD comes close). 
My top complaint is that the world npcs+loot level-up when player levels-up, so the Morrowind feeling of true accomplishment is lost (there is a good-enough mod, but it should have been a difficulty in base-game). 
Second most important issue for me: no random start option (again, there is a mod for this as well). Would be awesome to have them in TES6. 
Third issue: definitely poor graphics for 2020. 
Fourth: i never liked human-like lizards and cats (ever since Morrowind and Oblivion), so I like they are not so common in Skyrim, but still I would love the game more if they were not included. The WOW lore, instead, I like it much more."
17588,No comment needed. Legendary game.
17589,love it
17590,it just works ....
17591,"ONE OF IF NOT MY FAVORITE GAMES. i LOVE this game and every aspect of it- story and gameplay is just awesome. you can literally do anything from entering Sovengarde, or Apocrypha, to building a house or marrying someone. the map is HUGE (+expansions) and there is so much to explore and so many mysteries unsolved. this is a great game and i first encountered this game on the xbox 360 and i have adored this game forever 10/10"
17592,One of the best games
17593,Recommend purchasing if you want to get some practice in before it comes out on PS5.
17594,haha swing sword and lightning hand
17595,"Hey you, your finally awake!"
17596,Nice expandable and open world.
17597,"in love with this game one of the best open world games of today, cant go wrong with a little dragon hunting with the dragonborn."
17598,The mods and modding community make the game awesome. Check out sinitar gaming for really great mods to add to this to complete the experience.
17599,good
17600,"definately id recommend playing this game! the story! the graphics!
everything in this game is just amazing! and you can play it even on a potato!
even intel hd 3000 will give you a 40+fps"
17601,Aged like milk ok with mods
17602,do you get to the meme district often
17603,originally i put in 959 hours in this game.
17604,"all i to say is it,s a very good game"
17605, The variety and open air concept to go where I want /
17606,"People complaining about the bugs in this game is like complaining about milk with your cereal.
The ""bugs"" are literally a feature 

Buy this...
Maybe ill give you a sweetroll if you do ;)"
17607,It is good game.
17608,This is by far my favorite of all time! the combat is great and the open world aspect just makes the game fun for everyone! 10/10 would recommend!
17609,Are you really looking at reviews at this point? Just get the damned game already. There's a reason it's still wildly popular a decade after release.
17610,"""A buff guy climbs a mountain to meet a bunch of mute senior citizens, and learns how to channel his inner AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"""
17611,"Skyrim is love, Skyrim is life"
17612,asd
17613,peepeepoopoo
17614,yeah
17615,its cool
17616,Good game
17617,It's good.
17618,amazing
17619,it awesome
17620,It's Skyrim so yeah.
17621,"If you don't actually know what skyrim is, what are you doing

Stop checking the reviews, the game is broken but playable

Go buy it

Now




God bless you Todd Howard"
17622,doesnt everyone own this
17623,"yes
"
17624,good
17625,"Epic
"
17626,"Always a classic!  Given that between my brother and I, we have nearly 500hr's playing - both modded and unmodded - I have to recommend.  The game itself still has some glitches and it's no longer being patched, however, there are plenty of mods that fix and improve gameplay which balances that out for me."
17627,This was fun played a few hours on pc. 10/10 still buying it on every console i own.
17628,Nice Game
17629,"A very enjoyable, immersive game."
17630,"Game
"
17631,"awesome and immersive
"
17632,better than elder scrolls online
17633,Its master piece of todds creation
17634,"seeee
"
17635,"Best game I had ever played, even the things wrong about the game make it better."
17636,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."
17637,"You bought this game only because of the mods.
And so did I."
17638,good game
17639,So yes I only have 236 hours into the game and yes that is not much for a game like this but I played arround 300 hours on PS3 aswell. We can all agree the game is amazing the only problems are the little bugs but there is nothing the modding community hasn't fixed yet. In short an breathtaking game noting less than a masterpiece.
17640,is good
17641,it's better than fallout 76
17642,epic
17643,it got magic an stuff
17644,skyrim
17645,Naruto is my fav anime.
17646,Simply the best
17647,Wish i had this game on steam before i sank thousands of hours with mods to flex on playtime number.
17648,Amazing Game. Replay Value is outstanding
17649,Veri god game
17650,it's pretty good
17651,Very  good game.  Lots of things to do and explore. ton of hours of entertainment
17652,"Game does not run anymore (I have no active mods and the base game on low quality won't even run) My PC has the specs to handle ultra quality. Since the game has been hidden, I am completely unable to use this product."
17653,Its skyrim. What else is there to say.
17654,"I got this game years ago, and I still play it to this day, I freaking love this game and it is one of my top 10 favorite games of all time! <3"
17655,Waiting for the Apple Watch version
17656,peng
17657,Solid game and even better with mods. Purchased and played on multiple platforms. Hands down the best on PC.
17658,"Modded Skyrim has consumed more of my life than I would like to admit. No other game has made me feel as divisive about its quality: it exists as both a bad game and a great game, and I recommend at least giving it a shot. Like an addiction to fast food or the need to regularly visit a dominatrix, it hurts, but it hurts good."
17659,Forever will love this game.
17660,"Skyrim is a game that is very old and very well known, it's reputation is for excellent world-building and the potential that it's environment and mechanics give for the player to create their own story. Overall, the game is a solid experience and deserves to be played to a decent extent. Any RPG fan will gain from the time spent in this expansive world."
17661,"Skyrim is a creative and fantastic free roam RPG style game based in a medieval world. There is a main story line to follow but several varieties of side quests or exploration and even building your own home and setting down with a spouse and adopting kids. Create a character, choose what skills you want to improve, craft, fight, interact with NPC's and take quests and jobs. Excellent game even with some occasional bugs and glitches. Worth a gamers time!"
17662,Perfect... If modded :)
17663,"pros: dragon fights
Cons: getting pissed when the mods dont work
"
17664,wow yes
17665,nice game
17666,good game
17667,"Dragon-slayer simulator is very fun. Bethesda is known for not fixing certain bugs..

A must play however! 9.3/10"
17668,da best
17669,"I dont really need to say anything. Its Skyrim, it set the standard for RPGs and still holds up to date with the help of a few mods.
"
17670,very fun
17671,its good *still*
17672,"Thanks for Skyrim, Bethesda!"
17673,Very dank game
17674,"well, it is a skyrim,"
17675,Skyrim is one of the greatest games of all time
17676,i like
17677,It's OK
17678,"Arguably one of the best games every made!
Open world play allows you to craft your character how you want to and with extensive modding you really can play how you want to.
Modding has allowed this game to have so much re-play ability. As well as (thank you modders!) giving you the chance to update all the textures so the game looks stunning on modern graphics cards.
If you're an RPG'er and action player, explorer, deep emersion player then this is for you. In fact this game is for everyone!"
17679,"IS GOOD
"
17680,"Hey you, your finally awake.

"
17681,"First thing I saw when I spawned in was me flying 500ft into the air. I clearly don't see why braindead troglodytes praise this broken game instead of Skyrim SE. I guess they like flying into the skies like a dragon, literally."
17682,"Large world, hours of storyline, crafting system, soundtrack, excellent franchise."
17683,"Does'nt need""any saying"
17684,lit shit
17685,"Tons  of aggravating bugs. Super easy to get lost while doing a quest and end up wasting a ton of time getting un-lost. the game is very frustrating to play. However, good game for it's time 2011. Definitely not now. Super out dated and rage inducing to play. Quests don't work how they're supposed to. NPC'S glitch or die which forcibly fails questlines. the dungeons are repetitive. The quests are repetitive. Delve into a dungeon grab an item or kill a person rinse and repeat. Achievements bug out and don't pop. Some achievements glitch to where you have to restart your character completely if you saved over the bug. I could go on and on with complaints but my final statement is... a great game FOR IT'S TIME. Which was 2011. playing in 2020 definitely not worth it. With special addition combined i have 600 hours on skyrim."
17686,It just works
17687,I mean... it's Skryim. Its the Star wars of the video game universe. Re-done and re-released and we buy all of them. Looking at you George Lucas... Did Han shoot first?
17688,Good
17689,"yes
"
17690,yes.
17691,Hell yeah brother
17692,"I didn't believe the hype at first but then i dove in and i've been hooked ever since, 100/10 will play always"
17693,Great game! Beautiful environment!
17694,"Great music, fun stories, lots of time playing."
17695,"If you want to make Skyrim nextgen game of 2030 I recommend modding this one and not SE.
Check Sinitar Gaming Discord for guides, the dude is amazing!

thank god for mods :D"
17696,"it's pretty good, i guess."
17697,"Hands down one of the best open world RPGs in history. Great visuals, great music score, great stories, great character customization, and great replayability. If the original game isn't enough for you you can download mods from Steam Workshop or the internet. Skyrim has one of the biggest modding communities. The game is from 2011, but it's still very popular and i still played alot - be it returning players or new players."
17698,My character's name is OogyBoogy and he is an Orc. I primarily use magic and I have saved many villages. It just feels good to do my part.
17699,"How about including this game's DLC in sales? With all the hours people have put in, to completely abandon the prime version of your most supported product? Kinda sucks, man."
17700,This game is incredible but i just couldn't get the start of the game to work
17701,"Open world games tend to be my favorite, though I don't have a ton of experience. I've had Skyrim in my library for a good few years now and never really played it for more than a half hour at a time. After having a few weeks of working full time I decided that I deserve a break from Corporate culture, and gave it another try. Let's just say I can see why people enjoy it so much. Bethesda, you truly do make some of the best games."
17702,Just love this game i wonder why id din't got it much  MUCH sooner
17703,This may be the best game Bethesda has developed so far. Even in 2020.
17704,"i used to be an adventurer like you, but then i realized i was addicted"
17705,Great game and a great series...
17706,:)
17707,"This game is pretty fun, it has a good story line, Barley any Glitches and you can fight monsters ect. each thing has its own unique quest, you also get to customize your character through the Variety of the game! I would Recommend this to the others if your into doing quests and battling monsters."
17708,"This game has shook the fabric in reality. No longer I'm binded by simpleton concepts such as cold weather.
i have learned to embrace my nord heritage and blood. With the freshest skooma and moonshine imported from Elsywhere ,i became free from the shackles that have binded me. 






So yeah i couldn't pay rent so i became homeless in a russian winter."
17709,"Excellent game, even though it quite old. Still a great game in 2020."
17710,Listen. This game is pretty much immortal. Just play it.
17711,"It is a great, extremely fun game, but people hold it in high regard as ""one the best RPGs of all time"". 

It's not.

The RPG mechanics are watered down or non-existant. The class and attribute system was gutted. There are very few quests that allow you to take multiple paths. Essentially zero consequences to your decisions.  

The only things I remember that made this feel like an RPG was when I could choose to wipe out the Dark Brotherhood after they abducted me, the choice to kill Paarthanax, and that guards react to what you've accomplished in the world."
17712,"Not best Rpg but good Open World and ""MODS"" make it unlimit play.
Game end when you not want to play."
17713,"My issue is that he always asks if you've been to the Cloud District or whatever, but like HALF of the city is the Cloud District. And that's where 90% of the quests come from too."
17714,"I mean it's SKYRIM.
The 3rd most Critically Acclaimed Game [b]EVER[/b] after [b]The Witcher 3[/b] and [b]The Last of Us[/b].
10/10"
17715,...
17716,"Simplified compared to previous Elder Scrolls games, but a beautiful world that's fun to run around in."
17717,Good game.
17718,"The amount of love put in to the game
"
17719,"Across multiple platforms I've sunk over 3000 hours into this game. It's a black hole of immersion and modding and adventure and honestly I wouldn't trade a second of it. 
Todd Howard, you got me good."
17720,its skyrim
17721,gut
17722, I played it cracked for thousands of hours as I had no money. I bought it now out of respect as I doing much better. A game that made history.
17723,probably best game ever
17724,"It took me a few tries to really get into it, but once I did I was hooked. I personally put more time into the console versions, but this game is fantastic wherever you play it. Not perfect, since there's always gonna be bugs and glitches in a game this big, but you don't even notice because of how much fun you're having exploring and discovering the world."
17725,"One of the worst RPGs but still a decent game. Game is fun to explore, especially the first time. Wish Bethesda would polish their games. Mods make the game really good though but otherwise its pretty meh.
Edit: STOP RELEASING THIS GAME BETHESDA. IT'S LITERALLY ONLY GOOD FOR MODS, STOP FUCKING UP THE MOD SUPPORT"
17726,Old game but it's still great.
17727,"Skyrim is Skyrim. There's a reason Bethesda keeps releasing it, and thats cause its good enough to keep selling. Its a buggy mess at times, but the lore is some of the best out there and the exploration and combat still mostly holds up"
17728,Just buy dlc codes online and activate on steam.
17729,Pretty good I think
17730,fun
17731,7.8/10 too much water.
17732,It's the quintessential open world RPG. Classic
17733,goat
17734,nice
17735,gr8 game
17736,"AMAZING GAME!!!!
Over my entire time of playing games I've always found my way back to Skyrim and the hours I have in game on steam do not cover my time on console which has to be close to 2000 hours in-game."
17737,"With mods, infinitely replayable and anything is possible!"
17738,quack!
17739,potion of mini shield
17740,.
17741,skyrim = fun
17742,"several years old and still going strong, massively recommended"
17743,Nice
17744,great game
17745,==
17746,"Really fun, easy to start and play, easy to mod, very popular so lots of really good online help at your finger tips... What's not to like?"
17747,epic
17748,"good game but just buy special edition, it will save you money in the long run"
17749,Do I need to explain?
17750,no comment
17751,"Fun game with loads of hours of gameplay.
Large variety of Mods as well if you fancy changing it up"
17752,"Very good, obviously. its infinitely replayable playable with mods"
17753,I shouted at a karen and she flew off the face of the earth. 9/10 would love doing that irl.
17754,Mods keeping the game alive 10/10
17755,"Great game play and storyline! Even just running around to explore is fascinating, there is always something else to discover."
17756,
17757,idk why I keep playing this old ass game but I still love it
17758,I used to think was a great rpg until I played actually great rpgs (cough Witcher cough cough).
17759,"I play both Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition.  I mod the heck out of special edition, but the original skyrim I keep pure and love both!  I only have 46 hours of play time on PC, but on my old Xbox360 I played the game so much that it actually broke the original disc.  I had to go to gamestop and buy a new disc just to put it on the hard drive of my xbox360."
17760,"Amazing RPG, has some bugs though to save often to lessen the annoyance of crashes. Use nexus mods to enhance your experience the steam workshop mods aren't nearly as good."
17761,"Played a bit, pretty fun even now."
17762,ye
17763,it good
17764,"AMAZING GAME OVER THE YEARS!!!  This game is still fun.  I have played it through numerous times on different systems.  The game is just graphically pleasing, but the modding community continues to amaze me and make the game and lore even more amazing.  If you haven't already checked this game out, DO IT!!!"
17765,Pretty good game. better with mods
17766,good
17767,"It's a staple game; if you haven't played it yet, it's still not too late and probably never will be. It's so unique I can't compare it to any other game. you have total freedom to roam and be whatever you want to be at any point in the game. It's insanely popular for a reason. You aren't constrained to one mission or questline, you can literally do whatever you want and go wherever you want, including through walls and floors depending on which glitches you run into."
17768,It's skyrim? Do I really need to actually review it?
17769,Very Naice
17770,"This game is easy to get lost in. And for someone who suffers from depression AND anxiety, such as myself, getting lost in an alternate reality can be better than therapy!"
17771,"Since the wee hours after midnight on November 11, 2011...Skyrim has held on as my favorite game of all time.  It not only heavily influenced other games of its genre but also games that were not quite in its genre as well.  Beyond the epic gameplay and stunning graphics of its time.  Skyrim similar to former Bethesda games (ie. Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas) allowed pc users to mod the game.  Skyrim, Skyrim Special Edition and later Skyrim VR gave the PC gamers the tools to not only enhance and improve the game, graphics, etc, but to add new worlds, create armors, create their own custom npcs and create and change just about anything that they wished of the game.  

Many years later that opportunity came to the Xbox ONE and to a lesser extent to the PS4 gamers through their version of Skyrim SE.  Because Skyrim and Skyrim SE allows the use of controllers, I feel that it is still much more enjoyable and more fulfilling on the PC, as many of the PC mod authors were knocking out mods since the days of Morrowind and they have libraries full of mods to choose from for the various versions of Skyrim.  You would undoubtedly benefit greatly from these mods as it would update Skyrim and keep it competing head to head against many of the games that came out in the past 9 years.  I know no other game that I could honestly say that about, as I have seen talented former game developers and mod authors create entire new, independent games directly from this Skyrim 32bit game that you are thinking of purchasing.  Such games such as Enderal is its own separate game, that was created/modded from this base Skyrim game.  So, in truth, you wouldn't just be buying the great Skyrim game, but you would be given the opportunity of playing various other games and styled new worlds by talented modders for free!  This has also been going on consistently with the newer incarnations of Skyrim as well (Skyrim Special Edition and Skyrim VR).  Not even Fallout 4 can boast entire new games and worlds as Skyrim could (at least not yet)."
17772,I took way too many arrows to the knee.
17773,It's the most fun you can have going on an adventure by yourself/
17774,"The quintessential RPG. Choose to be good, evil, warrior, mage, or rogue. drink 50 health potions while fighting bosses. Drop the fifth set of armor from your inventory because you found a sixth set that is slightly cooler.

Break the game with alchemy. Enchant your weapons and armor with powerful magic (Morrowind was better). You will sink tons of hours in here. Enjoy the stay."
17775,Yes
17776,"Love it. Even years later, I still play and love it."
17777,This game took my social life from me.
17778,"its skyrim what else is there to say, they made this game a thousand times for a reason"
17779,spells and swords good game i like
17780,"fun for all ages, probably the first game i've ever played"
17781,"Special Edition was most unstable and kept crashing.
This game runs butter sweet."
17782,even worse
17783,"This is still one of my favorite games even after several years. And it is still best on PC. It is derpy and fun, but still has lots to offer someone looking for decent game-play and story in a single title."
17784,"I mean.. Skyrim... Dragons, Psuedo Vikings, Mods for a BTGGF."
17785,"This is one of games that .. i dont know .. let you in their unverse and wont let you comeback in reality back .. 
Skyrim sucks you in that never ending world of new missions , stories and quests , really overtime it is pretty time consuming .. its like that .. when you enter to finish one mission and exit to do homework or something you do 7 more missions and you always get lost in time and reality . I would recommend this game to every man who is bored or dont know what to do with alot of time free .. 

Graphics are great , i Cant believe this game come out in 2012 i tought it was like 2015 idk why .. 
Graphics 10/10 for 2012 .. Compared to todays graphic technology 6/10 
Story 10/10 
Music 10/10 
Optimisation 8/10 Very small problems and they can be fixed . 
Bugs 5/10 .. Alot of Glitches and bugs .. but they can be fixed too easy . 
Gameplay 10/10 
Controls 10/10 

Thats all from me .. this is my opinion about this game ."
17786,DO NOT KILL THE CHICKEN
17787,"Amazing!
"
17788,yarn
17789,"Found a view mods, played it for a while."
17790,"Thanks for the 200 hours Todd, I modded and modded and I never looked back"
17791,"Graphics: Very much good
Gameplay: Very much good
Story: Top tier for sure, and there's a couple of them. 
Overall: Epic gamer moments.
Mods: Allowed, there's too many of them but we need more.
Crashes: Happen every so often. Kinda annoying if the last time you saved was 5 years ago. 
Bugs: Shit sorry i meant Features. 
Studio: Bethesda.
Actual overall: Great game. The story is really good, the graphics are pretty good for a 2011 game, and mods for graphics often made me go *Wow*. It's really all you can ask for. Whether you like Runescape or First person shooters, This game has it all. Except it's first person swinger cuz u got a sword, but you can also go with bow and arrow, magic, etc. I've been playing this game since it was out, and I could not explain how nostalgic it feels to play it again now, and how good the game still is even if it's so old. I love how the side quests also teach you some lore of the game. You can literally buy your own house. 

Although the game crashes sometimes, there's a lot of bugs and glitches, the game will still make you forget about reality. You'll never have an experience like this game again. It can get infuriating at moments, like when you're battling 500 enemies at the same time. 

If I had to rate it on 10, I couldn't, because it's so perfect it'd break the scale."
17792,cool innit
17793,"Kind of buggy sometimes, but overall a good game.

When itthe game gets a bit boring, you can install mods and/or the DLC's - and trust me, there is ALOT of em."
17794,so
17795,"This is an amazing RPG. If you are into single player games and need one that goes on for hours with a lot of side quests, this is the one for you."
17796,poop
17797,"Good game
"
17798,It just works...
17799,Amazing game.
17800,Legendary game
17801,"What's there left to say about Skyrim 9 years after release?

It's definitely a good game, if excessively streamlined compared to previous Elder Scrolls titles.  The Vanilla game is buggy beyond belief, but that's just Bethesda's incompetent coders at work.

Still, there's a lot of fun to be had with a few stability mods installed."
17802,"Best version of the game. I even prefer the game before updates, the only benefit of the updates is the official fix for some bugs, but the game seems less fun. If I could, I would download the old pirated version and avoid the updates, but most of the links to bug fixes made by the fans are down due to the long time that has passed, leaving me with no patience to do so, but some day I will, and the original version will be sleeping here forgotten.

Edit * I was trying to play it again, but the ""speed"" wich attacks and moves responds to our commands are really unsatisfactory. I really hate to be forced to upgrade game and come shit like this, ruining the gameplay the way I liked. The dev's objetive is to fix bugs, not to ruin the gameplay. Now the gameplay feels so... I don't even have the correctly words to describe. The movements feels less dynamic, less free, it's like there's something holding the character, I hate it. For that kind of reason I love piracy. I bought it cause I really liked the game, but the new version sucks, and I have no choice, I can't simply download the original old version of the game, I have to play the shit version of it. The bug fixes are good, but most of the rest sucks.

The new versions of the game has a annoy input lag and feels less responsive. I really wanna go back to the old versions."
17803,"Skyrim is definitive. The scenery is beautiful, the score is moving, the story line is complex and satisfying, even the NPC companions are interesting."
17804,:)
17805,Very fun until you take an arrow to the knee.
17806,g0oD
17807,one of the best games with massive replay pathways
17808,"I started in the Elder Scrolls franchise with Morrowind - it was a huge playable game area with plenty of content and good graphics for its time.  Skyrim is also a large game, graphically even better than previous ones, with a much improved physics engine.  Not quite the biggest explorable world, but with the mod support it can actually be pretty large indeed."
17809,"A very fun open world game that has almost limitless possibilities and things you can do. Hundreds of amazing quests, amazing storylines, amazing lore, a vast amount of locations to explore, hundreds of characters, and much, much more! Definitely my favorite game of the last decade! I highly recommend this game to anybody who likes easy but entertaining puzzles and large map open world games! 5/5!"
17810,its a very good game somehow it always pulls you back
17811,GOOD
17812,"All the Elderscrolls games are amazing to play - with mods especially. However, mods are also the biggest problem when they cause errors or don't work initially. It takes some patience and problem solving to properly get the game how you want it, but once you're done, it can't be better. Until the next batch of mods come out at least. XD"
17813,"good game i can ever finish it tho
"
17814,"I've played this on xbox way before I got this for pc and I'm still finding new things to do. With the many many quests and the dlcs you can never run out of stuff to do. Each new playthrough will be different depending on what race you choose, what order you do quests, what sides you take, etc. Even if you get bored with the regular game, there are so many mods out there from our awesome community. Want to rebuild Helgen? Check. Want to change the UI and game mechanics? Double check. Want to have flying Thomas the trains breathing fire in your face? We got that too.

This was the first game that REALLY got me into gaming and it still is alive and doing well for itself. That shows how great a game it really is. I will keep coming back to this game until the day I die, and will probably keep discovering new things then too."
17815,"Just. don't. its a time sink. you will never finish this game no matter what you do. i'm starting my third playthrough. if you have depression, it will become the only thing you do and it will ruin you."
17816,it's an open world game that let's you decide your actions. each choice has different consequences & the world reacts to your decisions
17817,"good game

i like"
17818,I like it
17819,It's okay I guess.

17829,AWESOME Graphics!
17830,Nice
17831,"es bueno 
"
17832,This is amazing game with lot of stuff to do. Even if u are bored u can simply dowload some mods and play again with fun and still manage to do main story of the game.
17833,yes
17834,Lots of fun for chill adventures
17835,"I have only played this game for  hours (that is miniscule compared to other people) but I can tell you the game is AMAZING. The exploration, the story, the music everytihng is amazingly done. I didn't buy this game for quite a long time becouse I heard that the combat sucked but iff you play as an archer or a mage then there aren't any issues with it."
17836,i like it
17837,Fun game many ways to play
17838,Best game ever ?
17839,Spend days modding the game to play just one day. 10/10 would mod again
17840,Recommend forever but get the special edition!
17841,"It's the best game in the world!!!
"
17842,sehr gud 1/2
17843,Thats the most modded game i 've ever played in my entire life and most cancerous one
17844,Awesome game. Would definitely recommend for others to play.
17845,its skyrim
17846,"It's... Skyrim. I mean, duh."
17847,"I may have bought it... 





a few times...




too many times..."
17848,"It's Skyrim
It's trash
Steam wont stop bothering me about this so here's a review
Get some mods that fix the game, actually get all the mods. Get so many mods that it's not Skyrim anymore.
Get some graphics and ENB mods, get some weapon and armor mods. Get a perk mod. Get some overhauls. Get some quest mods. Get some NPC mods. Get some porn mods. Get some bug fix mods. Don't get any porn mods. Dear got please don't get porn mods. Jesus what the fuck is this. Why is there so much porn for this game. What the fuck.
For it's time it was a good game I guess. 7/10."
17849,"If you don't play this game, Todd Howard will eventually find you and force you to cross the Imperial border."
17850,"Great game, bled to death and milked for all it's worth. ok now that we got that out of the way let's talk about how steam is an asshat of a company. I played the game on a friend's account and thought that it was really fun, so i save up $20 (because i have no flexible income) and then buy it. NOT BUT 2 HOURS LATER, THE WHOLE GAME AND THE DLC (I got the unlisted $20 one) GOES ON SALE FOR $13. WHAT THE @!#%. Not sure if they'll give me a refund on the grounds of ""your game went on sale and i bought the expensive on"" but probably not. overall 7/10 there's a lot of features that could have been added but they are added through mods."
17851,BEST GAME EVR
17852,"big dragon game
"
17853,scooby snack
17854,only game ive ever been able to not play for years and come back and have as much fun as i did when i first bought it i love this game
17855,Skyrim is a good game that gets gooder if you mod it.
17856,this game is fun
17857,This game is amazing !!! I can't stop playing it...
17858,"While the gameplay is very interesting offering a variety of different ways to play as many different and interesting character, the game isn't quite the same without Shadow the Hedgehog. There was really no reason for him to be excluded from the game, and it was a fatal mistake as the game is left as a husk of sonic's old glory with sonic just splashing around in puddles. final score 3/10
"
17859,"is good
"
17860,Best game
17861,lol
17862,"I've played this more on console but nevertheless, love this game.  A lot of hours have been spent with this one, along with others in the series.  Definitely a game to find yourself playing long after it's launch."

17868,cool
17869,liked TES VI more
17870,Probably one of the best games I have ever played. I am always coming back to it to it because there is just so much meat to this game that it can keep you entertained for years to come.
17871,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is one of the most iconic and most replayable open world fantasy rpgs out there. It's simply a must play for anyone interested in the genre. 

For Skyrim veterans - go download and play the Enderal Mod if you haven't already. You'll thank me later."
17872,Classic.
17873,"awesome game endless possibilities
"
17874,best farking game in steam
17875,nice
17876,"Classic! Gets better with mods, just like good wine with age!"
17877,"i had just started the game, got the the first town and was in prison three times because i shot an orphan"
17878,pretty good
17879,You cannot go wrong with this game.
17880,God like game
17881,Easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played.
17882,Still can't finish it though
17883,"i mean, who tf doesn't know about skyrim at this point"
17884,After playing Skyrim for about 600 hours if you count my playtime across different platforms I can adequately say this game fucking sucks... other then that it's an amazingly buggy experience that people have to experience at least once in their lifetime.
17885,it's like Fallout 4 but there's forests and more bugs
17886,"cvbhm,nhbgf"
17887,Great open arena game!

17891,Good
17892,Not Bad
17893,If you haven't played skyrim yet you're just dumb. There's no replacing this game its brilliant.
17894,yes
17895,"best game of all time. incredible graphics and immersing storyline. its one of those games thatll have you playing for days, getting up only to go to the bathroom and fridge. 

mods make this game 100x better, but still an incredible vanilla game"
17896,enjoyable game with the exception of the MANY bugs that have not been OFFICIALLY fixed even though Bethedsa is putting out new versions on new platforms for same HIGH price.

17907,"I don't know how I wasted so much of my life on such a mediocre game. It's not that great, it's just that there was little to compete with it in the genre that it's in at the time. If you want a good fantasy RPG, play The Witcher 3 instead."
17908,best game ever even in 2020 and in the future of 10000000000000000000000000000

17911,10/10 would mod again
17912,"this game, is a game."
17913,"I still, despite having 181 hours in the game, have not actually completed the main story and am still finding new things. Take that with a grain of salt."
17914,"Not great, not terrible."
17915,"Good graphics, game mechanics and story, would recommend"
17916,You know it !
17917,cool game
17918,"Spent more time modding the game, starting it up, closing, fixing, and modding some more"
17919,One of the greatest of all time...if you've never played it or heard of it then you need to get it and play it!
17920,If your looking at this you are either brand new to steam and don't have skyrim or your looking for a laugh (search for Skippy Dinglechalk)

17929,Very fun and immersive.
17930,blah blah blah blah
17931,"Huge open world, modding community provides endless replayabiliy. 
Lots of character creation mods, find a character in a book or a movie and create them in a pre-industrial norse society...I've played for 2500 + hours and have never bothered to complete the main quest line, I just recreate charcters that I read about or from people I meet and see how  they would behave in the game.

17932,Selling you soul to a god is a good idea
17933,poggers yo
17934,One of my all time favourite video games.
17935,cool
17936,"At the time of writing this review I have played the game countless times on the Playstation 3 and 4. I never thought to play it on the PC since I had already played it through so many times but jumping onto the PC version it is like a whole new game. Steady 60fps, lighting and textures are far better, and it's just PC. If you haven't played the game, or even if you have, you should definitely pick it up and play it again."
17937,"very good
"
17938,meh
17939,Buggy as hell. Story is meh at best. But goddamit do I love this game.

17951,When is elder scrolls 6 Todd?
17952,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?

It's buggy at times, needs a lot of TLC to mod effectively and consistently, and the engine doesn't hold up terribly well at times.

But it's one of my favorite games. Immense world, gripping story, customization, DLCs, magnificent visuals.... nevermind what the modding community can do with it.

10/10, worth every headache."
17953,One of the best games ever created. It just works.
17954,Greatgame .
17955,its ok i guess
17956,Best Game!
17957,My absolute favorite among all games I've played. Vanilla is fantastic and modding makes things new again.
17958,Great game and story
17959,good for fucking with npcs
17960,Closely resembles D&D and the scenery is amazing! Modable with many mods that let  you customize the game as you choose.
17961,"Its Skyrim. 100's of hours of gameplay, even more if you start adding mods to it. large open world, tons of quests / side quests, great story, graphics looking thier age nowadays tbh, but once again mods come to the rescue and properly modded this game can easily stand shoulder to shoulder with todays top games. well recommended."
17962,Fuck Bethesda. Ive bought this game too many times. Give us a new fucking game.
17963,"Ehhhhhh its okay, pretty nice graphics with mods."
17964,great quest lines
17965,"For me Skyrim sets a standard as for what an RPG game should play like. The gameplay and leveling up system are both fantastic. The game has a wide range of difficulty that the player can choose. The amount of content is very good, especially if you got the DLC and/or mods. Stamina and carryweight limits are the only two annoying features of the game but you can level up to get around those features. Amazing game, would definitely recommend this."
17966,Good game
17967,classic game not ruined by MMO
17968,the bread looks nice
17969,Awesome :)
17970,Can't get past the first level

17983,Even after 182 hours of play over the past 6 years I am still finding new adventures.
17984,awesome game
17985,"Second favorite game of all time. The gameplay may not hold up extremely well, but that's why ESV Skyrim: Remastered is a thing. The game has a lot of life still left in it with tons of modding potential."
17986,"Cool game, it will consume a good amount of time. I've had this one since it was released and still haven't completed it."
17987,"It lives up to the hype, if its lacking in any area, mod it. Great game."
17988,it goood

18000,"pretty good 
"
18001,"Great game, Lot's of freedom and play time."
18002,"I like Skyrim for its variety of game play and to be honest the modding. Without the mods and the modding community I would have played once and walked away. But with the almost endless mods available you can change the game in any way you want, thus this game is one of my number 1 games with a bullet. Yes you can have guns if Skyrim billy, just get one of the mods."
18003,It's Skyrim. It's classic. Now bring out Elder Scrolls VI.
18004,cool
18005,get this game
18006,"love this game, one of my first games that I got, as a DVD no less!"
18007,why go around the trail when you can just scale the mountain?
18008,"Download it. Lose your soul for 20-30 hrs. Download all the mods. Go down that rabbit hole. Delete it to get your life back. 6 months later repeat. 
Its like an ex girl that is really good at blowjobs but is a complete shit of a person."
18009,"It was fun 6/8 years ago, but now it's an unplayable buggy mess not worth playing on new machines. 1 min into the game and already a game breaking bug."

"
18015,"you WILL enjoy it, but it's still pretty bad.

It's got good parts, and parts that are so obscenely bad they become good aswell.
I mean literally so bad it's good.
I'm talking The Room levels of camp.

It really shows how they went for more flare over substance here, the presentation is superficially neat and the first impressions are pretty good.
What did it cost? everything.
The rpg part of this rpg was butchered beyond recognition, the presentation aged poorly but luckily there's mods.
Not a bad 2011 game, but it's definitely a bad Elder Scrolls. Waste of potential really.
Buy it for cheap, don't spend as much time playing it as I did, it was NOT worth it."
18016,Best of the best
18017,"this game is almost a decade old, but i can't get enough of it still. i used to play this on console all the time years ago, but just got it on pc to play again. it's awesome, a beautiful classic. can't wait for TES 6"
18018,Does this game end?
18019,"what can i say, todd made a good game. great to replay too."

18028,"Skyrim belongs in every Steam collection. It will give you hundreds of hours and will encourage multiple downloads over the years to accomplish different outcomes with different classes and races. The story line, gameplay, and customized graphic interface is irreplaceable, a work of violent art."
18029,I still feel like I missed some quests.
18030,You can yell pretty loud
18031,"never gets old. ive been playing this game for years and its always been a comfort to me. its a janky, buggy mess, and its my mess <3"
18032,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES GOING TODAY AND YOU CAN MOD IT UP TO YOUR PLAY STYLE
18033,Its alright.
18034,oh yea
18035,"''Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.''

It's a great game, the main story is packed with action and different enemies/allies. The DLC's are great and give even more special and new weapons/gear. Modding is also a nice addition to the PC version, get nexus mod manager and install some spicy mods.

18036,I mean it's Skyrim.
18037,I love all of the boob mods
18038,really fun game a lot of fun and so much to do and explore in this game. I really enjoyed the story and side quest a lot in this game. there's always so much to do and explore. You can also mod this game and make it way more enjoyable I personally use NEXUS mod manager for all mine. The game is really fun with or without mods highly recommend this game.
18039,"Amazing game, meh story, still immersing"

18047,"While I love this game, i cannot recommend it. The game is simply broken in many respects and the writing can range from good to downright horrible. Its combat is horrible, boiled down to swinging your weapon with no feedback until you drain the health o whatever your fighting. It lacks depth, which is reflective of much of this game as a whole. Stealth is bad primarily due to a lack of variety in gameplay and terrible AI. Magic is mediocre because the schools of magic while different in most respects lack much difference in their individual spells. Exploration is great, when you find actual unique places and not copy-pasted one room caves. That doesn't even bring up the bugs, the lack of environmental interaction lessening immersion, boring factions, and lack of scale to most ""intense"" or ""climactic"" parts of quests. The games fun derives from the mods, the wealth of things to do no matter how shallow, and overall player choice in quests. Take it as you will."

18064,"It's a really good game with lots of things to do. I started playing again and i have basically just ignored the main quest and done side quests. 9/10 great game, some bugs that isnt good but its alright"
18065,
18066,Its reet
18067,everybody needs this game
18068,Amazing in every way.
18069,"I played this game when it first came out and finished all there was at the time. So when I saw it on Steam Sale for $12 I bought it again, and added a heap of mods. There is so much more in the SE version that I have not played so I am enjoying the new adventure. Highly recommend it especially with the extra mods."
18070,"Yeah, it's fun, really glad most mods and things are on SSE now though, 64 bit and unrestricted memory has made Papyrus scripting so much better. Still, never forget your roots."

18082,"Top tier game, so much to it and still enjoyable even with the age of it, so many mods to enjoy and have fun with ontop of near unlimited side missions and story lines, would definitley recommend to anyone looking for a game to pour hours into and to have a great time"
18083,I played this game for over 1000 hours. I like it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18084,good game
18085,I'm sorry but it's complete broken. I can't even start the game (new game last played 2015) the fucking cart bug happend EVERYTIME I start a new game and I have zero mods installed

18091,"Get the Special Edition, it's better. Love Skyrim though, you should definitely go check out the special edition. The game's lived this long for a reason, the modding scene really breathes life into the game."
18092,"i mean its skyrim, do you really need me to explain ?"
18093,"Fascinating, very involved game."
18094,"Damn. I got to experience this game, WAY to late."
18095,"I have played this a whole hell of a lot clearly... this is a great game and I find it very relaxing. The story is interesting, the graphics are rather decent, and combat is engaging."
18096,its a fun game to play
18097,"One of the best RPG's you can play of all time, huge open world, tons of stuff you can do and lots of quests.

I only have the original version of the game (not Special Edition) so the game does look quite dated, But honestly that's not really the a big focus for such a game in the first place.

18107,perfect game to bully NPCs
18108,Pretty good. Bethesda know exactly what makes a brilliant RPG experience. Once you have completed your medieval quest you can move on to exploring the thousands of mods designed to completely redesign the experience taken away from your next playthrough.

18125,Good game. Even greater with mods

18193,Never have I ever hated an intro to a game more than the one to this game.
18194,it is pretty cool
18195,It's fun.
18196,"Out of all the games that I've ever played, if I had to choose just ONE of them to recommend to others, it would be Skyrim. Hands down. And thanks to mods, just about anything that you could want to do in this game, you can do it. Endlessly replayable, once again thanks to the hundreds of mods available. Play through the story, or completely ignore it, and make a life for yourself without the burdens of being the Dragonborn. It's your choice."
18197,"Game is a timeless classic, compared to more contemporary RPG's it is outclassed in things such as story, role playing, combat and graphics but there is a reason that Bethesda released a billion times. The various stories are enough to make you want to see them to their end and the world has hundred of nooks and crannies to explore and get lost in. If you're into it there's also limitless modding potential ranging from big tiddy statues to fully realized quest lines that rival those that are already present in the game.

Basically the game is a classic and if you have not played it before I don't know where you have been for the past nine years but you should probably get on to it."
18198,"Great game, I've had this game for quite a few years now and I still enjoy playing it. I don't even think I've completed everything yet because there is just that much too do on it and if you get the expansion packs then there's even more things to do and explore. 

You can also add mods to this game, some mods on steam are quite good such as new outfits, houses, mounts and even new locations. :3 

If you're thinking about getting this game then I recommend you do."

One of the most amazing and life changing games I've ever played. It's not bugless, so make sure to the unofficial patch mod. 

Definitely recommend. This game's a classic"

Link for DLCs listed below.

Link should take you to the original version of Skyrim. If you don't mind using Bethesda's modding platform then just get SE as it's better, however, if you're like me and you prefer to mod the shit out of your game and don't want Bethesda as the middle man, get the original. You will pay more for all of the content and the original version vs the SE (as of time of writing) gives you everything for $40 vs original you pay around $65 for everything as it is almost never on sale and is unlisted on the Steam store (can only find it via link and not through search). 

TL;DR buy the original if you don't want to use Bethesda's forced modding platform but pay a slight premium for it

I am a Programming Degree holding game programmer, and I have more than enough knowledge and tools to track down exactly what STEAM is doing to crash the few STEAM games I own, and it is obvious that the staff at Steam thinks that if they prevent me from playing the games I already have, and have played allot, that I will buy something different.  I will NEVER buy another steam game.

-Balanced enemies and weapons
-You can become very OP after quite some time
-Many things to do when not doing the main story (or if you finished it)

Overall a 9/10"

my first RPG game ever, and boy was i impressed, on my first play through i didnt even bother with the main questline, i remember just soaking in the amazing scenary, and somehow ended up in Falkreath, just exploring, doing random quests and so on.  my friend told me there was dragons in the game, but i only met one, then he told me that i had to do the main questline so i started to do the main QL at lvl 54, I have 3000+ hours on my xbox, and i enjoyed ever second of it. 
this masterpiece was a doorway into a whole new genre of games for me. so if you havent had the pleasure of playing this game, i strongly recommend that you get to it."

18305,yes
18306,"An extremely shallow experience. Yet, I can't stop myself from playing it...

























psst they're called mods"
18307,"Really fun, lots of content. Do whatever you want in game, and I mean whatever."
18308,"bethesdas action rpgs are notoriously buggy, but skyrim is the worst yet. and will become more and more unstable as you progress thru the massive world. I would have liked to become a powerful arch-mage or heroic warrior of tamriel but was doomed from the start, never to be patched.

eventually the dragonborn is caught in the trap of either; an inescapable lag-storm, or an impassable crash wall.. never to escape except by the sweet release of save file delete"
18309,Standard skyrim has the better mods between it and Special Edition
18310,awesome
18311,"I can't believe Skyrim is going to be 10 years old next year, I remember buying it on its release day! 
Skyrim was always fun, glitches and all. Especially if you had mods!"
18312,God dammit what happened to my wallet
18313,"its every things I've wanted out of a fantasy title, here's to the next and here's to the community at large <3"
18314,It's so broken and full of exploits that it is awesome.

18320,"Fun, open ended game.  Never run out of things to do."
18321,I can't wait fo play this on my smart fridge.
18322,"Such a beautiful game. Couldn't fault it, with mods this game has aged fantastically too."
18323,Best game ever modded up
18324,"After playing this game from when it basically came out until now, with all the mod support it is still a great game to play
 I've created a mod for this, as its not as hard as one would think!! Definitely recommend even after all this time and for much more time to come!!"
18325,Play Enderal instead.
18326,"I really like this game because I can play it over and over again and still feel like there's more to find. At the time I'm writing this review I have over 500 hours played over the course of 4 years and I just finished something I had never seen before now. The story line is fantastic and the lore is incredible. Honestly, I feel like I can play this for 4 more years and still feel the same way about it."
18327,yeah it's aight
18328,its skyrim
18329,Buy it again for the 7th time!
18330,This is my favorite game ever :)
18331,good gaym with mod
18332,"Been playing this on various different platforms, both with mods and without and frankly it's a game that's provided me hours of enjoyment. This is a game that will keep you occupied and engaged, despite its bugs."
18333,best game
18334,Good Game
18335,"What am I supposed to say here? You probably haven't heard good old Todd Coward shut up about this game for nearly a decade. Plus, are you really looking for an unbiased opinion from a loser who's spent more than a month of their life non-stop playing this game? I like the game, but at this point, it's kind of just like how a heroin addict likes their next fix. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
18336,All time favorite

18345,"Wait, there's a main quest?"
18346,YES
18347,"Honestly one of the best.

no matter what this game can keep you coming back, i beat the game many times and move on and when i come back to play again it still keeps you in the ""new game"" feel, the side quests are endless and its easy to get lost in the landscapes especially on ultra with the HD texture pack, the game does have some bugs and issues that to me even with the SE. never got resolved but its nothing major more like minor setbacks."
18348,yes

18358,Great Game!!!
18359,iz good
18360,"It's okay, I guess.

memes out of the way, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim at its default out of the box experience is alright, there is a decent enough story the UNIQUE voice acting is decent, the common voice acting often leaves a lot to be desired(one guy voices a total of like 100? 'unique' named npcs and his voice really stands out) graphics are decent enough for a 9 year old game, the AI is totally wonky and the PhysX/Havok engine is very clearly on its deathbed, the game it full of bugs and exploits, but over all it's a decent enough game for a Bethesda title"
18361,"Not much to say about it, really. It's Skyrim. It's good. Just don't play it vanilla. Seriously, even on a first playthrough you should at least install some interface mods."
18362,"Me spending an hour running around a town on fire: is this the game?

Me picking up items in a house: Why does everyone hate me?

18366,"Review that's 9 years too late that no one will care about? Sounds good.

I don't see what everyone likes about this game. It's as vast as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle.
The quests are all samey, as are the dungeons, and the combat is boring.
I found myself bored or pissed at the rampant bugs at all times.

Maybe I'd buy into the hype if I played it in 2011."
18367,double thumbs up
18368,"its skyrim, just buy it if you havent 3 times already."
18369,"Game is broken because I am unable to start a new game due to the wagons and horses flinging around. The wagon the player is on gets stuck on a rock. No external mods installed; just the three DLCs from Bethesda are installed (Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and HearthFires)."

18377,"Ya, it's a pretty good game"
18378,"It's Skyrim.

Do I really need to say more? Lovely graphics, great modding potential, and a heavily bugged, compelling experience designed by Bethesda.

I feel like they could have worked harder on the main quest line and done more with the civil war story line but overall it was a very expansive game. I feel as if modding really makes it shine. Please try some mods if you play this great game."
18379,"Used to walk around in Skyrim during winter of 2011 admiring the scenery and in 2020 I am still doing the same but with mods.

18384,You're seriously asking me whats good about this game? It's a must have if you're a true gamer.
18385,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite game ever and I will never stop playing it. The amount of freedom you can have when playing is endless, the mods you can add are infinite, and there is just never ending entertainment and fun while playing. I will continue to play every Elder Scrolls game that comes out and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this series!"

18403,"The best damn moddable game there is, no contest with the crazy SOBs who make the mods"
18404,everything
18405,I can't imagine that my recommendation is the one you would land upon (versus all of the others) but Skyrim is FANTASTIC! Don't start playing unless you are ready to discover something that you will gladly give all of your time to.
18406,This is a great game.  I especially love it when it is modded thoroughly.  I play it now in the springtime with lush vegetation and villages that are upgraded to twice what they were.  I don't even have to change the quests much.  Just playing through different landscapes and appearances is enough.
18407,Why is yo game so fawking boring
18408,its skyrim
18409,Worth it..... For the mods
18410,yes

18421,yep
18422,"I was told to buy this game by a friend.Didn't really want to as i had been playing other RPG like Conan online, SWTOR amonst others.Then i had a bit of money left over from my birthday so i thought ""Oh what the heck"", and bought the game...I have the game for just over a year and not one day has gone by without me playing it. Over 1000 hours of play time so far with many more to come....So if anyone is looking for a game to play that throws you into a world of sword and sorcery,were your storyline choices could lead you on a moraly dodgy path or the way of the hero,then buy this game....it's addictive."
18423,"Played a bit, it's pretty good."
18424,Very fun
18425,Best Game i ever Played
18426,one of the bust open world games !!!!
18427,"yup, still good."
18428,"let's face it, you're only buying this for the porn mods. there are cheaper ways out there. don't do it."
18429,its fucking skyrim who wouldnt want to play
18430,good mods
18431,"What's to say? It's Skyrim! If you like RPGs, you will most likely like this game!"
18432,One of the best RPG in the world
18433,i cant play the game because i keep adding more mods
18434,I still play it after nine years.
18435,The game is a wonderful open world game with so much to explore and quests to complete
18436,"It's fracking Skyrim. If you havent played with 700 mods, you are doing it wrong"
18437,"This game has awesome graphics and well thought out character followers. It is awesome experience all around. When engaging in game time you forget about real time, it is that awesome!"

18439,The Best Game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18440,dragon fly round shoot fire
18441,The only game i can think of where I have The Macho Man Randy Savage as the dragons
18442,it is a good game and wothe it
18443,loved it
18444,Skyrim is the best RPG ever made. Some people will tell you a classic from 10 years ago is but the level of replay value in this game has cannot be measured. TL DR Skyrim is worth every penny and more with the mods and enchanting world of The Elder Scrolls.
18445,"As with Morrowind and Oblivion before it, this is a great open-ended open-world rpg with modding tools.  Exploring the world can be both exciting and relaxing."
18446,10/10 Sweetrolls
18447,ah yees game
18448,my favorite game of all time.
18449,Just a fantastic game.
18450,"Great game, recommended!
I've put some real time into it, and still have sooooo much to do. It's neverending, but so worth it. Just avoid taking an arrow to the knee and you'll enjoy it ;)"
18451,Very enjoyable. Even if you don't follow the main quest lines. There are plenty of side quests to complete and the world is made to be explored.
18452,It's Skyrim what should i say.
18453,Just don't ever lay a finger on that chicken and you should be fine
18454,it just works
18455,So many things to do. Mains quest line as well as side quests everywhere. The graphics and game play are incredible. Overall an incredible experience for any type of gamer.
18456,it is a good game
18457,"cmon man, who would not recommend this game. even if for some reason you think this game is stale, just mod the shit out of it. EAZY 200 hours of enjoyable gameplay"
18458,"I played this game almost 5 years after it was released. There was many other major titles in the gaming world back then. Despite being an old game this one won my heart instantly. I have spent countless days inside this epic world. I was mesmerized by the lore and the depth of the stories. A must play for any Fantasy game lover. The Graphics and visuals are not polished and has lots of bugs. But once you start playing this game, it start to grow on you will find those things negligible. If things look so bad that it hurt your eyes, you can consider installing one of the mods which will dramatically improve your experience."
18459,epic
18460,pog
18461,FUN
18462,It's pretty neat I guess.
18463,"not bad game, sadly i finished it only once because i started moding this game at it turns into 100gb then spending another days to fix the crashes then quiting the game before i ever visit  whiterun. 11/10 experience"
18464,"I'm writing this review because I keep seeing people write low-effort reviews saying that you should get this version instead of Special Edition, when most of the arguments against SE have become less and less relevant as time went on.

Yes, it was s****y of Bethesda to just hide this version and it would've been better if they had just done something similiar to what Red Faction: Guerilla did and just give players both versions if they own one of them. Yes, Skyrim Special Edition is a pretty lazy remaster and doesn't really fix many of Skyrims bugs, but in the end buying this will still just give you a worse version of the same game and Bethesda really won't give a damn which version you bought as long as they get their money, so if this really bothers you so much you should just not buy any version of Skyrim at all.

Anyways, let me quickly adress a few of the main arguments against SE that I've seen:

[b]""My PC can't run SE!""[/b]

I'm putting this one first because this is the only one that I'd actually consider valid. Yes, SE does have higher minimum requirements, and if you can't match those you might want to get this version instead. That being said, if you're above SEs min specs or even just kinda close to them, you'll most likely end up seeing performance improvements. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRzLgRvqfDs]Gopher made a really good video that explains this better than I ever could.[/url]

[b]""SE is worse for modding, and there are less mods available for it!""[/b]

SE removes a lot of the limitations of the vanilla engine and has improved stability, allowing you to run more mods at once and also increasing the amount of things you can have on screen at once, which is great for mods like Open Cities or Civil War Mods that use high amounts of NPCs to simulate large scale battles. A lot of large modding projects, like Legacy of the Dragonborn, Beyond Skyrim and Skyrim Together have also dropped support for Oldrim because the 32-bit Engine is limiting what they can do. I rarely encounter mods that haven't been ported these days, and even if they haven't there's plenty of tools available that'll allow you to port simpler mods, even without much knowledge of how Skyrim Modding works. Sure, the numbers on the Nexus' front page might suggest otherwise, but you've got to consider that they are likely heavily inflated because of all the ""big bobbie follower!"" and ""naruto in skyrim""-type mods that have been released throughout the years. The only noteworthy mod (at least in my opinion) that hasn't been ported yet is the total conversion Enderal, and even that might still be ported at some point and there are unofficial tutorials out there that'll teach you how to port it manually (although I can't vouch for the stability of those conversions).

[b]""SE costs more""[/b]

While buying base Skyrim is cheaper with the LE, if you want to get all DLCs, which you will need if you want to mod this game (and are also just worth getting in general, the DLC questlines are some of the best in the game), you'll actually spend more money with this version. If you add up the prices for all the DLCs you'll have to pay 59,96 € to get all of them, while the Special Edition only costs 39,99€. And that's not even considering the fact that LE doesn't go on sale anymore. The last time SE went on sale, its price was reduced to only 17,99 €, only three bucks more than LE without DLCs. This means you're still cheaper off upgrading to SE if you're just missing one of the major DLCs, as long as you wait for the next sale.

[b]""But Creation Club...""[/b]

Like I said earlier, it really doesn't matter which version you buy, Bethesda still gets their money, if you really have qualms with CC, you shouldn't be buying any of their games at all, because you'll still be giving them money and that's all that companies care about.

The only real effect CC has on the main game if you're not using it is that there's a little notification box in the main menu (which can be modded out), and that whenever Bethesda releases a new update to the game to make new creation club content available, SKSE will need to be updated to function with the new version. While this may sound like a big deal, it really isn't. Usually, only SKSE needs to be updated (which usually happens fairly quickly) and these updates can be easily bypassed by disabling automatic updates on steam and using the SKSE launcher to launch the game (which you'd have to be using anyways for this to be a problem) to bypass the update check.


I'll probably add some more stuff to this review later because I'm a bit lazy and there's a good chance this'll end up getting buried anyways, if you're reading this and have any other points against SE, drop them in the comments and I might respond to them."
18465,this game is trash i only played it for 5 min
18466,Install mods for one hell of a time
18467,GOAT
18468,JOSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18469,i've played 500+ hours of this game and would strongly suggest playing it if you haven't already
18470,yes!
18471,"I'm only writing this review because of a motivation to write more reviews. I've put 210 hours into this game on PC alone (I started on Xbox before my first PC build.) If you've never played this game, what are you even doing with your life? Being successful? Productive? Happy?!?
Skyrim gets plenty of flak for the fact that it's been released 7(?) times already in different ways, but it can do that for a reason. This game fucks, so hard.
There's so much to do and an immense amount of replay value that I've hardly scratched the surface on value. Couple that with Steam Workshop integration and you've got a game that could almost be a life-ending hole of virtual happiness (if it were up to date on graphics/multiplayer standards)
Oblivion still takes the cake as my favorite Elder Scrolls game for its creativity and innovation, but Skyrim DID pave the way to a brighter future for RPGs and did so fabulously."
18472,"great game to get lost in
"
18473,I can't stop playing this gods hot slab of ass of a game
18474,Skyrim is great. Definitely one of the best games ever made.
18475,"It's Skyrim. If you haven't played it, then get on it."
18476,Yea it's a completely balanced game not a lie trust me no glitches...
18477,dont get the other 5 skyrims
18478,"I've put 1500 hours into the game. That's about two months of my life 100% dedicated to Skyrim. Do I regret it? A bit. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Is this the best Bethesda game of all time? Not by a long shot. But can you waste two months of your life on it and still feel like you have more to do? Well, I guess I'm proof of that."
18479,yes
18480,nazeem is bad
18481,"I mean it's Skyrim, the game has been out for years and is insanely fun. The combat probably needs work, but the world and story and stuff suck all that up. Be sure to explore all of it as much as you can."
18482,Yummy Good!
18483,Big game.
18484,Good Game.
18485,it's Skyrim
18486,"why would i recommend this, because it just works"
18487,no
18488,"I played for an hour and the game crashed.
And yet, i can find myself investing a lot of hours into this game
oh, how i missed this game so much"
18489,"it's skyrim, what isn't there to love? glitches and exploits galore, deep lore, infinite modding possibilities, and a fantastic platform for storytelling. i'd recommend getting the special edition though, as it's 64-bit and seems more stable (idk if they added any of the unofficial patches to the core game or not?)

I've genuinely played nearly 500 hours on one character, with the rest split between two others"
18490,Awesome Game
18491,10/10!!!!!!!!!!
18492,Mod it for the vine
18493,good should remove some glitches though
18494,Its an enjoyable waste of time.
18495,"The game was amazing and I have rich memories with friends and solo. When this game first came out it sucked me in just as Oblivion and Morrowind had. I remember sharing stories on our classes and abilities. This game continues to bring joy to my life. It has been there while overseas and at home. I highly suggest this game. If you haven't played or heard of this game or seen anything about it....well this shit will blow your mind. It will only get better as the community continues to develop more mods to help keep this game current. Among that there are many of other story-stretching and enhancing mods, so there is something for everybody. Unfortunately, nearly all of my time is on my other systems...meaning I have willingly bought this game for other consoles like 4-5 times now...."
18496,Played  skyrim for years (on diff gaming consoles and pc) and i never get tired of it. So much you can do and on pc you can add mods which makes it more diverse
18497,You already know
18498,"I mean, it's Skyrim. It might be 9 years old, but it's held up well, especially with mods."
18499,Двое полных суток еб*лся с модами. Оно один раз запустилось нормально поработало и сломалось нах*й. Сижу переустанавливаю. Щас все по кругу заново делать буду. 10/10 всем рекомендую

"
18501,good game lots of content
18502,Flexibility in freeplay
18503,good
18504,Skyrim is one of the truly evergreen titles some other games aspire to be. 60+ hours with the GOTY and countless more with mods. All without the paying continuously like GAAS. There is a reason this title is released and re-released on so many platforms.
18505,fun
18506,Always replayable a clasisc of the Fantasy RPG genre.

18512,"Its Skyrim.. What else to say, its a given"
18513,"618 hours total is nothing to the nearly endless gameplay, a lot of which the modding community helped form. Even after a break from the game, the game still had the same charm and adventure it had before."
18514,"played a ton on the ps3 and this game is still awesome
9/10"
18515,pretty good
18516,"By far the best open world game you have ever played. If you care about freedom to choose whatever you can do and so many contents, definitely worth it. If you care about combat, simulation stuff, you may not enjoy it."

18519,G O O D
18520,great game
18521,Just get it.
18522,"It's Skyrim, what more needs to be said. If you haven't played any version of it you're clearly living under a rock.

In regards to this version it's probably your best choice for modding if, like me, you've mainly played the console versions (specifically the PS4 version, I mean come on Sony...) and wanted to try modded. Simply put with mods you can easily make this version more impressive than the special edition and it's far cheaper, again making ideal if your just buying it for mods."
18523,"Favorite game of all time, played it in my ol' ps3 back in 2013 like 600 hundred hours and again on the ps4."
18524,Great game

18530,Still great.
18531,"The only other video games I have spent any time on besides this one is Skyrim Special Edition and Skyrim VR.
Each are a little different and keep me entertained switching between the games and different characters in the games.  The variety in the gameplay and characters is probably the key."
18532,"it lit

18533,Only played it for a little bit. Really good. c:
18534,Game has so many bugs I can't get through the opening scene. Cart acts like a milkshake in the process of being blended.  Can't figure out how to make it work.
18535,.

18537,Skyrim is more than a game.
18538,very good yas.
18539,its sick
18540,Great game and I have been playing for years. I myself have never run out of things to do. Was worth the money and a solid 9/10. I'm hoping for the best when it comes to elder scrolls six.

18548,"I like it 
"
18549,"My favorite rpg by far, amazing when it came out on 2011 and still mindblowing. If the vanilla game tires you, then install a few mods and problem should be solved. There`s really no drawback"

18556,Best game in all of existence
18557,Best game evs
18558,"If you never played this game get it or wait that it is on sale, then do it. This game has so much replayability. On multiple occasion I went back to experience a different play through building my character a different manner. Including the Special Edition, I played this game 800 hours on over the span of many years.

The story is not the best but it is good enough to give you a reason to do the objectives. The combat is nothing special but the levelling system feels real nice, you get better at the specific skill you’re using. This makes every play through feel different.

But the main strength of Skyrim is the mods. It can add so many hours to the game and make it a different game entirely.

Tldr: Buy it
"
18559,Good game.
18560,"Skyrim is another installment in the Elder Scrolls Saga, between PS4 and Steam I have over 2k hours on this game. I love it, there are some bugs, but most of the mods available address them."
18561,You can mod it to be whatever you want it to be.
18562,its skyrim bruh
18563,"Probably the best game in the world. It offers countless hours of gameplay, especially with DLC's. Good graphics, rich storyline, nice combat system and mechanics and every piece of environment is unique in it's own way, it's not repetitive (Considering it's 9 years old game). 10/10 for me."
18564,very cool
18565,great game
18566,it's ok
18567,"Always something to do to pass time here, especially if you get into modding the game."
18568,Good
18569,"Yes, it's buggy. But since the special edition isn't bugfixed at all just play this (buy when on sale) and mod it.  Do it, you will not regret it."

The game is multiple years old and still one of the only games I can turn on and play for hours. I grew up from being an 11 year old kid to being almost 19 in a month playing this game and still have things happen to me which I've never seen before. This game is an absolute staple of my life and i hope the people that are buying this game are as astounded with the vast, beatuiful, lively world that is Skyrim."

18635,"You keep buying, Todd keeps selling."
18636,"This game is great. You can have hundreds of hours on this game and still have new quests to complete, dungeons to explore, characters to meet. And you can do all of that with a huge variety of characters all custom made by you. The DLC too is also great, out of them all I would recommend Dawnguard, basically a whole other game. It includes a very intriguing questline in which you can even become a vampire, or fight them off, it is your choice. Along with the questline you can also unlock new skills with becoming a vampire to hone your abilities and traumatise the towns.  Overall, it is a solid game with only a few minor bugs left over. If you need a game to play with limitless amounts of fun, this is the game for you."
18637,try it
18638,Great RPG game if you like fantasy
18639,"I can't say anything about this game that you don't already know. Why are you even in the reviews? Go watch someone play this game on YouTube or Twitch. There are a lot of videos out there. Also, 100% this game needs modded. At least the first play though, add some QoL mods for sure. After the first play through, you could add some more content mods."

18646,"Do you REALLY need a review to buy this game?.....i mean like it´'s skyrim pretty much more than half of humanity already played it and liked it, besides when you get bored from the base experience there is a ton of mods for you to download and make this gem even better....Just buy it. You wont regret it."
18647,"I've played this game much longer than it says in my Steam account and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves medieval games. Skyrim is a classic in the elder scrolls series and is just as good as Oblivion. I had this game on Xbox before PC and I have put years into it. I have to say that this game is 1000 times better with mods so you should definitely know how to add them to your game. The original character customization is sub par but with mods installed you could have basically any character you can think of, including ones that don't fit the lore of the game. There are lots of crazy quests and the conversational choices make it feel like you actually have a choice in the direction of your character. Be a good guy, or a bad guy, or just be a guy... maybe be a strange cat man hybrid known as a Khajiit, or a lizard man hybrid known as an Argonian. If you haven't played this game yet, buy it immediately without a second thought. It's too late to turn back now, you're the Dragonborn."

Follow the main quest or simply go wherever randomly or both! Finally got a lvl 100 character, and it's glorious with how much I've done. Unfortunately I have bad habits with restarting my characters many times, but this time I follow through with it and now; am an Vampiric Argonian Mage with unlimited Destruction magic, a collection of whole sorts of quest items, leader of all four factions, master of Castle Volkihar, owner of three estates, foster parent of two kids and a

18677,its pretty fun but at this point just get the spetial edition. its more but cheaper than getting this and then its dlc's. modding the game is great and the best way to play the game after beating it

18681,"I mean, come on, it's Skyrim. I've been playing this game since it released all those years ago. I've purchased the game for PS3, Steam, --steam again in 2016, as well as the PS4, AND the Xbox series. I'm a stone's throw away from VR and Switch tbh. 

My point, if you can find a point in all of that: Is Skyrim still holds up today and is an incredible journey. You can't possibly have a bad time playing this game. If you don't already have it.. Get it. It's available on EVERYTHING. You have no excuse."
18682,It's Skyrim. One of the largest causes of sleep deprivation for gamer's since 2011.
18683,High quality with losts of activitys to do
18684,Very good early 2000s classic. A must play at that. Elder scrolls is always a story load of a game.

18705,"My first introduction to Skyrim (and The Elder Scrolls games) was when I got my Xbox 360. Going into this game series having no idea about it, I was intrigued about having a new fantasy RPG to play. I was very excited to try the DLC out as well. Today I still play Skyrim but with mods, frustrated when something crashes but too fond of this game to give up on it. Thanks to Todd Howard I have three copies of Skyrim on three different platforms. I've eagerly waited for a new Elder Scrolls game for what feels like forever. Seems like I'll have to wait some more! In the meantime I have good old Skyrim to keep me company."
18706,Amazing RPG
18707,"Great Game!
Even better with mods."
18708,nice game when modded
18709,pretty neat
18710,"Quite possibly the greatest Role Playing Game of all time and the music and atmosphere in this game are second to none. Notice I didn't qualify it with ""western"" or ""medieval"". It is that good. 

This version, while not boasting as good as graphics in it's vanilla form in comparison to the Special Edition (which is the superior version to play ""vanilla""), remains the superior version to mod and customize to your own liking. It does not natively support 21:9, but it can be can be modded to do so. This game can be modded more than any other game you ever play; you are not buying just Skyrim, you are buying an almost infinite number of experiences. 
The Steam Workshop is way better than Bethesda's mod store in the Special Edition as: 
1) all mods are free;
2) it is easier to add and remove mods; 
3) there are way more mods to pick from; 
4) mods do not remove the ability to get achievements in this version...to be fair, there is a mod for that in the Special Edition as well. Remember, you can mod anything."

18724,"[quote=Hrongar]I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy.[/quote]

What made this a great open world RPG, is a pretty good story (although a little worst than Oblivion for my taste), an impressive graphic quality for the time and, above all, the freedom to do and undo as you please.

It has a brutal amount of content. Beyond the main story, there are lots of side stories, factions, crafting, etc. On top of that, if you want to try out mods, you have, literally, thousands of hours of extra entertainment.

On the downside, I'd say that the followers AI leaves something to be desired, and the combat system is a bit simple and rough.

In any case, Skyrim is a classic of the genre and, in short, one of the best open-world RPGs of all time. Very recommended.

18725,"Despite its flaws, Skyrim is still a widely-loved game that stands as one of the prime examples of an open world fantasy rpg. While being meh in terms of combat, impactful decisions and optimisation; Skyrim contains a simple, fun to explore and atmosphere rich world which is one of the main things that has secured its longevity. It has beautiful music, grand vistas and both iconic places and characters that have stuck in many gamer's minds relentlessly these past 10 years. Overall a fantastic game, perfectly imperfect and absorbingly addictive.

P.S: There are plenty of mods that can fix or majorly improve almost anything you dislike about the game, so I'd definitely recommend getting some of those to overhaul your game and make it an overall better experience gameplay-wise."

18733,After getting through the beginning and finding my way to where I actually needed to go the game became quite alright and I would recommend the game but most gamer's have probably already have played. The cut scenes are long and the story line is very slow but I enjoy leveling up.
18734,good very nice
18735,"One of the most immersive gaming experiences ever, an excellent followup to Oblivion. At first i felt like a lot of cannon was being violated, but after going back and replaying the series from the beginning it became apparent that it actually all holds together very tightly.

18779,"I've played this game on and off the most of any in my library since 2011, yes it has bugs and all that but it still tops the list of my most played games for a reason (& I have hundreds). Once you get into the mods that is where the game begins for many, it will consume your life though, be warned. Though honestly with COVID-19 abound at the time of this post, this couldn't be more convenient.

So I guess yeah, would most definitely recommend."
18780,really cool! much wow!
18781,The wagon turns into a helicopter and I can't progress
18782,Lydia isn't THAT bad.
18783,Just a classic you can mod endlessly to keep it entertaining enough to play again when todd howard re-releases it again
18784,It just works
18785,"Its Skyrim, nothing else needs to be said at this point"
18786,my older brother (who uisually gives reallllly good games and calms me down when i get upset) likes this game but i dont
18787,GAME GOOD
18788,yes
18789,install testicles mods
18790,5
18791,"This game is by far one of the most addicting games, you can make your own choices and play through the way you want to, this game doesn't hold your hand like most newer games. Skyrim gives you a direction you can take and you decide whether to take it or decide to go on an infinite amount of side quests before coming back to the main story. On top of that this game has tons and tons of mods you can pile on to help build your own unique feel to skyrim."
18792,This game isnt even the best game. The best game probably goes to tetris on the game boy color. This game is a close second though and my favorite game of all time
18793,Find a better game. I dare you.
18794,"Eh, it's okay."
18795,"You probably own this game on the PS3, Sega Genesis, and your Nokia. You like this game. You'd love to play it on the PC. And when PC 2 comes out, you can buy the Special Super Edition so Todd can keep wiping his ass with $100 bills. 

I love this game."
18796,AMAZING
18797,"no description needed, you already know this is a great game."
18798,great game
18799,skyrim
18800,"Absolute beauty of a game. I mean what is there to say. It is just amazing in every aspect. The base game is like a 9/10. Not a 10/10 due to some bugs here and there but other than that it is a perfect game. However I feel like the story is a bit lack luster and just has you being a mercenary. The DLC is awesome though and they feel more immersive than the main story line. The looting is pretty fun and always exciting whenever you find a good set of armor or an awesome weapon.  it has such a wide variety that you can go like 3 playthroughs and encounter different loot each time. That's about it for the base game and now it's time for where Skyrim really becomes the perfect game. The modding aspect. It has the most mods out of any game and therefore you can find whatever it is you're looking for. You want a mod that adds in a weapon from your favorite movie? It's more than likely there. The mods also fix a lot of bugs from the base game so with mods the game becomes perfect. You can also get graphical mods that makes the game look like a 2020 release and everyday there are new updates coming out for mods and new mods coming out. You can change your playthrogh so much just by using mods. if you want a survival game where you have to take track of food, sleep, and water then there's a mod for that! or you're just a chill player and just want an easy time then there's mods for that too. Or if you're one of those people that likes to make your game the most weirdest but funny game then there's those too. This game is awesome in all its aspects. especially now with its vast community of modders making the game better every day."
18801,"good game
"
18802,I have played a lot of skyrim. It was my first big video game. Fun times!
18803,Game good
18804,goood. especially in these times. aged well.
18805,gud
18806,HELL YEAH <3
18807,"Iv'e owned this game on every fucking system it's available on, so it must be doing something right."
18808,Its fun and complex with a great storyline i think people who like exploreing should give it a shot. I know things are misspeld just leave me be.
18809,This is one of the best games I have ever played! Highly recommend! I would recommend the special edition more than the regular edition!
18810,Gud
18811,I played so much Skyrim that i can´t even remember when i start it.
18812,Hands down the best game ever created ever.
18813,yes
18814,wtf todd my sex mods dont work i want refund
18815,endless fun
18816,"i like it
"
18817,not nice
18818,"The Elder Scrolls 5 is a stunning game. I've had my fair share of amazing moments through this game and I recommend picking it up for yourself but its best to get the special edition. You play as a Dovahkiin who can use magic, melee, ranged and shouts to defeat any opponent in your way. Civil war has broken out in Skyrim as well as dragons and you need to chose a side to fight with either the Stormcloaks or the Imperials as well as wipe out the dragon race for good."
18819,Bugged beyond all believe
18820,"""It just works"" - Todd Howard 
10/10 best game"
18821,"This is the game of my childchood. What's the best you can play how you want. Thousands of quest make you busy for many hours. You can make your own character, buld a house or even adopt a child. Of course there are some bug's, but it's one of the best RPG games you can find !"
18822,Great game i wish i can forget everything about this game and start again
18823,"i am writing this review for the Samsung smart fridge version.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlNmCxWVAAAnGL0.jpg"
18824,"its good
"
18825,"Pro:  Good story, developed characters, rich lore and an amazing and expansive world. 
 Con: Aside from the bugs, there is a certain amount of content that was cut in vanilla which would have made the game even better.  Also, the radiant quests and dungeon raids can get pretty tedious pretty quickly but I suppose that's to be expected with the sheer size of the game world. 

Bottom line, the vanilla game is fun but the mods are really where it's at. It makes the game a lot better and there's so much creativity out there. There's also mods that restore a lot of the cut content so you can experience the full ""vanilla experience"".  I give the game a solid 8.5/10. Room for improvement but overall an excellent game.   
"
18826,saaa
18827,Fun
18828,"I also played special edition with 250 hours under my belt.
amazing game, would suggest the classic version more cause of steam workshop mods instead of whatever special edition has.
wait for a sale, buy all of the dlc, HAVE FUN!!!"
18829,"it is game
"
18830,"Anything I can say in support of this game has already been said, if you are looking at this game it's best just to add it to your cart and stop reading the comments."
18831,Its a classic
18832,fantastic game. have played for over 1000 hours and just started all over again.
18833,"Best game of all times, for me :)"
18834,"it's skyrim, you know what it is
"
18835,"I mean, it's Skyrim"
18836,its dope
18837,"I mean, just look at my playtime. Buggy, but it's endearingly so."
18838,Life consumer. Worth it.
18839,Classic game and never gets old
18840,It's skyrim. if you don't know about this game by now then I can't help you.
18841,I played this when i was in high shcool and had a nightmare where i woke up in the intro and didnt play it for 5 years out of an irrational fear.
18842,It's so big and awesome
18843,The game maintains your interest throughout the story
18844,A good role playing game once properly modded
18845,"8/10, aight RPG"
18846,this game is best
18847,good
18848,It just works.
18849,"Well, I've played this game out of steam form more than 500 hours. Now I have around 150+ hours on steam. I also bought this game for my PS4. So, trust me, this is one of the best games I've played in my life and If you havent played it yet, give him a try."
18850,Good game. Yeeting people with your voice has always been a dream of mine. 11/10
18851,Yes
18852,I mean... its skyrim.
18853,"Hands down best gaming soundtrack of all time. Jeremy Soul is the producer of Skyrim's music, and he did a phenomenal job. The Elder Scrolls V will go down in my books as one of the best video games I have ever played, thank you for such good memories."
18854,pretty cool
18855,My favourite game ever
18856,"Decent without mods.
Maybe the most fun you can have with mods."
18857,i installed sex mods and fucked a 60 year old maid
18858,Good game for relaxing.
18859,I miss my first playthrough
18860,I WILL BUY ALL RELEASES OF SKYRIM I DO NOT CARE HOW MANY TIMES!! THIS GAME MAKES ME COOM EVERY TIME I PLAY IT
18861,"The absolute best in ""free to roam"", free to do"" game ever. Open World content is the best. Just ensure you have your big pants on to enter some places. I wished more games were as forward thinking as Skyrim. There should be a place for more titles like this in the game world."
18862,"My first rpg, got a new pc just to play this way back in 2012. A great game for new and old player that you can play over again and again"
18863,aight
18864,blank
18865,"one of my favorite games ever made, love it.  If you havent played it get it"
18866,You like dragons? Here's some dragons. And some potato headed children models.
18867,It's one of the best games ever created
18868,"Best game i have ever played, hours of fun and definetly my favourite game!"
18869,It's Skyrim. What more do you need to hear?
18870,It is an amazing game i would also like if they stopped making updates to Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 and made Elder Scrolls VI or Fallout 5
18871,fun
18872,"iz cool

18879,its good but not goat simulator good
18880,This game is really fun and great for people who love story. And if you dont it is always a fun idea to download a bunch of mods and mess around
18881,This game made me retarded

18883,"Epic Gamer Moment


Hahahaha Dragon Go Brrrrrrrrrr"
18884,"Vanilla Skyrim is good.
Modded Skyrim is amazing."

18886,Never played Skyrim? Inconceivable!
18887,"This game is a huge adventure, made even better with mods"
18888,....
18889,Great game! I think everyone should play it at least once in their life :)
18890,goat emoji
18891,Loved this game since it came out and I still do all these years later.
18892,skrim
18893,Here be dragons!
18894,I've been playing this game since 2015 and it's still fun to play.
18895,"I mean, It's skyrim. If for some godforsaken reason you've managed to not play it for 9 years, I suggest you get around to it before it feels too outdated. Mods are recommended however."
18896,"""Hey, wake up""
what a terrible game, i was trying to sleep when i was transported onto some medieval carriage, and was forced awake.
butt..
10/10 IGN"
18897,"Immersive, large scale game, a little light on the rpg elements to my tastes."
18898,gg
18899,Game has been around forever now and is still fun. Mod the Hell out of it! What else can I say?
18900,"the good: absolutely gorgeous world to explore. Pretty enjoyable either in story or in open play, solid entry in Elder Scrolls. 

the bad: maybe this is a bit picky but after playing some of the Assassin's Creed series I wish the character animation was more dynamic and mo-cap based, it just looks a bit wooden in 3rd person mode."
18901,Its Skyrim. 'Nuff said.
18902,"It's Skyrim. You know what you're getting into.

If you're like me, and want as simple of a mod installation process as possible, the workshop is pretty decent for it. You won't find the best selection of mods, but there's a decent selection and standards like SkyUI."
18903,"Oh man... Skyrim.

Skyrim, Skyrim, Skyrim.

By itself, Skyrim's a now-dated, but acceptable experience. Enemies are dumb and exploitable, and I doubt I'd call the gameplay robust.

The reason this game was and still is such a big thing, apart from oh-so many ports, is its modding community. Frankly, without that, Skyrim'd have been good, for sure, but nothing quite beats arriving upon Riverwood from your AIRSHIP, summoning a BEAR MINSTREL that happens to not roar but rather speak in AUTOTUNE, and through the airship's functions, send this bear floating down on a platform to announce to the plebeians below that the Dragonborn is upon them.

It might've been a serious game once. It can still be, depending on mods. But it can also really, really not be that anymore.
That flexibility makes it a far, far greater experience than the sum of its own parts. The imagination of hundreds of creators is what makes it. 

So you want this game to be fun and unique? Browse the mods and make it yours."
18904,y e s
18905,gas
18906,"It's 2020 as I write this, do I even need to defend this game? It is hands down one of the best RPG's on the market for new players. I admit, in the genre of RPG's the mechanics of Skyrim are quite mainstreamed and that may not be appealing to veterans however the story telling and world building have sucked me in to this world so much so the very walls around me have melted away into a fantasy landscape in which I could escape. If you have never played this game, and are looking for a fantasy role playing game to get lost in, I hope my review will convince you to give it a try. I've played literally thousands of hours of this game across several platforms and to this day I get lost in it's wonders. Please, Let yourself experience this game."
18907,You just can't hate it.
18908,fuck yeah best open world game ever now go play oblivion and morrowind you mfs
18909,Skyrim
18910,epic game
18911,"You can save the world but that won't save you from dire consequences of accidently hitting a chicken.

Pleanty of ""lore friendly"" mods too that enhance the game such as:

Guns
Cars
Trains
Futanari ponies

"
18912,this game is one of the best of all time.
18913,Literally one of my 3 favorite pieces of fiction. Get the Dragonborn DLC.
18914,"dagger forging simulator 2011
I still have ptsd"
18915,Works well. No stutter. Best game in the world
18916,love it
18917,Despite being so old it is still a good game (with mods).
18918,"If you don't know why this game is 10/10, you must not get to the cloud district very often."
18919,"Take the leveling away please! Then this would be just as playable as any Doom game is/was. FPS mixed genre with RPG (leveling) just doesn't make enough since and doesn't go well together (same as RTS and FPS.. just doesn't work). I can barely recommend this game due to this fact. Good graphics, weapon/magics selection, and story however. Only a single player game; does not have multiplayer co-op PvE or PvP stuff. 7 out of 10, good game"
18920,"still buggy but thats kinda part of the fun, still good to get into today"
18921,I was forced to write this
18922,Skyrim got an elixir of immortality in case of 60k mods. That means you never get bored of this game. It's a master piece with a magical art design.
18923,Almost ten years after release and this game still has a special place in my heart. Pure escapist bliss.
18924,Great classic game. Its definitely a must have!
18925,Unlimited potential with mods and unlimited bugs.
18926,It's Skyrim
18927,if you haven't played this game already you are not a living being.
18928,Iz cash yo
18929,"The only reason I bought this and not special edition was because i couldn't run special edition on my old pc. With that said this is still a great game, even on my new higher end pc i still like this one because im a sucker for older games and the graphics for this game just hit the spot. All the dlc are still full priced even on sales which kinda sucks but im ok with it. Overall, you will probably end up spending more money on this than the special edition, but if you like the feel of the older graphics and maybe even need this one because you can't run special edition then go for it."
18930,Amazing
18931,relist the game fuckers
18932,"its skyrim, do i really need to say more"
18933,Less of an rpg then its predecessor but the world and story telling interactions make up for the change. I highly recommend this game to any action rpg fans.
18934,"If you like to quest and produce,this is the game!"
18935,is good
18936,"498 hours, oh i don't know what do you think!"
18937,Skyrim is so good it completely ruined all other RPGs for me meaning that i can't enjoy the others nearly as much as before.
18938,ok ok game
18939,its good. buy it
18940,just...amazing.
18941,Hodd Toward is watching me.
18942,.
18943,"Shit without mods, barelly works without unofficial patches but god damn amazing if you have some patience for moding. On it's own not worth wasting time though"
18944,"good game
"
18945,"This game was the best of its generation. An almost flawless game with lots of character options, factions, etc..."
18946,i just love game
18947,Original Skyrim! I am so glad I bought this instead of the remastered version. I don't have a gaming PC so this is easy on my system too!
18948,its alright
18949,Fus Ro Dah Lydia off a cliff. 10/10
18950,"Dude, it's Skyrim."
18951,just play it if you like open world games
18952,"ive been playing skyrim since it came out across multiple consoles and every few months its one of the few games i can always come back to. It means a lot to me, and it might be nostalgia but i hope it can bring others the comfort its brought me through some really tough times."
18953,"Amazing Game, great story and really fun to play again and again. Some mods have issues and skyrim has a few bugs but other than that, great game, 9/10"
18954,"The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is the first Elder Scrolls game AND the first bethesda game I ever played. I first played it on xbox 360 and had to buy it on PC of course. No doubt this is one of the greatest video games I have ever played, I to this day have never beaten all of the quests in the game. The only bad thing about the experience is that I only get to live through it the first time once."
18955,The game is just all around fun and great
18956,Mods.
18957,Great game deserves all the praise that it gets.  I own it on almost every device it's been released on
18958,I just wish Bethesda didn't unlist the game.

18967,What's more to say than the success of this game speaks for itself.
18968,"Unlisted, but who cares. If you somewhat able to read this and without my buying the game, then here is my review. It is an epic game. Hearthfire adds I think home making elements. Dragonborn new dragon stuff. Dawnguard vampire shit. I enjoy the mods created by the community. Very epic."
18969,"Game of the decade for me, with mods possibly game of the century. An undying specimen of entertainment. Huge shout out to the modding community for giving me and other players hundreds of hours of new game mechanics, story elements, weapons/armor and even new lands to explore."

18982,love this game ever since i was a kid ive followed the series.
18983,Literally one of the greatest and most influential games in the history of gaming and modding. Nuff said.
18984,Best game for mods
18985,Very Good
18986,It's a very fun game that has infinite possibilities. Modding is also very easy to do too which adds an extra level of depth and makes the game even more fun.
18987,"I can download a mod for whatever my sick mind desires but if I alt tab out of the game it becomes unplayable.
10/10 would give Todd Howard my money again

18999,"I mean, its skyrim."
19000,Do caralho
19001,very good
19002,The earth is 4.6 billion years old and we managed to exist at the same time as this masterpiece.

19005,Issa gud game
19006,bad
19007,skyrim is such an immersive world to live in.
19008,"I've played this game for years and i still haven't seen everything and that's with DLC deactivated, there's so much to do and the quests and lore make it worth playing."
19009,Go fight the first giant you see.
19010,It's Skyrim do I really need to say more
19011,amazing

19021,"it is very good
"
19022,Very rough but overall a good time. Lots of things to do and the mods can give so much more to it. Absolutely worth it.
19023,Greatest game of all time. Must-have for everyone's steam library.
19024,The Lusty Argonian Maid.... nuff said
19025,very pog.
19026,Good story. But many bugs.
19027,TESV is one of the best pieces of art to grace this godawful hellhole of a planet. I played this thing so hard on my old PS3 that the disk started to shit itself and dialogue started mismatching. I probably have like 4k hours on Skyrim with that baby. Just a solid gem of a game and a helluva ride throughout. I couldn't possibly recommend it more.
19028,Expansive game which can be replayed multiple times. With so much to do you could log hundreds of hours of gameplay and still enjoy finding new quests to complete. A complete RPG completely worth playing for any fan of RPG's.
19029,it good
19030,great game
19031,yea
19032,"Great open world solo game. if you run on lowspec PC let system define game as LOW then increase all item, and object and grass fade as 6 or 8 then game looks good enough to play on your laptop or set to High on your desktop to get a slightly better look. I enjoy doing all side quests, hence 1000 hours - and still going"
19033,Pfft. As if anyone still needs to read a review before playing Skyrim these days.
19034,amazing. fond memories. glued to the screen for hours on end
19035,"Good game, ngl. We all know how good Skyrim is, much applause for Todd Howard and flying horses. :clap clap:"
19036,This will forever and always be the best game of all time.
19037,Its good
19038,"amazing story line, I recommend the whole franchise"
19039,Best game ever for a easy rpg lover
19040,This game is quite fun but can be quite hard
19041,"oh my god, this is one of the most captivating games i've ever played.
 soundtrack is amazing, gameplay is quite diverse depending on what you decide to do, and oh my there are so many things you can do. so many quests, factions, armors, weapons, spells, enchantments, artifacts, and the dlc adds even more of those things.
 oh and there are so many mods, so if you get bored of all the default crap, just, like, you know, install 170 mods no big deal.
 of course with all of the good things, there are downsides, mainly being glitches, oh so many glitches.
 all in all it's a good game, and i've enjoyed all of my 7-8 months with this game."
19042,fuego
19043,"Very nice game, with mods even better. Special Edition has better graphics but has no Workshop support and is harder to mod. Skyrim Together does work on SE better however, but is still functional on this version."
19044,its amazing
19045,"Its an awesome game i do recommend it.

The only issue i have with the game it needs updates on bugs that is the only issue i have so far with it."
19046,"Even after all these years, I can still come back to this game and have so much fun, all the different DLCs are great as well and worth playing through."
19047,"this game is the bomb back when I was a high school student 

one of the best game ive ever played"
19048,"My review cant really say anything that hasn't already been said by a million other reviews.
Just buy the damn game already"
19049,This is a modern classic of the most epic nature.
19050,Would Fus Ro Dah your Mom all over again.
19051,This game is fun.
19052,"Solid action RPG 
Countless hours of gameplay
"
19053,"Amazing game, definitely one worthy of being in the hall of fame. (I haven't bought the special edition, but this game has decent graphics despite being made in 2011) Story and gameplay are really fun～！"
19054,I really liked the open space and the amount of detail put into the game :D
19055,I have over 700 hours on this game..it's one of the best games ever and especially with mods and a graphics enb
19056,I still havn't done everything there is to do in this game. 10/10
19057,"Todd's greatest creation since the Creation Kit. Where would we be without this game. Obviously all the memes on this game has truth to it, and ol' Todd unlisted this since he came up with Skyrim Electric Bogaaloo  which is prettier and runs higher FPS without glitches. But hey, if you are able to read this then you already have this game and only check this page for the nostalgia."
19058,f****** awesome
19059,"Despite the fact that Bethesda has slowly fallen to the old parable about living too long, Skyrim is one of those games that it wouldn't be strange to have put 1k+ hours into with mods.  At this point you know what you're getting into with it so I'll forgo any details, but if you still haven't played it, it's worth picking up.  Just make sure to get Oldrim rather than SE."
19060,Good game. Recommended for people who cannot run the Special Edition.
19061,Got it from g2a is amazing but special edition is gonna be better later
19062,Very good game. I love it.
19063,"Excellent game despite its age, the mod really enhance the layout and graphics of the game a pity the game developers never took the effort when the realease the special edition to include them directly it does make a great game. 
hours of game ahead really great and offer plenty of different game play style"
19064,"Wait, there's a main quest line?"
19065,loved it
19066,"What's not to love about Skyrim... massive open world where you can follow your own path and take whatever turn you like. Be a warrior, necromancer or stealth archer, ride dragons, and kill dragons, get drunk at inn and get in bar fight, or take to helping the Daedra in their machinations. There are some bugs, and the graphics are getting more dated, but there's so much to do and so fewboundaries to stop you."
19067,"I absolutely love the massive content and versatility of game play
"
19068,"Best game that I've ever played, it is well worth the cost and dlc's are a must. You can mod it to look next-gen and have amazing new features, only downside is that it is a little buggy. 10/10"
19069,"This game, while it came out a while ago now, is timeless. There is always something else to do, as well as having the steam interface to mod accordingly, which allows for creativity in the game. Love it."
19070,good vey good
19071,love this game alot
19072,great game
19073,At this point you know if you're interested in Skyrim or not. It's a massive open world RPG with okay combat and storytelling but all the freedom in the world. Enjoy.
19074,"""What is better? To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?""

19075,"An open world RPG game with something for everyone. So many possibilities and so many new adventures to be had. Replaying with different characters and taking on different paths. Best part any one can mod this game to make it even more immersive. Now there are few bugs as being a bethesda game but with the modding community releasing fixes you really won't have much trouble. And don't worry there are no cursed quest breaking bugs like in other RPG games such as Fall Out New Vegas or Kingdom Come Deliverance. Let's take a look at pros and cons. 

[b]PROS[b]
- Amazing optimization with graphics holding up really well. Even better it can be modded to have even more realistic graphics. 

- The RPG elements are done well, the game play, music branching paths and atmosphere. As usual you can mod these as well to your liking and even add modded quests to enjoy something new. 

- Variety of weapons and magic to choose to make a build to you liking. Again you can easily mod more weapons into the game wit out breaking the games immersion.  

- Both DLC are amazing in their own way. Dragonborn DLC where you get an entire new map for you to explore with new abilities, weapons, explorations and side quests. Dawnguard has the most memorable characters and the most unique weapons and magical abilities. Both DLCs can give you so many hours of playtime on top the massive playtime of the base game. 
   
[b]CONS[b]
- Story is ... not that interesting. Even worse most of the characters you meet in your main quest are boring as well. You can pretty much ignore and do your won thing in the game but it's better to do the main quest along the way as well to gain access to abilities and certain areas of the map.

- Combat is extremely unengaging. It is a wack fest with who can out chug potions or out heal the most. Sure you can mix in a shield or magic in your off hand but even then it is still not that engaging. Going full two handed weapons is depressingly boring. You can heavily mod the combat mechanics but the vanilla combat just fails. 

[b]FINAL NOTES[b]
If you like RPG games ES5: skyrim is definitely a must have in your library. It is a game where you can just relax and immerse yourself in this new world full of different adventures and possibilities. And if you don't like that world or wanna improve it even more know that you can easily and safely mod the game."
19076,"Great missions, graphics, game play and open world environment"
19077,9 years and multiple re-releases later its still ridden with bugs
19078,"Very fun and open-world game, the puzzles in the dungeons are not half bad either. Overall a good game 10 out of 10."
19079,"I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee."
19080,"Duh, it's Skyrim."
19081,"A Good game better than the sse version if you know how to bash patch and use tesv:edit(xedit sub prog) for cleaning 
unfortunately bethesda knew how to create the framework but best thing they ever did was giving it to us modders. again even in 2020 if modded well amazing! really special."
19082,"Best game I ever played. This was the game that made me addicted to video games and I have bought it on multiple platforms. I have spent countless hours in the realm, doing small side quests that lead you on a thrilling adventure. 10/10 in my books."
19083,"No matter what kind of character you set out to make, you will always end up as a sneaky kleptomaniac archer.
You'll also make for a fine rug, cat. 
10/10"
19084,THANKS TOD
19085,"This is a game I was waiting to get on sale, but Bethesda is too stupid to put the original Skyrim on sale so I bought the game for it's price and I must say, I was surprised. This game has a bunch of replay value and so much to do. It beats so many other openworld games like Far Cry and GTA V. This is mainly because… you can go anywhere. You see that house, normally in games like Far Cry and GTA V you can only open doors that are involved in quests or stories but in Skyrim, no. Plus the story never gets boring. There is so much lore involved that you just want to hear every character dialogue. The gameplay might be bland- actually really bad- especially for a person who has Dying Light as their favorite game. But there is something called mods to fix this issue. I’m not really a fan of mods because of how buggy, how many times it makes the game crash, and the mod conflicts- a few simple mods can help. Plus, the game never gets boring. Everyday something new happens. That is something that very few games have (one of the few games is Far Cry 5, that game was trash.) You might encounter something new that you've never seen before. Or you might even stumble upon your new favorite weapon. Skyrim is a very unique game. And nobody is going to read my review anyways so I’m not going to say more.

19086,"I LOVE SKYRIM SO MUCH

19095,"I, like hundreds of thousands of other people, have sinked hundreds of hours into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Having the largest modding community in the gaming industry, Skyrim is a game that you can play for hundreds of hours if you find the right mods."
19096,It's Skyrim. It is kinda famous. Buy it and you wont be disappointed.
19097,Good
19098,good game
19099,"Played a ton on xbox, back to it on pc.. one of the best games you will ever play"
19100,yes
19101,"yum 
"
19102,"even in 2020 it still holds its own as one of my favourite games, hundreds of hours of game play, and a great story behind it too. recommend it to anyone that likes single player RPG's"
19103,Hours upon hours of fun
19104,It's like comfort food in game form.  Anytime i think about this game I have to reinstall it and play again.
19105,good game
19106,"Hello, if your looking to buy a game make sure to get this one because its an open world game and there are lots of new places to discover with me having a 1000 hrs yes you should get this game. Thank you for reading this review
"
19107,"It was so fun, I enjoyed every hour playing this."
19108,"Modded it to hell, broke it, and now have to start over again. 10/10 would mod again."
19109,good game
19110,bethesda should release this 45 more times
19111,It's Skyrim!
19112,Best game ever created hands down
19113,Game good drug bad
19114,Classic of Classic
19115,Not bad
19116,"It's Skyrim, what else can be said?"
19117,gamer game
19118,"Great game. Classic.
But you might as well get the special edition..
How many times can they resell this game?"
19119,Absolute masterpiece i recommend everyone play this game at least once and give it a chance.
19120,"Overall a good game, but do not expect the complexity of the previous Elder Scrolls Games. This is what Fallout 4 was for Fallout 3. Overall a good  game, with new mechanics you can play with, but mostly for the cost of both the gameplay and roleplay elements."
19121,"ME SHOUT MYESSS
"
19122,"You feel very lonely in the game. After a while, NPCs are like garbage. 2min ago, I killed a dragon in front of them and sucked the soul, and I went somewhere, and the guy says, ""Hey, you, we don't like strangers around here. who are you?"" Ass, you just shouted,"" Long Live dragonborn, you saved us."
19123,just an epic game
19124,very fun game. you can invest hours into this game without even getting bored. would 100% recommend.
19125,Great Game!
19126,"I have been playing through Skyrim repeatedly since 2013.And I usually start as different race each time.
I have thought about trying the Skyrim SE as I was able to get it free from Nexus.But, I haven,t yet.
I like this game because my char can travel all around Skyrim with no loading screens,except when passing through a gate or door."
19127,The game is fun but it would suck without mods.
19128,If you have Win 10 it's a constant crash out to desk top. I tried all the support suggestions and still crashes. I have a gaming rig with ultimate everything and even with the change to reduced settings still crashes. Really disappointed. Didn't play 61 hours ????
19129,"stabbed a couple people, kinda good tbh, too many important people i can barely slaughter an entire city without being cucked by some dumbass people important to a quest"
19130,One of the greatest video games ever made (once you install a grip of mods)!
19131,.
19132,"Great Adventure spend hours lost in the world, brilliant for modding
"
19133,"Listen, I have played this on Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and here on Steam. I don't have a life. I have played through different characters so many times. In different lines. I dunno man. I'd keep playing this game."
19134,absolutely love the game

19136,"seems decent
"
19137,Timeless
19138,"It's skyrim. 2020 people are still playing it.

Try to laern how to install mods, and install graphic mods. The game will look stunning, like next-gen 4K quality."
19139,Loved the game but bethesda is a pack of scumbags

19143,"By now, if you know, you know. This game is a masterpiece in its own right"
19144,"""You've finally awakened...""
This is Skyrim and no there are no car rims in the sky. This is an adventure RPG from Bugthesda and is a good game to mess around in with mods or roleplay as a character you want to be.
Now if you will excuse me, I will go murder a giant with my Potato Launcher."
19145,I used to be an gamer like you but then I spilted my drink on my laptop but still pretty good game
19146,bro
19147,too many places :(
19148,"very nice
"
19149,One of the best games I've ever played. Highly recommended with mods though
19150,spend more time in mod manager instead of the game
19151,Favorite game of all time
19152,"So good I was willing to restart the game more than five times when the save file corrupted, now I'm working through a backlog of other games before I return to Skyrim."
19153,nice
19154,Why...
19155,Come on what can I say? It's Skyrim!
19156,I used to leave my house like you... then I took a skyrim in the knee.
19157,Elder scroll
19158,yes
19159,"Very bad game, I was in australia when i played it and the game burnt the entire country when I tried to use Igni at that part where you have to kill the Lich King while he kills Todd Howard."
19160,water flciekrs
19161,just look at hours
19162,"So, I've played this game for a few hundred hours, and I'm still trying new things.  The game has a lot to keep one occupied.  And the goodly amount of mods helps to keep the game from becoming stale."
19163,10/10 have bought again
19164,:-)
19165,"The game is old and looks a little rough in some areas but you can't deny the open-world experience and the many quests there are. If you like exploring and you've never played this game before, this could be the game for you!"
19166,Perfect.
19167,"Love the everything

with mods
"
19173,rly good game
19174,Epic adventures.
19175,Who the FUCK made Warframe?!
19176,"Had a couple hundred hours on the PS3 before finally transitioning over to the computer.  I probably can't say anything about this game that hasn't already been said.  The game is old enough now that most computers should be able to run it without issues.  It holds its worth even after all these years, and it's one of those games that after a decade you can still come back to and spend another 100 hours in.  There are some really amazing mods out there in the community (for free and for purchase) that can add new layers of depth, fix annoying hiccups, or streamline/improve aspects of gameplay that needed a little love.
Basically, if you like open worlds and fantasy-themed stories, why haven't you bought this yet?"
19177,"A great game to pick once or twice a year, install 50GB of mods and then not actually play the game.
10/10"
19178,Just play it.
19179,.
19180,"Good game.

God i hate Serana from The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim expansion pack Dawnguard.
the first time you find her in daycare, the game wont let you kill the vampire whore. it forces you to babysit her back to her ugly Leatherman daddy. she is the most autistic follower in the game. something is fucking wrong with this whore. she will interact with anything she can. she will sit on chairs, that's fine. but she will also take over a fucking forge and start forging fresh blades. you don't work here bitch, get out. If you are standing still the attention slut will walk right up in front of your face and stare at you until you play again. this bitch is demented. The devs clearly gave her a lot of unique follower dialogue and they love to show it to you. she will say a one liner anytime she can. ""i don't know how you can stand the sun"" bitch I'm not a vampire that's how. ""uh its sunny can we go in a cave"" fine, ""uh, a cave. i spent so much time  in a cave that i don't want to go in. but I'll follow you"" bitch make up your mind. I don't know why there's a million mods on the nexus for this whore in specific. don't they see she's autistic?"
19181,tis good ye faggots
19182,screm
19183,GoodGame
19184,i mean you have skyrim then you have skyrim but i prefer skyrim rather than skyrim in my personal opinion
19185,It's Skyrim
19186,Best game ive ever played period. Best replayablilty w modding as well.
19187,"its cool
"
19188,"Though I gave a thumbs-up, I honestly feel that Skyrim is overrated. 

It's fun for a while - but it actually has some annoying issues that people always overlook. 

There are so many side quests, locations, and small distractions that it is overwhelming and I am too overwhelmed to be able to finish the actual story. Because there is /so much/ content in this game, it actually makes it /less/ enjoyable for me. Admittedly, I often prefer more linear story based games, but Skyrim is just so inexplicably overwhelming that it's boring. 

That being said, I do have 85 hours of play time at the moment, so I would say that it is definitely worth the money. I almost dread trying to figure out to do next when I play, though. Maybe I'm just way too easily distracted, but it really does get extremely overwhelming sometimes."
19189,"skyrim is my favorite game of all time and the people who mod it are amazing.

good memories of a time before Bethesda went full EA"
19190,Well worth playing through at least once.  Many weeks (or months) worth of great game-play content.
19191,I live here now. Always and forever
19192,good
19193,i enjoy this game a lot. the base game is kind of bleh but if you like to make your games harder or want to add new races and abilities this one is perfect for that. plus you can always find new things in it if you mod it right
19194,"Well, it has been 9 years since it was released. The gold mine for Bethesda, who decided to drink up every >juicy< dollar out of it. Bethesda is bleeding, but Skyrim is a very funny game nevertheless. [spoiler]I know that anyone will see this review 'cause of >>SKYRIM 2<<[/spoiler]"
19195,YEZ!!!!!!
19196,"is a lot of fun, dungeons respawn after a time, seems quests never end, side quests are plentifull

great game to waste some time on
"
19197,This is my favorite game of all time! Its replay-ability as well as extensive mods make fr a new adventure every time.
19198,!!!
19199,VERY good game.
19200,"Why buy Special Edition when you can still get codes for Legendary Edition? Use this link to the official High Resolution DLC. https://store.steampowered.com/sub/13437/

Definitely worth grabbing the High Resolution DLC. I use it with the 2k textures mod and the Static Mesh Improvement Mod. Links below: 
2k Textures: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607
Static Mesh Improvement: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11832

You'll probably want the script extender too: 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/365720/Skyrim_Script_Extender_SKSE/

And Bruma is an awesome fan made DLC that integrates perfectly into the original game and official DLC packs, it adds the northern region of Cyrodiil to Skyrim complete with fresh quests and professional level voice acting. Link below: 
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84946 

In my opinion the above are all you need to create the ultimate Skyrim experience. 

Hope this helps. 
"
19201,Best RPG game ever ! A must have !
19202,"This is my favorite game. The base game itself is a little lacking in the combat department, but mods fix that right up. Honestly, Skyrim is a timeless game and I hope I can convince people to pick it up. Epic story, environments, and countless ways to customize your character to fit the exact play style you'd want from a fantasy world."
19203,fus ro dah
19204,"The game is only good when you spend 3 hours installing mods beforehand, foreplay with Todd."
19205,"Skyrim is a disappointment, but you need the base game to play Enderal."
19206,"I don't know what are you doing down here. You aren't supposed to read reviews of Skyrim in 2020! Just buy it if it's on sale. 

Aren't you convinced yet? So listen.
This game has so much to offer 4 everyone. Exploring, crafting, innovative skills system(in 2014 at least), combat and [b] soundtrack&climat [/b] . Everything has been made properly, or even better.
Well, except plot. Main story is actually terribly boring.

BUT
If you re still keen to discover world's secrets and experience nice stories you should try:
>Dark brotherhood storyline
>Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC's
>Whole story of Thief guild and nightingales
>Quests given by this old guy on far south-southeast(about killing legendary ghost animals)
>Solving the mystery of ghost rider




No man can avoid playing in glorius The Elders Scrolls V

19224,"I am just gonna come out and say this. Skyrim is a fun game. It really is. But the stiffness in the gameplay is just a bit too offputting. But heres a list anyways.

Pros: 
Great story
Different ways to progress
Endless amounts of mod support.
Fun combat system
Remembarable NPC's
Memes?
Ok Graphics?
Not too hard not too easy.

Cons: 
Stiffness in gameplay.
Slow progression.
Caves....caves.....
Deluxe edition can steal your souls if you're slow like me
gets boring quick."
19225,"OG Skyrim best Skyrim, more mods on this version as well."
19226,Its skyrim so 10/10 xD

19228,it's heckin' skyrim
19229,dope
19230,i liked it
19231,"a challenging and adventurous game that you can loose yourself for hours in and still have more to do. if you decide you want to start a new game and try something else, focusing on quest lines in towns can help you learn the cultures and unique lives of the individuals. was very thought out. wish they had more variety in avatar creation and some more voice actors to make it feel less like a game and more like a real world but all in all id give it a 8/10. one of my favorites."
19232,"good game
"
19233,"Let's be honest, I made this review for awards."
19234,sick game
19235,"For me, ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" is a very special game that came out at just the right time to blow me out of the water and introduce me to a world I had never seen the scope of before in a video game.

At around the time this title released, I was unimpressed with the gaming industry. I was losing interest in what felt like an uninspired and commercial medium that praised mediocrity and shunned creative people for thinking outside the box. Really, I wasn't planning on playing much of anything related to video games because I felt I was getting to be a bit too old for them and wanted to focus on other things. For some reason, though, I gave ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" a shot, and haven't looked back since. Although not a perfect game, the sheer awe it filled me with has stayed with me to this very day. This is the game that rekindled my passion for the art form of video games when I was faltering on whether I wanted to continue even being interested in playing them anymore. It gave me hope, and for that reason, of course I share a bit more bias for a game like this over others, but truly, it was magical when this game hit the scene. It helped reinforce my belief that video games were an art form, not just a way to waste time or escape reality, as there is much you can get out of playing an experience that you just can't get anywhere else.

The stark and cold environment of Skyrim is not one which should inspire wonder and amazement in me, yet it does every single time I revisit the world. Usually, when I am introduced to a game that takes place in a snowy or desert environment, I am immediately skeptical. These sorts of environments lend themselves to boring design and lots of one color everywhere you look. Some games excel at making this interesting, however, and this is one of them. Although there is a fair amount of snowy land, Skyrim is a continent, and so it has different biomes and the like for one to traverse so you don't get visually burnt out as you tread along on your journey. Though the Nordic ruins are an abundant dungeon type, there are enough of the other types of more well thought out areas to explore that it makes up for this and, again, keeps you from getting burnt out. Truly, even today, Skyrim is a very beautiful living and breathing world, especially if one finds the right modifications made by the community to fix the weaker textures within the game. ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition"" did an alright job, but for a truly enhanced experienced, the prior is the way to go.

Although there are some fairly lame and filler miscellaneous quests placed here to keep you playing the game for longer than necessary, a majority of the main and side quests are phenomenal and very creative. The main quest takes you on a journey to save the continent from the reawakening of the dragon menace led by Alduin, a figurehead of their movement, and comes to a close when you face him in the ethereal Sovngarde. The civil war side quest sees you choose the side of the Stormcloaks or Imperials, both of which are flawed but strong presences in province, and aiding in the battle against the other may lead to better change made from within, so long as you pick the ""better"" option, or depending on how you look at it, lesser evil. The Companions questline sees you intermingle with warriors of glory and werewolves, of which have hid their secrets well. The Thieves Guild is more or less what it sounds like, but goes deeper than you'd think as you begin to restore it back to its former glory. The other factions, such as The Dark Brotherhood and The College of Winterhold, hold equally as interesting storylines worth investing time in.

Some of the best side quests, however, are the ones that are done under the request (or demand) of a Daedric Prince. These are the most memorable to me because, unlike the rest that are based on factions, you are acting under a deity with its own morals and guidance, which are usually self-serving, but it provides one with plenty of unique situations and moral dilemmas when you are asked carry out a controversial task. When looking back, I love a lot of what this game has to offer, but there are valid complaints that surface when looking at this game critically. For one, there are tedious missions. Even excluding the miscellaneous tasks, there are still a few side quests with interesting stories but gameplay that doesn't stack up. Often, you are going one place, killing said group of men or beasts, and then returning to the quest giver for a reward. This is fine, but this game doesn't always make the effort to spruce that up in any meaningful way. There's also the fact that there are more uninteresting and placeholder non-playable characters than there aren't, which can be talked to for a small, copy-and-pasted quip, but otherwise, are just there. Again, this would be fine, but when there are so many one-dimensional characters that you can talk to, then it starts to break the illusion. Other smaller but potent issues include the unimpressive way in which the game adjusts difficulty and the abundant amount of glitches, which are funny at times, but shouldn't be forgiven so easily.

Overall, I am a huge fan of this game. The environments, the dungeons, the lore, and so on made this game a standout at the time it was released, as it felt like it had this respect for the consumer that few other games that were so mainstream did. Although my opinion on this company has most definitely shifted, this was released when being a Bethesda fan was not such a bad thing to be. This may be their only game in this style I think is a classic, as their interpretations of ""Fallout"" have been pretty good and immersive at best and offensive and bland at worst. Somehow, they did something truly phenomenal with ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"", and that is hard to deny. Even almost a decade later, so many people are still enjoying it and creating their own worlds and stories within this title, and it really is an impressive feat.

[RATING: 9.3/10]"
19236,A game I always comeback to. With the help of mods and role playing ofc.
19237,"One of my all time favorite games! There's so much possibility that's undiscovered! One might think that this sort of game can get boring once everything has been explored, but the mods that exist in the steam workshop continually make this game all the more fun and interesting. I really recommend it!"
19238,"its pretty fun, you should mod it though."
19239,It's Skyrim dammit!! GET THE GAME!!!
19240,Great game
19241,very good
19242,dont buy skyrim
19243,So much to do and can have so much fun while doing it. Never played a game I enjoyed as much as this game.
19244,"this

19245,dragon go brrrr
19246,.
19247,My favourite game of all time
19248,Thanks MXR.
19249,"I mean... This game has been memed into oblivion, but there's still a lot here to enjoy, especially with the mods available from Nexus. It's broken as shit, but at least the community fixed all the bugs that Bethesda wouldn't. Bethsoft probably doesn't deserve your money for this, but if it's on sale for dirt cheap you might as well give it a try."
19250,"If you don't have it, you're not a gamer.
Do yourself a favor and buy it. 





Why are you still reading reviews? Buy it you uncultured troglodyte! Jesus...."
19251,I LIKE IT
19252,ITS FREAKIN GREAT
19253,very fun
19254,"....I mean what could I say that already hasn't been said about Skyrim? I think sometimes the real quality of this game gets lost in current events and internet jokes. True, this game has some issues that have made me burst out laughing. But the actual game itself is enjoyable, if somewhat easy. This is a weird review, as I would recommend you try it and draw your own conclusions. Mods or not. Your choice.

Final Grade: You decide"
19255,"todd howard made me buy this game at gunpoint even tho i bought it on the 360, its good tho"
19256,"I love to come back to this game after 2 year breaks only to download 90 mods that make the game crash every 2 mins...

but otherwise its pretty great!"
19257,Yes.
19258,"Man, i put so many hours in this game on pc and console and i cant. just get oblivion or morrowind unless your have a negative iq then sure burn your money. shit just aint really fun man ngl. you cant do ""anything"" you need mods to do most ""fun"" stuff. you can do anything in morrowind and you got more freedom in oblivion at least mechanically."
19259,"New builds, roleplay, and story lines make this game incredibly fun and infinitely replayable."

19269,JUST BUY THE GAME. If you have a low end pc this is the one but if you have a decent pc buy special edition as it has all dlcs while this one you have to buy them separately and this edition along with the dlcs never go on sale which of course is todd howard's courtesy
19270,เกมในตำนานอีกเกมหนึ่งที่รันได้แม้เครื่องสเป็กต่ำ มีเนื้อเรื่องหลักที่น่าติดตามให้ความรู้สึกเหมือนเป็นฮีโร่กอบกู้โลก อีกทั้งเนื้อเรื่องเสริมอื่น ๆ อีกมากมายที่น่าสนใจไม่แพ้กัน มีเควสและดันเจี้ยนนับไม่ถ้วนให้ค้นหาระหว่างการเดินทาง ระบบต่าง ๆ เข้าใจได้ไม่ยากแต่พวกเวทมนตร์ค่อนข้างซ้ำซากไม่หวือหวา และท้ายที่สุดหากคุณเล่นไปแล้วเริ่มเบื่อเกมเพลย์แบบเดิม ๆ เกมนี้มี Mod นับหมื่นที่พร้อมจะประเคนให้คุณดัดแปลงมันให้กลายเป็นเกม RPG ในอุดมคติแบบที่คุณต้องการ

19273,"This game is super fun and has great quests, i recment it for 10-9 and up, It has some parts where its a little icky but that's okay bec the game makes up for it"

19288,endless fun
19289,"It's Skyrim, you already own it"
19290,"Pros: Good graphics, solid gameplay

Cons: They re released this game and did not give me accesss (special edition) I feel ripped off seeing how i paid full price when this game came out. Gets boring if you want to replay. Has no replay value.

Other thoughts: Buy special edition if its on SALE only!"
19291,its skyrim
19292,skyrim
19293,Amazing game had it on other systems.
19294,"No matter how many times they resale this game, i will ALWAYS re-get it and love it!!!"
19295,I love the Elder Scroll series. Very much like a table top RPG
19296,omg its great
19297,Even in 2020 one of the best games ever made. Fanmade mods make this game worth even more. Recomend 10/10
19298,"Without mods: Eh ok. Quite some fun and a lot of content. Including the typical ""features"" Bethesta is known for 

With mods: Damn fantastic. The sky is the limit."
19299,"My favorite game, really distresses me and I love all the mods."
19300,A classic game. So much to discover and great replayability. Can't go wrong with Skyrim.
19301,fantastic game
19302,"Amazing game, classic, best of the series of games so far. Cant wait to see what the future holds for the next game. Well worth buying!"
19303,It's fun. Once got obsessed with it for a week and when I walked out of my house I heard the game music. Very immersive. I only play in spurts now.
19304,"Its Skyrim , do i really need to Explain anymore?"
19305,"Steam is holding me hostage and forcing me to rate games that I only have 56 hours on, please help."
19306,Oh yes i would it`s fabulous u will love it the best game ever
19307,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the first game of the Elder Scrolls series I've played and I'm quite impressed.
I've spent around 300+ hours between different platforms and between Skyrim (Vanilla + DLC's) and Skyrim Special Edition.
Starting with the graphics, they are very good for a 2011 game. Although you can find very low resolution and pixelated meshes on rocks, ruins, clutter, roads and other environmental details.
The setting takes place on a medieval fantasy world with magic, dragons, deities, and other mythical creatures.
The gameplay is really good on the RPG style. From the way you improve your skills, simply by using them, to the range of the abilities you have at your disposal, although, at the long run, you can be a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-all.
You can play the game on first or third person POV, but I found the third person to be a bit weird and noticed the game is more optimised to play on the first view.
There are countless quests to do, from the main story, to the DLC's, several factions, and the never ending radiant quests.
The story is about the return of the dragons, and you are the dragonborn, who can absorb dragon souls and use powerful shouts which you learn through the game.
This is one of the few games I can rate 10/10.
Good work Bethesda!"
19308,bug but its gud
19309,"Before you crucify me, hear me out. Someone is more likely to read a negative review than a positive. This game is in a grey area. It's Bethesda, so something as simple as following a main quest becomes a broken mess, but the fan mods make this game worth some money. I would wait ONLY for a really good sale if you're curious. Just be warned, I have had so many soft locks in this game that some quests cant be completed. Listen, back in 2013, this game was something amazing. If bugs happens, it's frustrating, but they might fix it. This review is in 2020 and Bethesda has re-released this game EXACTLY as it was in 2013 (bugs and all) with no patches, but a ""Creation Club"" for mods people have already given out for free. Just, flip a coin on this or something, just don't get over hyped."
19310,"Great RPG. Clocked most of my hours on console before getting it on PC. Endless hours of pure exploration, lore and storytelling."
19311,"9 Years on and this game is still among one of my favorites. Bugs and crashes happen of course, but this is a Bethesda game! patches and fixes by the many talented patrons of this game are available for free. 
I'm writing this review as I recently decided to revisit the game and do the one play-through I never have; 
Stealth Archer

I know you're staring in disbelief at this, but as a teenager playing this game I always tried to stay away from that play style. Friends and family all told me about how fun it is, how cheese it is, and everything that you most likely already know about stealth archery. But I always stuck to the fighter classes, and occasionally battle mage, modding the game to make combat more difficult and souls like. Every play through ended the same though, I would pitter patter through, bash faces, and get destroyed in close melee with the difficult bosses. 
But ohhhh man, now that I'm replaying as the revered stealth archer, I see the true reason everyone raved about it. It has opened up a completely new door for me in Skyrim, and I intend to actually take this character to Max Level. 9/10, the crashes and bugs are the only downside, but hey, us Bethesda players are used to that. Worth picking up and especially at Steam Sale prices, if you've never played (But who the hell hasn't played Skyrim by now? BUY IT)"
19312,"Skyrim itself is a fun experience that'll give you quite a few hours of enjoyment, but the real fun of the game comes from the passionate modding community. They're the reason I always find myself coming back to do another play through of the game. Skyrim 7/10. Skyrim Modding community 11/10."
19313,"really fun game would recommend to anyone who wants to try out a good exploration game.
"
19314,You will be coming back to this game no matter what...
19315,There aren't many perfect games out there.
19316,This game was ahead of its time. One of the greatest games ever made. Many hours on disc and even xbox. A whole new world with stunning detail
19317,everysingle bit of this game I like
19318,awsome game no matter how old it gets always go back to it
19319,I've completed this game 5 times and I don't regret any time wasted. Just saying
19320,Great game. Still enjoy it after all these years.
19321,meh
19322,Brilliant all round!
19323,Deserved all the Credit it gets. Timeless. Masterpiece.
19324,I'm a dragonborn and I killed a chicken - now I'm a prisoner.
19325,Just an awesome game! Loving it
19326,It just works.

19328,"Why would you not play Skyrim? There's a reason Bethesda keeps milking this cow for everything it's worth. Great gameplay, fantastic scenery, fun characters, glitches--I mean fun, unexpected features...this game always wins a thumbs up from me."
19329,"Its big, its beautiful and full of so much to do!"
19330,k
19331,Good!
19332,awful combat mechanics but fun and immersive overall

19335,just horse
19336,gh
19337,I don't know why they bother to still have reviews I mean for fuck's sake Bethesda has released this game so many fucking times I'm pretty sure everyone and their grandmother owns it by now... but yeah it's a good game.
19338,A cultural phenomenon
19339,most of my hours are on xbone but a classic non the less.
19340,"its very glitchy and annoying but i got some improvment mods and it was incredible, very fun game."
19341,"Oh the good ole days were one could climb a mountain with a follower in toe only to ""Shout"" them to their doom... 

Sadly I rarely ever found the corpses after climbing back down. 

Oh and don't do what I did... Ride a horse over the mountain or at least don't do it with the bad-ass horse you get after completing the Brotherhood Quest line. Due to the bugs and glitches and originally playing it on Xbox 360 I could not get my bad-ass horse again from that save... 

Anyways I used to be an adventurer but then I took an 'arrow' to the knee..."

19343,swaggy game
19344,yeye
19345,Don't need to Explain. The Game Explain's itself.
19346,my steam library betrays the countless hours spent playing this game. it is an incredibly fun experience.
19347,of course i recommend skyrim
19348,OG
19349,nice
19350,"Its an epic!
~Captain Obvious"
19351,a perfectly balance d game with no glitches or exploits
19352,"Endless amounts of hours can be spent in this world and every playthrough youll find something different. I would recomend installing the ""unofficial skyrim patch"" mod, there are countless of guides that tell you how to install mods."
19353,"The fifth Elder Scrolls game is a worth successor to Oblivion, and one of the best RPGs ever made. Technically, it’s not a huge a progression from Oblivion, but it’s a game where all the elements – graphics, sound, art design, music and gameplay – combine to make one incredibly immersive whole. Clear your diary, take a break, and cancel Christmas if you have to: unless you have an allergy to sword and sorcery, you’ll need every spare second to play."
19354,Including SE i played this game for more than 2000 hours. its quite good i think. almost completed the main story by now
19355,"Not bad, pretty shallow and boring combat but exploring is really fun."
19356,best game ever
19357,"good

19364,"Valve intreviwed me for this.

Question 1: Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product 

-Log 1- This game.... This GAME.

19365,"I recommend buying this version of Skyrim instead of the special edition.
For the fact that the original version of Skyrim is a lot more modable."
19366,"wonderful game throughout, lots of fun hours"

"
19419,Great game.  Lots of mod support.
19420,"I mean, how do you not recommend Skyrim?"
19421,"Skyrim is a classic and deservedly so. This game offers a rich atmosphere for those looking to engross themselves in a fantastic world. The combat is very bare bones and once to an extent, this game can begin to feel repetitive because of the long walking distances and monotonous combat. There is a reason so many people love this game. And hey, if you get bored, you can always bake this game with the vast library of mods in the workshop."
19422,"Help me please, Todd Howard has kidnapped me and only lets me play skyrim, steam is the only other thing on this pc. Save me. I can hear his footsteps, i dont have much time left.


Edit: He saw my reviev, now all he feeds me are wheels of cheese, i cant take it anymore."
19423,best RPG
19424,Best game ever made when you have mods installed.
19425,"The ""Legend"" of gaming

This game has been launched/remastered/released so many times ...."
19426,Pretty good
19427,when it comes to open world games and playing at your own pace this game has to be the best. its timeless meaning new gamers can adapt and older gamers will still enjoy. its a RPG game that allows you to do pretty much anything. Be warned you will spend hours/days playing this game and never getting bored. I love it
19428,Probably my favourite Sky I ever rimmed.
19429,Legendary game IMO standing at the top of RPG's along with Mass Effect and The Witcher franchises.
19430,An amazing game that in my opinion has no parallel. i find it to be up there with the great titles of this genre such as the witcher 3
19431,"Never have I hated a game yet played it as much as I have Skyrim. Seriously fuck this game, it takes away days of your life and it makes you feel so terrible when you go back to work on monday and realize you wasted your days off making your 17th stealth archer character."

19451,still playing 9 years later
19452,"Apparently people are now randomly giving awards for one-line meme posts or other troll reviews in every popular game for absolutely no reason, so I'll just post this sentence as well that makes no sense but follows the same logic, along with the usual honest Yes/No that doesn't really explain much but apparently is currently much more worth the time than writing an actual nuanced review that would actually be helpful to others."

I wish more games took note. 

I wish Bethesda took note of what made people love this game so much."
19469,"If you're a fan of open world adventure RPGs, there are only a few that come close to Skyrim.  One of the best games I've ever played, period."

19484,"Game good, but mod it, else don't bother."

[b]Summary:[/b]
Go everywhere; do everything.

[b]Review:[/b]
Skyrim doesn't set itself apart in any spectacular way. The open world mechanic has matured so much over the years that many other developers have many other takes on it. Where Skyrim succeeds is in that it refines so many aspects, while managing to be an effective template for modding and customizing the experience to the individual's taste.

I've clocked in hundreds of hours in this game, many of which are also on my PlayStation 3. Each time can be a very different approach, even if the experience isn't all that different. Sick of magic? Try a stealth build. Sick of being a warrior? Try being a werewolf. Buff yourself up as an alchemist fist fighter if that's your bag; the sky's the limit!

Combat will vary entirely on how your approach. I found sword play to be rough and silly, and generally unfulfilling. Magic was okay, but nothing great. Shouts were more of a weak supplement to whatever you decide. My preference was a bow and stealth, which made the game pretty easy on just about any setting. Satisfying, but not great.

The voice acting is reasonable, but generally very generic. Some of the actors had really thick accents. One of the most bizarre characters involves a quest in assisting a talking animal. I won't spoil it, but the voice actor was mind-blowingly odd, like way out of left field “did they hire this guy from a Long Island street corner?” odd. As for the rest, it wasn't awful, but it won't win any prizes.

Same with the unremarkable dialogue and story. Actually, most of the writing was lame. I can't say there was ever a moment that made me laugh, or care, or wince, or generally react. I felt nothing from what I was getting other than another task from another character I could barely care about. Plot points move predictably, and sometimes the resolutions are so simplistic they feel rushed.

Sound and music are good and thematic. It's clear this game drew a lot of influence from the TV show Game of Thrones, in world design, character design, story, and music. The chanting was pretty cool in areas, such as approaching a word wall and learning a Shout. Battle sounds were solid, but not great. I didn't care for that 'DONK' sounds that played whenever I scored a sneak attack, but that's just my own taste.

Visually, without modding, the game's clean and runs well, except for some occasional stuttering as wider areas load in. With mods this game can look downright stellar! There are thousands of mods out there to enhance the experience, some in [i]strange and awful[/i] ways. Some of my favorites beyond graphical mods were immersion and quality of life mods, such as Move It, Bring Out Your Dead, and of course the always essential Mod Organizer 2.
Whatever you decide to do, vanilla or modded, you make the experience. Despite being shallow, Skyrim excels at being accessible, straightforward, and highly customizable.

This game was played with all settings maxed out using an Intel i7-8700k, 32gb DRAM, Samsung Evo SSD, 1080ti, running at 3440x1440, which looked kind of fish-eyed (no matter what I set with Flawless Widescreen) due to the game's built-in limitations. My mod count is currently 482 active mods, with 246 active esp files. Thanks to Mod Organizer 2 I was able to fine tune everything, and run a stable game thus far.

I played using my Logitech G13 and a mouse.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Standard in every possible way
    [*]You decide your experience
    [*]Good soundtrack
    [*]Controller friendly
    [*]Lots to do
    [*]Fully realized world
    [*]Mods for almost everything
    [*]Deep and very active modding community
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Standard in every possible way
    [*]Modding can be frustrating and time consuming
    [*]Ultimately empty and easy experience
    [*]Repetitive quests, world, and combat 
    [*]Fussy ultrawide issues
[/list]

[b]Verdict: 8/10[/b]

The quintessential Elder Scrolls game that holds its own more than a decade after release.  Better with mods."
19560,"cool game, very fun"
19561,Its alright
19562,Oops all stealth archers.
19563,Praise Tod Howard
19564,"This game is still the goat, and I still prefer this over the special edition"
19565,Great game. Excited to check out some of the mods (for the first time!).
19566,"The game is alright, and I can't say I regret playing it as much as I have, but to be honest, if you've already played oblivion, you've already played this.  It is a buggy, clunky, awkward mess, with a vast quantity of shallow content and equally shallow but not quite so broad game-play.  

If you've never played oblivion (or any of the fallouts, 3 and up) then this is probably fine (though I suspect fallout New Vegas might actually be the only game in this ""sub-genre"" worth playing, not that I've actually played it myself).  If you have played those, but still desperately crave more, then might I suggest you instead invest in a therapist, as you're probably addicted to escapism."
19567,BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED THE MODS ARE ENDLESS
19568,"Bethesda yet again proving they have no idea what an RPG is.
Must be nice having your game single handedly carried by its art team."
19569,Excellent game
19570,It's a game.
19571,Amazing graphics and storyline
19572,svovvengard
19573,"1. It's bloody Skyrim, what else?
2. Great for those want a casual RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously.
3. Can be played in first or third person on the fly, which is a huge plus for me.
4. Mods. Tons, and tons, of mods. Gives the game MASSIVE replay value."
19574,Love it
19575,external website modding is hard. the game is still fun i'm just warning you
19576,Its a great game just doesn't need a new version for every system in the world
19577,"i disliked none of it
"
19578,A classic
19579,Pretty good dlc the vampire story was interesting and the power itself is useful
19580,gd game
19581,"very nice
"
19582,"Skyrim is one of the only games that I don't think I will ever get tired of. The main game you can speed run decently quickly but this ain't about that. Skyrim has the most side quests, mods, companions and groups to join/ lead... I once spent a whole summer playing this on the Xbox 360 getting around 300 hours. Then I bought it for the PC I don't regret this at all. I love this game."
19583,pretty  cool game
19584,Big world and multiple ways to develop the hero. Fun.
19585,cool
19586,This game is dope i could see myself spending 100's of hours in this game
19587,its skyrim
19588,It's Skyrim. It's amazing and will suck you in.  What more is there to say?
19589,its very fun
19590,Simply amazing and revolutionary for open world games would play on fridge.
19591,"very immersive, great story!"
19592,This game is as addictive as big fat bag of crack cocaine
19593,ITS FUCKIN GR8 M8
19594,"Like any other game that has any connection with Bethesda, I can only play this once I've dedicated a week's worth of my time modding it to hell and back to make it playable"
19595,this game is life changing
19596,its a little fun
19597,ive played many time on different systems and its amazing  STILL! mods with the addons rally helps me  stay interested
19598,"Just buy this instead of Special Edition, especially if you want to use mods."
19599,It doesn't just work
19600,dovakin go shout shout
19601,THIS GAME IS JUST SOOOO GOOD... ive played 1.4K hours and it is just fun
19602,Great game as you all know
19603,"best game ever, no cap"
19604,"It's pretty nice, mods allow it to hold up well but the normal game itself is pretty nice too!"
19605,"This addition is certainly good, but I can only recommend it for some people.

the best all round edition that Bethesda has released is probably the 8th Anniversary Super Ultimate Gold Premium Collectors edition of Skyrim for PC.
"
19606,One of best games I've ever played
19607,good
19608,"Finally finished the character creation, looks like its going to be a great game."
19609,"With all the mods that have been made for this game, it can be played and enjoyed for years.  Never have I gotten my moneys worth so hard, than with this game."
19610,Skyrim is for the Nords
19611,Get a lot of mods
19612,"Even years later this game is still one of the best. Great game, great mod community, what more do you need?"
19613,Its like FarCry without guns.
19614,Best RPG i've ever played! and mods make it a lot better!
19615,"You can get this game on almost any platform.  It has been around for years now and if you haven't played it by now, you probably won't.  That said, this is one of those games that offers almost unlimited options.  You can do so much and it's such a beautiful world.  Can't say enough about this masterpiece."
19616,absolute classic.. had to come back.
19617,timeless classic. i have 159 hours in this game and there is still so much to discover and learn and do~
19618,graphic exotic
19619,I think it gave me herpes.
19620,One of the best games ever
19621,"Skyrim is an absolute legend of a game (despite its glitchiness) and everyone should take the time to play it, even if you aren't necessarily an Elder Scrolls fan."
19622,yes
19623,i ges i just like the game.
19624,good game.
19625,FHN
19626,still holds up
19627,it fun
19628,"Good variety of quest, nice graphics, good variety of characters
"
19629,"Everything about this game is amazing. The open world, the characters, the huge selection of quests. :3"
19630,I enjoy.
19631,its good
19632,Best ES game - beautiful imagery and a decent mix of adventuring and dungeon-diving without the repetition of Oblivion
19633,"What's there to say? This game was a masterpiece when it was released and with thousands of mods available, it manages to keep me coming back for more."
19634,"Took about 435 mods to tweak it to perfection but to this day nothing beats solo-roleplaying in Skyrim, Solstheim and now Bruma ! Vortex makes modding games so easy now so you have no excuse. Go give that decade old gem some love !

Edit : okay more like 528 mods but the point still stands :D"

19644,"My favorite game - Ever... Well, that and DDO - but Im older and played the Original version. Paper and book and dice."
19645,shit lit
19646,"In 1986, Christopher S. Weaver created Bethesda Softworks. Weaver created and Published Elder Scrolls, including Arena, Daggerfall, Battlespire, Redgard, and Morrowind. 

Due to corporate strong-arming Weaver was forcefully removed from his own company, and creation, by Robert A. Altman who then assumed control. Altman cares little for videogames, or programming, nor does he really have any observable talent for creating anything at all. Altman is a corporate businessman and executive.

Hey, you're finally awake.

Skyrim itself is great with mods, but, the vanilla game is a complete mess, so I can't recommend it.

19647,"Its a classic
"
19648,One of the best games ever made.
19649," This game is one of the ALL TIME BEST! It is so versatile, you can make it ANY game you want with a few MOD downloads (which are VERY EASY to use, especially through the Steam Workshop). The shear volume of quest and side projects in the stock game alone make it very re-playable. 10 out of 10! Thumbs ALL the way UP!"

19692,iitx skyrim

19694,"ngl the game is good, but the company is dogshite, they sold a seperate version of the game for remastered and vr. there are 3 versions of this game and the only reason why people like it is because of the mods."
19695,"[h1] It doesn't disappoint Bruh. [/h1] 

Welcome to skyrims snowy barbarian wilderness where everyone has some plan for the dragonborn even the imperials who have you as a prisoner when you first arrive in skyrim. From a quick glance skyrim can seem opaque and lifeless but nothing can be further from the truth there is alot to do. Speaking of the world it has some of the most beautiful scenery too date everything is crisp and refreshing, It's so immersive you very much feel part of the world, The combat is challenging on high difficulty with enemies quickly exploiting everything you do wrong, the voice acting is flawless and immersive, the modding potential makes this game eternal (Steam workshop and nexus mods), it has some of the most interesting quests and engaging storylines for you to explore too your hearts content, the npc's are quite attractive looking. Everything I have mentioned I thought would be bad in this game the game changed my mind.

I should also mention it has more mods than special edition but the special edition has better graphics and still has some good mods but I still like to pick the one with the most mods."

19698,This is the first game of this type I have played for many years and while there are complicated nuances to the game with a little help along the way I have enjoyed it very much and am working my way through this new world.
19699,"Its Skyrim, what can ya say its a classic."
19700,Dragons.
19701,its skyrim we all love it
19702,its a good game
19703,Really? Write something? This is the literal definition of a classic.
19704,There's always something else to do in Skyrim. Careful - it will suck your time away.
19705,Love this game! Will always be a classic time killer.
19706,"This game has so much nostalgia and is a GREAT RPG. Story line was pretty good, but couldve been better imo. The music soundtrack is AMAZING. I've played this game for a few years, and i STILL play it. That has to tell you something. Overall great game and one of the best i've ever played"
19707,"Describe Skyrim? It's been ten years, how does someone not know about this game? 

Honestly, look up a Youtube video on this game if you're unsure."
19708,Hmmmm YES!
19709,"Great game, huge expansive world, excellent mod support"
19710,"The best game ever.
"
19711,I'm 414 hours in and still discovering things new.
19712,"Just found out this is unlisted. Todd, I thought you loved money."
19713,This is the definitive and only version of Skyrim you should ever play.
19714,I have this version of the game because my PC would not be able to run the special edition. They shouldn't hide this version because they would not have gotten a sale out of me and I could have missed out on this great game.
19715,fun and good
19716,"I just love Skyrim so much, 
I got every skyrim edition i can play
This is the best game,

Everyone who says witcher 3 is better is wrong

19719,beautiful
19720,AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH STILL THE BEST GAME
19721,you can't say you've played skyrim unless you speedrun it with a gun
19722,it's a classic with memorable story and characters and almost endless stuff to do
19723,"I'd have over a thousand hours; but due to some issues a few years ago with the Steam Cloud syncing my offline data; most of that was lost in a tragic accident, along with my self-respect and dignity. Skyrim's Skyrim, it's 2020, if you still need convincing about this game's worth by now; I question your intelligence."
19724,thank you todd howard very cool
19725,"Don't bother playing this if you have a decent computer. The bugs make it literally unplayable. Can't even cross bridges to progress the story, you just fall right through. Even after a complete reinstall of the game, it doesn't help. Supposed to be one of the best games ever, but its more like a hot piece of garbage."
19726,Fun game!

19736,The modding community is very good.
19737,Perfectly balanced game with no flaws what so ever
19738,nice game 69/420. could use some rework. soooo if bethseda could take a look bake to elder scrolls V it´d be great

19746,I love the original Skyrim..!
19747,GL not just becoming a stealthy archer every game
19748,"I was playing, trying to complete more quests and some asshole stole my sweetroll.  I tried filing a complaint but the Stormcloaks just fuckin laughed.  They weren't laughing after I used Fire Breath.  They screamed.  I laughed."
19749,It's ok I guess
19750,"gg
"
19751,"it's a classic
play it
if you like fantasy that is"
19752,"its skyrim.... if you still haven't played it... why???? do you really need to read reviews about it??? have you not heard enough about how amazing it is?????

the game has been out for 9 years. NINE YEARS. plus my hours on the xbox360, i've played this game for about 300 hours (and counting) and i'm still finding new things to do. mostly miscellaneous quests but there's so much more to it. like one i just found today was about some guy who likes to bone ghosts. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?? if you take the time to read a little, listen a little, talk to everyone you can and explore a little, it's a game that keeps on giving. the scenery is also G O R G E O U S . the night skies are TO DIE FOR. THE SOUNDTRACK IS *CHEF'S KISS* whenever i listen to ""the streets of whiterun"" on spotify it makes me feel like i'm home and nothing in real life has made me feel that before. 

the only con is the usual bethesda bugs but it doesn't affect the gameplay. sure sometimes when you walk into a room some plates and shizz will go flying everywhere but if you're creative enough just think of it as a feature of the game. i.e my wife has been bugging out (walking in place, walking into walls, jittering here and there, dialogue options not appearing etc) after she got kidnapped so i'm choosing to believe that she's suffering from ptsd and it's all gucci. she still cooks me meals, takes care of my 2 beautiful children, gives me a share of her daily earnings from her store and most importantly i still love her. who needs real life when you've got the hearthfire expansion??

okay this review is a mess but i figured i ought to say something about a game i've spent the most time on so yah and whenever i go to my library it keeps asking me wOuLd yOu ReCoMmEnD tHiS gAmE like yes yes yes yes so here stop asking me already 10/10 recommended to everyone (even old people enjoy this i mean come on for reals check out shirley curry on youtube if you haven't. it's the most wholesome thing in the world ever. SEE YOU IN THE NEXT ELDER SCROLLS GAME GRANDMA SHIRLEY <3)"
19753,hehe alduin go ded
19754,"I play this Skyrim on my home refrigerator. If I get a glass of water from the dispenser it uses my shouts, giving me incentive to stay hydrated. 7.8/10 would fill Dragonsreach with cheese wheels again."
19755,It's Skyrim.... You have heard about it.
19756,this game saved me during my parents divorce 9/10
19757,"Amazing game, absolutely love it. Tom stop releasing it and make elder scrolls 6 already

19758,This is still my go to game. Anytime I am in a lull with other games I alway come back to skyrim.

19778,go0od.
19779,"Just one more side quest, then I'm back to the main story... ©"
19780,This is the reason to even own a PC.
19781,"If you don't like skyrim go ahead and unfriend me, cause this ain't gonna work. c:"
19782,After skyrim being out for almost 9 years im finally playing it for the first time in its Vanilla format with out mods! I've never actually beaten the game but from what i've been playing so far. This game is a damn master piece!
19783,"Good story, challenging missions, and great adventures."
19784,Always a good time.  There are so many ways to keep this game fresh and interesting.
19785,"Only worth playing when you mod the hell out of it. Luckily it's the most modded game in history, and steam workshop handles all the nitty-gritty for you.

Pros:
+ Still holds a sense of player freedom in a way only few games do
+ The visual design holds up, even if the graphics themselves don't
+ Tons of content to explore
+ The most modded game in existence. Much like the game itself, you can pretty much customise Skyrim to be whatever you like
+ The soundtrack is iconic for a reason

Cons:
- Painfully dated in multiple ways: the combat is floaty and lacks any sense of weight, the character animations are stiff, the dungeons are just straight lines with no branching paths, many mechanics are laughably simplistic compared to even Skyrim's contemporaries, there's some terrible balancing issues etc.
- The vanilla version is just not worth playing, at all. The UI was awful on release, and it's awful now.
- the voice acting is passable at best, laughable at worst
- The main story is utterly forgettable hogwash, and the number of memorable NPCs can be counted on one hand.

Despite showing its age, Skyrim still holds up overall. Almost any cracks (and boy are there many) you may find can be modded out."
19786,good
19787,its a legendary game with tons of fun mods to spend hours in this game
19788,THE LAW OF SKYRIM
19789,is gud
19790,It's fun. I had fun with it. It put a smile on my face. I would recommend doing things that put smiles on your faces.
19791,"i love this game so much its ridiculous. one of my favorite games of all time that introduced me to my favorite game series of all time - that i've had the delight of revisiting all the entries in over the years and am currently enjoying the MMO set in its universe. but back to the important thing here: skyrim is... skyrim! it so good. and i love it. i have over 1000 hrs of gameplay across PC, PS4, Switch, etc. i would kiss this game if i could. i cannot wait till i get my new gaming pc next month so i can play this nearly 10 year old game yet again with the best settings + mods possible. i'm pretty sure I will cry when I load it up the first time. ok, thats all. bye!"
19792,its skyrim what more do you need
19793,Cool story possibilities!
19794,awesome game
19795,very entertaining and fun.
19796,"I'm also a fan of Ghost Adventures, Mass Effect, Anime, and LOTR. Filmography and artism are an intellectual outlet, and I hope my unfunctioning Windows 100 wll handle this bull. Job coming soon."
19797,Only fun when modded.
19798,skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim
19799,yes
19800,"I am soooooo late to the party to write a review.

Its a buggy fun filled epic masterpiece. Nothing else to say but please try it with mods. The adventures I have had with this game are some of my most treasured. 

8/10 
10/10 with mods"
19801,Lov gam
19802,it is a very wide expensive game that is has a wide open map that encourages you to explore everywhere
19803,"This little known indie game is a little rough around the edges, but has a great big world to explore. There are tons of beautiful places to explore and items to hoard. The extensive mod support includes many that can effectively extend the world, add replayablity, fix issues, make the world look even better, and much more. The main thing holding the game back in my opinion is a fundamentally stiff combat system that is only a step above the first elderscrolls games from the 90's.

Pro's:
-Todd Howard
-large and sufficiently detailed world to explore
-lots of established lore, characters, and story to play through
-Mods
-satisfying progression 
-tons of treasure
-lots of freedom to play as you like
-really cool locations and hidden secrets abound

Con's:
-the game engine is quirky, which can be funny at times, but can break immersion and limit the effective range of stuff you can do
-the true size of things is actually fairly scaled down, which is reasonable, but also a missed opportunity.
-combat is stiff, and can get boring faster than you can level a new skill
-little sense of danger, higher combat difficulties are mostly just number changes on enemies
-dragons are wyverns, and feel more like large animals most of the time rather than epic monsters 
-NPC's are overwhelmingly unpolished and un-emotive. most treat you the same no matter what you have done, at most occasionally giving a single unique line of dialog.
-Civil war feels half baked 
-some areas of the map are noticeably unpolished, with walls especially not holding up to much scrutiny 

There is simply so much put into this game that despite it's flaws it is easy to get absorbed into. The few who have yet to try skyrim may as well give it a spin, especially with some mods that modernize it a bit."
19804,"Don't listen to anyone. This game is all about blending water, a giant's toe and red mountian flowers into a red vial and conning a merchant into buying it for 40 bucks. The dumb ass..."
19805,i like it
19806,sexy!
19807,If Skyrim isn't one of the first if not the first game in your library you failed as a pro gamer in your roots.
19808,"Still holding strong!
"
19809,Fun game to play when you're bored of all your other games except recently when I try to start a new game of Skyrim it becomes glitchy...
19810,"10/10
"
19811,"Fun game. I've played it too much. Might encourage you not to be LG, but otherwise solid."
19812,good
19813,We all know what you actually play this for ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
19814,I cannot say anything here that hasn't already been said. If you don't know what this is because you're new to the gaming realm just do yourself a favor and buy this.
19815,"One of my favorite games by far. It's very buggy on it's own, but it has a lot of charm to it. If you're considering buying, don't be like a lot of us and buy every single version (speaking as someone who has this and special addition. It's not worth it. Pick whichever you believe to be the most stable or has the mod support you're looking for, and stick with that one!"
19816,Its Skyrim.
19817,"I pretty much like everything about this game, ngl. I've been playing ot since it came out and it just gets better and better."
19818,<3<3<3
19819,"This game is fire
9/10"
19820,"If you're reading this... Congratulations despite Bethesda's best attempt to cover it up, you found Oldrim. The version many Users prefer to use/mod. HOWEVER just a few thoughts before you get this game..

The price on Steam is terrible. For context the whole enchilada (Skyrim Legacy + all DLC's) is gonna run you $65. $20 for the game, and $45 for the three DLC. Instead buy a copy of Skyrim Legendary Edition elsewhere. I got a new, boxed copy complete with disc AND steam key from Amazon for $10, including the shipping last Cyber Monday. It's probably even cheaper for just the key i'm sure, but i'm a sucker for physical boxes.

Second i seriously recommend you get an ENB, especially if you plan on modding. ( enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm ) With ENB you can increase how much memory the game gets, preventing sudden CTD's before they even start. Once it's installed go to enblocal.ini, in your Skyrim directory, and under the [MEMORY] category adjust the VideoMemorySizeMB value to something more... In line with your mod/PC setup. I use VideoMemorySizeMB=10000, but that might be overkill for some. The higher the value, the slower your loading screens UNLESS you have Skyrim installed on a SSD."
19821,"Most immersive and addictive game I've played in my 48 years. Espescially with the myriad of mods for immersions, quests etc... I always come back. I can play so many different types of characters I just like to make a back story, make a plan for the character and live it's life."
19822,"I  likess this ""Games""ss Btw
"
19823,gkjgkjhgfkjfjfufuyfufuyfufuyfufiufy
19824,It is fun.  I get to sit at my desk in my underwear and play the game until my mommy yells at me to get dressed.
19825,A great classic that you can vibe with and play
19826,10/10 best way to waste your time
19827,good
19828,yes play this game right now.

19830,Awesome game.
19831,It's basically legendary

19837,all i can say is i love playing this game
19838,.
19839,Great game. Hard to put down. Hours of gameplay. The game basically never ends. Beautiful graphics. I put the game down for a while and came back to it. Now I can't put it down again.
19840,"Todd Howard has taken my life savings away with this game, I have a shrine in my room to pray to Papa Todd every night. Papa Todd is my lord and savior, I would gladly sacrifice my child for another Skyrim port. To not like this game is the same as saying your life is pathetic, and honestly your opinion means very little if anything. Also, it's a good game."
19841,get it
19842,uwu
19843,"Is one of those games you wish you could experience all over again for the first time. 
Will forever be a favourite that i will replay."
19844,noice
19845,good.
19846,asd
19847,"amazing when heavily modded but the base game is a buggy mess with an uninteresting story, terrible combat and a level up system made by an 8 year old"
19848,One of the best games of all time
19849,I will kill Todd Howard if Elder Scrolls 6 isn't out in the next 3 years
19850,"murdered an entire town and stole everything, sold it in the next town and used that money to pay off my bounty, killed several dragons using my bare hands and a shield, spoke the Jarl of whiterun, while nude. I violated the Geneva convention, in medieval times, which I didn't think was actually possible. than I tried installing one (1) mod and the game hasn't started since, overall 10/10 experience would buy on several different generations of console again."
19851,yes
19852,its Skyrim what more is there to say other then its amazing!
19853,yea
19854,yee yee dragons
19855,"What can I say about this title? I enjoyed Skyrim and it's changes from the older Elder Scrolls titles. for whatever console or fridge you own Skyrim on, its an essential to the Elder Scrolls Collection, but not a must play."
19856,Awesome
19857,it just works
19858,Great game
19859,"interesting enough i waited a year to get this on pc and i only have 31 hours, im going to change that.
"
19860,One of the best single player games.
19861,bangbangchickenwang
19862,"I've loved the Elder Scrolls series since Morrowind, and while I feel Morrowind had the most unique plot / atmosphere, Skyrim has vastly improved gameplay and has taken ample inspiration from Norse myth and culture for much of its plot and culture (a subject I've always been fascinated by).  From Draugr and barrows to a world-ending serpent, it's hard for a fan of Scandinavian myth not to love this new fantasy take breathing new life into the old concepts.  Plus, on pc, there's the vast and endless modding community.  I don't think I've ever seen more mods for any one game, and they've probably kept this old title going many more years than it would have otherwise."
19863,Played enough skyrim to last my entire life. Mods definitely bring new life into the game. Would recommend but I'm sure everyone already knows that.
19864,game
19865,It just works.
19866,fos ro da
19867,kel mai bun joc
19868,"I purchased this game a few years ago on a whim, since then I haven't found a single game I enjoy more.  I've made many characters and every time I find something new I didn't find on the last character.  It's fun going back and choosing different options that change the story line or simply swapping one weapon type for another.  The replay-ability is pretty good, not amazing, but pretty damn good."
19869,It good
19870,Long time favorite!
19871,i just got to whiterun
19872,"hours of fun. been playing and watching videos of skyrim since the day it was released. i still love it. there are easter eggs hidden all over the world, and interesting conversations to be had everywhere."
19873,Favorite video game of all time.
19874,"
it's awesome"
19875,It just Works.
19876,Far better than Witcher III.
19877,I mean when is the next one gonna come out.
19878,v good spent >9000 hours
19879,"Was great when it came out, still great even now with the special edition out... some times oldies are goldies!"
19880,ye
19881,its fun
19882,Iz very good
19883,GOAT
19884,"Great game, even without mods. You can play it straight from the company and enjoy yourself for hours and hours on end."
19885,dragon go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
19886,"Did you ever love playing World of Warcraft when it was just out of Vanilla? Not really interested in PVP or guilds, etc....? Hated the way it forced you to join a guild  just for the perks and extra XP? Did you just love doing the quests and learning about its world whilst building your character - its armour, skills and weaponry? 

This game is for you.

The landscapes are at sometimes breathtaking - even 'northern lights' in certain places (You'll find out),  beautiful double moons that you have to take care to watch in case you are attacked by a random bear, wolf or winterbastardcat (You'll know what I mean) - if they kill your horse it'll cost at least 5000 gold to buy a new one or steal one if you can get away with it.

But that's my point. This game makes you care about things like your unnameable horse because the bugger will try his best to defend you with shoddy hoof attacks when you've tried your best to keep him away from the trouble you can see coming by dismounting and trying to hide him from harm.

You should see him/her/whatever try to take on a huge dragon - didn't end well. If you've any shred of decency you reload just in case you've lost a member of your loyal AI group. They are useful for backup and storage  and will copy your stance in an instant if you're going for a stealth approach in a dungeon.


TLDR; - World of Warcraft for grown ups."
19887,yes
19888,This is one of the best games i've ever played and this doesnt even show my 1000+ hours on xbox. The addition of mods to this game was like adding infinite possibilities to be had an i love it.
19889,love
19890,"I feel as if my playtime speaks for itself. This game is amazing, but make sure you have mods. honestly it's just fantastic and if you don't have it already what the heck are you doing go play."
19891,"Um... do I really need to have my input on this one?
Moddable.
Replayability.
Legendary Addition kicks *** in mods comparison
Stopped playing because I had played it for 2 years straight on xbox 360 when it came out. 
Bought it again for pc, modded the **** out of it, wouldn't stop playing for weeks until my friends told me enough was enough.
... Would go back to it if I got another SSD."
19892,may have only 14 hours on this game but it is amazing and i want more hours played on this
19893,"Hey it's me, Not Todd. Buy my game."

I think I got this game in 2014-15 and, as well as other games and some slight breaks, I've pretty much been playing it ever since. You will not get bored of it, even if the same concept over and over bores you because you can explore each quest from a different angle in each playthrough. Over half of the non-hostile and non-miscellaneous NPCs in the game have quests and most-all of them have unnique dialogue. An epic open world with deep, complex and interesting lore. 10/10"

19989,fun
19990,"Currently only have 40ish hours on pc, well over 2000 on both xbox and ps4. This is simply one of the best games ive ever played, having the freedom to do whatever you want is wild. My only issues come from modding and some of the playstyles. Ranged archery and magic are difficult and slow to play, but if youre really dedicated to playing them, it ends up being rewarding. Modding however, can be a bit of a gamble. Some mods will either greatly enhance your experience, or break it entirely. Otherwise, it really makes you feel like a dragonborn. 10/10 -IGN"
19991,Extremely fun and addicting
19992,very good like much yes
19993,"ooh, this mod looks cool. *boots up game* WHY IS THERE A THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE FLYING AROUND?"

20004,So I bought all the DLCs but now I have to REBUY them after uninstalling? If this is intentional I'm really switching to epic games.
20005,"Its cool i guess...






Sex mods."
20006,Timeless classic doesnt age
20007,its skyrim
20008,Game never gets old. the modding keeps it new each time
20009,I've always loved this game. Use to play it on console but prefer it on pc because of the wide variety of mods not available on console and the fact you have the command window for easy changes in the game.
20010,I want my money back
20011,"ITs an Elder Scrolls game, that alone is enough reason to be curious about it in my opinion. Though it's old enough to go to middle school now it's still pretty darned fun."
20012,:)
20013,"Well over a thousand hours, over three consoles and a computer. Hell yeah I suggest this game to my friends."
20014,"I've decided that, since I have nearly 350 hours in this game, I might as well review it.

So why do I recommend Skyrim? I mean I could just say that's a stupid question and end it there, but fine. I can elaborate.

If you're like me, and you enjoy anything and everything that's even slightly related to medieval fantasy, then you'll love
this game to death. There's just simply an enchanting feeling that gets to you when you first visit Riverwood. 

There's something magical and awesome about encountering your first dragon, all the while trying not to freak out in excitement upon the realization that you have to fight said beast. Already in your inventory and skills menu preparing your spells, weapons and of course, shouts.

There weren't many games that could nail the atmosphere that Skyrim offered in it's taverns. The bards sing, the innkeeper, already asking you about your dinner, while you sit near the fire and hear the goings-on in the city from the townsfolk.

If people ever feel like too much noise, you can go back into the world and get lost in enchanting forests, abandoned caves, snowy mountains, you name it. Whether it's by horse or alone, the road never gets boring, for there's always a wolf, a giant spider, or the occasional bandits and cutthroats that try to steal from you.

Whether it's demonic Daedras that try to corrupt you, or common and not so common people that need your services, there's always something to do in this place. Sometimes you search for adventure, while other times, adventure finds you.

Do you want to be a warrior? One who's mighty and just? Go ahead. Do you want to be a mage, who learns everything there is to learn about the world and the elements. Do so. Or perhaps a thief, who always enjoys stealing the dangling fat purses hanging from nobility's waist. You can. Maybe even something grim? Like an assassin? One who lives to kill, coin being of little importance, rather the thrill of the hunt is the only thing that matters to them. No problem.

You have every suspect of fantasy, from werewolves, to giant rats, trolls and talking cats. Even scaled lizard folk.

Build a house. Adopt children. Get married. Read books.

I could go on and on about how detailed, captivating, immersive and realistic this game is, but truth be told you should experience it for yourself, and you'll thank me later.

With a modding community, that is still coming up with crazy things to keep Skyrim relevant, you'll find that you won't need another game for a good while. Nor will you want one."
20015,Very good game still played lots more on xbox than pc but very nice
20016,Its fricking Skyrim. get it.
20017,Hundreds of hours of fun to have here.
20018,"This game, if you let it, will consume your soul.  Great job as usual Bethesda!"
20019,"Best Elder Scrolls game, Better even than online."
20020,awesome
20021,"one of the most iconic games ever, and very fun to play. 
awesome story in an awesome setting.
I definitely recommend this game"
20022,There is nothing I can say that has already been said.
20023,"Ok, I guess little must be said about this classic game. It has some issues, regarding the controls and view angle, but overall its just a fantastic experience! Go get it!

PS: If you pry for the HD version, you should go for the community HD mod. The official HD mod is not as good."
20024,"very very good
(:"
20025,best game still almost 10 years later
20026,Das is gud
20027,"Yeah it's pretty cool, I picked it up one day and played it once or twice"
20028,"Great game by a dumb company with literal TONS of customization possibilities through mods...

PRO - VERY fun if u enjoy customizing characters & fantasy role play.

CON - VERY unstable if u mod & VERY boring without mods(once u beat the story(s)."
20029,"Before I start pointing out the pros and cons of this game I just want to say that I have over 500 hours of playtime on this game. I have immersed myself into the game lore as much as humanly possible. I have bought all of the DLCs for this game. I have done research. I have made sure to miss nothing but I still probably have. I am giving you the best information I can on this game. Now let's get started. We've got a lot to go over.

Combat: 5/5
There are some unique weapons in this game and you really have to play the game a lot to figure out which style of combat you like. Want to attack swiftly and do small amounts of damage in a quick amount of time? Try out a dagger or a sword. Do you want to silently take out people from afar? Perhaps use a bow and arrow! How about setting people on fire or tricking them into experiencing their worst fear? Then Magic might be the ticket. Or maybe you want to have a heavy weapon to stagger them and a light weapon to finish them off? Then use a mace AND a dagger. Oh yeah, did I mention you can dual wield in this game?

Enemies: 5/5
Fighting the entities in this game NEVER gets old. There's a LOT of variety. You will never NOT find at least ONE new enemy or an enemy using a clever strategy during a quest. You'll constantly feel a fight or flight sensation when in combat. Either fight your way through a mob of enemies with heavy armor and healing potions or run away, level up a bit more, and come back later. It doesn't force you to do anything. It's all up to you.

Exploration: 4/5
Let me get something straight. I have over 500 hours of playtime on this game, and I STILL can't remember how to get from Solitude to Markarth(Two cities within the game) by walking. That's how you know this is a good exploration game. You'll always find little structures here and there. Or maybe small things like abandoned carts or small shacks. There's no way you CAN'T leave every stone unturned.

Story: 5/5
I have done everything I can to immerse myself with the lore of this game and incidents prior to the era of this game. Let me tell you, you're in for a treat. You're the hero(obviously). And you have to kill an evil villain who wants to destroy the world. That's the basic premise, like all games. But all stories are told differently. This one is told very VERY well. There's much more than just the main questline. There's side quests. But then there's more story quests! You don't just stop at defeating the primary antagonist, NO! There's a war to take care of. You can assassinate the emperor, you can join an exclusive guild led by a powerful demon queen, you can become the leader of a magic school, the list goes on. And that's WITHOUT the DLCs. Download the Dawnstar and Dragonborn DLCs and you're in for the most real treat you've ever had in your gaming life.

Crafting and Scavenging: 4.5/5
I don't even know where to start on this. There is SO MUCH to craft and find. Some armors can only be crafted at certain forges. And some stuff can only be found in certain locations. If you want to find a good balance between making your own gear and finding better gear, this game has it. It's either you craft and enchant your own stuff, or you can find it in the deepest of dungeons.

Overall I'd give this game a big fat 5/5. This will have you hooked for hours. Try not to get addicted, seriously. Most things can take you an hour or two of playtime but the end result is so worth it. If you get into the lore like me, it's a whole new world to live in. I'm not joking. Live a peaceful life, get married, make a nice house. Or live on the edge and delve into dungeons, risk your life for great rewards, and become a great warrior. There's so many ways to play this game and for only a $20 bill... this masterpiece is worth three times as much."
20030,fun game
20031,Everything
20032,YEs
20033,good

20050,It is Skyrim. The bugs are features. The mods are endless. I still play the game to this day.
20051,yes very gaymer
20052,insane bro
20053,Its an absolute amazing adventure game with so many ways to experience it.  You can easily play the vanilla version of the game and spend hours getting yourself immersed in gameplay.  There is also an insanely amazing modding community with such versatile options to choose from if that is something you wish to do as well!

20080,""" Hey you! You are finally Awake! "" This sentence will haunt your dreams, I mean probably it will be ported to your dreams. But anyway, one of the my all time favorite games, and definitely my favorite franchise. This game has almost 10 years. But a really strong mod community. The game is amazing, it has his flaws ofc, but overall one of the best games ever made. Like everyone one else I am waiting for the TES6, but all I get his Skyrims ports to everything that has a screen. Can't wait to get a port of Skyrim in my treadmill."

20084,The first time I ever played this game as a kid when I got it on Christmas was a truly magical experience that no other game I have ever played has been able to replicate.
20085,very good game
20086,Good game
20087,"Skyrim is one of the defining games of my life. I remember when this was announced, the hype was unreal. When it was released in 2011 and I got my hands on a copy for the Xbox, I spent untold hours playing this game, simply because it felt like there was so damn much to do. I mean, Todd Howard was lying when he said it was infinite, but it is certainly a huge game with an insane amount to do. The world of the Elder Scrolls and the lore therein, having been carefully crafted over several years and throughout several games, is some of the strongest worldbuilding in video games to date. The world of Skyrim, especially for the time, was dynamic and responsive and boundless. The possibilities for adventure are so numerous and entertaining, especially with DLC and mods, that you can easily forget about the main questline for an almost absurdly long amount of time. As for the art direction, Skyrim is the most visually compelling installment in the Elder Scrolls series of games, once again only enhanced by modern mods. The architecture of the cities and towns, the range of appearances across the races of the region, and the various styles of armor and weaponry all come together to make a wide ranging and coherent set of visual ideals to be found in Skyrim. I was floored the first time I saw it, because it was anything but generic. It was unique, it was new, and it was innovative. The gameplay is easy to grasp and provides the player free range of motion to play said game. It never felt clunky, in fact, it felt a little simplistic, especially in comparison to the other Elder Scrolls titles like Oblivion or Morrowind. Still, it was complex enough to be satisfying, and the combat challenges in the game didn't suffer either. It is everything an Elder Scrolls game should be, and I can only hope that the next installment will recapture that same sense of wonder. Overall, given the aforementioned factors, I give Skyrim a 9/10."
20088,"A lot of bugs, a lot of mods to fix them. Perfectly balanced."
20089,nice
20090,hmm
20091,"One of the best games ever made, but superseded by a different edition of the game.   However, the developers freely gave the remastered version to everyone who owned this version on Steam, so it's impossible to complain.   Thumbs up for a game nobody can buy anyway!"
20092,An old but great game with longevity. If you want it better looking there are tons of DLCs available

20108,just reviewing so i dont see the review recommendation anymore.
20109,love this game
20110,"Unlike Fallout 3, this doesn't have Windows Live.
10/10"
20111,"Too good , just too good <3"
20112,"  Skyrim changed my life. I was a depressed kid, no real happiness in my life, I did not have much joy at anything i was doing in my life. 
  I was 16 when i first played skyrim, i did not own a pc, so i went to a friend's house every weekend to play some games, enjoy the pool. When we discover skyrim with this friend we were so amazed and happy that there was a world where i can make choices in an epic adventure, that we were part of something huge like being the Dragonborn. 
   I started working really hard to buy my first pc. When i finally got it we did lan parties EVERY WEEKEND. We loved the mechanics of the game, we loved the way it was presented to us, we love the mod community. 
   Everything about skyrim is perfect. There is no way you will find bad things about this game to make you feel its bad, you may not like it but the game is beautiful, immersive, and will just make you travel to a world where you enjoy and make sacrifices and choices that matter."
20113,"Good Game
"
20114,The best.
20115,gud
20116,"great game if you need a way to kill time this is it
"
20117,"frick yeah this is my jam

i get to kill people , dragons, and mummy dudes as a frickin cat
i recommend this game"
20118,Quite simply the best
20119,good game i haven't found anything that i don't like about it.
20120,its very good
20121,This is such an enjoyable game I currently have over 590 hrs of play and still are no where being board of it.
20122,cool
20123,Great game.
20124,its good
20125,"Note cap your fps below 100 if you don't it will mess up in game physics and other things. Skyrim is one of the best games I've finally bought it on PC and the ps3 version was great, definitely worth it best RPG there is."
20126,".
"
20127,"Worth all of my time. One of thee best RPG's in my opinion.
Glad it was my very first game on Steam."
20128,Best RPG of all time.  It has everything you're looking for in a RPG game.
20129,"I mean it's Skyrim, come on."
20130,"fun, and as immersive as older titles in the series"
20131,.
20132,"the original, the best"
20133,It's Skyrim.
20134,"Even after the game has been out for years, it's still one of my favorite games out there. The quests are both challenging and entertaining. The open world is huge and the graphics for the game are pretty good."
20135,"An unstable, poorly written jankfest that you can pull occasional fun out of but is otherwise a complete time vampire that slowly builds up your resentment towards it and those that made it.

But hey you can pump it full of titty mods so if that sells it to you there you go."
20136,"i like its modding capabillities, im disapointed they removed the trading cards in special edition"
20137,"""Hey.""
""You, you're finally awake.""
You were trying to cross the border, right?"""
20138,"Todd's masterpiece and all its DLCs, while objectively terrible games defined by their overused tropes and poor fantasy writing, will always be in my top five games, despite the fact he won't stop trying to sell it to me. Don't get it twisted, though. If you want to buy this game, buy old Skyrim and its DLCs for considerably less than any of the newfangled ones. With a little modding, it'll look better and rub smoother than any of the new releases, and you'll need to mod it anyway to get bugs out of any of the releases. Don't let Todd take more of ur money than u need to. This game is ballin but it IS NOT worth the AAA-video game price tag for current games that he constantly thinks it deserves despite being a game older than i care to think about."
20139,"CTD constantly occurs when you progress 75% completion with the same mod over a years. Tried to find the crash log but no clue which mod to crash it but turn each off and clean it with other dependency, I totally fed up with this game and this game company."
20140,Good Game still.
20141,xd
20142,"What can I say that will be different from everyone else, not much sadly, this game, is excellent, very in depth and graphically beautiful. The sound is wonderful and game play is great as well.  Some learning curve if you not familiar with the mechanics, but all in all this game is a mush have for anyone in my opinion."
20143,"With the modding community in hand, this game is one you will come back to again and again for years to come, easily worth the price all things considered."
20144,good
20145,Ageless beauty! Highly recommend.
20146,Just no. It's what you think it is.
20147,its a good game. I like the story and the characters are funny. kids kinda creepy though
20148,The most awesome game ever! In the PC version you can actually customize (using mods) the game to play exactly the way you prefer!  12/10!
20149,"bro i got this shit when it came out



busted fat nuts to the dragur

i give it a strong 4 without mods tho"
20150,it good
20151,Significantly replayable until you realize that all you do deteriorates into exploits because there is little to no novelty without killing everyone.
20152,"Through all my hours playing this game over many generations of consoles, I can fully say this is my favorite open world Action RPG. For fans of similiar titles I give a full recommendation."
20153,"This is an older version, I have over 300 hrs in and there are still new things to do.  There are several story line or main quests and side quests. The SE version doesn't have as many mods yet so as of this writing this version can be made to look better."
20154,issa game about dargon
20155,"BOOBIES, BOOBIES AND MORE BOOBIES"
20156,Great game. Worth every penny.
20157,Its Skyrim cmon who wouldnt want to play this.
20158,"This has become my number one game of all time.
For a single person open world, this is your world!
Heavy in Viking culture, which makes this even way more awesome than it already it.
Fun for years!"
20159,What can i say. I'm addicted to this game and all the mods people make for it.
20160,asd
20161,very good ues
20162,mehhh
20163,"yes
"
20164,"I've only played 13 hours on PC but that's because I'm not a huge PC gamer. This game is so good that I would be willing to put 500+ hours into it, when I already have 200+ hours on my switch."
20165,Too good!
20166,"I mean, come on. It's Skyrim.
sure, the bugs and crashes and glitches are annoying, but it's Skyrim."
20167,The Game is freaking amazing!
20168,it good i guess
20169,"What a game, where it all began for me. Still holds strong today and am still finding my self revisiting for another playthrough, ever attempting to not end up a stealth archer... Shame how far Bethes has fallen since this great game. Hopefully they can bring it back for the next instalment of the franchise."
20170,Better than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.
20171,Its fun lol
20172,Years later and still the best game in the market
20173,Ah you are fınally awake
20174,"cracked game 
"
20175,Wæ!
20176,h
20177,working with customisation and mods (125 mods running very well) has been tremendous fun - particularly when there are certain plots you don't have to follow in order to progress. 5 stars.
20178,Skyrim will go down as one of the few games in history that can be replayed and be a different game experience every time. I think every gamer should play this game at least once.
20179,Best of best👹👹👹
20180,love this game i would recommend especially modded
20181,It's a great open world RPG with an even better modding community
20182,"badass
"
20183,"Incredible gameplay, stunning graphics, immersive story! Solid af."
20184,Just as good as special version as long as you don't care about the graphic upgrades (just use mods in this game).
20185,"great for 2011, quite dry today without mods."
20186,Played this since it first came out. Never tire of it.
20187,All hype!  Skyrim is still boring even with tons of mods.
20188,"I mean, honestly? Like, why are you reading this review? Go play the game. It's 2020 and I still play; that's all you need to know, dude."
20189,"NICE
"
20190,Terrible game. Never play it.
20191,Elder scrolls. what more is there to say.
20192,"Skyrim is a classic game, highly modable for amusements and QoL fixes, and there's just something about the game and its replayability that makes it such a wonder."
20193,I have 69 hours in this game at the time that i write this
20194,skyrim very good
20195,gud game
20196,love this game
20197,with mods adding playability and a solid game engine its been the best video game expierence so far
20198,Skyrim is a great game. Been playing it since I was in elementary school. If you're a fan of open world games and rpg's then this is the perfect game.
20199,"Have you somehow managed to go this long without playing or hearing about the experience of playing Skyrim? Get ready to jump into what is easily one of the largest and most engaging games of the past decade. If you enjoy rpgs, you're in the right place. If you're a completionist or just like to replay games to see the different playstyles, get ready to play this game for way longer than American Police train before joining the Force."
20200,"Legendary game.
"
20201,"Very few people play Skyrim just for the game itself. It's a mod and meme powerhouse, as all games should be, but very few are nowadays. It is also the last time Bethesda showed... some. decency in product quality. It's still pretty damn great nowadays, even though still glitchy as hell, but that's what (usually) makes it more fun, honestly. Go ahead and play it if you haven't before, and make sure to browse the Workshop from time to time - just to make your playthrough more unique"
20202,Do we really need to read comments? If you have not heard of this game then you have obviously been stuck on a dessert island for the last few decades. In which case I prescribe a drink before playing.
20203,"Honestly one of my favourite games of all time, there are endless quests to complete, or you can just roam around and explore the map."
20204,All you need to do is to see how much time I've spent on this game.
20205,Amazing graphics and the story line isn't set to one path so it would take ages to get close to complete so if your looking for a game to play over the years this is defiantly the game to play
20206,Nice to see a remastered morrowind in different setting
20207,"By Azura, by Azura, by Azura, it's the Grand Champion! I can't believe it's you! Standing here, next to me!"
20208,do i have to say anymore
20209,"this game, is good. 10/10 would play again"
20210,It's ok
20211,its like skyrim with guns
20212,it gud
20213,g0d
20214,fus ro dah
20215,love this game seriously endless gameplay
20216,"My favorite game of all time! this game was my childhood on the xbox 360 in 2011-2016 and i still play it to yhis day! I bought a 2,000$ gaming computer to play it with mods. I would go in to debit to pay for the great memories i have creating new characters and getting the completeing all of the quest with a different play style."
20217,"I always comeback to Skyrim at some point or another. If you're trying to decide whether to get this or 'hot chick with a sword simulator', you will probably have more fun in the long run with Skyrim than that other game.  This game is so old but still way better than the slogs of sh*t that get released everyday. How can such a masterpiece exist without inspiring other developers to do better."
20218,"iTs FuN

20219,This is simply the best open world RPG ever to have been made

20221,todd
20222,better than witcher in my opinion
20223,to make your self...n making and creating your own destiny...have fun you will love it.......I do
20224,"I played this game since it first game out on console and I have enjoyed every moment of it. There are many ways you can play this game and countless journeys, but it does get boring after you've done every quest time and again but that's why the community creates mods and a new refreshing way to experience Skyrim."
20225,"fun to play, has a lot of adventure and its fun to play its cool 9/10"
20226,Its good
20227,It's the best game I've played.
20228,its skyrim love it bugs and all
20229,This is a great rpg that I love and just keep coming back too. Despite some of the clunkiness and bugs it's a lot of fun.
20230,-
20231,One of the best RPG's ever.
20232,"Bought skyrim when it came out, bought all the dlcs but hearthfire shortly after releasing. Played endless on both vanilla and heavily modded setups. I re-install and re-do a modded skyrim every year, usually during November. With the world being what it is today, I'm starting way earlier than normal.

I've known about Bethesda hiding this and the dlc from the store for quite sometime but never bothered to state my opinion on this.

Honestly its a scummy move, and giving special edition free but under the radar back in 2016 has always been a joke to me. I won't be out looking for es6 when it comes out, I'll wait until its on sale or it has overwhelmingly positive reviews. Which would be a miracle for bethesda to pull off at the rate they are going.

I realise special edition goes on sale, i've almost bought it a few times but the fact I could of got it free just pisses me off."
20233,fun endless hours of quests an side missions. an thats without even using vortex / NMM to add in epic mods.
20234,"Even more broken than I remember! 
Seriously play with mods they don't effect your achievements unlike SE edition."
20235,Very enjoyable game i have replayed over the years many times highly recommended you buy
20236,"This is a good game, if you have a good computer"
20237,"TESO V: Skyrim is a perfect game with moderate graphics, a fun storyline, and huge maps. It sounds okay as a basic game but with mods it is fantastic! I personally love Falskaar
"
20238,cool
20239,Yes.
20240,This game is like Skyrim
20241,so many ways to do so much stuff even after you've done everything you can do it all again with a different build and it's completely different experience
20242,Good Game
20243,gud
20244,its fun with mod but at the same time hell
20245,Good game.
20246,"This game fucking slaps.
First the vanilla game. There are so many ways to play the game, sides you can pick and so many ways you can build up and make your own character.
The amount of lore behind this game is great. There are hundreds of books in this game, each with it own story, and in one way or another giving somethings to the overall story. You can spend hours and hours reading the thousands wiki pages of the lore (if only bethesda used the amount of effort they did on skyrims lore on fallout 76)
The graphics might seem a bit outdated, comparing it to newer 2019-2020 games, but still it holds up considering it was made in 2011.

Now on to the mods.
The mods might be the biggest selling point of this game, they are easy to import and dosn't take programming hacker man skills, you can just use nexus mods.
You can do anything, want dragons to be trains? you got it. Want better HD graphics? hell yeah homie aint nothing stopping you. Want every enemy to hit you with the power of ZEUS? homie, you got it.

Now you have probably heard of skyrim special edition. In my opinion i would advice against buying it. All you get are a bit better graphics, graphics you could get from mods. Just buy normal skyrim instead."
20247,thanks for 650+ hours of fun and annoying bugs :)

20253,"Does Skyrim need any introduction? Thought so! ;)
One of the finest crafted RPG games of modern gaming to date and certainly one of my favourites!
As a standalone game, Skyrim is sunning and beautiful.
Great stories, side quests, A.I. behaviour, dialogue and so on...it's just that good!
Skyrim with mods? Now you unlock the games full potential!
Massive library of mods to pick and choose, Skyrim's replay value is almost unlimited!
Definitely a 10/10 for me!"

20266,"Here it is, the classic game, kind of icon of  the RPG worlds and of games at all also. Times, when Bethesda was still making a phenomenal games. I remember when I played Skyrim in 2012 and it was one of my best experiences in gaming. If you haven't played it yet (for some really strange resaons) - do it, you won't be dissapoined."

20281,"Yeah
"
20282,"I like everything about it, the graphics, the playability, and even the story give you a feel like no other."
20283,"Saw a flying mammoth, built a house by myself, shouted fire at a priest and got married to a lizard. Been more productive ten hours into the game than I've been in my actual life."
20284,.
20285,Peepeepoooo
20286,It's Skyrim...of course its dope!
20287,Skyrim is a very fun and chilling game if you've or you are going through things just play skyrim and take your anger out of guards XD
20288,"Just play this game, damn it. I don't need to explain why."
20289,"All jokes aside, Skyrim remains one of the greatest western RPGs to date."
20290,"If you do the thing, and you do it right. it works, it just works."
20291,Such a huge improvement to graphics since TES Oblivion. I have enjoyed this game thoroughly! It is massive and even without the addition of community-made mods you could literally spend hundreds of hours in this beautiful world. I cannot wait to experience the next installment and all I can say is I hope one comes soon.
20292,As with any Bethesda game this title expands on the skill leveling from the previous games while adding an immersive story to back it all up. Definitely a must for the most staunch D&D player or role playing enthusiast.
20293,Just.... Yes...
20294,Love this game
20295,It's a very fun game and I think it could be one of the best.
20296,fun game
20297,It's fracking Skyrim
20298,fun
20299,is good
20300,Too mainstreamed to console players. If it would have same kind of character developement as in oblivion it would have been better. Gets boring after first run.
20301,damn boy best game ever everything is just so great
20302, kool
20303,"I have my gripes with bethesda, but Ive made my own mods for this game so this rating is expected"
20304,"The most overrated videogame of our time. Weak narratives, two dimensional characters, unimaginative art direction... You're better off buying literally any isometric rpg."
20305,i love skyrim le

20314,"If u got a lot of time, u should try this game. Also, add some mods here and there."
20315,A really fun bethesda game. Fuck them for hiding this game though.
20316,"It's fun, and I like the environment mods."
20317,"""I was an adventurer like you, until I took an arrow to the knee'"
20318,very cool
20319,yes.
20320,I 'm a fan of  this game believe it or not

20324,There's just something about this game that makes it so special. My friend told me about this game back in 6th grade yet I always come back to Skyrim every now and then. I'm heading to college and I still consider this my favorite game. Adding mods to it will make the game even more enjoyable.
20325,"Yeah, it's alright. Managed to get a few minutes in.
8/10"
20326,Good as always
20327,"Game is fairly consistent. 
The largest issues are 90% of cued games are a set percentage above your player ability. It's geared to get you to spend money if you don't have patience to wait for the new lineup to cycle. I've had this game for some time now so i have correlated the patterns. 
"
20328,Pretty self explanatory...it's the best.

20330,1 WORD = MODS
20331,"ya its good

20333,ITS ADDICITNG
20334,its good
20335,Lmfao sKyRiM is best boi download it whore >:(
20336,Skyrim gives you the option of following the story line or just do your own thing and go on an adventure.
20337,very game. such good
20338,its really fun but you will hear the same word over and over if your ok with that and also it feels like a fallout game a little.
20339,Bad
20340,pretty good
20341,"OG game to play, a lot of games have been based from this and refined, but this game still has special place in my heart. Loved my vast adventure freedom then amplified it with mods"
20342,"a amazing expeirience, even in 2020!"
20343,You will probably spend more time modding this game then actually playing it but....10/10 would mod again.
20344,"This is one of my all-time favourite games ever, and there's any number of reasons why it's constantly hailed as one of the best of all time. The immersive world, the number of quests and things to do, the simplicity (which at the same time brings in a wealth of different strategies, the modding community, the different spells and abilities, the console command, everything about this game is amazing. I've played through this game multiple times, completing every major and minor quest except the miscellaneous tasks, though this usually takes me around 100+ hours (I've played the game on other platforms, which is why I only have 152 hours on steam). I don't have a bad word to say about this game."
20345,It's Skyrim.

20351,Lots of fun. Still waiting on ES VI though.
20352,Most immersive and engulfing experience i had in a game. The main storyline is sick and the npc conversations and side quests seem well thought out. Along with this Skyrim has beautiful graphics. 10/10 would play again
20353,ok
20354,Good gam
20355,Looks like i'm about to break the law again. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
20356,Everything about the game is great except for Horse Tilting. Horse Tilting is god awful. Tiltless% all the way
20357,Always a fun game to visit after not playing it for a while. Even as a vanilla game its enjoyable to come back to.
20358,noice in every way

20361,"There's no game as insanely popular as Skyrim. Even though it was released in 2011, it still has one of the biggest fanbases a game can have. Huge map to explore, beautiful environments, music, the ability to shape one's character in various ways in accordance to personal preference in combat. 

Important to mention is the huge modding community, which allows you to add tons of modifications to your game which still keeps me playing after almost 2000 hours! I'm pretty sure that at this point Skyrim has been established as a game that doesn't even need a reference, because its a legend amongst games."
20362,"good 
"
20363,Great open ended adventure game and with mods can be played anyway you want to make the RPG experience feel just right.
20364,"iam dragin boern, iam coool and badsaas"
20365,i would if the steam platform didnt have so many issues when loading the game or the game having issues downloading
20366,"i love this game, i've pirated this game my whole life, i probably have over 900hrs (i know rookie numbers)
but this is by far the best RPG i've played, buy it, buy it now! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gKj0WJNwbI love this)"
20367,THis is one title which has huge replayability. Hell I even have the VR version.
20368,I am an old guy that played D&D as a kid.  Skyrim is perfect for me.
20369,"One of the worst RPGs ever. Boring and repetitive.

Braindead story and experience.

Only thanks to the modding community it is popular."
20370,"kinda boring, not much long term play value"
20371,"Replaying this for the first time since it came out. Love it just as much now as I did then, even more so now that I'm on PC instead of Xbox. Graphics are beautiful and the game is overflowing with content.  So glad I bought this again"

20389,yes
20390,"Get the special edition if you can. It comes with all the DLC, support to run at native 64-bit, and general improvements all at a single price that can be lower than this older version with all the dlc included in some regions. The mod support for both the editions are excellent.

I only bought this edition because it was cheaper in my region."

.6 MODDING MADNESS.

-Cons
Lots of bugs(some might be game breaking if things gets screwed)
Not as good looking vanilla as SE version(but that can solved by modding)
Not stable if heavy modded(SE is much more stable because it 64 Bit)"

20414,10/10 would shout again
20415,"Skyrim is one of the best RPGs ever made, if not the best, at least until the next installment comes out. The combat system has been improved and it is just as immersive as Oblivion.
That being said, the world of Skyrim is even bigger and has even more quest. There is something to do everywhere and the game overall is very playable, with a better interface and combat than Oblivion and especially than Morrowind. Worth the full 60$."

20436,Really? You gonna look at a review of skyrim? Do you LIVE under a rock?
20437,"Great game, spent plenty of time playing this, the SE and I watched alot of others play it. The game alone is wonderful but the bugs make it even better."
20438,"this game can be good for role playing there is a lot to do and it is difficult to get bored.

personally, my favourite quest line is the civil war 

i definitely recommend playing this game"
20439,It's Skyrim. Need i say more?
20440,"i love this game cant wait for 6 to come out 
"
20441,"It's Fun but, beware,  it contains a lot of violence.
If you dont like the graphics or the gameplay etc., you can add modifications to change them.
Oh, make sure you read the instructions if you do that."
20442,yu impiriel bastrds
20443,"One of the best single player games i'll ever play, if you've never heard of this game you're not a human being to be honest. Can't recommend it enough, infinitely re-playable and has one of the largest modding communities ever seen."
20444,Completed it mate
20445,good game
20446,"This game is not just a game, it is an experience. I love it and spend many hours playing and references from it in everyday life with friends. It's viking based and well worth it!"
20447,Skyrim is a great game. If you're bored with the main questlines you can find tons of sidequests to entertain you for days. The graphics aren't as beautiful as some of the newer games but for it's age it still holds up as an amazing game. The only thing that I would change would be the fact that I can charge straight up a 90 degree angle on a horse but it dies if I try walking down hill too fast. lol
20448,could have been more boobs
20449,here for the mods
20450,its just a great game
20451,"No need to explain, just play and see for yourself"
20452,"Its Skyrim, what more needs to be said. Lots of fun when you have mods."
20453,The graphics alone are enough to fall in love with this game.  I have entered new lands and literally had to just stand and look around before continuing on with my quest.   I've been playing this for years and it never gets old.
20454,very good
20455,is fun
20456,"If you want the perfect game, where you can do whatever you want, this is basically it."
20457,Fun open concept with many choices of game play and customizing characters.
20458,"Great game, it is not scripted. If you freeroam you can get diverent events, you can walk pass or you can go into the event and then you can get a quest. That is why I like this game. Every savegame is diverent.
There is offcourse a mainquest but its not like the game is over. You don't get the ending credits.
It feels like there are more mainquests."
20459,"Great game, not much else to say."
20460,the first scene keeps bugging and I cant continue to the acctual game
20461,"Good game. Lots of fun, especially with mods."

20470,"My relationship with skyrim was very weird... a few years back i probably sunk 500 hours into this game , but i could never get mods to work on skyrim , then later on i bought the special edition and played it through but couldn't get mods installed either BUT NOW ... NOW I AM EXPERIENCING MODDED SKYRIM FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME!!! AND IT IS AS IF I HAVE BE REBORN!
God fucking damn its awesome , buy it , play it , enjoy it , skyrim as a game is pretty fuckin nice already but mods make it 100 times more fun... and it's already a hella lot of fun without mods! The story is kinda short and not that amazing but eh that's fine the sidequests can be quite nice..oh btw BUY THE DLCS , for the love of god buy them they are sooo worth it + you need most of them for mods"
20471,By far one of the best rpgs...
20472,standard
20473,I love this game!
20474,skyrim acts out of pocket sometimes but that's alright
20475,My favorite game by far and will never be beat by the fact that I put over 4000 hours extra hours on PS3 with my additional 1000+ hours that I have shared between normal and special edition on PC.
20476,"I dislike how they hid my version of the game & made it extremely hard to get the dlc (thank you whomever the kind person who had the link to the dlc's in the  reviews section), but this isn't about a scummy company, it's about the game, which I love, & recommend to all!

Love RPG's singleplayer & multiplayer, but this ones awesome, I wish that it had been updated/patched over the years, because it does have bugs, but they're far & few between unless you go out of your way to find them."

20482,"needs mods, morrowind is better, buy it instead"
20483,Fun if you play vanilla but even better with mods. 10/10
20484,"The game is great , I just got victimized by steam back in the day , they removed that vampire dlc from my game. I bought that GD DLC , I didn't hack or exploit a damn thing , and I can't bring myself to touch the game since then. Great I'd probably try getting all the DLC in a bundle somewhere else."
20485,"Despite my overwhelming preference to Oblivion, and the superiority of the Special Edition, this game will always hold a place  in my heart as the one game I literally played for 24+ hours straight, despite its flaws...

and the mods... lets just say if the mod manager was on steam that you would have 10x the amount of hours on that than you would the actual game."

20501,"I play games like Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, I played World of Warcraft the most but, I find having a games that I can enjoy with out having to be online truly worth getting I use Wireless connection so lagging in mmos get frustrating. this game has a lot story game play time because of the side quests and guilds you can join in game and I have been drawn in by the story, the amazing detail and I became a fan of Skyrim pretty quick. this game has sword fighting, archery and magic, also many races to choose from, adding the RPG game feel in that regard. I found elder scrolls Skyrim to be my favorite single player RPG. I recommend for anyone who prefers RPG games. and those who think they want to switch from first person shooter to RPG this game has a first person mode and third person mode as well."

20514,A classic example of what a fantasy rpg game should be. A vast open world game that provides hours of distraction.
20515,"I recommend you save yourself time and buy the special edition version instead.  Bethesda is notorious for games that crash.  While some people can get around this with technical know how.  Some of us lesser minds prefer to just buy a more stable version such as special edition.  

Skyrim - Crashes would become more frequent until the game became unplayable.  Never completed everything on 1 save.

Skyrim SE - Crashes were less frequent and I was able to complete everything on 1 save.

20526,Great game to relax or get serious with. Long adventures with short side quests. Definitely use mods from Nexus to enhance gameplay - or you can play without.
20527,A Classic 9.5/10
20528,"It's pretty similar the The Elder Scrolls games if you've ever played them, but compared to TES, Skyrim is pretty watered down. 

You should buy this game for mods, preferably on sale, but I won't recommend a game which is so lazy compared to its predecessors.

This game's only innovation is the radiant quest system, which was never fully introduced and ended up as a group of generic fetchquests you can be given by a select few NPCs. 

Other than that, plotwise it retreads Morrowind's plot (prophesied warrior with a special soul arrives in a racist, barren northern province of Tamriel full of bickering factions vying for control and disgruntled natives who feel their way of life has been disrupted by modern sensibilities, prophesied warrior awakens after fulfilling part of the prophecy, temporarily settles the province's internal conflicts & fulfills the prophecy completely by killing a demigod in an incredibly sacred place after proving himself to a guy in a temple, the warrior then goes to Solstheim to vibe with a daedric prince in the final DLC pack)

And Oblivion's combat again with a few changes

Even with mods, the fact that you couldn't add scripts, models and animations to the game originally before players added them in eventually makes it absolutely amazing to me that this game's modding community ever got off the ground

To be fair, the things this game does right are:
They perfected the level scaling feature after it ruined Oblivion
It looks good visually, especially for a game made in 2011
The combat is playable
The open world is fairly large compared to most games

Don't be fooled by my time played, I have time played in the special edition too, and hundreds of hours on my xbox back in the mid 2010s where I completed every major questline (other than the thieves' guild which broke almost immediately and locked me out) and explored almost every location in the game. With that, I can pretty confidently tell you:
If you want a TES-style RPG, play Morrowind
If you want a big open world, play Daggerfall Unity or a Rockstar game
That's all this game has going for it
If you want both play The Witcher 3 or probably CP2077 idk I'll come back and change this review if it sucks, which it probably won't

Update: fuck you cp77 was pretty good"
20529,Is good
20530,"I like to hord and build stuff. Lots to do. Game codes, cheats, and quest info can be found online with a few searches."

20538,The vanilla game is great but to make it even GREATER download some NSFW mods.
20539,"it just works
"
20540,"The sheer amount of bugs and glitches in this game makes it literally impossible to play. It took me a solid number of hours just to fix the bug where my horse starts floating away in the intro scene and it doesn't trigger the start of the game. Took a few hours to fix the bug where my character constantly made the ""surfacing from underwater"" noise while jumping into the ground. Took more time to fix animals flying off into space and killing me from the sky. Now I can't run or turn without glitching into the ground. Bethesda is an absolute joke. I'm sure many of these bugs are fixed for those willing to shell out more money for the remastered version, and i'm sure theres plenty of new bugs to take its place. I will never buy another bethesda game after my experience with skyrim and fallout games."
20541,"Endless modding capabilities and in this game you can inhale 1000 skooma and kill the entire capacity in Whiterun

20544,"very nice game, there is a wiki online that helps you tons so it can be played by pretty much anyone. the game itself is well built, there are some bugs but they can be easily fixed by loading previous saves or using console commands. the 3 dlcs are really cool and fun, pretty much worth it."

20549,BEST GAME EVER
20550,The Elder Scrolls Series Is Amazing and Skyrim is no exception.
20551,"So pretty much everyone and their grandmother has heard of this game, I mean it's been released on every platform and probably even your toaster, and though this game has been released and re-released multiple times I will recommend it to those who haven't left the safety of under their rock and ventured out into the light of day in 50 years!

With every game it has it's good points and bad points, for the good points; The Combat is easy to get behind, the graphics are good, the landscape is beautiful and the voice acting is pretty well done. The way you build your character is entirely up to you,, and you can be anything you want, want to play a thief, go for it, want to play a noble knight who seeks to help the people you can, want to be an evil overlord that works to conquer Skyrim, more power to you!

The bad points well in my opinion the story could have been a bit better, as far as how Alduin is, I mean you spend most of the game fighting dragons while preparing to defeat Alduin and he's just a slightly more powerful version of a normal dragon, no difference in how he looks, he's just a recycled model.

Despite the negative points, I would still recommend this game, especially if you have a love of Norse mythology as the game has several references to it."
20552,"I mean this is skyrim. I don't know what more needs to be said. You can play through the game a bazzilion times, then when you get bored of that you can mod it to Oblivion. Great game Bethesda probably best game. I highly recommend for anyone who likes rpgs."
20553,"VERY NICE. :)
"
20554,"[h1][b]A CLASSIC[/b][/h1]
There is no way you don't get lost into Skyrim's universe. The game experience as a whole is definitely polished. I noticed a few bugs here and here but I always found a solution on the Internet to solve it. The atmosphere is unique, graphics are relevent to this day thanks to the overhaul mods. Plots are intricate, usually you get into a quest and you end up in a journey by snowball effect. There is a skill system as well that gives you the opportunity to grant your character with unique caracteristics and I find the game balanced in difficulty. Then I can say that the dialogues are furnished, I am French and actually use the game in English to improve my language skills. And when you put the game upside-down, which is my case, you can downloads some mods and pursue your journey to level 78 in order to shred that legendary dragon!

10/10"
20586,"this game is literally skyrim so that a plus right there.

If youve played skyrim, youve probably killed a dragon or two, you know what I mean?

if you did not play skyrim before, who even are you

skyrim is the best selling game on the xbox, ps3, wii, and the pc, which is incredle.

the only problem is if you go to dawnstar theres always a dragon there, so id say theres too many dragons.

i heard that they got steve buscemi to voice all the dragons, and i think tghats respectable.
you have to hand it to ron howard, he really knows how to make a video game

skyrim: 8.7/10
ron howard: 7/10

20587,"Fantastic game to get your hands on. Great for learning how to mod also for your first time
."
20588,Excellent massive open world
20589,Only thing I dislike is that steam hides the DLCs.
20590,many many hours of enjoyment had like 500 plus hours on xbox
20591,THE MOST AMAZING BROKEN MESS I HAVE EVER PLAYED
20592,"Dude, its skyrim. Just download it, yeah?"
20593,Quite fun. Unmodded is silly though.
20594,i was very hesitant about spending money on a game but this game is 10/10
20595,"Good game
"
20596,"Great game
"
20597,incredible.
20598,Just awesome. I spent in it way more time than on Steam.
20599,a very good game
20600,Imagine not owning Skyrim
20601,Best source for total bullshit. in the best possible way
20602,Good
20603,Epic adventure!
20604,great game love open world games and this one really stands out
20605,I feel like after almost 9 years you don't need to read another review that this game is good. Especially with the amount of mods for it these days
20606,"I've legitimately spent more time modding this game than actually playing it, I have spent hours upon hours over the course of months trying to fix crashes that my 200 mods would cause in an attempt to overhaul it and make it better than Cyberpunk 2077. 

While I am certain Cyberpunk will still be better than this game, once I actually played this game with all my 238 mods working in tandem perfectly it honestly changed my life forever. I felt like a new man, and I had the most fun with a game I ever had in a while.

Then my computer died and I am going to have to do all that again because I didn't save my load order.

I am a fucking idiot out of 10"
20607,good gameplay the graphics are good and overall a good game for RPG lovers.
20608,"its amzing
"
20609,This good game. Recommend I will.
20610,yes
20611,Best game ever made period.
20612,it r gud
20613,"Skyrim: Computer edition.
There are more mods for this version over the other on the Nexus, which is about the reason you'd expect to pick it over Special Edition."
20614,its the best
20615,"This game was my first M rated game I've ever played. If 752 hours on PC alone doesn't show you how much I love this game, I have over 200 hours clocked in on my Xbox as well. While Skyrim might not have the in-depth RPG elements of early ES games, modding easily fixes this issue. Even without mods, the game is an absolute wonder, with all sorts of stuff to do. With great replay value and a wide range of role-playing options, every character can be new and special. This game is responsible for my true love of gaming, the fantasy genre, and more. I seriously can't recommended this game enough. Skyrim is one of the reasons I'm still here today."
20616,"Got killed my a thomas the tank engine dragon. 10/10 todd strikes again
"
20617,"This is the best game ever made! And no I'm not a review bot, ew. Best Game Ever!!!!"
20618,"One of the best open world fantasy games ever created, which is only reinforced by its amazing modding community. Seriously if you don't have the game, get it, you're missing out.

Though a few of the quests are a bit irritating as they don't give you location markers, now where is that 24th stone of Barenziah . . ."
20619,epic game
20620,This is one of the best games ever
20621, Recommend
20622,the goat
20623,love this game just wish they would fix somethings. I know that will never happen but still a good game.
20624,Not enough Horse Armor
20625,too many glitches with quests and npc dialogs missing
20626,"Legit one of my most favorite games I have ever played. Been playing it for so long now, first on my Xbox, then my brothers PC, then on my own. I come back to it after a while and its fun again. Would recommend 10/10"

20637,"Very good game
"
20638,"I mean, it just works."
20639,epic game
20640,"Was shit. Don't trust reddit when it comes to buying games, especially if their advice is ""mod it until it's good."""
20641,"it is Skyirm!! Google it, watch reviews on it. it is a time suck that is worth it."
20642,"ofc you'll like it, it's skyrim"
20643,CC
20644,Played on and off since release. Modding community is still strong up to this day (Oldrim - Skyrim SE) Fun game to explore and get lost in. Avoid the chickens. 10/10
20645,WOOT
20646,its like the 4th time i've gotten this game
20647,"had to play on 60 fps, because of some bugs, but it was great. loved the side quests and exploring. if you still consider playing, go for it. great journey"
20648,very well put together open world and story.  Reminds me of Game of Thrones
20649,The first Vibeo Gane
20650,One of the best open world gmaes ever played
20651,This was the best version by far
20652,very fun. can be gruling at times but rewarding 9/10
20653,"Can't recommend this game enough.  Excellent the first time, still good the tenth time.  If you don't care about mods and want some slight optimization and bug-fixes, I recommend playing the special edition.  Otherwise, original buggy Skyrim is an all-time classic."
20654,Great Game. The texture on the Garlic is revolutionary and looks better than any other game; I mean no one is able to do it right and this game is just perfect I love everything about it and personally I think the garlic in this game looks better than real life.
20655,"this is one of the best games i have played if you look past the bugs you will find there is a vast world to explore and a variaty of quests to do i am still not done with every quest ingame
"
20656,Is good. Watch out for dragons n' bunnies. They both scary.
20657,cool
20658,"great game, timeless!"
20659,Have you been to the Cloud District? What am I talking about? Of course you haven't.
20660,Its a very fun game with and without mods even though its being hidden and if you find this congrats you found a random modder who's tired of steam asking if i recommend it
20661,its good
20662,great story
20663,One of the best if not the best since more than a decade.
20664,yes
20665,Amazing game!
20666,
20667,.
20668,I've known about the game for years now but I just didn't know it was good. This is probably one of the best games you'll ever play in your life! It's amazing!

20678,gud game!
20679,great game
20680,"mainly the stealth mechanics are bad, especially in the beginning. enemies sometimes see me through walls and can hear me from a kilometer away."
20681,"Its pretty good, combat is meh, story is meh, everything is meh. The only exceptional thing is the world building and the mods. Both are good enough though for this game to be pretty good."
20682,"One of the best games i've played.  There is no reason not to buy this game.  You can get married, become a vampire, werewolf and more.  A timeless must play game"
20683,Simply a great game
20684,"Skyrim is almost 10 fom 10 or 100% or ..... and with the right setup of mods you can make it your second life.

20685,Good
20686,"A good time sink though i know my hours don't match up to some of the people playing this :L

20697,"Keen for an adventure, this game has you covered"
20698,"Play the vanilla game for the magic experience, fall in love with the game with the mods. Regret all life decisions 200 hours in. Find MxR, Brodual and other mod reviewers to get more content and feel happy again."

20710,"Great game, greater with mods."
20711,This has been my all time favorite game that i can come back to and play any time!
20712,"Decent game, Lots to do."
20713,its not good
20714,awsome first time playing i understand the hype
20715,"If you have to read someone's review for this on Steam, you have been missing out. Just buy it."
20716,"I've recently paid attention to the counter telling me how many hours I've put into this game since I got it years back.

924. Nine-hundred and twenty-four f#@king hours. It really sinks its teeth into you as you try and find everything you may have missed, or new ways to deal with challenges using skills you may not have leveled the last time.

And the mod community. Saints bless the mod community. Without them, so much of this game wouldn't make sense (like equipping followers, or telling the dumbass shopkeepers to stop trying to punch dragons and vampires). And some of the other modders have gone out of their way to *massively* enhance the beauty of the world Bethesda built, turning it into a feast for the eyes or ears.

While there is of course an actual story to play, you can easily make your own story as you go and make your mark on the land of Skyrim. Enjoy it."
20717,i can die when i walk over cheese. 10/10
20718,Beautiful timewaster!
20719,wait skyrim was a game? i thought it was a mod

Slow at the start but good, and here is one command that will help exploration

20730,"10/10 game, took  my fucking life from me tho"
20731,this game is great
20732,It's the ultimate escape into another reality. Unlimited variations in game play. Choice is yours.
20733,Lots of fun and great story!
20734,hardwqere
20735,BUIETIFUL GRAPIC  STIFF CHARACTOR MOMENT
20736,Definitely an epic time killer. I can always come back to this game and lose myself in it.
20737,I like the freedom to go where ever you want and have so many choices.
20738,nice.
20739,I think it is a well made game that could use a few more mode added to it
20740,It's freakin' skyrim.
20741,"i love how it breaks its funny most times
"
20742,"always my go to, needs some mods but its still good on its own"
20743,toppity top
20744,extremely good game. has small bugs but they dont really negatively affect gameplay
20745,"Good, old Skyrim. While not as advanced as the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, it's still a lot more coherent, inspired and booming with character as the day it was released."
20746,"This game will never get boring.
"
20747,I love skyrim. There is so much to do it is always a go to game for me
20748,"good, but needs mods to not be a boring pile of rubbish
"
20749,ghk
20750,we all loves this game glitches and all.
20751,"This is now 9 years old.  And still Brilliant!  Even when you know the main plots, even when you have completed the sub plots, even when you THINK you've seen and done it all, there is something new and unexpected around the corner, or maybe, because you can play for so long and do so much in so many ways, you just forget and half of it is new again.  Love it, so much better than Elder Scrolls online (which is, or at least was oddly linear).  one day, in the distant future there will be Elter scrolls VI, with any luck it will be just as open wild and HUGE as this."
20752,A fun and immersive game. It seems as if there are always more things to find out and do.
20753,Great game. you never run out of story and you always got something to do.
20754,Masterpiece!!
20755,"ja

20758,good game
20759,"I'm into Building of structures and the Improvements of your own Manner house Is Kool, But I would keep and option on the Construction table to change the Wings if you want something else and add the option of how many external stairs to the deck and an option to be able to add a deck cover aswell. And be able to exspand the land the Manor House sits on to Further put more building to support for adding more roles to extra staff to the house , and be able to add a log wall/stone walls to defend it from passing brigands and young giants. As well to add a mineral mine into the nearby rock next to the Aperairy. If you can adopt 2 kids should be able to exspand your hold people to secure it and if you gain enough thane's staff, then I should be able to house them at the Manor House!"
20760,GOOD GAME
20761,you know why.
20762,bigk
20763,It never gets old!
20764,Very good story line. Great armor and weapons. The best of the Elder Scrolls series.
20765,will draw you into an ever changing story line with many different paths
20766,"Over 1.6k hrs played, and I've still not done everything, been everywhere, run out of new-to-me builds. Melee, pure mage, rogue, battlemage, arcane trickster, crafter, unarmed and unarmored with no spells, so many different ways to explore Skyrim. Love love love this game."
20767,its not the special edition
20768,This is such a great game. There is so much to do and so much to see it's overwhelming at times. The graphics might not be top notch anymore but it's still one of the best RPG's out there.
20769,One of my favorite games ever. Endless entertainment.
20770,"What can I say about Skyrim? Actually, where do I begin? Maybe there are no words to describe it. It is something one must play to understand. Skyrim is a whole new reality. You will get lost in it. And once you get lost, you don't really want to get out.

Seriously, if you haven't played Skyrim yet, please do. And if you haven't, I envy you. It's probably my favourite game of all time. It's a masterpiece."
20771,One of my very favorite games loads of fun lots of replay value a sure winner for me
20772,Just play it ...you will see an amazing game.
20773,h?
20774,"groundbreaking, legendary, iconic, classic"
20775,"The game is endlessly replayable, especially with mods.  I am loving some armor and weapon mods that give me new crafting options, but I've also loaded on entire ""expansions"" that add entire new game zones.  A new suite of spells keeps life interesting as well.  You see my played hours, well I've yet to get around to beating the main storyline because I keep having cool new character ideas.  THAT gives you an idea of how deep the gameplay is.  I run this game on a desktop that, several years ago, was top of the line, using maximum graphics settings without any real issue.

What can I say?  It's great, and it's impossibly deep once you start delving."
20776,"It's Skyrim, just get it. Pray to the gods the next one is similar, and not like ESO"
20777,yes
20778,the best game ever
20779,One of my favorite games of all time.
20780,h
20781,Epic adventure. Epic open-world. Skyrim is epic.
20782,Still the best Norway exploration simulator nine years later.
20783,It's Skyrim. It's the best. What more do you need to know?
20784,"6 year after i bought this game, i'm still playing.

the skill system allow various build to be experiment and mix together into what you like to play plus the huge amount of awesome mods that increase the immersion, gameplay and graphic.  

 10/10 gonna play skyrim untill new TES comes. XD

"
20785,I love the fact you can+ play any play style and be whatever you want to be the builds are so many!
20786,"vary good but you need mod, and don't get them for the steam workshop, you must go to the skyrim nexus"
20787,"its skyrim for gods sake, of course its good"
20788,good game
20789,"yes yes yes yes,
YES!"
20790,This Game seems at first to favour a more deliberate approach. Definitely not your run and gun type of RPG. Still l getting to grips with the need for considered skill level progression and not trying to max everything from the start. I'll write more when I've played more.
20791,good
20792,If you don't know why this game is good- sell your computer to someone who does
20793,"Muckle Bass, ticht drums!"

20797,good
20798,pog
20799,I think you can kill dragons or something.
20800,"not gonna lie,i beat it 3 times"
20801,good
20802,"Obviously one of the best releases of this past decade.
"
20803,i mean what is there to say? its a great game and the memes alone make it worth it
20804,"Its the most open world fantasy game I have ever played, which is great.
Its single player with great mods
Character skill improvements are very interesting
The storyline is worth the playthrough, as there are multiple stories
On the price this game is sold at, its a must buy for any guy interested in exploring the gaming world for the first time."
20805,"It's bugged af, some quests need mods and fixs from the modding community to work because they are broken and Bethesda didn't really care about fixing them and some objects such as display cases in Heartfire DLC don't even work.
Yet I still love and reccommend this game. You know, for those masochists who want to go through the land of Skyrim fueled by pure rage and hatred towards screwed up game dynamics.
I mean, as long as them game crashes only once per day, it's still enjoyable.

TL;DR: IT JUST WORKS. AND I'M NOT JOKING, I LOVE THIS GAME, BUY IT IF IT'S ON SALE. IT'S STILL A BETTER STORY THAN TWILIGHT."
20806,"Play with mods, or don't bother playing. 
"
20807,"Skyrim. End of story,"
20808,good game
20809,"I have 300+ hours in this game, multiple play-throughs and all the DLC. Amazing game.

Shame i couldn't continue to play it when i got a 2560x1080 monitor at 144hz. Wish there was an update to fix this but read that refreshrate effects the games gravity. Oh well."
20810,Where's the next Skyrim game at!?!
20811,Great game but it has been out for years so I would think most people would already know about it.
20812,[h1]I give this a thumbs up.[/h1]
20813,"Game itself is ok at best. Don't mod it too much unless you want to mod the game more than actually play it and then lose passion for the game itself to then stop playing it. 
Edit: I say this yet im still modding, it's an addiction pls help."

20830,Game is super fun and when played with mods its even better!
20831,It's bad.
20832,Im a old pro at this game i dont think it is a sticker game it does get old pretty fast but god damn the first time you play it you get immersed into the game and take the role of whatever the hell you want! I also heard the modding community is huge so some people can have fun with that. also the dlcs are amazing and the entire game is worth a buy

20846,amazing game
20847,"This game is a unique experience in that there is a lot to do, I've played roughly 540 hours of this game and I can safely say that if you enjoy games that incorporate fantasy and swords with tons of different play-styles and mods that keep the game fresh whenever you try them, then this is a game for you."
20848,"It has *hundreds* of quests with hours of playtime. There's always something to do and it keeps you entertained. After 9 years of playing this game, I still have tons of fun. You can do multiple playthroughs and change it up so it is unique every time! :)"
20849,"GREAT GAME!  if you like previous elder scrolls this will not disappoint, lots of mods for any taste, many hours of fun  :)"

20862,"THE GOOD : The Modding Community.

THE BAD : Todd Howard - if you keep buying we keep making/copying them.

THE UGLY : THE ADULT MODDING COMMUNITY!

IT JUST FRICKING WORKS!!!"
20863,"By now most know of Skyrim but to sum it up - It is a dark-ages fantasy role-playing adventure game. As is expected for Elder Scrolls games, it has a massive map and adventures which are the natural result of wandering around in it. In comparison to the previous Elder Scrolls, the graphic design is much more convincing and the AI behavior is much more natural. The dungeons are no where near as grand and the individual quest lines tend to be shorter than ES 4: Oblivion, but the number of them as well as personal options has massively improved. 
Pros - compelling quests/NPCs/landscape, easy interface, well thought-out story lines.
Cons - occasional AI F*&# ups, many dull dungeon designs, simplistic puzzle solving."
20864,"Couldn't play more than an hour, too much titty.







Kapp"
20865,nice
20866,Love this game!
20867,awesome i undertand why was game of the year
20868,It can get a bit grindy but the music and scenery are nice.
20869,"It's a great game with an amazing community. There are some minor issues but that can be fixed and overlooked with the vast amount of mods at your disposal (most of these mods are available for free by the modders themselves). If you love fantasy and adventure in an open world, then you should give this a try."

20874,"This play thru is using my high level character. A level 88 High Elf. I've put a lot of hours into him. 
I've played the un-skippable, opening mission too many times, so I didn't want to start a new game, but I wanted to change the dynamic of my already created character drastically that it felt like a new game. So I stripped him down, literally and metaphorically, starting over with a basic outfit, no gold, some food, a pick-axe, a woodcutter's axe, and a few spells.

My houses, 3 total (2 in major Holds, 1 in a forest outside a Hold), contain untold fortunes in the form of flawless gems, gold, rare, enchanted weapons and clothing. I've been in the deep dungeons and the highest mountains to fight powerful foes- slayed a few dragons in between. Vampires still attack me at night, conjuring gargoyles to help their quest at defeating me. I've looted my assassin's bodies to read the contract with my name on it.

I just wanted to relax with this play thru. Find a place new place to stay and become a part of it.

Traveling from Hold to Hold (there are 9 total) is dangerous but my master mage skills allow me to cast spells like Harmony, calming down every creature in a certain vicinity for a period of time. I can also shout Kyne's Peace, throwing my voice in a powerful, yet soothing way so that wild beasts lose their desire to fight. I desire peace with the animals and people around me.

Mountains paint beautiful landscapes, bodies of water cut through trees, while a sky illuminates in an array of colors. It's easy to take the beauty for granted when it's just back and forth to the next fight. But now I here the rain falling and the storms brewing, see the butterflies land on flowers and dragonflies dart along the water. Rather than sprint everywhere I walk more. 

When I find an Inn or small town, I leave the game sitting there while people going about their day, farming, chopping wood, selling their food and ales. Sometimes I find some beautiful scenery and pause the game so it can be my computer screen for an hour or so.

Certain tasks might seem mundane, but wood chopping, farming, cooking, mining, forging items, potion making is rewarding from start to finish. Creating lightweight, high value items makes it easier to be a traveling merchant. The plants I harvest and the butterflies I catch can create strong potions to enhance my magical abilities, fortify my bartering,  cure poisons, or even poison. Chopped firewood combined with metal ingots creates arrows, and other metals can be used to make fine jewelry studded with diamonds, emeralds, or rubies. I always keep the sapphires.

I found myself in a Hold called Riften to deliver fire salts, a rare ingredient, to a blacksmith. Having the fire salts would help his forge, and he paid me handsomely for them. After doing my own forging and bartering, it got dark. First I went around the Hold picking every flower and mushroom I was allowed to. It was hard to see in the dark so I walked up to a building without really knowing why I approached it. Other than that I needed light. 

It was the Temple of Mara.

The Goddess Mara is one of the Nine Divines that are worshiped in Skyrim. Mara is specifically the Goddess of Love and compassion, the Mother Goddess. Marriages are carried out in her name at this temple.

I approached her Shrine to activate it. The blessings of Mara cleansed any poisons or diseases that I might have had and fortifies healing spells for the next 7 hours. I must remember to seek her blessings after the time expires. 

An Amulet of Mara is now around my neck, purchased from one of the lead priests. 
It makes it easier for me to cast healing spells. It also symbolizes that the wearer is looking for a spouse.

There I sat on a pew watching others activate the shrine and thank Mara for her blessings of love. I then donated a substantial amount of gold to help the temple in their endeavors of love. 

 I have a mission myself for the temple called The Book of Love. I've agreed to help the Temple of Mara help the cause of love throughout Skyrim.

Play Skryim and spread the love."
20875,Its a really good game if you're bored and you wanna play a solo medieval adventure
20876,veri god gam for pro epic gamer
20877,Wonderful game. There's a reason people are still creating mods for it years later.
20878,"I AM DRAGONBORN!

anyway it's a shame that bethesda has decided to hide the original skyrim and the DLC 
and still tried to resell skyrim every years,

With this skyrim you can mod it, because the community itself still creating mods for this amazing game and have a large variation of mods.
the LE skyrim don't have much, AND the original skyim mods are not compatible with LE skyrim (if you wondering)

luckily you still can share the DLC with this steam guide, this guide include the All DLC (include the Hi-Res Texture DLC)

20880,Bro its skyrim you know what this game is buggy large open and fun as hell
20881,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Review

The Fantasy is bigger and better than ever before… 

Some key points that this game offers:

1.	Massive open world for you to explore.
2.	Hundreds of weapons to make use of.
3.	Freely level and upgrade your character the way you want. 
4.	Focus on one specialization such as a warrior or be a hybrid that wields blades and magic whilst being quiet as a mouse, the freedom to grow as you wish is at your fingertips.
5.	Dozens of extra quests lie in wait to keep you entertained.
6.	A Treasure trove of secrets and other unique oddities to discover.

Gameplay & Controls:

The game plays and handles beautifully on both controller and keyboard, here the choice is yours if you are playing on PC, as for the console users, they have nothing to fear here regarding layout and action use vs button options. 
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim control system has been masterfully designed to offer full control and comfort in one brilliant package.

Just like Oblivion, Skyrim is completely open world giving us the choice to go wherever we want, and do whatever we want. Start the main quest or avoid it all together, as always, the choice is yours. Skyrim has an enormous number of dungeons for you to explore and loot, filled with gold and other treasures.

“The more you use the better you get at it” levelling system of The Elder Scrolls is still in effect here but is has been greatly changed and remastered, for the better if you ask me. Previously we chose a star sign and a skill set and that was the basis of our levelling and character build.

Skyrim has since changed that completely, here you have access to everything, you can focus on being just a light armoured thief or a heavy armoured warrior armed with a sword in the one hand and destruction magic in the other, the freedom to grow and customize your character in whatever way you wish has been given to you like never before.
If you invest the time and effort you can build yourself a hybrid character that has masteries in every skill category you ever wished, for once you can be your own army, armed with everything you need to fight an entire war.

This is but the tip of the spear, Skyrim has been completely hand crafted, making its map and entire landscaping a unique masterpiece. Skyrim has a rather lengthy main campaign, but we all know that’s just a tiny drop in the bucket for any Elder Scroll game, the crown jewels lies in everything else the game offers, such as one of the many ‘guilds’ you can join, the wide variety of side and extra quests that the game offers.

There are numerous unique weapons and armour that can be found and then neatly displayed in our homes, or better yet craft your own legendary weapons and armour if your skill is up to the task, as always, the choice is yours.
Skyrim offers this and so so much more that you will be busy for days on end….

Graphics:

No RPG or Open World game can produce perfect graphics, the world is simply too big to make that happen, however, Skyrim comes pretty close to one beautiful and visual masterpiece.

The terrain is beautifully drawn, delivering that lifelike look and feel, whether we are running through the low fields that resemble autumn or the snowy regions where the snow never stops, all these regions with their unique weather conditions offer a very realistic experience as you travel through them.

The Character design has received the same amount of effort and creative design delivering not only a beautiful world to us, but one filled with numerous characters from different races, each with their own appearance and behavioural patterns. 
The world has been created with so much content, from small rivers that have a beginning and ending to rooms and dungeons complete with their own unique furniture and other decor oddities. So much effort went into this game, that it isn’t hard to say that it is a masterpiece.

Sounds:

Another masterful adaptation that has been beautifully implemented through and through. Whether it is the dozens of voice acting scenes that have been brilliantly performed to bring life to the vast inhabitants of Skyrim, or the brilliant background sounds that add life to the forests, mountains and creatures that roam this world.

The soundtrack for this game enhances all of Skyrim in such a significant way that your entire journey is so much more memorable. Battle scenes are livelier, exploration is more interesting, and just plain ol grinding is made better by the combining awe that the sounds and soundtrack offer.

Replayability:

There is so much to do, and explore in this game that it will keep you busy for hours on end, then there are the numerous quests that seems to have no ending…

Last but not least, just like Oblivion, Skyrim will have untold mods for you to make use of.

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers ahead:

To simply state that Skyrim is a masterpiece feels like an understatement! There has been so much improvement and expansion since the days of Oblivion that Skyrim isn’t just another sequel, but a breakthrough in Open World RPG gaming.
The addition of Dragons in the game is another spectacular experience. Their behaviour so smooth and fluid that their appearance is a splendour… albeit a dangerous one, but a splendour nonetheless. The developers have added so much extra content into this world that this gem will keep you entertained for days without an end.

The improved levelling system is another nice change of pace, giving us complete freedom to build the character of our choice, with little to no restrictions, which is a step forward in RPG gaming.

Skyrim is in need of a Hero and surely you are in need of a journey, so finish up this review and start this Epic Fantasy tale…

20882,"Ehh, after 369 hrs of attempted role playing and thoroughly going through obtained quests, I must say the most annoying thing about the game is the same old 5 or so voice actors ...practically everywhere... How can over a hundred people I meet and talk to all sound exactly the same?! Sure...it's ok for the first 20 or so people I meet, but after that, it was nah - breaks immersion when I'm trying to actually roleplay.

A few random crashes here and there, but not as bad as what I experienced playing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Boltte/recommended/377160/]Fallout 4[/url]........

Otherwise I guess it was an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah, for that infinite loading screen fix: https://web.archive.org/web/20200516015701/https://appuals.com/fix-skyrim-infinite-loading-screen/

20883,Finally getting a chance to really play this on the PC versus on the XBox and it's very much a solid title. Using a gamepad does make it easier to play and the title is just as beautiful.

20918,Skyrim is a great open-world RPG with a ton of content and highly developed world. The graphics haven't aged too well but they're still pretty good and the modding community is fantastic. I played this game so much when it came out in 2011 and I'm still playing it now in 2020.

20931,"Super good game, even at nearly 700 hours i still find things to do, which i have never done before.
If you ever feel like you have done it all, you can always get a mod, find a new way to do a quest, or even just start over.
Best part is: you can do whatever you want. You don't even have to do the main quest line."
20932,"One of the best games in its class, even today! Highly recommended!"
20933,It's Skyrim. That's really all that can be said. Having clocked up over a thousand hours on it I can honestly recommend it - in the highly unlikely chance you haven't played it already.
20934,good game
20935,"very fun game, chalenging if you play on hardest mode"
20936,How does it go? hey I am finally awake....... Nailed it

20939,oh yes me ooga ooga
20940,"great game, i just wish the enchantments didn't wear off"
20941,It's okay I guess
20942,pretty nice game had a lot of fun on the xbox 360 and one version and some fun on pc too i recommend this game
20943,I like the world & gameplay
20944,It's just a great game
20945,its gaem
20946,"Another incredible addition to The Elder Scrolls. Hundreds of hours to gameplay even besides the randomly generated quests.  Several things were simplified from Oblivion and especially Morrowind, which I disliked at first, but it took away some rough edges and it is a game almost anyone could enjoy. It still contains the classic trifecta of brute force, stealth, and magic for combat, which besides the variances in these general classes, make for tons of replayability."
20947,awesome game
20948,this game is my life
20949,"There's a reason I don't know anyone who plays this game vanilla. It's like an early access game. The open world is boring and samey. The dungeons are copy and paste and all blend together. The combat makes me wish the enemy would reach through my screen and kill me in real life. The mechanics are shallow. The NPCs are so laughably bland I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sub plot where robots have replaced every other person in the world except you. This game is shallow, repetitive, ugly, boring, empty, messy and soulless. I paid £9.99 and I feel ripped off. Apparently it's alright with Nexus mods though."
20950,"Well I HATE and I mean HATE the DLC Dawnguard you become a Vampire and they mess up everything you have done in all the City's. they kill people everywhere and you are always fighting because the only people that dont attack you is the dawnguard.  Very bad DLC.
Other than that this game is as good as World of warcraft a very fine game.
To bad the developers left it for dead. People still play this game a lot more DLC's could be made.
Not the custom made by the players most of them Suck."
20951,gg
20952,Skyrim is life. I'm pushing it really far with mods and it still didn't crash or anything so i f@#$% love that game ahah
20953,epix
20954,It's just amazing. The freedom. The atmosphere. The only thing that's lacking is combat. But it's not as bad as it sounds. The amount of content is huge. With mods it's one of the best experiences you can have.
20955,"Huge world, Huge lore to be discovered, many quest lines, many side quests. You just cant get bored.

Good thing is, you can leave it for a month after you complete everything, and start over with different choices and explore the results of that. 

Just a note, install the unofficial batches to fix some silly bugs in the game."
20956,"The only reason I'm doing this is to get rid of the review this popup thing. its Skyrim, you know if you wanna play it."
20957,Skyrim was one of the best games to ever come out on PC with near-limitless mod options and ownership of this base game on steam got me the Skyrim Special edition for FREE! The game is very addictive and has hundreds of locations to explore and dragons to slay. A wonderful game with one tiny issue...... Todd never fixed the bugs he just left them in there. The game has been out for almost a decade and they never fixed very critical bugs with the game so that does eat away at its value. I would only buy on sale for $5.00 or less. Also they should have made Serena a marital option but Todd didn't because he enjoys messing with the player but don't worry they have mods for that and to make her more beautiful. 9.5/10 would shoot you in the knee with an arrow and steel your sweet roll again.
20958,Mod it til it breaks
20959,I am the dragon fucker
20960,More than 1000 hours and I think I might have perfected my mod load-order.
20961,this game needs a unarmed skill tree
20962,I love this game!
20963,"I work for Belethor, at the General Goods Store."
20964,its ok
20965,"I'd rate this game very good, as long as you use mods and don't pay attention to the constant slow down and gayness, i mean todd said to put a 10/10."
20966,Its da best very fun great mods to add could play 20 times and Id still enjoy it
20967,its fun yeah init bruv
20968,"loves the graphics 
"
20969,This game without the mods looks old.. But once you install the mods is litteraly a sandbox RPG that you can litteraly do anything.. Amazing game and mod options in my opinion. Even in 2020
20970,"I've been playing and modding Skyrim since it's release. I'm have a blast with it, always something new to find and always interesting. Graphics are incredible, even on a lower end machine."
20971,iss perty epic n stuff. mods are good to have. don't pay for ur mods with the stupid bethesda mod manager or whatever it is. use nexus and vortex
20972,"グレタを見るとスカイリムがやりたくなる。
Greta Thunberg makes me wanna play Skyrim.

How dare you!"
20973,"This is an incredibly immersive role-play game with a grand amount of side quests and player options. You could easily go a 200+ hour playtime if you were to do all side quests and the main on one character. It would be potentially 300+ hours if you don't fast travel. Its only about 30 hours for the main story so that gives you an idea of just how much extra quests the game has to offer. Overall, the graphics are good, there aren't any bugs except for the occasional rag doll malfunction, and it really allows you to get sucked into the game. I highly recommend taking the game slow and trying to get the most out of it."
20974,Started my very first playthrough.... in 2020.... Late to the party but not disappointed.
20975,"The Skyrim version Bethesda doesn't want you to know about because they unlisted it.

Despite it being a dumbed down and streamlined entry in the once ambitious Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim still stands as one of the most fun RPGs to play despite of it's shortcomings.
This is namely due to the tremendous mod support that this game has with there still being active development for Skyrim on nexusmods.
You can get just about everything from fan patches that fix a TON of issues that Bethesda never bothered to fix, all the way to QOL mods like SkyUI which make the inventory system actually good.
And then there is content mods, adding things from armor to weapons, to even reworking areas of the game like the Open Cities mod to make city/world transitions seamless. And get this: EVEN ENTIRELY NEW AREAS.

However there is a caviat to the vastness of this game. It hasn't aged all too well as modern PCs above 60Hz will encounter massive Physics Issues unless the frameraze is locked at a solid 60 FPS.
And yeah, the combat is okay, the quests are all over the place in quality, almost all the dungeons are a straight line like a rollercoaster ride and many more issues that accumulate.
This was an approach taken by Bethesda more and more starting with Morrowind (Which was still absolutely fantastic, not to dig at it) as they started to water down their games more and more, going to Oblivion which has the XBOX360 as it's main focus platform and then all the way to here.

Skyrim is still a great game to play despite it's issues. But it is clear that the direction that the series is taken in is not for me.

Still a massive thumbs up from me though for the countless hours of fun this game has provided me on both my PS3 and then on PC after i got it here."
20976,"its okay. haven't played much of it, but it seems adequate."
20977,best rpg
20978,"Pros:
-Pretty nice-looking game that doesn't fry your graphics card
-Very large map with tons of quests
-Interesting and long-lasting progression system
-Huge amount of various mods
-You can shoot eagles out of the sky with fireballs.

Cons:
-In some aspects, Skyrim is quite unbalanced (some enemies onehit you; mages basically do no damage even with the strongest spells but can friendly fire your neighbourhood guards easily; mages can also perma stun any enemy with low-level fireballs; mages regen magicka very slowly in fights, so after their first three fireballs they are stuck running in circles in order to cast three more fireballs)
-After all these years and even while using the community-built bug fixes, there are still many bugs (getting stuck on undoable quests; having shadow-stripes on mountains; subtitles sometimes say something completely different than the actual person in front of you etc)
-Sometimes, the game crashes spontaneously without a reason and without saving
-Although hunting is one of the most fun activities in this game, it's not worth your time without mods boosting the prices of furs and leather.
-Food and cooking are mostly pointless.
-You need the external Nexus Mod Manager to get the most value out of the mods."
20979,"I love this game.
I often return to Skyrim just to be there. Beautiful.
All those mods too !!"
20980,"""Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.""

21020,"Definitely my favorite game of all time. I've spent countless hours on TESV Skyrim since it's release in 2011, and continue to play. Due to it's all but infinite replayability, I still find new ways to play and enjoy the game after all these years."
21021,one of the best games I've ever played. Everything in this is near perfect
21022,"The start is a bit boring cause you don't get much freedom, but when the world opens up it's an awesome experience."
21023,"The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim.. A game that I've played a thousands times before, a game that I will play a thousands times more. This is the kind of game that you play over and over because no matter how far you've gotten, no matter what other games are released, no matter how long you've played it, you come back to it because not only does it feature one of the best story-lines you've ever seen in a fantasy RPG, but it also has the deepest and best lore. I almost know more about the history and lore in Skyrim than I do of the real world, that's how interested and deeply invested someone can get in this game and I have become one of those people. 

This game will always remain one of my favorite games and I always recommend it to people who have yet to experience how truly amazing it is. Bethesda may have gotten a few of their other games wrong, I won't mention any names but it rhymes with 'Ballout: 76', but they hit this one on the head perfectly.

 I will forever love this game and keep coming back to it. So if you're reading this as a new player or wondering if you should even buy it, please do, you will thank yourself later."
21024,to be honest i thinks bethesda are cunts for removing the old skyrim i think haveing nexus and workshop mods are more chaotic than creation club i mean you dont even have to try to crash you game from a big spell or spawning thousands of sweetrolls
21025,so this is oblivion but better
21026,"one of the best games i have ever played or still playing.

If you wanna buy Skyrim do so, but dont buy the special edition"
21027,All time classic
21028,Yes...Yes...Yes...Yes...Yes...
21029,10/10 like skyrim
21030,Its fun even now
21031,ü
21032,really good game
21033,epic
21034,it's Skyrim.
21035,"if you haven't bought this already, buy it and make sure you have a few hours to spare"
21036,Your a long way from Cyrodil Imperial.
21037,"I mean it's Skyrim... it's an amazing game. Super highly recommend you play it at least once in your life. It still holds up even 9 years into it's life, and it has one of the coolest communities and by far one of the best modding communities."
21038,it's pretty alright i suppose
21039,good
21040,its ok
21041,just a fun game
21042,This is a staple for gamers. Play it.
21043,"""Would you recommend this game to other players?""

YES."
21044,yes
21045,A childhood favorite. My low play time is do to playing offline and on other platforms.
21046,"A must have for any PC player who needs a action-RPG to fill their time with. Mods are a must, though."
21047,WDADWAD
21048,"Great Game
"
21049,53 hours in. Feels like I have so much more to go! Immersive and excellent.
21050,O K
21051,game bad
21052,"Look, I totally get the shit this game gets. It's buggy, the combat (especially the magic) can be pretty meh, it's kind of ugly now that it's almost a decade old, and it's annoying that they keep porting and remastering it, but there's also a reason why it's so popular. At its best, Skyrim is an immersive, fun, endlessly moddable game that keeps on giving. I've played through this game more times than I can count and I'm still finding locations and little hidden details I've never seen before. Special Edition is fine, but I prefer this release personally - it's easier to mod, and the mods are kind of what keeps the game fresh after all this time."
21053,doof pack right here boys great stuff
21054,"One of the best game out their, I prefer this version of the special edition because its more moddable plus you can get the good graphics with mods."
21055,ummmmmmmmmmm yeah
21056,is gud
21057,really fun :)
21058,if u kno u kno
21059,"I've played this Game for more than 100 hours. What else do I need to say? 

Mod up and make sure to follow the modding order protocol?"
21060,One of the best games ever made.  Can't wait for a new one.
21061,Just buy this damn game you fool
21062,A well loved and played classic!
21063,worst game development wise....but so addictive all the bugs and quarks are memorable. legandary is unforgiving. fathomable replayability. unlike any other in the elder scrolls series. yet still pans out with lore. by far my favorite broken game.........tod howard was right it just works. thousands of hours spent.

21065,"Worth the money, fun game!"
21066,"I just now finished customizing my character (400+ hours) after getting off the cart, but from what I have seen so far it looks good. All jokes aside the game is pretty good. The game is more streamlined compared to some of the older games in the series, such as morrowind or oblivion. Personally I really like some of the mechanics and feel of the older games, and I miss my hand to hand and unarmored skills. I think Skyrim is good for the more modern action oriented players. The game is also easily modded with the devs releasing tools to help people make mods, and there are lots of free mods available out there to offer more replayability to the game."
21067,Well well well looks like you found it. Enjoy
21068,still nice with some mods
21069,its good
21070,"It's Skyrim. not much else to say. 
10/10 recommended.
brb, gonna go ride my horse up a mountain..."
21071,"Shallow, but fun."
21072,"It's Skyrim, just don't expect to see your family much while playing !"
21073,:^)
21074,I'm a few hours in and I think it's alright.
21075,"it is Skyrim ...
you probably bought it again like 3 other times and still played the exact same way."
21076,This game is worth that $60 price tag it had. I have 270+ hrs on it
21077,it's a good game.
21078,"Great game, Great story, Great Mechanics and Graphics. Overall would give it a 8/10. Recommended."
21079,U just have to play this game.
21080,"Skyrim has lots of quests and is much larger than the previous Elder Scrolls games. As with any game this size there are some bugs, generally they are easy to work around. Playing this game is simply fun and there are plenty of mods to keep it interesting."
21081,"loved it
"
21082,Nice
21083,"This is the good version. Not the traightor Bughesta version. 
This is the normal skyrim version."
21084,gr8
21085,amazing
21086,i lioke it iust so realistic
21087,"I love this game. It has many quests and places to visit that look cool. The game itself is a bit glitchy, and there are some hilarious glitches, but that makes it more fun, and there are free mods to help with the glitches if you don't like them. There is a lot of lore and so many different quests, there is so much to do, you don't need to do the main questline for years if you don't want to. This game is terrific for downloading different mods that can add stories, add funnier stuff like make everyone's head be a My Little Pony, change the game, so you have a different start, and SO many other cool things. Skyrim is my favorite game.
"
21088,very good game
21089,i don't know
21090,"best game eva, lost huge chuck of my life jamming this game, worth it."
21091,"big dragon sad, pls adopt me todd"
21092,It's Skyrim.
21093,Sex On A Stick
21094,is what it is
21095,Classic
21096,Already an all time classic. Love the series!
21097,hyu8ouhyiohiuphuijon
21098,An infinitely replayable classic.... Which is good considering Todd Howard can't stop porting it to everything but my kitchen sink.
21099,excellent game for mod's and experimenting with game creation.  Allows a unique character freedom rarely seen in rpg.
21100,I love it
21101,best game of 2060
21102,"Played it on all platforms including my old steam, and even after years I can still say this is by far my favorite game. I love it dearly and will always recommend it to anyone. 1000000000000000/10"
21103,"fun and plenty of adventure, plus mods and some other fun in your own mind quests you canmake up if you're creative"
21104,"One of my top favorite games out there, also one of the the first ones I played, so there's the nostalgic factor too. This game is one of the best old open world games out there, especially for fantasy RPGs. You can easily spend over 200 hours with side quests, the main storylines, and the DLCs. Add some mods to update how the game looks, and you're set. 
If you're into fantasy, magic, fighting, and dungeon clearing, I highly suggest you check this game out.
It's a classic, in my opinion, and while there are glitches, there are patches that totally help with that, the Steam Workshop has plenty. 
"
21105,"One of the greatest RPG's ever made, hands down."
21106,"It's Skyrim, as if you needed to know anything else..."
21107,yeah
21108,"Great game, try a dagger only run"
21109,good game yes
21110,"Even after finishing the main questline you still have countless hours of things to do, even with this PLEASE BRING US TES6!"
21111,"Played it when it first came out. Though the graphics are old, the gameplay is still fun as when i first played it. You can also add mods to up the visuals."
21112,"As an escape from reality, the game is entirely emersive."
21113,Love the enviroment and the gameplay
21114,Awesome
21115,"iF YOU DONT LIKE THIS GAME, YOU CAN GO SEX YOURSELF"
21116,Fuck You
21117,how do you not have this game you fucking weirdo
21118,"What do i have to say? 
Its Skyrim"
21119,how do i review one of the best games ever made.
21120,Beautiful open RPG.
21121,NEEDS MULTIPLAYER
21122,"it has person I kill person = fun
"
21123,"I really liked this game! 
If you are a fun of fantasy and hack and slash this is your game.
In my opinion is not as deep as Oblivion or Morrowind, but I really enjoyed this game.
The only sad part is that the mage gameplay is not so deep and complex.

"
21124,It's fucking Skyrim m8.
21125,yeet
21126,"Somehow one of the most played games of all time, its a great games for mods and exploration but the base game is as shallow as a puddle. The combat is crap the story is crap the quests, for the most-part, are crap, the characters are forgetable and the dialoge is infamously bad. If you want a good RPG game play new vegas, or the witcher and I'd only reccomend this game for the mods and considering that this isn't the games nexus page i'd say don't buy it if you cant be asked to mod it.

For mods you need this edition, comes with DLC
https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition?hmb_source=search_bar"
21127,10/10 Best game.
21128,"Skyrim is Skyrim. Got this version as a free upgrade from the original forever ago. It's the same game as the original, except technically more stable since it runs in a 64bit format. If you mod the game, that's a godsend. I'm having far fewer stability issues with this game and all my script mods than I had with the original version. Most of the best mods from Oldrim have been ported or rebuilt for SE, so if you're afraid of missing out on some of the old nice mods you don't have to worry."
21129,Its propably the best game i´ve ever played. I would spend 121 hours all over again. I am so exited for The Elder Scrolls VI.
21130,y
21131,it makes me happy
21132,"Don't buy this game, i got addicted left my wife and kids, but it was worth it."
21133,good
21134,ITs just awesome
21135,"whatever my playtime says, it's off by at least 2,000. 

good game.

yes you should get it."
21136,"it game
"
21137,Still Never completed the main story
21138,"It's Skyrim y'all, you've played it. You've played it on the PC. You've played it on the Nintendo Switch. That one guy played it on his refrigerator that one time. Absolute legend. What a lad. Be dragon. Fight dragon. Be cat. Fight...dragon. Good times."
21139,beruh
21140,It's Skyrim... enough said. 10/10. The extra graphics files from the community should be stock in the game and the people who made them should be hired at Bethesda. Grab it if you've never played before.
21141,"I have tried more times then i care to admit to create a character but menu will not allow    so i bought a disc instead of steam key but still no luck   nothing online was able to solve issue.
don't waste your money.
Spent over 20 hours trying to get this thing to work."
21142,BEST GAME EVER if you don't have it already GET IT!!!
21143,"Highly recommended. 
It's got mods for heaps of extra game play and adventures, the main content of the game is enjoyable and frustrating and best of all you don't need friends to play with. 
11/10 will be playing again."
21144,It's Skyrim not much else to say. Just avoid greedy special edition!
21145,this is a timeless classic of RPGs
21146,very fun to explore
21147,more sex mods on this version than SE... wouldnt touch those though. nasty!
21148,One of the only games that I can say with full confidence has stood the test of time. Skyrim has been one of the hallmarks for Bethesda with its emphasis on an open world RPG that many can revisit and still enjoy every second of it. My only hope is for Bethesda to take extreme care in TES VI or else they will tarnish the community they have built up for so many years
21149,So worth your time. 6 hours in and I've not scratched the surface AT ALL. So many life customization options... ahh. can't wait
21150,some depth.
21151,One of the best Elder Scrolls instance. Just running around the open world is fun enough.
21152,"An amazing adventure experience filled with tons of areas to explore, a pretty easy to follow combat system and a huge amount of hidden lore, one of my favorite games, my introduction to the Elder Scrolls universe and Bethesda games (wich became my favorite games of all time) and if there's anything you dont like you can just improve it with mods."
21153,Fun janky mess
21154,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MY PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21155,This game has definitely held up throughout the years and is one of my all time favorites
21156,Incredible game.  Endless quests.  Lots of great views.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.
21157,"are you happy now, todd?"
21158,"As a long time elder scrolls fan, I can say that Skyrim builds upon and breaks new ground for the series. The legendary edition release was one of the definitive moments in video game history, and one which can be experienced with the same awe even to this day! The scope of the world and its inhabitants, the epic quest lines, crafting, magic system, and rich character creation defined the benchmark for the genre, of which it remains a leader of even a decade past!

Yearly I find myself reinstalling, creating a character, and delving into dungeons, quests, and battles as if there was no lapse between the first experience and now. To make things even better, player made modifications bring limitless replayability and tailored individuality to the game each and every time. For those of you that have been living in a necromancer's dungeon since release and haven't experienced the game, do yourself a favor and buy it!"
21159,"A perfectly balanced game with no exploits. 10/10 It just works!

It's legitimately a fun game to play, and it's one of the few quality games that runs on my laptop."
21160,"It's skyrim, what's not to love?"
21161,gamer
21162,"Despite detesting Bethesda as a whole, Skyrim (Elder Scrolls) are the best games of all times."
21163,Nice game.
21164,Love this game can't wait for TES VI
21165,yes
21166,"Still one of the best games, i have ever played."
21167,lactating breast overlay mod for CBBE
21168,one of my favourite games of all time. would highly recommend this game to those who like RPG games.
21169,"Dragonborn big funny
"
21170,Very fun game
21171,It's Fooking awesome
21172,Play it. You'll be addicted right away.
21173,you can be as inventive as you wish & it usually works well.
21174,"its the elder scrolls: skyrim, i think the game kinda stands for itself at this point"
21175,classic and really fun game
21176,delicious
21177,Its Skyrim man. Just buy it. Also mods.
21178,Skyrim Good
21179,of course... It's Skyrim duuuh...
21180,snow
21181,Very worth your time and effort. Very immersive RPG open world game.
21182,This is the superior version of Skyrim.
21183,"fuck yee dragons boys 
"
21184,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

Fascinating experience.

Get it."
21185,"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
"
21186,good shit.
21187,Wake up
21188,"Good game, good graphics, lots of content, extreme replayability"
21189,"Skyrim holds up as a solid game, years after it was even released. Strong replay value."
21190,Play Skyrim. It showed me what an RPG is.
21191,JUST BUY
21192,"pls
"
21193,"How are you seeing this review? Old-rim is unlisted on Steam... Look, just buy it again. We might as well fund TES:VI with steam Skyrim sales alone. I loved this game when I got it. It holds a special place in my heart. This was my childhood. It's still got some of the bugs expected from Bethesda, but honestly, it's an amazing game. However, check out Special Edition before you buy Old-rim. There's fewer mods for it, but still, that might be a better way to spend your money since it's more graphically advanced, and it's running on the newer, more polished engine.

90/100. Please, Todd, give us TES:VI already..."
21194,Fuck yeah
21195,"I would be very surprised if anyone has yet to play this game who has any interest in rpgs. The Elder Scrolls are by far my favorite games, Morrowind being the best, but Skyrim is a solid runner up. The graphics are only a small part of what make it great. The character creation, side quests, skill lines, and ability to design weapons and armor really make this game great. I have over a thousand hours sunk into it and still find new things to do."
21196,the best game if you mod the game
21197,"It's a nice game from 2011, it's similar to the Fallout series except it doesn't have weapon mods. Still has a very expansive open world play-style and many people still play it to this very day! It also has a workshop where you can add your very own game mods if you know how to create them. Give it a try, you might enjoy playing it!"
21198,pooppooo
21199,Its a very good game with exellent video
21200,i have always liked skyrim since my xbox 360
21201,I like Skyreim
21202,"I recommend this game, I'm sure you've heard it all before why you should play this, and if you will play this you will and if you won't you won't. But if you want my input, yes you should play this! Enjoy!"
21203,"It's a Skyrim, what the hell you want from this review?

It just works."
21204,Stealthy Archer Simulator 2012
21205,"Skyrim is a time-honored game that is so beautiful and realistic that it's breathtaking even to this day. I have played Skyrim since middle-school, and I am now a full-grown adult. I still love to play it, and I'm still discovering new things to love about it! It's a wonderful, open-world game that everyone should try out at least once."
21206,ideed
21207,"Yes, I recommend this game. It's Skyrim, they release it for something else every other day.
Just waiting for when they release it for my toaster.
There's nothing for me to add that everyone else hasn't already said.
"
21208,i
21209,You haven't bought this yet?
21210,Cool game.
21211,fun and big enof to last almost forever
21212,e
21213,You can play this game again and again and still find it interesting
21214,"Skyrim(the regular edition)has been removed from the steam search engine, but you though, the true pc gamer has managed to find it anyway. If you are seeing this, I will assume you already own the game and are reading this for the purpose of nostalgia; a truly noble cause. If this is the case, fulfill the inevitable, mod and play this game until it breaks.
If you have never played this game, all I can say is that the money you will pay for it will be negligable to the amount of pleasure you recieve. There has never been a game quite like this and I doubt there ever will be again. Its your move."
21215,"best game ever
"
21216,"it's skyrim. at this point that's all you need to know
"
21217,Best storyline game ive played
21218,"Some advice, do not delete all your saves.Because when you try to repair a quest the files will no longer be there....lol"
21219,"No matter how long I don't play for, I can still come back and enjoy every minute of this beautiful game"
21220,LONG TIME P[LAYER
21221,This game is one of if not my favorite games in the world. It's not perfect but what is. I love the modding capabilities that is unlike any other game. 10 out of 10.
21222,"So many bugs in the game have rendered it uplayable for me. I really wanted to get into this game and finally bought it and started playing. Originally I loved it, but now when I fast travel I lose the ability to regenerate Magicka and Stamina. The only way for me to fix it so far is to not fast travel and go back to my last save point. When I get to a certain area of the map it breaks my game. Bethesda has not answered my emails regarding these issues and from the forums, it seems it is an ongoing bug they have no intention to fix. If they fix the issue I will happily change my review, but for such a large company, they just don't seem to want to resolve this issue."
21223,I have probably 400 hours total into this game before it was even on Steam. It's a great game...buy it and get sucked into the amazing world of Skyrim. You don't need to read a long winded review. If you like high fantasy and RPGs...buy it now.
21224,"Skyrim is an amazing, immersive and incredibly detailed game. My brother and I have played it for years, and it never gets boring. There is always something new to find and see, and the music is truly a masterpiece. I have never seen or played a game with graphics as good as this, ever. I would definitely recommend it to everyone! I'm not sure I even have something bad to say? Maybe that not long into the game, you'll wish you lived in Tamriel and the knowledge that you can't will forever haunt you.

Have fun!"
21225,"Gay, cause they hid this version and trying to milk skyrim even more wwith now 3 or 4 different editions???
WTF Bethesda, just quit"
21226,"Fun game with a lot of content, and it does have replay ability."
21227,yes
21228,i love rpgs
21229,"It's Skyrim. I don't think there are many people in 2020 that haven't played it yet. I purely got this on PC to play with mods. It some how makes a game I wasted so many hours on, much more enjoyable than it already was. My only advice is...make sure you have a computer that can run all the mods you're going to use."
21230,"I love all of The Elder Scrolls series so far I own ( III, IV, V ). I hope to have them all in the next 6 to 9 months, I will continue to get them as they are produced, until I own them all or die which ever comes first."
21231,very good game
21232,can recommend.
21233,Why you looking at this get the F***ing game
21234,"This is the epitomy of garbage. Cold and rotting. Just trash.

Unless you wanna larp as a blacksmith or something. If you like to larp, this is for you. I prefer to live, and when I play video games I want to play. Larping has its place, but not in a ""role playing game"". A role playing game has you play a role, with a purpose in life, like finishing the damned story and having it be a rewarding experience.

There is no reward here. Dumb NPCs, abortion of a storyline, just trash."
21235,play it
21236,The best
21237,a true classic and highly recommended.
21238,"Over 1000 hours into this game spent on the same character. I plan to live another life eventually but this one's still going strong. I have a heavily modded game and don't expect to run out things to do with this first character any time soon. I love taking screenshots, as you can see if you check my profile. I wish more games were this customizable and open.  I sometimes finish a quest but most of the time, I'm just out there doing what I want to do."
21239,I love it. I wish it was easier to play on my laptop.

21248,Best game ever made.
21249,hhooo
21250,It is a great game!
21251,"Look, it's F****** Skyrim. If you have not heard about this game or not played it yourself yet, just think of all of the crazy memes that you've no doubt seen. This game became a gaming culture phenomenon. Get it. Play it. And you too can be an adventurer. Until you take an arrow to the knee that is."
21252,very good game
21253,Its alright :)
21254,"I have been playing skyrim since it was released, and the games that came before. I recommend skyrim AND Oblivion and all the games that came before. This series is amazing and timeless."
21255,It's the perfect game.
21256,Good game when played as released.  Adding mods makes it a whole new experience and it can become quite addictive.  Kudos to Bethesda for making it so moddable.
21257,A good escape
21258,There's a reason why it's a classic. I recommend it to everyone!
21259,"Congratulations on making it successfully to the Realm of the Unlisted. Here are your rewards.

21272,IT JUST WORKS
21273,It's ok I guess.
21274,great game fam
21275,This game is legend ... wait for it ... dary!!
21276,"The best Open World RPG. After so many years is alive and well because a strong community keeps adding content and improvements to all the game aspects.
A good central story, and a lot of side-quests to keep you busy for hours."
21277,"I am more of a Fallout guy but yeah it's cool, especially if you like fantasy"
21278,E P I C
21279,"Immersive game play hours of fun ,different routes to take"
21280,ITS SO GOOOOOD I PLAY ALL DAYYYY
21281,"Awesome game, my original pc with the original copy perished a few years back, had over 800 hours played on it. Highly recomend, and modding is topnotch too."
21282,"It's skyrim, so 6 stars"
21283,"decent, tod howard is a bastard tho ngl
"

21286,20/10
21287,"best game ever i played, it has plenty of mod you can install and their gameplay was the best if you guy like hack and slash style play.."
21288,I grew playing this game on the ps3 and man i really do think you'll enjoy this game P.S khajit is overpowered use them rofl
21289,"In my opinion The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is the greatest video game of all time, rivaled only by Fallout 4. (Bethesda is very good at outdoing themselves.) As of the date of this review: I have played Skyrim for almost 200 hours on Steam, but that does not include all the countless hours that I spent playing it on XBox 360 before I had a computer that could give this game justice.

Skyrim allows you to create your very own unique character and play the game any way you want. You can be a hero, a villain, or neither and just be a farmer, miner, or anything else that you would like to be. 

The game is not linear. You can chose to complete or not complete the main questline. Either way the game continues indefinitely, and there are always new things to do, or new adventures to go on. All in a massive beautiful game world with a deep and fascinating history."
21290,Nothing negative to say other than the fact that if you nolife it there's eventually nothing left to do.
21291,Just get it!
21292,"I've spent thousands of hours playing Skyrim since its release, both console and PC. Skyrim is currently my all time favorite game, a spot previously held by, MYST, released in 1993. Skyrim is one of the most immersive games that I have ever played. I found it very easy to get completely lost in the game and its many story lines for hours on end. Skyrim is an immensely enjoyable game for those who indulge in their imagination, allowing you to be, almost realistically, someone or something else. Skyrim is a breathtaking example of some of this worlds most creative minds."
21293,Gud
21294,"the best bethesda rpg so far, but fr tho where's TESVI?"
21295,"Great game. 

My two cents:
I played and enjoyed Oblivion more though I don't have the ""record"", and while I didn't play Morrowind as much as Oblivion I feel like the Elder Scrolls series is loosing it's luster."
21296,"its pretty boring without mods, at least to me, (dont download too many mods or else you wont be able to start up the game) its very hilarious when it breaks and overall a joy but as a serious RPG it doesnt hit the mark. good fun though if youre looking for a laugh"
21297,My absolute favorite game without a doubt. Played three times through!
21298,crashes
21299,Perfect
21300,"This game is good, however it is not as spectacular as the reviews or the internet says. The animations are stiff and akward, sometimes random NPC's try to talk to you while another NPC is saying something important etc. I feel as though the guilds especially are uninspired, the theives guild is more of a ""fight some stuff on the way to get to the item"" rather than an stealthy interesting experience like the guild in skyrim should have been. All of the other guilds are the same all a former shell of their counter parts in oblivion. However, this does not detract to much from the amazing open world that Bethesda has created, there is so much to do from helping a captured stormcloak soldier escape from Imperial soldiers to delving deep into dwemer ruins in search of great treasure. In conclusion, Skyrim is a great game but there are some major problems that the reviewers tend to not see.
"
21301,reet
21302,now this is a video game.
21303,You  play for thousands of hours and still have more to do.
21304,Praise be to Tallos.
21305,"One of the best Elder Scroll games
"
21306,it's okay
21307,Great game . You are free to do whatever you want to .
21308,I may not have very many hours of this game on PC but if I added the hours I have of this game from my PS3 it would be well above 500.  The game play of this game is a bit bland but is very tolerable and same goes for the story.  What makes this game  amazing though is the seer amount of content available.  Well over 100 hours of content is in this game and if it isn't enough there's modding.  I'll be honest the only reason this game is still talked about the how well it is set up to be modded.
21309,Yes
21310,uhhhhh good game
21311,Great game.  Played for hours and hours.  Definitely recommend.
21312,This game is great. If I need something to do this is what I go to.. It manages to never make me bored. I admit there are some scenes that creep me out but even then they are just quests. There are so many options to what you can do on the game quest wise. Rate- 9/10
21313,You know this game is great
21314,loli good
21315,fun game
21316,Best gameplay so far.
21317,"It's Skyrim, broh."
21318,Skyrim is a phenomenal game with an amazing story line and open world.
21319,10/10 it just works
21320,Even without mods still better than Fallout 76
21321,it good.
21322,Amazing game by itself but mods magnify it by 10x. Can recommend this game for sure!
21323,install sexlab
21324,"Imagine not having skyrim in 2020, 10/10 game, even better with mods"
21325,This game is awesome its so in depth ive been playing it for 10 years and still love it
21326,Classic.
21327,I have 75 hours yet have never been over level 20
21328,Best game out there canny lie
21329,One of the best RPGs ever made
21330,"How did I pick this up: Steam sale

Pros: Great story, music, RPG elements, tons of side quests and factions to work for. 
EXCELLENT replayability - I made three characters that finished the base game, and one that finished the whole game with DLCs.

Cons: I played this before the DLCs arrived, and there are some terrible game breaking bugs. 
Though in the latest version in steam (bought it with DLCs), didn't encounter any of them. So there are no cons now.

Conclusion: Must have. Get it on sale if you can, but this game is worth its' full price. Definitely one of the best games that I have ever played, second only to Witcher 3."
21331,Best open world game ive ever played hands down!!
21332,goood
21333,it fun
21334,Yeah It's Ok right now buy i want to add mod to see how it goes with them
21335,This game is my childhood and I love it no matter what.
21336,it's skyrim
21337,fun and cheap
21338,It's Good.
21339,Would not buy a third time
21340,Skyrim ist gut!
21341,Amazing
21342,immersive world
21343,Pretty good
21344,good game
21345,"skyrim is good for the childen of the world and i love it too and i love childern and i found a big hole in my heart cuz i don't have child and i need one in i pussy hole rn #motherlyproblems

edit: i ended up changing gender and i hate kids now cuz i forgot a kid killed batmans parents i love how kids do the whip nae nae tho i like it when they do the fort night youtube style comment below you epic gamer moent i'm 45 y/o i'm gorwing still :_::::"
21346,For some reason I never had recommended this after all these years get this game if you haven't already. Original Skyrim on PC is the greatest version of this game especially for modding
21347,Its good
21348,EPIC
21349,"Get this version, as you are able to install mods at will!"
21350,Its Skyrim
21351,Just a great all around game. Plenty to lose one's self in for hundreds of hours.
21352,"Good story, diverse range of weapons and spells. Great for RP"
21353,Incredibly fun and immersive game. I've so far clocked in a decent 89 hours total of playtime and I'm still as invested in it as I am when first playing after installing. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a new game that won't get old for a long time.
21354,tis good
21355,"Buy it so you can play Enderal. 

Just make sure you play this first, or you'll be disappointed when moving from a free total conversion mod to a AAA game and realizing the former grossly outperforms the latter."
21356,good game
21357,"Okay.
"
21358,balls
21359,">Serana isn't real
>Why live?"
21360,I don’t think I’ll ever stop playing it. :|
21361,"Skyrim, progenitor of a million memes. Overall the game is an interesting first or third person RPG. It is an RPG first. The story is one of the core components of the game. That being said, it is hard to identify just one ""story"" that Skyrim tells. There are little stories ongoing in each of the towns. Some of them tie in to larger plots that are affecting Skyrim as a whole, others are unique to the hamlet they are told in. The world feels appropriately active, assuming you don't look at it too closely and recognize it is still a computer RPG.

Skills improve through use, and levels are gained as skills are improved. The system for specialization is easy enough to understand and allows for either strong specialization or generalization. Gear has some interesting characteristics, but isn't central to the overall enjoyment of the game. It is not a loot RPG, but a story RPG. 

The modding community is also pretty active, even after so long adding quite a bit to the longevity of an already lasting game."
21362,its fun but a great glitchfest
21363,"A game that will last for generations

 because Todd Howard will remaster it"
21364,lo juego y ya me vengo
21365,Goat Game
21366,"this game is only a game for EPIC gamers, oh yeah and i got like 96 hours from playing it like 2 years ago lol."
21367,"if you havent played skyrim yet
1. what have you been doing
2. get it now"
21368,até que é legal
21369,not bad
21370,My absolute favorite game.
21371,Best fantasy adventure game ever made.
21372,its fun
21373,"P Cool. So much stuff to do, when you start over again, the game is definitely  going to be different in quite a few ways."
21374,C'mon.  It's Skyrim.
21375,it's okay i guess...
21376,Bruh.
21377,LoLz
21378,"It's like Skyrim, but with guns."
21379,I _like_ it ! :)
21380,good
21381,"large world, plenty of play and replay time.  then you can mod the $#%&*#$ out of it, and it is a brand new game!"
21382,best game ever
21383,"fun, interactive, interesting, cool, fun."
21384,AWESOME GAME!!!!
21385,"""A Masterpiece."""
21386,Skyrim is my everything! <3 I love the capacity in the game engine for modding and all the wonderful mods creative artists have come up with and put out there for us to play with! <3
21387,Honestly if you don't like the way it is just mod it till it is lol.
21388,Good  game. Better when modded.
21389,pretty dope i guess

21395,mods
21396,This is one of my favorite games of all times
21397,Great game.
21398,"I like the old games better. That said, this game is still really good. I actually have way more than just the listed hours, as I launched from a mod for at least half the playtime. Just download a few mods and Skyrim is Ace."
21399,It's Skyrim. It's good.
21400,One of the greatest games ever made
21401,Kill dagrons
21402,Great game!
21403,This game is the ultimate in single player rpg's.  Character development is well managed and skillfully implemented.  Above all the game is fun if you love the lore and mythology of Skyrim.
21404,"это - просто шедевр, в который можно играть вечно. Проходя за всех и за вся.  111 часов, я просто играл и проходил побочные задания, и сюжет. 
Я сам раньше не любил эту игру, и бо не понимал в чем её прикол, мне казалось что это самое обычное РПГ, но когда начал в неё играть - мать твою это шедевр. И игру должен пройти все кому не лень.
"
21405,you can get sex mods and thomas the train
21406,Do not recommend! It has a million glitches. Buy the Special Edition instead.
21407,"Best Open World Game.
TBH, there is no Match to the Elder Scrolls Series.
Great Work Bethesda, Zen studios and special thanks To Todd Howard and his Creative Team.
A great Salute to one of the greatest composer of all time: ""jeremy Soule""
You Guys Got all My supports.
Thanks For this great ART and MasterPiece."

21417,Old good one
21418,yes
21419,"Vast, intriguing, fun, difficult questing at times that is not a negative."
21420,"I still have yet to complete the game as it was intended, but I have had a ton of fun doing all of the glitches and exploits."
21421,Good RPG fantasy game with a large modding community.
21422,guuuuud
21423,I've perfected heating  a pizza lunchable in the oven
21424,aws
21425,very fun
21426,I have never played a game as long as I have put hours into Skyrim.  Multiple Versions.  This is a fantastic game that has been enhanced by an online community of very talented programmers who have provided any experience you could think of.  Go for it!
21427,It's Skyrim. What more do you want?
21428,"oh, Skyrim, what i say about it? nothing, i don't need to say nothing. you have ever listen about Skyrim, i know. buy it and go play, there is no deception.

and after complete all the vanilla game and the dlcs, you can explore the mods of community, there are many who are very good

(buy the other version)

sorry for my english :("
21429,"This game has an interesting story, nice gameplay, amazing graphics, and all I can say is I reccomend this game."

21439,"My youngest, I got him a Switch. and he really got into Zelda. And he hadn‘t traditionally played those games, and he was too young to play Skyrim when it came out. Then when Skyrim came out on Switch. I said. ‘Well you‘ve played a lot of Zelda. I think you might like Skyrim.“ And I want to do it as the father, like ‘Please, play this game, and see if you like it.“ And the short story is: he got obsessed with it. That's how i'm sold Skyrim to my own son."
21440,Its Skyrim!
21441,Yes.
21442,"click on the bad guys they fall down
2/10 too much game"
21443,"""fun"""
21444,yes
21445,One of the best RPG:s ever released for the PC.
21446,is dank af
21447,it sucks
21448,"Very addicting if your into wizards and dragons. Plenty of guests, armor, weapons, and shouts so it's difficult to get bored. Even runs on my bogus ass computer. Nicely done Bethesda."
21449,The Elder Scrolls Series is the best. ever. forever..
21450,"Awesome game, really like the DLC where you can become a Vampire"
21451,isgud
21452,if you no like you small pp
21453,yes
21454,Bad game
21455,It's okay.
21456,After all this time the game still holds up and is a excellent adventure and action game
21457,"One of the best Games I ever played , only cons Graphics slightly dated .

over 600 hours , really recommended"
21458,One of the greatest and most immersive games I have ever played. No wonder Todd likes it so much!
21459,awesome
21460,"i havent gotten past the first story questssss

21464,It's Skyrim innit. Nuff said
21465,"Always been a favorite, would definatly recommend for any RPG fan. Most of you contemplating buying have already known this for a while anyways"
21466,Damn you Todd! the addicting gameplay has forced me to buy this game a total of six times for me and a friend. Curse you Todd!!
21467,It is one of the games I could not have stopped playing since then.
21468,its good
21469,game very yes
21470,"Open World, freewill."
21471,The game that first got me into having long play sessions. Still one of my fav RPG's
21472,good
21473,This is both the best game ever and the worst game ever :)
21474,This game has stood the test of time for me. The feeling of playing this game brought me back to the first time I played Final Fantasy. Absolutely enjoyed every aspect.
21475,it's just skyrim.
21476,By far the most complete game I've ever played.  Approximately 25 hours in and I feel like I've barely touched the surface.
21477,Fun.
21478,good
21479,I think Skyrim is an allround great game that just doesnt get old.
21480,"Even after years this game's graphics are amazing.  I'm a bit older now, but the townsfolk still think its a good day when I'm around - even after I took an arrow to the knee."
21481,Epic game.
21482,"   This game is absolutely classic. It is a wonderful mixture of so many things- combat, puzzles, lore, story. There's just enough of each for those who like those kinds of things but not so much that those who don't are truly bothered by it. It's got magic, monsters, dragons, wonderful story plots that are pretty optional to follow, for those who aren't a big fan of story-based games. In fact, every quest is completely option, except for the tutorial. You can literally just wander the world of Skyrim without doing any quests and be perfectly fine. And this game rewards those who explore as well, often times you can wander off the trails and find treasure and all sorts of things. It's a truly wonderful game and I'd recommend it to anyone who is even mildly interested in RPGs. The only thing is that there are some glitches. That is a result of the game's massive world, I'm sure. Some glitches are benign, some are even entertaining. There are some that can be a bit annoying and it's always frustrating when your game crashes. However, I wholeheartedly believe that this game it completely worth having to deal with a few glitches. It's a game that you can spend hundreds to thousands of hours on and not get bored, with so much to do it's almost impossible to do everything. I have this game on many different consoles as well as on the computer so I've had to play this game with new characters going through it again and each and every time, I always find something new. It is truly one of the best games I have ever played and I don't think you'd regret buying it."
21483,i mean you know
21484,its alright
21485,addictive
21486,dragonborn go fus ro dah
21487,skyrim
21488,dragons = annoying
21489,It's a really good game even if freaks you out.
21490,cool game lots of killing
21491,"Excellent game, endless replay value and most modded game to occupy your time"
21492,aight
21493,a good game played lots love hunting dragons just don't forget your potions and spells and have fun exploring the world
21494,giiii
21495,"2475 hours of gameplay divided by 16 (8 hours subtracted for sleep) and that equals me playing this game for almost half a year. 

Likes: Extensive story content, huge world, cool death scenes, weapon/armor design, artwork, music, voice actors, character customization, addicting

Dislikes: Bethesda bugs"
21496,nostalga!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21497,"With over 3,000 hours in this game, I can honestly say it was life consuming, and life influencing. The greatest thing about this game, however, is the modding community. What skyrim has become is a sandbox for devoted creators to make something truly their own, and to share that with the world. Skyrim isn't a game, its a canvas to paint the world you want to inhabit."
21498,"its skyrim, whate else do i need to say"
21499,"I love skyrim because its a big ass game without having to eat lots of disk space not like, lets say: GTA 5. And I dont care about the bugs because we can easily fix them. Oh and nice job at hiding the OG edition, assholes"
21500,my entire teens was spent playing this game
21501,Absolute banger.
21502,EDF
21503,"amazin, spent more time modding then playing. 10/10 game though"
21504,Gotta pee Gotta pee for the single's Party.....
21505,Horses
21506,A great RPG with expansive content.
21507,"The story is fun and there are so many different ways to play it. Especially with all of the DLC. However, the mods add so much replayability that I'm still playing it almost 10 yrs later."
21508,It's a good game
21509,its greeat
21510,Best RPG ever made.  They need to come out with another.
21511,"Love this game, can start over with new characters and end up with different outcomes and quests."
21512,What needs to be said
21513,One of the best game in my life
21514,An absolute perfect game for gaming in quarintine. I loved every hour of playing. Surprisingly the glitches make the game actually a very fun game. And the modding community gives you countless hours of gaming.  8.9/10.
21515,why are not playing this already? GET ON IT
21516,"haha mod
"
21517,Dude this isnt my first buy and probably wont be the last besthesda. Love this video game.  One of the best games of its time.
21518,"Skyrim is my favorite game.
Skyrim is old but has the best gaming experience in my opinion.
You can read **ck tons of lore or you can just get to cutting off heads and disintegrating your enemies.
For when its released i'm surprised it didn't get game of the year, it has good performance considering its release date, really good fighting amongst other mechanics, and has a great storyline not to mention the ability to download mods. I got the game for $15, its the best ***cking $15 i've ever spent. BUY IT!

21519,Amazing and cannot wait for next installment
21520,good shit
21521,"This is one of the most amazing games i ever played. I love all the story aspects of the game, Even when you beat the game there is still so much more to do. .So i realllly recommend you to buy this game."
21522,"It's Skyrim, one of the most popular games in the world, why wouldn't I love it.  You've seen the memes and it's impact, give it a try already."
21523,I CANT GET THE DLC
21524,"As someone with a lot of experience playing a lot of different games on a lot of different platforms, Skyrim is quite possibly the best single player experience thus far."
21525,I would kill for this game
21526,good
21527,Strange
21528,One of the best games of all time. A must play for every gamer.
21529,Combat and leveling up is fun. Graphics are great. The world is big and easy to immerse yourself in. And therein lies the danger...
21530,"Really awesome game, it's been out for years and I'm still discovering new quests and things to do in game. I'm really enjoying it."
21531,"This game is bursting with life thanks to the insanely amazing modding community! 
The music is also stellar, I cannot deny it's got a bomb-dot-com soundtrack
So of course I had to give it a go (bought this years ago)...and was ultimately disappointed/bored. 
The game world and characters feel incredibly shallow, not to mention the dungeons which feel extremely rinse&repeat style. The world without mods looks so bleak and empty. For me this feels like an RPG that isn't exciting or worth exploring since all the zones feel/play the same, nothing is spontaneous. None of my actions make a real difference. Fallout 3 is the same.
That being said if you like RPGs like this (or wanna build your own secksi harem with mods) you will enjoy Skyrim. It's 100% NOT a BAD GAME. Just not my cup of tea. 
Elder Scrolls Online on the other hand actually improves on Skyrim...ALOT. I recommend that over Skyrim anyday."
21532,Endless replayability.
21533,"i would say no seeming it crashed when ever it got past when it sayed bethesda but i was able to play an hour which i found fun but not fun once it keepet on crashing 
"
21534,"Great game with hours of entertainment but when you finally get bored youll need this
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim"
21535,"This game is very good.  The map itself is one of the most detailed maps in gaming, the gameplay is just amazing and fun, and really hard to get bored of, and the amount of things you can do is amazing.  You can adventure, get married, buy things, get better at skills, it's amazing!  Even from 2011, it still manages to hold it's own feet up way into 2020, and is remember as a classic.  I highly recommend at least trying this game, and getting lost in the wonderful land of Skyrim."
21536,Is good.
21537,"Mods keep this game alive. Even with 650 hrs in this game, I still play special edition which is simply the more stable version of the game because of some game fixes. This game has a special place in my heart. I started on a friends xbox 360 and go to lvl60 before finally getting a PC that could handle the game and playing so much of it."
21538,One of the best RPG's ever made.
21539,"Skyrim is a great game. there are many different paths to take, and you aren't forced to only follow the main story line."
21540,"It's Skyrim, wtf are you waiting for???"
21541,"All Bethesda games have issues. That doesn't make them not enjoyable experiences.
Skyrim is a great sandbox, and with the support of modding, has allowed many people to stretch their creativity."
21542,"goated game, over 1000 hours on ps3"
21543,"its fun, give it a try if you're not busy."
21544,favorite game
21545,I mean its skyrim bro.
21546,do i really need to say anything about this game ? is skyrim you will love it buy it on every plateform you have
21547,It's Skyrim. The only reason you are reading this is because you are stingy with your money. Just buy the game and enjoy it. This is a masterpiece.
21548,"What more is there? An epic journey no matter which path you take. Assassin, thief, paladin of virtue: all require an epic journey of transformation. It's what makes Skyrim one of the greatest games of all time."
21549,"Played for a bit, might pick this up again and try mods."
21550,RP?
21551,"arguably the best open world rpg's that has been created. hundreds of characters, immersive storylines, beautiful scenery. it will easily get you invest at least a 100 hours into it."
21552,"love the game, you can mod it if it starts to get boring"
21553,It's a must play for everyone that likes RPGs and one of the best RPGs ever made. But it's not the best Elder Scrolls.
21554,Love the game
21555,"To put it simply, if you spend enough time playing this game there is much you can do for hours and hours. when you're done with that you can spend even more hours (days worth of  cumulative hours) if you want to experiment with mods. with mods this game can be made into alot of different things that can surpass the original vast realm of possibilities that the core game and its dlc already provide. it is definitely worth a purchase if you like sand box games like gta, or if you've played previous elderscrolls or fallout games, or if you like games like TESO obviously or fable, WoW, Kotor, Dragon age, mass effect. my point is its one of the most solid single player games of all times if you are judging on playtime and in game activities and roll playing. Add environment mods and graphics mods to get further immersed"
21556,"7/10. Too much rim, not enough Sky."
21557,"Skyrim: This game has taken thousands of hours of my life away, not only on pc, but switch, xbox, pc in vr and special edition. What a wonderful game. 

Tip: Don't buy if you want a life."
21558,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/

You will probably need this 
"
21559,greatest game ever will buy 1000 time if i had to
21560,Its skyrim.... need i say more?
21561,Perfection
21562,its skyrim what else do i need to sy
21563,"You really can complete this game in a few hours, but its richness relies on the nearly infinite ways in which you can explore and inmerse yourself in this incredibly detailed world. Despite having more than 8 years, graphics can be improved and featurescan be added thanks to the inmense community contributing to the game. Still my favourite"
21564,"Don't even think about not buying Skyrim. This game is a MASTERPIECE. The open world is the richest i've seen. It dwarfs Red Dead 2 and The Witcher 3 together in content. Plus it has the biggest amount of mods i've seen. You can't check out all the mods even if you spend your life doing so. 

Pros: Detailed fantasy open world where every fantasy trope can not only be found but interacted with. It has a main story but you can ignore it and go on adventures as soons as you complete the intro, and in every corner of the game you'll encounter something that will make you keep playing.

Cons: Dialogue is really really badly written, don't expect Witcher 3 levels of depth. Once you've played for 200 hours the game will feel repetitive as everything you encounter will have to be done again in the same way you did before. Eventually Skyrim loses its wonder...

Pros over the Especial Edition: It has way more mods and less bugs. 

In conclusion: There is no way in hell you'll dislike skyrim, at least untill you reach a point where you've done it all. That will take 300 hours at minimum and 1000 at max. But then you can get mods and make it interesting again."
21565,I've spent more time modding this game than actually playing it
21566,ITS GOOD!!!
21567,"It says something about a game when you can get 345.2 hours out of it without even finishing all its content. It also says something about the player when the reason they can't finish the rest of its content is because the touring carriages mod they downloaded conflicts with the better looking male face mod that also happened to be packaged with a Non-Optional file that also put realistic c*ck and balls on the male models. Got me again, Todd!"
21568,good
21569,This game is an awesome time suck.
21570,10/10
21571,yes
21572,Highly recommended but haven't played much on PC still considering there is much more game available overall so I can only imagine it would be even better and more enjoyable to experience.
21573,"Buged game simulator.
The fact that they have not fixed any bugs since launch or even in the better version of the game is ridicilus. 
Very hyped game and i stumbled across 7 bugs in the first 2 hours of the game one of them beeing gamebreaking.
Why people give this game so much credit is beyond me."
21574,fantastic game
21575,"An OG, mods makes this game endless."
21576,Best RPG out there!
21577,1312
21578,"This is a truly fantastic game and it will continue to be that way for years to come even after the next Elder Scrolls release. After beating the vanilla game I would recommend playing with certain visual, and game play mods you can find in the workshop."
21579,"I used to leave reviews like you.

Then I took an arrow to the knee."
21580,Love this game!
21581,been playing for 514 hours.. GG worth it
21582,"Amazing graphics, lovely story"

21593,i mean its skyrim pluss modsssssssssssssssss
21594,Probably one of the greatest games of all time. If you haven't played Skyrim you definitely should. You're depriving yourself of an amazing experience.
21595,mega epic
21596,Buying this game for the third time. Gonna try to get all the achievements for the second time. Best game ever made.
21597,noice
21598,"Even without mods this game was a blast. Do I wish there was more depth to the characters and some of the stories? Yes, but the sheer presence of the epic environment that is Skyrim kept me coming back. There is so much to do and see in this game. Highly recommend if you enjoy the little details in games, wondrous soundtrack, epic quests, exploration, medieval setting, chaotic battles...For me it was worth it just to experience the aurora borealis in the mountains."
21599,"I broke my skyrim over and over again with mods, and now everytiem I try to go to Karthspyre it breaks and crashes. 10/10, would mod again"
21600,"great story, wonderful open world, lots of quest,"
21601,it good
21602,It's alright.
21603,Ive almost spent 5000 hours in skyrim and I still play it. this might be the greatest game of all time.
21604,It just works
21605,this is fun
21606,I have been literally playing this game since i was 7 years old and it is an amazing fun game. I have beaten the game on xbox 360 at least 5 times and on ps4 2 times. I wish they made another elder scrolls like this but online because it would be super fun!
21607,!
21608,it skyrim duh
21609,Very cool game
21610,love it
21611,"Skyrim is almost as good as Morrowind in terms of gameplay.  The difficulty level is much simpler, with exact locations and instructions given for quests instead of vague descriptions that require exploration and basic observational skills.  The graphics are much improved from Morrowind, but are able to be run on a lower graphics card, unlike the Special edition."
21612,This is a game
21613,The best fantasy style game I have ever played. Also has a very strong modding community.
21614,"Best game
"
21615,Bad game
21616,This game is a masterpiece and I am so happy I was able to buy it
21617,"If you don't know about Skyrim by now then I don't know where you've been.  It's not a perfect game, but it is a very fun game and I've done multiple paythus.  One of the things that certainly extended my time in the game or brought me back over the years is such a wide variety of mods available for the game.  It's just a fun game and I look forward to the next Elder Scrolls."
21618,I wrote a positive review of this product because it is a very good product.
21619,idk its pretty ok
21620,"Don't know why it's unlisted on the steam store, but the pinnacle of Bethesda before a long unfortunate series of events took place and drove their reputation into the mud soaked carpet they call their headquarters floor. 9.5/10."
21621,"It's Skyrim. You probably know what it is, however, I'm not here to talk about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I'm here to talk about the insane off the walls bonkers ass modding community. If you've played this game once, there is definitely replayability, but you haven't played it once. You've played it half a dozen times, having completed it maybe twice, if you're like me. What I want you to do is go to Nexus Mods and find the most bonkers mods you can find. Master Sword? It's there! Samurai armor? It's there! The ability to play as a bear? It's there! Go download a frak ton of mods and recreate the game from the ground up into something new and delightful!"
21622,PeePeePooPoo
21623,epic
21624,fun
21625,IS GOOOD
21626,This version of Skyrim is actually better for low end pc than Skyrim SE. Also I can't seem to feel any difference.
21627,Skyrim is a great RPG fantasy game that is super easy to dive right into. It's a classic already and will continue to be for a long time. Once you are familiar with the game I recommend trying out mods.
21628,"addictive and fun,especially with mods"
21629,"Skyrim will forever be one of my top favorite games. If this game was remastered with multiplayer I'd be the end of my world, because that's all I would do all day."
21630,after +/- 9 years still great
21631,good game.
21632,really fun with mods

21667,Really fun game. I have it for Xbox too but I love the fact that it runs smoother on my PC and that I can also cheat in the game. (I only cheat so I can have all of the supplies for my house in the DLC)
21668,its a nice small indie title. I hope more people see this game!
21669,yes
21670,"Alright, mother-hearty (Steam seems to like them anyway) Skyrim... Boy there's very little that hasn't been said about this game... The greatest sandbox ever, the greatest sandbox since Fallout NV (for Mad Max fans at least), the greatest sandbox pre Witcher 3, the absolute masterclass of worldbuilding in games, the horribly buggy mess, the poor city dweller's trip to the countryside,  the archetypal western RPG, the modder's paradise and the modder's hell...

Let's get the recent shady business practices out of the way first:
1) By now there are approximately billions of versions of this game, with varying graphics and moddability.
2) This particular version, the original one with the separately bought 3 DLCs, the most mods, and most basic vanilla graphics is apparently ""unlisted"", ie ""evaporated"" (read 1984) for all practical purposes (which means I'm only writing this out of the hope of a better tomorrow for the history of videogames).
3) The other versions can be safely assumed to be marginally less buggy, with marginally better vanilla graphics, noticeably worse modding communities, possibly even involving some shady microtransaction practices that seem to be catching on (like some kind of virus, perchance?) lately, though they might also include the 3 DLCs with the main game.
4) As a result, even though the original game is an absolute classic (more on that in the next paragraph) in its conception, ideas, and original execution, ie this ""unlisted"" game right here, you will need to be wary of whatever's been changed in any subsequent version which you might consider getting to avoid nasty surprises

With the rotting stench of corporation as far away as possible from the ever green glade now, it is time to look at the actual game:

[h1]Summarily:[/h1]
Skyrim is a cult classic, landmark-of-the-videogaming-medium open world western RPG in the familiar high fantasy setting, this time somewhere in fantasy Scandinavia. It can be played equally in 1st or 3rd person, though I prefer 1st for the immersion. 

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Gameplay-wise it's hack-and-slash, and 1st or 3rd person shooting, and light stealth. It's a bit bare-bones compared to more modern stuff like Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild, though it holds up fine and the vanilla lack of flash, spectacle, and variety, like most of its shortcomings, is easily mitigated by a good selection of mods, leaving gameplay that can easily be as deep and involved, and also as flashy and exciting as it can possibly be in a game with these admittedly quite restrictive technical limitations, so don't expect to be able to turn it into a PlatinumGames spectacle fighter, but anything below that (including ye olde Dark Souls) is definitely feasible.

[h1]Narrative:[/h1]
But Skyrim is ultimately a narrative-driven game, not gameplay-driven, so narrative is where it truly shines. Let's then examine how it handles the 3 pillars of narrative: Plot, Characters, and Setting.

Plot:
The way Skyrim works is there are several questlines, ie series of missions, which can be played straight through or staggered with other questlines as you please. Some questlines are actually just one quest which can be small or big, but generally not a colossal venture. There is a main questline, though ""main"" really doesn't mean much in this context; The game keeps going after you finish it and very few things are changed, besides some cool new powers for you, possibly a few dead characters (depending on your decisions throughout) and a few extra lines at some places. So the plot's quality is highly variable depending on the various stages of various questlines in which you are involved; Except for the spirit of adventure and exploration, there is no overarching theme in all the questlines; And some are significantly better than others. The highs can be very high, the lows just kinda boring.

Characters:
There are loads of characters in Skyrim, like, a stupendous amount; Meaning you're looking at a more quantity-over-quality (r-strategy for the biology gang) approach, but, then again, like Stalin (of all people) said, quantity has a quality of its own, and that's quite true; For instance, you can think of a city in Skyrim as a character; then the people in it are indeed the different facets of that character, contrasting and different, but sharing some unifying traits. That said, if perhaps only by chance, there are definitely a few hidden gems of characters around, and really, I never needed more than a few, for human perception has ever been one large exercise in the cosmic irony of diminishing returns anyway.

Setting:
In other words Worldbuilding. This is by far the strongest point of this game. You might have cringed a bit at my mention of the high fantasy setting (everyone now: Men, Elves and Dwarves, sword, axe, and pointy ear in droves!) BUT. Let me tell ya, this is no standard fantasy affair: The depth of the lore just below the surface is so deep, intricate, interesting, and exciting, there have been volumes written on it and still there is the great and charming mystique about it. It is easily, easily the most fleshed-out and living high fantasy world since Tolkien, ie the most fleshed-out and living high fantasy world since, well, real life. This is not a small world that feels BIG, like, say, Yakuza; It's a BIG world that feels [b]ABSOLUTELY COLOSSAL[/b]. And as the layers of metaphor and symbolism pile on top each other, the immersion factor increases exponentially, which is why, after all, this is my most played game as of now. The simple act of going from one place to another, in most games mere tedium, can be a true (if perhaps a bit lonely... but then again, what isn't?) adventure here, with twists, and turns and endless derailing

[h1]Pros and cons:[/h1]
+ Relatively light, means you can just open your favourite music playlist and just roam around and wander for hours in absolute bliss.
++ The most unequivocally beautiful open world, I've ever experienced in a videogame, ever. Can be made doubly beautiful with graphics-enhancing mods which I can't run, but truthfully, it doesn't need them; Except for a slight saturation boost, it's already perfect.
+ Decent enough  orchestral soundtrack, a couple of standouts but nothing exceptional, though that is easily remedied (see above).
+ Great variety of playstyles (it is a western RPG, after all), which can be massively increased by mods.
+ 20 bucks for upwards of 500 hours of wonder and fun is definitely a great price.
+ So many characters that it's impossible that not even a couple won't connect with you, whether some lesser known ones, or some of the classic ones that everyone loves.
+/-/? A lotus island of a game; So ridiculously immersive and beautiful that you might come to regret being born unto your comparatively painfully banal real life...
- Not much in the way of non-combat options, as one would expect of something like Fallout.
- Bethesda-style stiff looking NPCs. Mods can mitigate this issue, but ultimately, let's just say you will need to apply a little [i]imagination[/i] on your part to think of them as living people, especially if their personality doesn't carry.
-- The aforementioned shady corporate skullduggery meaning you will have to be uniquely clandestine in your selection of the version of the game you want, if even there [u]is[/u] anymore one without microtransactions up its Hearthfire [b]and[/b] a good modding community.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Assuming you are careful which version you get, I truly think this is a must-have for anyone even mildly interested in videogames as a medium and an artform. It is a veritable classic, to the point where even if you don't really like it, you should at least do one fast playthrough, if only as a lesson in the history of videogames (In much the same way as Star Wars IV and V). Just be prepared for the consequences of sacrificing a good part of your real life tedium for a while in the probable case that you do."

21698,It is good
21699,"It's a good sandbox game that will keep you engaged for hundreds or even thousands of hours. Admitedly, since I was and am a busy person I moved onto different games, however Skyrim is kind of like the comfort food of games - you can just turn it on and get lost in its world for hours at a time, and probably never get to see everything the map has to offer. My note is that Skyrim is not really that good of an RPG, maybe you could describe it as RPG-lite, which to be fair, isn't always a bad thing."

21735,fun to mod the heck out of
21736,It's Elder Scrolls. What's not to like?
21737,"TES V : Skyrim
A buggy mess, but it wouldn't be a Bethesda game if it wasn't, would it?

This game has taken more hours of my life than any other game I've ever played. I've spent thousands of hours on this game, on console and pc. The modding community just adds to the replayability. I have never gotten anywhere near close to 100% completing this game in all that time, I'm still to this day finding things that I've never seen before."
21738,I played this game for a million and a half hours all through the ice age of dragons Best played with blood finishinging move and decapataion mods. Its your game afterall
21739,Nice for passing the time.
21740,addictive definitely got my moneys worth
21741,"Honestly fuck Bethesda, dropping to levels I thought I would never see a publisher/developer drop to."
21742,Good game.
21743,"oblivion dont work
"
21744,good
21745,yes i would i have played 159 hours i would recommend this game to others i would
21746,If you don't buy this game you'd be committing a crime against Skyrim and its people.
21747,Best game I've played.
21748,good game yes
21749,"A true classic for lovers of role playing in fantasy environments. Greate immersion, a very detailed world and great quests - really recommendable!"
21750,"Many years ago I modded this game to play ""Beautiful Girls"" by Sean Kingston as ambient music because I didn't know about windowed mode."
21751,5 stars
21752,Good Game
21753,"good game, but you know that"
21754,Just a great RPG all around. Definitely for anyone.
21755,"I love this game, i can never stop playing 
"
21756,"Over 1,000 hours of playtime, do I need to say anything else?

(Never ever play this game unmodded! EVER!)

P/S: Still waiting for TES6, please release it soon :("
21757,Its a great game i love it when i hear about it because im a big fan of RPG games but one thing that should get fix is the houses but it make my day a lot ^^
21758,"The game is endless. You can do whatever you want in the order you want. I finished the main quest years ago but have kept playing this games side quests & there are so many mod add on quests available too. I just love the diversity. On the down side, there are a few bugs but it is to be expected with such a huge open world."
21759,five stars
21760,Great immersive experience. Love the mods!
21761,It's Skyrim. It's practically immortal at this point.
21762,Amazing. Would be nice if this wasnt hidden from the search
21763,"I've loved the Elder Scrolls series since Oblivion in 2006. At first I didn't like Skyrim and thought the game kinda played itself, the quests were boring and it was boring. But then I got into the game a little further and WOW. There were skeletons and big monkeys and the combat felt rewarding and structured. In Oblivion you would hit an enemy, he would walk right through it and just kinda keep making odd noises each time you hit them, in Skyrim though, Bethesda says, ""Heck no, that ain't how we do it over here."" And made it better. The faces were a big complaint in Oblivion and were said to take the player out of immersion because they were so horrible, in Skyrim however, the faces look actually real, and don't take the player out of immersion. So right off the bat we had all sorts of improvement, but one thing was still lacking... the one thing that separated it from other RPGs... Dragons. So many RPGs have dragons, it's almost not an RPG if you don't got a few dragons, but Skyrim executed the whole dragons thing quite nicely. The story is something new and nice, the shouts are pretty fun to use, the side-quests are decent enough, and the landscape is really cool. I enjoyed the waterfalls and hated mountains the most. NPC's in this new Elder Scrolls became MUCH more responsive and open. In Oblivion you'd talk to some dude in Bravil and the questions you could ask him would be like: Any news on the Cave of Barrons yet? Rumors? Or, I have your staff, now give me your soul. In Skyrim there are so many options to choose from, honestly it was quite over-whelming at first... So I don't know whether to classify that as a pro or a con soooooo, I'll just say it was an alright change. Overall, I give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim an 8.5/10"
21764,Love this game.  It's fantastic.
21765,"Mod Maker Review. ""Mcdoye"" modding bethesda games since 2011

Very Great Game. Even Better with mods. as a modder and mod maker i love the creativity of what i can do in the game.. it is foolish of bethesda to hide the dlc but i have found a way around that. in the skyrim workshop look for a mod that requires all 3 dlcs. then on the mod page look for the mod requirements and you should be able to find the dlc pages there to buy them. 


~i shot an arrow at a deer, i missed and the arrow hit a small frog, the frog died. i went about my business, sometime soon later i traveled back through the area and a random spawn necromancer reanimated the frog thinking it would attack me, the frog hopped away and turned to ashes. ""FarmAnimalsMod"" 10/10"
21766,QAWED
21767,cool
21768,"This game is timeless. I've came back to it again and again over the course of several years and it is truly a one of a kind game. It's very story rich, and there is so much to explore. If you still haven't played this game, just go for it; you won't regret it."
21769,"It legit just doesn't work. It is so glitchy and poorly optimized to the point of it being unplayable. I haven't been able to get past the first 15 minutes of the game simply because of my prison cart flipping, or getting stuck, or my cart just flips upside down, or my horse just has a spasm and flys around in the air or under that map, dragging the cart with it. The one time I've gotten past the cart scene, the first prisoner was supposed to be beheaded. Everyone got into position and he said is line, but when time came we all just stood there in silence. I've tried everything from restarting and reinstalling, to going into the game files. Do not get this game and if you have to, buy it directly from steam so you can refund it if need be. Sadly I got it on G2A making me practically burn 10 bucks.

[EDIT] I have found out the solution to my problem and now totally recommend it. I have been having so much fun with this game. The main problem was that since the engine is so old if you go over 60 fps, it just breaks."

21779,"Extra interesting game, fun"
21780,Beautiful graphics. Interesting story line.
21781,i think most people know skyrim for how many times its been released but its an amazing game you can sink hours and hours into before even touching the main quest
21782,shit slaps bro
21783,It has water I fucking love water
21784,"Just awsome, even better modded"
21785,"If you  haven't played this game yet please do. 
I've gotten this game on pretty much everything since it came out. As soon as I change  systems this game is a must have.

Do it."
21786,It's TES 'nuff said
21787,play this game forever! it will never be neglected
21788,Its just a great game. If you like these types of games. The modding is just a + no matter how you look at it.
21789,Pretty fun
21790,mass paralysing the entirety of whiterun. fun game.
21791,after all these years its still one of the best games ever made in my opinion my one criticisim would be that the guild quests are way too similiar to each other
21792,"If you don't already know this game, then you might only be 10 years old. I don't suggest this game for 10 year olds.

The best game ever for mods."
21793,doesn't get better than this.
21794,Good game
21795,"Why are you looking at reviews? It's Skyrim, how do you not know what Skyrim is?"
21796,Nice.

21813,is fun. lots of running and looking. very much enjoy
21814,it's ok
21815,Elder Scrolls has produced some really great ones. This is the pinnacle. Don't even think about the online one - piece of turd. Skyrim is still attracting great mod writers and builders - always something new.
21816,Have loved this game since 2012 since i first rented it on a RedBox
21817,its just an all time great game
21818,I love Skyrim. Each time you play you can create a new character and change the choices he /she make therefore creating a new experience.
21819,"This game is horseshit when you attempt to mod it. If you install 1 mod the game fucks itself then you install a mods that was made to fix the first mod but that mod creates another problem then you get a mod that ""fixes"" that but then that mod fucks itself then you uninstall all your mods then you realize that it wasnt any of those mods causing the problem but it was just the game being shit because it was made by a game company that is worse then companies such as EA or Bungie."
21820,Best game ever until TES VI is released
21821,play with mods.
21822,"fun idk what to say it's fun. only complaint is that the modding system/""creation kit"" is so much more complicated now than it was with morrowind. i know ofc it's gonna be more complicated because it has more features now but some of it seems unnecessary, eg. needing to refer in scripts to things by hash code instead of their filename. anyway it's a good game."
21823,Nice
21824,"Its a fun and rich game to play and explore, especially with mods"
21825,"Its Skyrim, I don't there's much else to add. One of best games of all time."
21826,One of the greatest games of all time.

21833,It's not bad.
21834,is good
21835,"I am not a big Bethesda fan. However, this game is worth a play on sale. So many mods and fans creating content, you can have all sorts of different experiences. Still has same buggy issues as its' predecessors and even its' modern cousin fallout 3 and 4. Character models still look like older games. 
I will probably never beat this game, because I get distracted too easy from the main quest...same Issue I had with Fallout 4. Oh what's that! and I take off running...I played this game way more then FO4. 
FO3 is the only Bethesda game I have ever finished."
21836,good game a lot of fun even after all this time. the mods make it way better
21837,You Imperial Bastards!
21838,df
21839,rawr xd
21840,the open sand box play is more immersive then the standard game play that forces you down their direction. trying the game in different ways adds to the game play.
21841,The best single player RPG I've ever played. Rivalled only by The Witcher 3.
21842,There really isn't anything I can say that anyone else hasn't. This is a Solid game for solitary playing.
21843,Real world? What are you talking about?
21844,"If you enjoy free reign to roam and discover, this game fills the bill. The story line is excellent, but isn't restrictive. There are numerous ways to reach your goal, and surprises to be found all over Skyrim."
21845,nice game
21846,"Good game, shit RPG. Rather unfortunate for the fifth installment of an RPG series."
21847,its a mazza
21848,"You will have to spend dozens of hours to fully explore Skyrim. Like any other Bethesda game, it has its share of imperfections and broken promises, but it's exciting and fascinating nevertheless. Wait for a couple of patches to come out, download the best mods, tighten the screws in the SkyrimPrefs.ini file, and you're good to go for a virtual Christmas vacation."

21853,"After many years of playing this game on and off, It seems that I will never find the ""end"" lol. After playing for a few years, I downloaded the expansions and found a whole new world. Thank you for the hours and hours of gameplay."
21854,Love it
21855,"I loooove this game
"
21856,it's good
21857,Wow Bro just Wow
21858,HI
21859,"This is probably the best and most immersive game that I have ever played. It is huge with thousands of things to do, a lively surrounding and a lot lot of freedom. You can play it like a walking simulator if you want to relax, you can play it with excitement if you follow the quests, there are difficult choices and so much to explore and uncover!
You will see beautiful places, magical places, harsh and desolate  places. It can happen that you end up in an area that you are not ready for physically, so save the game on a new slot when you make progress.

This is a recommendation for every one who likes adventures, exploration and immersion!"

21864,"This game is simply incredible. Even 10 years after getting it, I still find myself revisiting Tamriel and being sucked back in by the vanilla game- never mind all the incredible mods out there. TESV:Skyrim is the gold standard for replayability and atmospheric world building. Even the infamous glitches are charming."
21865,"I have been addicted since the first Skyrim release. I have stuck by Skyrim through bad computers, no computers. I will never leave Skyrim..."

21867,it is a great game and very entertaining

21872,"Kind of annoying that this is hidden from searches, but if you found it, congrats!"
21873,gg
21874,Highly immersive. Hours of game play on main and side quests. Character customization. Modding community adds infinite replay value. The definitive open world RPG experience that never seems to get old!
21875,"Immense world totally explorable, beautiful landscapes, settings with attention to the smallest detail, practically infinite game. Sometimes you run into some annoying bugs."
21876,"this is anbsolutely a game worth playing and for those who have not should give it a chance, an absolute masterpiece. cant wait for more"
21877,"Play it vanilla , then when you done , start adding mods (you'll enter the never ending cycle of adding\deleting\troubleshooting mods) ."

21880,"I mean, what else is there to say about this game?"
21881,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
21882,"Huge world so much to do that it is easy to lose track of what you are supposed to be doing.
"
21883,"It's Skyrim, buy it."
21884,So much fun!

He also lets me sleep in the other room while he sleeps with my wife, and sometimes lets me stay up past 8pm. Last week he said I've been really good and that he'll buy me Cyberpunk. Paarthurnax is so cool!!!"

21908,"I've tried to enjoy this game, I've tried to complete every quest, loot every container, travel to every spot. It took 100 hours or so for me to realise that the game gets dull after some progress.

IMO, just another overrated rpg"

21916,"Game doesn't work anymore.

At the beginning in the intro, the prison carts are glitching and spinning, and never reach their target. 
(So the game never starts.)

I have no mods installed.
Some people suggest installing a mod that makes the game skip that whole intro at Helgen, 
but that is not really fixing the problem, it is avoiding the problem.

And no matter how long the game is, skipping the first 15 minutes ruins my immersion enough that I don't want to start a new playthrough anymore. :("

21931,"This game is awesome. Sure there's annoying bugs in the quests, swimming goats, flying mammoths, and an amusing assortment of other glitches, but overall it is hours and hours of fun. There are several mods and dlc's for this, so it is very expandable, and it varies from Fallout NV in that it has no ending, so it's got that going for it. Console cheat commands are a blast with this, but it isn't too hard to play fair and square."

21941,"This game came out 9 years ago. If you haven`t played it yet, what are you doing?
My all time favorite video game. Even though it is a story game, has HIGH replay value and I continue to replay it."
21942,"I would recommend this game to other players. However, watch what mods you get, if any at all. There are some quite buggy ones, but only a few."
21943,9 years later it is still a great game

21952,"Well, after 381 hours played it's hard not to give positive feedback. In general ES Skyrim is already iconic game with all it  quest lines, crafting, magic system, fighting, riding, echnanting, dragon shouting for different races and ability trees within open world. Great grafics and music. ES Skyrim - best RPG in it'stime."
21953,Is good

21960,its AWESOME!!!!!!
21961,"Improved gameplay with a decent story line, tons of side quests, and a great modding community. The map design isn't really all that interesting though."
21962,"This game is so much fun. You can get dogs and i love them. They bark, sit, and even follow you! I would definitely recommend Skyrim to whoever loves dogs. The combat and all of the other aspects of the game are okay to I guess. My favorite part of the game is when you run around and look at the scenery. The game is absolutely beautiful! I cant wait for the remastered version to come out. I bet the dogs are going to look amazing! I cant wait. I love coming home after a long day of bird watching to a table covered in food (I LOVE my sweet rolls!) But anyways, I love spending quality time with my family. We usually take our evening stroll to Riverdale and while we're there, we usually steal some iron from the blacksmith. The kids love it and it's always nice to get out of the house. Speaking of which, my last adventure I went on was super jam packed. From stealing sweet rolls to stealing horses, it was a ton of fun. I hope you would get to experience the same thrilling adventures. Just like the the crazy adrenaline rushes you get as you sneak into someone's bedroom and stare at them while they sleep, give's me a adrenaline rush just thinking about it. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did and I'll be writing another review when the remastered version comes out, so stay tuned. Be safe!"
21963,"If you somehow manage to find this version of Skyrim on Steam, congratulations, buy special edition and get the Beyond Skyrim mods once released."
21964,This one of my most favorite games. Despite its quirks its so well done.
21965,"There's a reason this game has been re-released again and again on more and more platforms. Between the standard experience of a massive amount of lore, quests and customization options for your own character's skills and armor and the even more impressive community of modders and coders who add anything from a quirky weapon from your favorite anime or game into Skyrim to the utterly massive and impressive additions of lore friendly areas, quests, items, npcs, massive graphics over hauls that turn it into something even current gen games have trouble meeting and more.

You'd be hard pressed to find some one who doesn't like Skyrim for a reason, because in its base form its a great game and with the nigh infinite range of mods fans of the series have created for the game its an unforgettable experience. I will always remember when one game I ran around as a Yautja from Predator, hunting worthy prey then on a whim became Kratos, the God of War and took over all of Skyrim in a single man conquest.

Seriously, who HASN'T at this point?"
21966,could be better
21967,Yes
21968,maybe
21969,"I have played for not much time, but I play with 600 mod and It is great, I play hardcore and seex mod is awesom very  hot yeah play this game"
21970,"i personally hate this game,"
21971,"This is a great first person fantasy game. There is plenty of action and dragons. I have played through the main story but keep coming back to try different characters and story paths! This is easily one of the best games I have played, there are so many side quests with there own stories it never gets boring."
21972,gr8 m9
21973,skyhrum
21974,Fantastic game to play the special edition is far better than the remastered version of skyrim because of Todd the twat Howard puts paid mods on the remastered version (not funny)
21975,Help everyone and still gets talked down too. 10/10 would recommend
21976,Yes game good. Freshem
21977,it's ok
21978,"No matter how many hours I put into this game, I can't seem to keep an eye on my horse. I'll buy a horse, take it with me to a village or town, and it'll walk off on its own in some arbitrary direction. Not even fast travel will bring the horse back to me. I've gone through at least 11 horses due to this, as well as horses throwing themselves into battle. 10/10 would recommend this game for the horses alone."
21979,"It's Skyrim, what can I say"
21980,Suddenly lots of bugs
21981,"I've been playing this game since forever, but I've never bought it before because my I download it on torrent since the very first time that I played.
So I sold my old pc and now I have this shit laptop, which can't run Skyrim. I've found the solution of my problems with Nvidea Geforce now, and since them I've been playing skyrim with this service. Recently Skyrim was removed from Geforce-now platform due greed from Bethesda, so I'd like to say: F*CK YOU Bethesda, you and all other companies with the same Approach. I'm not that person which writes reviews because I don't have that good English to express so well but I had to say that in public way, next review: Metal Gear Solid V."
21982,.
21983,there is not much to say the gameplay is good can make for a fun time and somtimes challenging  and other times you can good laughs out of it
21984,"This game is amazing. My favorite of all time, the base game will provide hundreds of hours of play and with mods it increases to thousands
"
21985,good game hmm yes
21986,Best game ever

21993,"i hate it
"
21994,"haratso
"
21995,"Good game, lots of great mods.
Would highly recommend."
21996,"Ok I will preface this with This is not quite a Elderscrolls game but on the other hand it actually is. The game play has been dumbed down drastically, but also improved at same time. Like spell casting used to be seperate from weapon controlls now its one control but at same time you can now boost spells by dual casting. I will say it's nice not moving like a tank (morrowind). Yet they removed flying spells and Creating your own spells like my fireball spell that hit for 1-999 damage over 1 second it would plink mostly then one shot stuff. they made it so you no longer have to repair gear but also made it so blacksmithing could be used to improve Damage Resistances and Damage outputs. Yes it looks prettier but we still have the same old glitches from every Bethesda game like head body mismatching and what not. The Real Gem is modding the hell out of these games."
21997,it's fun i guess
21998,"Worth it for mods and Enderal, but if your choice is vanilla Skyrim or Oblivion, go back and play Oblivion"
21999,It's Skyrim. Buy it.
22000,"Three words.

Fus
Ro
Dah

Use it on Nazeem on Throat of the World. Pure satisfaction."
22001,why wont the this game show up on the search (besides SE) is the new SE just a cash grab? because I cant buy any dlc. im not spending more money on a game I already bout JUST so I can play dlc. this situation is pissing me off because I dont want to buy the game again and loose all my progress and mods.
22002,There not much to say this game slaps hard you can mod the heck out of it YES PLEASE ILL TAKE TIG OL BITTY ELF GIRL AND OR DEMON/DRAGON SLAYER

22017,11 out of 10
22018,"Very good game, many mods :)"
22019,There is something i like on this game. but not sure yet...
22020,I don't think I can write anything that hasn't already been written.  My favorite thing is getting to go just about anywhere I want. I'm sure it's been said before.
22021,its ok
22022,Remember i bought this game on release day. I regret nothing.
22023,its skyrim
22024,Best open world game
22025,uwu
22026,I just enjoy the game alot
22027,fun
22028,v\sdvcv
22029,"The best, most interesting, action filled and badass game I have ever played in my entire life. The storylines are fun and engaging, The shouts and combat is brilliant and it makes you feel like the Dragon slaying badass you are. I have played this game since 2011 and it still doesnt get old. The mods can be funny and exciting too."
22030,"just get it
"
22031,This game sucks but if you are monumentally bored and can't think of literally anything else to do for an hour it's slightly better than looking at the wall in stone silence.
22032,"still my in my top 3
"
22033,"one of my favorite games ever, absolutely perfect"
22034,It's Skyrim
22035,nice
22036,It's a fucking work of art
22037,"Amazing game. Best with mods (can't recommend the unofficial patches enough). 

I've lost myself into so many different characters while playing this game since it came out (first on a family friend's console, then again on an xbox when I first gone one, and now again and again on steam since I can). 

There's so much to do that half the time the main challenge of the game is to stick to a playthrough and not go ""but what if I were an argonian mage? but what if I where a Nord that's afraid of water? But what if I were a dirty Thalmor agent?"" and immediately jump to a new playthrough. (The alternate start mods make avoiding doing this so much harder but they are so fun)"
22038,It's Skyrim!!!
22039,Good game.
22040,"greatest game ever no lie
"
22041,"Skyrim, just get it"
22042,Best Game as of yet imo
22043,"Lots of things to do, and very easy to get lost in. Never a dull moment in the quests."
22044,it's fun
22045,It's fine ... I guess.
22046,It's fucking Skyrim.
22047,this game must be modded (like all bethesda games) to ensure best playability. The unofficial patch on the nexus will fix any gamebreaking bug there is and ensure the highest quality of gameplay.
22048,i think that this game could use some work.
22049,MOOOOOOOOODDDDDS!!!!!!!!!
22050,10/10 would steal your sweetroll again
22051,"Over 5000 played. The most addicting game I've played to date. This open world game is multifaceted and the exploration level is great. Character building is one of my favorite parts of this game. Using racemenu and other tools, the realism of the created toons is quite amazing for a game this old. Modding has kept the game fresh for me and has certainly added to its longevity for many other players as well."
22052,"I mean....It's Skyrim. It is arguably one of the top 5 games ever made. If you are on the fence, take the leap. You will get more entertainment value out of this game than almost any other."
22053,its skyrim nuff said
22054,gae
22055,It's Skyrim. Everyone knows its good. Play it.
22056,Good time.
22057,epic
22058,"Bruh its skyrim, buy this shit now."
22059,"SKyrim, what can i say this is a game i got on launch, and would buy again, as soon as i saw it it was a buy for sure, having said this if youre gonna buy skyrim i would definently recomend buying the special edition"
22060,"I have sunk too many hours into this game, while the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting it is the modding community that will have you coming back over and over again. Anyone who enjoys open world RPG's will love this title."
22061,ITs Skyrim :) <3
22062,mods add hours of replayablity
22063,"Responsible for countless loss of hours before I bought on steam then plenty of hours here... 

10/10 will roll a lvl1 werewolf 100 more times."
22064,"great game
"
22065,Classic
22066,It's Skyrim - need I say more?  Best open sandbox game ever.
22067,Steam deleted my save file. I'm fuckin tight. 126 hours down the tubes. I reinstalled the game after not playing for a while and my file is gone. Awesome.
22068,Best games. Nothing to say.
22069,What can I say about Skyrim that hasn't already been said? I'm finally getting a chance to play after years and I'm having a great time. :)
22070,neat. use mods
22071,endless gam eplay
22072,"Infinits nivells per pujar, tot un món per a explorar, relacions per establir...
I el destí de Skyrim a les teves mans!"
22073,it's skyrim
22074,I think that it has great graphic and a great story plot. It has great small quest to do and the animation is fantastic.
22075,hrasevelg
22076,"* This might be my favorite game of all time. I literally spent more hours in Skyrim than hours doing my assignments for University.
* Frankly speaking Skyrim is a beautiful game even without mod, but god damn modding it's just a gift form God. Sometimes I was caught by the sightsee and I was just gazing like an idiot for several minutes. 
* The combat is just annoying, it's clunky and bad but it has it's appealing with various build and combination you can make. 
* The storyline is kinda bad TBH, I often found Side quests with a better and a more interesting story telling line.
* The game is buggy and the devs doesn't even care about that and still the game is good for some reasons. 
* I really have a love-hate relationship with Skyrim. 
* The MOBS are lovely, dumb and stupid, specially Falmers, I can live without them ... No, I hate them. 

                                                          *BTW full achievements baby*"
22077,Classic. Still returning after years.
22078,great game
22079,Warning: this game will eat countless hours of your life.  I love it.
22080,i love this game.
22081,god tier
22082,The ultimate power trip for wanting to shout at someone so loudly that they fly off a mountain.
22083,best game ever best story best gameplay huge amount of weapons and modability
22084,best game......ever?
22085,"This game is a must own gem. I've bought it several times over the course of 8 years. To this day I still go back to revisit it. Something about it just makes me feel immersed. From the dense forests of Skyrim, to the vast mountains that lead onward in the distance, I have to say this is one of the most beautiful regions of Tamriel. If you're playing this game for the first time i'm telling you it will be an amazing experience."
22086,"I can say probably form Bethesda that i knew this was on of the following games that i looked up From the list
1.Morrowind
2.Daggerfall 
3.Oblivion
4.Arena
5.Fallout 3 
6.Fallout 4
7.Skyrim 
(F:NV F2 and F1 not included them  are legends of different developers and Fallout 76 that is blehhh i will have to play the to i guess someday) 
Why is is on my  last of list do to game breaking bugs and them lack  of hardships and elements that are missing from other TES games like repairing broken gear(durability is out) athletics and soo on..., and i like them mechanics.
And what i hate more is game breaking bugs! LOTS OF BUGS!

Why i recommend the game is do to the game is fun overall (it gets boring from time to time). 
Its lore is big and its expanding The ES world of he we look on it.+
Using Star Chart for Skills is a great advatage and pick perks for that current skill is a big + 
as removing Major and Minor  and Misc. skill. +
Multipl. Campaigns Thiefs Guilds Dark Brotherhood + 
But Level advantage is far to big at later level of starting from 80 (as i remember) 1 skill prestige and leveling it back will give you 2 level(yeh thats ruff) for me thats a big fat - 
Removing skills like athletics acrobatics is a big fat -
Bugs Breaking Quests - 
Item Durability removed and repairing them -
No game stats like STR Luck all defined by Magic Health Stamina(increase also carry weight) thats a - and + 
+ simple  - removes the fun of what your characters is like is he luck or strong.

over all i recommend this 
I dont recommend for people who owns this to buying Skyrim:SE."
22087,Extremely nice COVID-19-consuming!
22088,"It's a buggy, unimmersive mess. So many other sources of fantasy RPG stuff is out there, that are way better than this."
22089,"Bugs aside, it's an addictive and re-playable classic."
22090,Güzel fakat yeterli geliştirmeler yapılırsa dahada güzel olur beğendim.
22091,BU OYUNU BİTİREBİLEN İNSAN DEĞİLDİR NET!
22092,Verry good
22093,e er
22094,Great game would highly suggest\
22095,Very healthy and family friendly
22096,very good game
22097,its skyrim
22098,"They tried to hide the DLC, I found it and paid 30 for Hearthfire and Dragonborne, totally worth not buying the re-hasher edition :) Bethesda is losing their clout"
22099,i mean its skyrim if you dont know what its about you dumb
22100,Yes
22101,There is a *lot* to Skyrim.  Too bad it's mostly a lot of nothing.
22102,yes
22103,Yes
22104,Even if you dont buy the Legendary Edition. It is legendary
22105,"I used to be a vanilla adventurer like you, then I took an immersive mod in the knee."
22106,This game will keep you here forever
22107,Skyrim is a classic.
22108,its awesome
22109,One of my all time favorite games to play.
22110,I LOVE THIS GAME its amazing and fun
22111,big boi game
22112,very nice game
22113,Liked about it.....let's go with everything. I love this game.
22114,my favorite game ever made
22115,"good game
"
22116,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is extremely nostalgic to me. I remember when it first came out and I would go start home after school to play for hours non-stop. Skyrim's lore guarantees excellent immersion and decent gameplay time. You will waste hundreds of hours learning new stuff that you previously have not discovered while exploring. The characters are well developed and memorable. The quests are entertaining and lead you to believe like you are part of something special. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.
22117,i've been playing this game for 6 years and will always have a special place in my heart
22118,fuyfyffukyyuuyfuygyg uyguyg
22119,"This game is like kinks. Once you leave vanilla behind, you can't go back."
22120,this game never gets old
22121,"One of the best Elder Scrolls i have ever played. It never gets old, and its the best one to mod to. Thank you MxR for showing the way of modding for Skyrim."
22122,is good but my computer got to bad to run it
22123,Fun open world and enjoyable storyline. Downloading again now after 7 years because I miss it!
22124,"very cool , very good game 0 bugs/glitches"
22125,"Like any other Bethesda game, it has its share of imperfections and broken promises, but it's exciting and fascinating nevertheless. But I just can't stop playing Skyrim, even after all this time it's still getting regular play from me."
22126,"NEVER gets old!!!!!! Awesome graphics engine.....go anywhere, do anything game play. Mod-able in the extreme. (though I prefer it with minimal mods)"
22127,One of the best PC games out there!  Instant classic.
22128,"fallout but lots of years before and fantasy shit included
nice"
22129,"AWSOME
"
22130,"To give credit where it's due Skyrim was my introduction to Bethesda Game Studios, and it left quite the positive lasting impression and will forever be treasured in my mind. The side quests, factions, companions and roleplaying capability will always cement it as my first true longterm RPG experience. While the graphics and engine haven't aged well at the time of release Skyrim was a beautifully detailed open world with so much to do, to the point that there are still side quests that I have never completed or experienced. While other games such as The Witcher 3 have come and improved on the open world RPG concept, Skyrim was one of the first to do it so masterfully."
22131,"beautiful landscapes and wonderful lore, was also my first RPG game"
22132,"The Elder Scrolls series has always had a special place in my heart, and Skyrim above all else, is definitely my favorite game in the series. The game itself is pretty damn good, but the modding capability is amazing. I can't say what most have already said, check it out for yourself."
22133,"I first played this game as a wee 14 year old boy, but now am kinda a man so i have better clarity, right? Well, Skyrim is still an amazing game if you can look past some of the piss taking bugs. Still, just get it yeah?"
22134,It just works
22135,you can spend countless hours exploring Tamrial or spend your time in ancient nordic ruins fighting the souls that protect it its an amazing game
22136,"Honestly the game itself is incredibly bland and unispired, the only reason you should buy it is because of the mods the community created for free.

But you cant buy this version of the game anymore, only the more expensive ones, so nobody will probaly read this, exept maybe someone working for Bethesda, so if thats the case, RUN YOU FOOL, RUN AWAY FROM THE PREDATORY EXECUTIVES YOU WORK FOR!
RUN AWAY BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!
RUN AWAY BEFORE THE GATES OF HEAVEN ARE CLOSED FOR YOU FOREVER!

anyways im just kidding"
22137,"Everything! From fighting dragons to building houses, From riding horses to hunting vampires, Even the mods in  the workshop are amazing!"
22138,"There are some of us who stuck with old computers and cannot afford or bother to upgrade. Some of us who just wanted to play Skyrim, their system can handle the original version but barely run the SSE, some who just wanted Skyrim as their sole game in their work machine, and you Bethesda just alienated them all.

Normally i never criticize anyone, but i'll make exception for once

BETHESDA, YOU SUCK !"
22139,I have a love and hate relationship with Skyrim
22140,"IS GOOD
"
22141,"If you plan on playing Skyrim, don't overlook the Steam Workshop for this game. The community has made so many mods that vastly improve the game. The base game is still great and all, but mods are a must IMO if you want to play past the main story line and DLC."
22142,Ranged arrows o Death
22143,It's the greatest open world RPG in the history of video gaming. And you can run it on a potato or a PS3 if you must. What more can you ask for?
22144,Nice.
22145,"lOVE this game! play as you want, how you want and go anywhere..."
22146,"Open world, really cool, all quests and sidequests really well developed. A lot of mods that help."
22147,yes
22148,"i honestly dont know why i play this game, its objectively not very good but idk i just like it. dont buy this game"
22149,love this game spent way to much of my life playing it
22150,Yes
22151,"ITS SKYRIM PLAY THIS
"
22152,"Never finished the game, only modded it. Still worth it."
22153,This is one of the best games I've ever played
22154,Each piece of this game is terrible. the combat. The boss fights. the voice acting. The loop. but I still like it because mods. only ever play with mods
22155,A++ about to re-play again.
22156,Great game to turn your brain off too and just get sucked into a fantasy world. If your looking for a hardcore RPG look else where. If your looking for a relaxing RPG with great visuals then this is the game.
22157,"Best Game ever made, end of discussion."
22158,It's Skyrim
22159,its awesome
22160,"If you don't know what this game is wtf are you doing with your life. This is one of the greatest games of all time. 20/10 am playing through for like the 5th time but now with mods just for lolz.
"
22161,3651 + hrs played speaks for it self.
22162,good game
22163,loved it since 2012
22164,"good game
"
22165,It's Skyrim. It's. Skyrim.
22166,:)
22167,god
22168,great game love the dlcs
22169,"don't be a bitch and buy Skyrim already, it's not like we're getting another (good) Elder Scrolls game"
22170,"There are not a lot of games that I constantly come back to play over and over again, and this is one of them. Even on the rare occasions that I start to get bored of the vanilla gameplay, the mod community has always been so active that it only takes a few minutes of browsing to change the game completely. The hours shown on steam don't reflect the time I have spent playing offline while traveling or on console before I got into PC gaming. (It's also the only game I ever played on console that I liked enough to buy it again on PC.)"
22171,"fantastic game, very immersive, stunning graphics, i cannot find a fault with it"
22172,"It just works.

1) I was tired of visiting identic dungeons.
2) At some point the game started to have bugs with quest items.
3) This made me to acknowledge there are far better RPG's.
4) I uninstalled it for good."
22173,love the replay ability and the seriously great selection of mods
22174,"I mean, I guess it is OK. /s"
22175,best fantasy rpg game
22176,class times
22177,Elder Scrolls in all its Editions are awesome games.
22178,This game changed me into a Viking
22179,great game
22180,its old
22181,"It's Skyrim, nuff said"
22182,"It's fun
"
22183,"Just do it!
"
22184,"Very good Action-RPG with open world where you have stuff to do. It is a really good game with many options and objectives. Great music and sound effects only add more immersion to your adventure through the game's world. Interesting main story, side quests and great characters makes your wanderings more enjoyable and more rememberable. Amazing game highly recommended.

22185,Never ending gameplay
22186,screw the guards. kill all chickens
22187,iss fun
22188,yesw
22189,Brilliant game!
22190,good
22191,so many mods and so much time to kill. 10/10
22192,"Určitě to za to stojí! Dlouho jsem Skyrim odkládal, ale udělal jsem chybu. Možností je zde fakt mnoho. Hra se skutečně stane po nějaké době stereotypní a ze startu se na vás všemožné questy hrnou jak lavina, takže máte guláš v tom co dělat dříve. Zvolil jsem postup, že jsem procházel tak nějak na ""střídačku"". Přesto mě hra nedala a stále jsem pokračoval a vždy jsem se za čas dostal do situace, která překvapila. Je to mainstream RPG, který není úplně pro každého. Já ale nakonec asi všechny ty trofeje dodělám :-)"
22193,"Bethesda games aren't RPGs. They're just Bethesda games, bogged down by consumer expectations that Bethesda makes RPGs. Skyrim is one step on Bethesdas path of learning to not be RPGs anymore."
22194,THIS IS SOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD LIKE COCAIN (JOKE BUT ITS STILL A GOOD GAME...)
22195,Great
22196,Massive Open-World with Great graphics and storyline. You can also MOD this game as there are many mods available for it. Loved it totally
22197,"the best game, put simply."
22198,"Mod Until Crash
10/10"
22199,Good game but it's almost 10 years old.
22200,"Very Gripping game, the amount of things you can do and see is incredible its also great the way you can customise your build to suite your own individual play style"
22201,im just wanting elder scrolls 6 already
22202,"Started playing in 2011, still playing, will keep playing till 5evah"
22203,fun game with dragon!
22204,"Best game bethesta ever made, too bad they are going to fuck up the next elder scrolls :("
22205,Time well wasted
22206,"amazing
"
22207,yes
22208,Ignoring the stupid special edition stuff and whatnot this games always good! 9/10!
22209,Freakin Epic Game!!!
22210,.
22211,fun but repetitive
22212,yea it's aight
22213,"One of my favorite games. I have it on multiple systems. On the off change that you're not familiar with it, it's an open-world fantasy role-playing game with magic and dragons and undead monsters"
22214,"Fus-Roh-DUH
;}"
22215,This game is phenomenal and keeps me coming back to it year after year.
22216,If you don't know what skyrim is you need to go back in time and discover it when we all did so it makes as much of an impact on your life as the rest of us <3
22217,I just enjoy the series completely.
22218,This is the greatest single person RPG ever! Play now.
22219,best worst game ever thx todd
22220,"Crashed my game with 180000000% potion magic, worth it"
22221,Super game hours of fun none stop
22222,very sex game
22223,"Its a crime to say this game is glitchless, but I must say, this game ran better than all the fallout games I have played combined. Also had a rather interesting story, so far, have yet to finish it.
But however its a good buy, you get lots of time out of this game!"
22224,"best game ever
"
22225,i highly recommend this game but only if you plan on modding it if you plan on playing vanilla then go and play something like cdpr's witcher 3 don't get me wrong the game is good just not as good as it could be if the content that was cut wasn't cut so i beg you if you plan on modding it do so properly and use a mod manager like the nexus vortex or mod organizer and try to keep in mind to go and keep mods from steam to a minimum at most. i give this game a 8/10 only due to the fun i have had and a bit of nostalgia so it may be closer to a 5-6/10 then a 8/10 but that is my choice.
22226,"It is the must play game for anybody and everybody, with an avid modding community it is infinitley replayable, and never the same experience twice. In fact, when i googled ""infinitely replayable"" exactly how it is written in quotes, articles about Skyrim made up 7 of the first 10 results (at the time of my posting). I have played countless hours on my xBox 360, and will continue countless more on my PC because the game is timeless and a joy. Skyrim will forever be a gaming treasure."
22227,Have always Loved this game. The PC version is awesome as well.
22228,lol i saw a granny that looked like my ballsack
22229,"10/10 best simulator game
"
22230,this game has so  many ways to play love it
22231,me like this game but they unlist it from store they replafe with special edition me not play that one because it 60 $
22232,"its a classic 
"
22233,IT JUST WORKS
22234,"decent, not the best, but fun. get mods, look at big titty goddesses."
22235,It's Skyrim. Need I say anything else?
22236,This has to be my moms favorites game of all time. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is outstanding I am still playing this game now in 2020 and I am sure that there are many others out there doing the same . This game is definitely a top 10 for me no make it the top. I love this game so much! Bethesda you’ve done a great job thank you for your service!
22237,"While I really enjoy this game, even with its many bad design flaws such as a tutorial popups that cant be switched to its many game braking bugs. Both have gotten me killed a fair few times such as a remindes to heal during a fight wich got me killed or low mana interupting a heal which got me killed so on and so forth this still a good game. I would recomend people play the game with mods though as the game really needs the polish to keep in interesting."
22238,Yes
22239,"Bethesda trying to hide the original game and making people buy the special edition is a stupid thing to do and is a straight money grabbing scam i love this game and would have supported Bethesda but recently the studio has let its fanbase down
one of the best games ever made and changed the industry"
22240,"Skyrim is a world all its own. With customizable characters, endless adventures, and mods GALORE, this is an awesome game. Its currently my favorite game."
22241,"not much not to like, its a great game"
22242,the game suit my taste which im allowed to discover a huge world finding odd and funny places and quests
22243,Endless customization and creativity in the modding community. Even the vanilla game provides hours of entertainment. Magic and physical weapons are both balanced. So many unique items to collect and treasures to horde. You can own property and display your trophies proudly. Each faction is incredibly detailed and has a story to explore.
22244,"I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.

Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.



It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.

Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.



Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.

Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.

Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.
"
22245,"Fun. XD
I JUST F****T UP WITH ANIME MODS XD!"
22246,Its alright I guess
22247,"this game is a lot of fun and its one of the best bethesda games i know second only to oblivion
"
22248,one of the best games !
22249,Love the game I'm 60 and I've played LE and SE constantly since the first came out. Theres so many mods to keep your interest to keep playing
22250,Still amazing
22251,"I've helped many friends play this game before but I've honestly never played it for myself until now. It's pretty fun. I like the open world aspect of the game. I've played Tamriel, Morrowind and Summerset so I know what it's like to play ESO. It's my first time playing the Skyrim story line though. I like it. I would definitely recommend it to those whom haven't played it before."
22252,Solid game cool DLC
22253,Love this game.  Just needs to be modded for graphics and a few QoL things.  The best part is this supports a lot of mods.
22254,"Ah, Skyrim...

What a treasure of a game. I wish there was MORE to do to you, but alas I have 100% of all achievements. This is quite possibly the best game I have ever played. It has it all:

1: Immersive storyline
2: Non-linear progression, DIY anything and everything
3: Extremely detailed character and world-building capabilities
4: Tons of side-features (house building and design, vampires, werewolves, etc)
5: Tradeskills galore - smithing, enchanting, leatherworking, jewelry, and more
6: Great combat and magic systems
7: Endless replayability

11/10. Beautifully made game."
22255,Very immersive large world with may playable options
22256,haha voice go boom
22257,The Cheese To Die For!
22258,good
22259,DOPE AF
22260,"Good graphics, good gameplay, great modding community! I recommend buying this game. The modding makes this game even better, with more realistic movements, graphics and NPCs. The NPCs are kinda retarded in vanilla, but you can fix it with mods."
22261,"Absolutely one of my favorite games, I've been playing this since it came out and can't believe it's gonna be 10 years old soon."
22262,I LOVE Skyrim. It is so immersive and has many diverse quest lines. The world is absolutely stunning and pretty massive. I never get tired of this game - I always return to it and I've started a number of new games. Would really recommend this if you're into open world fantasy-type games.
22263,Still one of the best open world games even after all the time
22264,"I really recommend this game because it is so timeless. the graphics are not really the all that timeless like the gameplay, but you can fix it up with a couple of mods. Personally, I think people should still buy this game. It's really good fun. The story is very good, too. I highly recommend that if you have never played skyrim (or bought it), you really should at least try it."
22265,its ok
22266,It's Skyrim
22267,"Buy skyrim special edition instead

If anybody tells you legendary edition is better for modding, they're pulling one over on you and you should slap them immediately"
22268,It's ok
22269,you know what skyrim is. dont forget to mod the hell out of it.
22270,It's Skyrim. 'Nuff said.
22271,"Nunca vi tantos bugs juntos, en una mision de las PRINCIPALES un NPC que tenia que abrirme una puerta se bugueo y no me la queria abrir. No solo eso, sino que hablaba sin audio, solo con subtitulos, y como no habia audio iban extremadamente rapido. Tuve que forzar por la consola a que me abra la puerta, la abrio, y me pidio que lo escolte, se quedo en combate el NPC por toda la eternidad y se nego a avanzar. De milagro logre ir hasta el final, pero de nuevo, no podia hablar con otro NPC porque NO SALIA AUDIO DE SU BOCA. Y se bugueo todo y quedaron ahi.

Es una vergueza que a Bethesda le perdonen absolutamente todo, encima el mapa es una cagada todo igual, ni para explorar esta bueno."
22272,obviously one of the best rpg games. I spent 300 or more total hours on this game though it may not show in steam.  I purchased it on this account to get Enderal and decided to start playing it again.   Addictive for sure.  Can't think of anything I would change except maybe if the leveling system was like Enderal.
22273,Fun
22274,its skyrim
22275,poop
22276,best game ive ever played
22277,"Really Shitty it""s unlisted, but whatever.  I've played a lot of games in my 25 years of life, but few have made me come back again and again to play it like skyrim.  Mods galore, new encounters every time and some of the best DLC ever.  Plus, despite playing this game for eight years, ive never finished the main campaign!"
22278,Thousands of hours of incredible content waiting for you
22279,Nice game
22280,Ah. I find myself coming back to skyrim so much. Here's to hoping that the next elder scrolls will have just as much life as this one did.
22281,Limitless replay value. I grew up with this one and still play it.
22282,"Skyrim is a very well thought out ""worth it game"" so buy it peps"
22283,"Favorite game of ALL TIME. Skyrim never ceases to amaze me. Every time I hop on this game I find something new and interesting, and if I don't, I install a new mod. Seemingly endless entertainment, Guaranteed"
22284,i never really get bored with this game.
22285,"So, You walk around and shoot deer while everyone tries to kill you....oh yeah it has dragons."
22286,Awesome
22287,one of the all time best games ever
22288,qUALITY
22289,fun
22290,Timeless game
22291,"Fantastic game, endless fun"
22292,"nice game
"
22293,A classic. Experience it in its original form.
22294,"Lots of customization for characters. Tons of story and side quests
"
22295,good
22296,"love elder scrolls, especially skyrim"
22297,"Allows for hours of variant gameplay. You set the restrictions and play the role you want; be it thief, warrior, mage, blend of 2 or more, follow or ignore the story it's up to you. My personal preference is to select a type of class, a race and a personality then use those limitations to make the game unique."
22298,good game
22299,sick game .
22300,nice game. interesting mods available to install
22301,The Best game ever made! (I have never played any other scrolls game so they might be better)
22302,"pretty good bro
"
22303,"Hey, you, you're finally [spoiler] stuck because you don't save every fuckin' minute [/spoiler]"
22304,"A nice relaxing game to play, i rate this!"
22305,"This game is one of the best for any modder community out there. It is however slightly being overtaken by the Special Edition of it and a lot of mods are obsolete. Though this version still have about 5 times more mods available, most of them are redundant and I would recommend to get Special Edition instead if you still haven't played Skyrim. As the Elder Scrolls 6 is way out in the horizon and at least two or three years away at this time of writing. This is an amazing game if obsolete. Special Edition uses Fallout 4's iteration of the Engine and this one is very sensitive to crashes depending on what mods you use. Take care. But yes, I recommend."
22306,noice
22307,its alright
22308,DOVAHKIIN
22309,SUPER
22310,hamburger
22311,"One of the rare games where bugs make the game good, thats Bethesda for you"
22312,"Addicted Game, need more elder scroll :)"
22313,"I love this game.  It is the game, in general by which I judge all other video games I play for it's richness of detail and expanse.  I also love that it can be modded to be about whatever you want it to be.  There's a reason there are inquiries out there for ""games like skyrim."""
22314,What can I say. It's Skyrim!
22315,gucci game
22316,"If you don't have this, get it now cause you probably got a good 10+ hours of modding and mod troubleshooting ahead of you if you want to play it. Better get started."
22317,"I deleted my last review about this game, I wrote it when I was around 10.3 hours into the game, but i just said ""one of the best RPG's out there"", and now i want to do a review a little more ""deep"" (not that deep actually im pretty lazy, so lets get to the point) :

Game is cool, immersive atmosphere all the time, environments that can change very quickly or very subtly depending on what is happening in the game, be it a tense, suspenseful situation, or a liberating climate.
There is a lot to investigate, to discover. A giant Lore that honestly i cant even describe how i feel about it, it's just too deep and too immersive. Very good honestly.
Graphically it is beautiful, although personally I recommend looking for the more compressed textures, but without losing quality (youtube has all the info)

As a music lover myself, I'm honestly impressed with all the soundtrack. Master piece.

The dialogues, the narrative, the exposition of the information, the voice acting, all a bit cliché but it does its job and pleases the player in the long run.

Mechanically? interesting, the game mechanics have their logic, they are not as simple as I expected.

Artificial intelligence? It's not a big deal for these times, let's remember that the game has its years, but honestly they don't bother me at all and I find that they are relatively well worked (although sometimes the npc's make me laugh a lot since they act strangely)

What else to say, maybe a bit overrated, maybe a bit underrated, but still a good game, and still one of the best RPG games that I have ever played. But buy it when it's on discount tho :p"
22318,"great game
damn you todd though
"
22319,best game ever
22320,Its alright i guess
22321,Game of the decade.
22322,its okay
22323,Fun
22324,it good
22325,fuckin splended
22326,Endless fun! Endless possibilities!
22327,Good
22328,It's a pretty good game besides the fact that Todd Howard won't stop milking this game for every console that exists.
22329,MODS
22330,Nice
22331,Top 10 games of our lifetime
22332,"Tim A Poo Brain
"
22333,I played this for over 500 hours on xbox before i bought it on pc to start my journey into the modding hell that is making more than a hundred mods play nice at once. Still worth it tho
22334,"This game is filled with mods of anime girl with big boobus, very happy"
22335,Good graphics and game play. Story lines are short and somewhat silly as you tend to become the boss of ___ before you're even all that good. The action is excellent though.
22336,"bruh, dont you love it when you're running a save with 40+ mods on it, for it to succumb to an illness and become corrupted... :(

R.I.P to my og save that will never be played again..."
22337,"come on, this shit slaps."
22338,Fun big Fun with kills kids/mods
22339,roar
22340,thier is a lot to discover
22341,"It's Skyrim, C'mon."
22342,it's skyrim.
22343,"i like argonian maids
"
22344,My playtime speaks for itself.
22345,kill the chickens :D
22346,"Skyrim is the game that you play through multiple times, install mods, install even more mods, break the game, and then leave it as it is. After some time you come back and reinstall it just to do it all over again"
22347,I bought this yesterday... It got tons of things to do and holds up really well even by todays' standards. My only complaint is you cant play the game at more than like 100 hertz or else the rivers and animals will bug out.
22348,.
22349,"Guys, please don´t downvote this gem because the stupidity of two companies involved. We all know, this is the true Skyrim. Spread the word (and links) and complain at Steam and Bethesda directly. 

And for the actual review (around 700 hours on different copies): 
1. Create a goblin (with mod)
2. Find a dragon
3. Punch it in the face (mod)
???
5. Profit"
22350,quality game
22351,Game.
22352,it's kinda fun
22353,Immersive.  Still holds up after all these years!
22354,good game
22355,"""We know"""
22356,"its dead because bethesda released the special edition.

i hope people could buy this without looking for the direct link to the steam store."
22357,Never should have come here!
22358,it's a fun but loaded with bugs! bethesda game at it's finest! it's great with mods! without mods it's kinda boring...
22359,"Played a little, it's pretty good"
22360,"Unending fun, only your mind limits you, not minding the mods"
22361,"What we gamers dreamed of in the old days (1980's/90's) ! An RPG with high quality graphics, open world, survival, crafting, building, tons of challenge, skills and abilities to learn and open lands to explore!  I have played through the game many times and each time bring new escapes, new challenges and items and or situations missed during previous games. Combine the original game with available mods and the possibilities are endless!"
22362,"If i would have to choose between my wife and Skyrim....
Well...
Good that i have not to. 
Cause....
I love my wife yu know."
22363,good
22364,best single player game (going to be multiplayer because of a mod) and if u say witcher is better u hard capping
22365,"how do you get skyrim together
"
22366,The best elder scrolls by far even after playing for way more than i shouldve on 360 and xbox one its still a load of fun on pc
22367,Best game ever..!
22368,love the game not enough side missions some missions are pretty gay and vanilla dulled down for kiddies compared to oblvion like the dark brotherhood ect ect and hella needed more underwater areas to explore still the best game to date looking forward to the next game in the series
22369,I love that you can have anything happen to you and someone else who is playing will have a complete different experience. I love the random stuff that can happen at any given time. It is open world and I feel that you really get something out of exploring it.
22370,its good
22371,"This game, despite how much I enjoy it, is inherently broken and is, without mods, a bad RPG. The game launched filled with bugs, and Bethesda's work in fixing it has been sub-par to the point that third party mods do a better job handling the bugs than official patches. Also, the game doesn't effectively carry on the legacy of Morrowind and Oblivion, as most quests only have one ending, and a dedicated mage can easily become the leader of this game's fighters guild, The Companions. Speaking of The Companions, about midway through their questline, you are forced to make a major decision, which, in a better game, would affect your perception by the people and factions of the province, but here, is largely ignored. This same decision, also, only has one outcome as far as the quest is concerned. You cannot say no, only delay the decision. This is a very brief review, but these are a few examples of this games lackluster design."
22372,its fun
22373,it is just so fun to play
22374,"Its a classic game but most people know that! I like the fact you can get lost, take your own path! Its an old game but its still worth playing. Dislikes I do not have any! Well maybe bow strength and speed!"
22375,10/10 must replayable game ever
22376,piece of shit
22377,yeet
22378,Only worth playing if you mod the hell out of it. Also fuck Todd and Bethesda
22379,oh no
22380,Just try It if you haven't It's freaking Skyrim
22381,"Doesn't matter how many years pass, Skyrim is still Skyrim! 

Everyone should play it at least once."
22382,"Very great game! Gotta' love climbing them mountains to skip certain places, not being able to finish a quest because you already had the quest item but when you turn it in, it doesn't notify you, getting OHKO'd by the giants at the very beginning of the game, and lastly... not being able to find the OG Skyrim on Steam.

I have recently been replaying this game, on legendary, and boy is it tough! My main goal is to sneak kill every human/orc/elf/argonian/khajit possible. 

Also, Adrianne Avenicci is bae. I know, I know... you cannot get her to marry you, but at least I tried."
22383,Nearly a decade old and still my favorite game.
22384,"If you don't know about this game at this point, you won't gain anything from this review because you live under a rock and don't own a  computer."
22385,look man. it's skyrim. what more do you want from me?
22386,fun
22387,great game.
22388,"Really great game, nice environment, landscapes, there are many things to do and it's a game to take it slowly with no rush, to admire the open world while doing the quests. Definitely recommended."
22389,TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSS!!!!!!!
22390,good
22391,This game is the bestest most best game in the wide world
22392,"yes, very nice
"
22393,"Bruh, it's Skyrim. It's still awesome."
22394,"Skyrim is my favorite game ever! The world is beautiful and open for self-directed exploration, the music is amazing, the story/stories is/are compelling, the gameplay is immersive, there's a ton of replayability and character customization options... and if there's anything you want to work differently, there is almost definitely a mod that does it! I simply cannot recommend this game enough! ... but I recommend installing a bug-fixing mod such as USLEEP (the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch) at the very least."
22395,like Farcry 3 with swords
22396,"I mean, it's Skyrim..."
22397,awesome
22398,I <3 SKYRIM
22399,One of the few masterpieces out there.
22400,Finished at last. A fun game as long as you dont run into bugs... But that would be too much to ask for. Thank God for Console Commands.
22401,its eh
22402,"LOL
"
22403,gang
22404,the best game that i played
22405,"good enough by itself I suppose, really should mod it though, make sit so much better"
22406,It good
22407,An immersive world with a great plot line and hugely moddable.
22408,"Apart from the general 'fetch missions', the rendering and graphics for the time this came out is still ok.  Combat can still be challenging and I like the variation of combat depending on how you spec and develop your character.  I've played it through on both sides of the war and still find time to log on and spend a few hours dungeon crawling either as a tank build or Wizard.  It would be nice if Bethesda developed a follow on which wasn't a massive multiplayer as sometimes it is nice to do one of these games without some jack ass charging past and getting involved in your mission."

22412,"I like the scope of the world in this game.  You can explore, create potions and magical weapons.  And of course there is battle against all sorts of opponents.  The world is colorful and varied.  And there are many mods you can add to make things even more interesting."
22413,fus ro DA!
22414,This is a great game.  I have over 1100 hours into it and I find new stuff all the time.  It is very replayable.
22415,best game

22421,I used to be an adventurer like you until I took an arrow to the knee.
22422,way to much you can do its worth every penny
22423,This game even after 9 years still looks good plays well and is mostly more fun than any other modern titles.
22424,"love it

22425,fav game
22426,Love it.
22427,kinda eh
22428,Love this game!!!!
22429,I like it :)
22430,"The Elder Scrolls universe is deep and engrossing. When coupled with modern standards of gameplay, what you get is one of the greatest games of all time. A must-play."
22431,The freedom this game provides in choosing your own playing style (in Combat and general play) is great. The main story alone will give you lots to enjoy along with all of the side quests. A must play for any RPG fan.
22432,"its skyrim its good 
"
22433,"great game, just hella buggy."
22434,"if you're going to get this game and since you're on PC, i imagine you're going to mod the hell out of it, which is the only way to turn it into a good game and make it fun, Definitely worth it for mods
But if you're playing Vanilla

Well, You see Skyrim has received much praise over the years and has had about 5,000 releases
Nonw of this praise is deserved
The main quest is boring and uninspired, you are a chosen one because reasons and you must stop the evil dragon man from destroying the world
All the guilds and side quests kinda suck too, some side quests are ok but the guilds suck
Why do i become the leader of various guilds in 6 quests?
The combat is terrible, You just sit there and spam potions, all you do is out tank the enemy
The sneaking doesn't work

Despite being an RPG none of your choices matter, there are no real consequences
Skyrim is not and never was a good game
Compared to most of the  good games that released during the same year, a year after, or a year before
it doesn't stand up to any of them

If you want a good medieval RPG from 2011, go play Dark Souls, it's a genuinely great game that deserves it's praise

22450,Great Game
22451,"I very much enjoy the open world aspect of the elder scrolls games but the biggest problem with the franchise is how linear the dungeons are, one way in, one route through to only one exit or sometimes after you defeat the dungeon boss that same linear route takes you right back to the entrance so you don't have to backtrack to get out but they put the path high up on a wall or ledge so u cant skip parts of the dungeon making it even more linear which sucks but besides that complaint the game is exceptional and still one of the best RPG's ever designed. To be honest The Elder Scrolls and nearly all Bethesda games are some of the best designed games ever with more to do and enough secret tasks that make it possible to play them over and over and not really ever have the same experience twice."
22452,i fell down the skyrim rabbit hole good game though

22459,"While, yes, the game is overrated, it withstands as one of the best games I have played. Even as a base game, there are dozens of hours of content and goofy things to see as many ""F E A T U R E S"" remain from launch."

It's from Bethesda so it's buggy af and you will play for 800 hours and then ruin your save and have to start over because your save is now fcuked beyond repair but you will do it again and again because this isn't a game it's a feeling of wonder."

:)"
22489,i get to play at my own pace. Each play through is different. I find something new every time
22490,Large open world with fantastic mod support. The game let's you do what you want and doesn't force you into the story after the first quest.
22491,"Do I really need to even type words? Look at the date, this is still alive and well. ""Mods"", you might say... Yes, friend; Mods. So much so, that I could say you're buying a whole new pass time, not just a game. See you around on Nexus and don't be afraid to break it one or two hundred times- You'll be back. Let's hope they can pull it off again with VI- Mods and all, but with a solid base this time."
22492,"Same as Fallout series, it's the only few games I still play and modding it nowadays.
"
22493,"Endless fantasy fun! Explore many a different and challenging dungeon. Beautifully rendered self contained substories along with the main thread. Finally, the dragons. If you have the proper sound system and monitor size the dragon fights should scare the crap out of you for a while at least. Must be experienced to appreciate. Still the best in 2020."

22511,its good
22512,"I don't know anyone who hasn't played Skyrim but I have heard they exist. The game offers you rpg, crafting, exploration and so much more. It will go down in history as one of the best sand box games ever."
22513,A Nord's final thoughts should be of home.
22514,One of the best games ever made
22515,"Please help, Todd Howard has kept me hostage and is forcing me to write this, he is telling me if I write something bad I will wake up in the game. I don't know what he means by that, but overall this game is pretty good and entertaining, especially with all the diverse options you can take on almost every quest, and you can play your character however you'd like! Wanna cast spells? Go right ahead pal, wanna swing big weapons? My guy take your pick, wanna do both? Well no two handed weapons but don't hold back, cast firebolts and swing swords, be the nord."

22529,Awsome game..
22530,Can play this game for hours and when you're done it has massive amounts of replayability especially if you mod it.
22531,yes
22532,"ALL GOOD
"
22533,"One of the best games I've ever played. Possibly *the* best. 

For a long time, I only played Sandbox games (particularly games without combat) because the most frustrating gaming situation to me happened in nearly every linear game I tried: getting stuck at a certain point in the storyline and never being able to get past a certain puzzle, challenge, or fight. Skyrim changed that. 

It retains a Sandbox nature in that you can, to a certain extent, do whatever you want whenever you want, moving back and forth between hundreds of quest lines at will. I've gotten stuck on fights or been stumped by puzzles--though I love video games, I'm not very good at 1-v-1 situations--but where other games essentially don't let you proceed until you figure it out, I'm able to step over to a different quest and give myself a break. Every time, without fail, just stepping away and coming back has helped me get past a boss fight or a particularly rough batch of enemies.

For someone who's run with the gamer crowd but has never really felt like I belonged there (""Oh yeah, I'm a *real gamer*--I play the Sims, Minecraft, and Animal Crossing!"") this game has probably changed everything for me. I'm far more confident now in my hand-eye coordination in combat (which has always been a problem, particularly on console) and I've been... genuinely proud, actually, of so many of the things I've been able to accomplish in-game. The immersion, size, and detail of the world is incredible; I cannot imagine how much work was put into this story, characters, and world.

Thank you, Bethesda--I've played games before, but this is the game that really taught me how to play well."

22553,This is more a vacation spot than a videogame.
22554,"A true (somewhat) modern masterpiece. The environment, the combat, the dungeons are/were jaw dropping. The game also supports extensive modding, which has truly elevated the game to being one of the best Open World RPG's on the market. 

However, the game suffers from poor main quest writing, the start of boring radiant questing in Bethesda titles and a regression on the importance of some skills in the game (namely Speech and Alchemy).

This version of the game is better than the special edition and has way more mods available. Furthermore, the game goes on sale to like £5 every couple of months, so just wait for it to go on sale as per usual."

You can play as a tank, dual wielding monster, archer, mage etc.  While the game has its faults where many questlines feel shallow, its many strengths overwrite those.  I recommend trying to do as much in the game as you can vanilla style before getting into the modded scene, as once you take a bite of mods, it's a deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep well."

22574,"  It's Elder Scrolls need i say more never the less this is probably one of the best RPG's i have played in a long time ever since Oblivion. It has a lot of location that can be explored given the time and patience that this game sometime requires, also did i mention there are DRAGONS!!! who doesn't want  to fight a Dragon from time to time though i have found that they do dwell close to some town's more often than not! and it will make getting out of those towns a little harder but if you are strong enough and brave enough you will succeed in your encounter with them, there are a lot of main and side quest's to go though and if you like RPG's with mods then you are in the right place because even some mods have little side quest depending on the mod you have chosen to play, this game has and or can have everything you ever wanted just by choosing the right mods to play with but i digress, you will have to experience this game for yourself and see where it will take you, will it take you on an adventure or glory you will have to decide."

It has the largest, most diverse modding community i have ever seen. It also has undeniable charm and amazing story lines. if you haven't played this game are you even a gamer? o.0"

22589,"This game is coming up to almost 10 years old, and still I play it! I played it for 8 years in it's unmolested form on console. Then last year, I bought it on PC, cheap on eBay. For a week I played it in it's original form and was amazed at how stable the engine was compared to both PS3 and XBox 360 versions. And even with minimal RAM requirements and a graphics card that had the capabilities of a potato, it still looked beautiful. Then I went down the rabbit hole of modding. Skyrim obviously needed Predators and Aliens running around the province. More animals. More weapons. More armour. More quests. This is a game that I suspect will never die. Every day, new mods appear. No two games need be the same.
Not only is this a great game; I think it is the greatest game of all time!"
22590,"All elder scrolls games are amazing, (except online)
Skyrim is immersive and loads of workshop items to customise your own game."

The realistic terrain and the fact that you can mess up and fall off the cliffs unlike other games that block that from happening,  Being able to buy land and build your own house is a nice touch, but need more iron!  I don't like the limited dialog with the NPCs a dialog upgrade or an data file that the user can input new chatter would be nice."

It's pretty decent role playing as well, although perhaps not on a par with its contemporaries e.g. Dragon Age Inquisition.  But it holds up quite well in that regard, at least the way I enjoy role playing computer games.  Plus, it's a beautiful game with a haunting sound track that I play as background music at work."

Ouh have I mention that you can marry them as well?

YES YOU HEAR IT RIGHT! Being an introvert with 0 real friends, weird degenerate that worship anime girl and being perceived as ""weirdos"" by surrounding people which makes me lost my faith in humanity entirely, this game has completely help me in coping with my unsolved situation.

22642,"One of the best stories for an RPG and epic gameplay that can be at times be extremely immersive. The dialogue of the characters is quite extensive but sometimes it doesn't make sense or is repetitive, like when 2 different NPCs have exactly the same dialogue options and outcomes. It eventually becomes predicable. However, there are times when the game surprises you and makes hundreds of hours of gameplay worth it."

22646,The most replayable game of all time
22647,"Really fun to explore and there is a very strong thrill of discovery in this game.  So much to explore always leaves you wondering ""hmm wonder what's over there"", which makes it all very exciting.  You might discover a cave filled with enemies that look very threatning and you need to be cunning to take them down and then you find some cool items you can use and armor.  it's not the story you're playing this game for. It's the exploration and RPG elements.  It has a nice aesthetic.  overall a solid 7.5/10 from me."

In trying to find people with a similar problem, I went to the reviews and saw outrage at the greed and mediocrity of Bethesda, the fact that finally disappointed me to try to play Skyrim."
22662,"Skyrim is a mythical game set in the region skyrim(funnily enough), you wake up on a horse kart about to be executed for being a suspected rebel when crossing the border , the special edition of this game looks more detailed id say more than a shader pack, although you can achive similar in the origin version

-----pros-----
the game you know and love
can put Professional dragon slayer on your resume 
can kill chickens 
a in-depth story to be told

-----cons-----
bit pricey for what it is , considering it looks like a community project
head bobbing when running could trigger motion sickness :  making the game unplayable
the children cant be killed :(

in my opinion skyrim is worth a pickup to play if you are into mythical type games"
22663,Stormcloaks forever!
22664,"Bethesda had done a really scummy thing making this game nearly-impossible to find on Steam in order to get people to by TESV:SPE and to even go as far as to hide the DLC for this version too, if you want too, here are the links for the other DLC's, I hope this review doesn't get lost in the other mountainous reviews for this game

If you want a 64 bit version that isn't capped at 4 GB Ram please buy the Special Edition, I only bought this version for the mods and to try to glitch the game and ruin the npc's, (The Biggest Difference in Special Edition to Original is Better Graphics, Same Glitches, Mods are a thing if you manage to bypass the achievement lock or use Nexus, and it runs so much smoother, definitely buy this for some old mods and stuff for NMM/Vortex and Nexus)

BETHESDA PLS BRING US BACK TO OLDRIM"
22665,One of the best games ever made.
22666,its like Fallout but without guns.
22667,yes

22676,I mean it's Skyrim. That pretty much says it all.
22677,It’s aight
22678,It just works.
22679,"Like an old pair of jeans. Might get tired and put them away but you never throw out. Add in mods that enhance performance, graphics and in some instance add additional scenarios and makes it one to keep in the library"
22680,iz gud but not as gud as IV or III
22681,"Skyrim is a classic, some might complain about all manner of glitches, and anoyances. We all know there wont be anything better than this until Elder Scrolls 6 comes out."
22682,This game has stood the test of time. An amazing RPG adventure.
22683,"I enjoyed the massive continuous map as well as the rich detail of the images.  story line is good, but i enjoy all the side stories."
22684,"If you haven't played it, you will play it. The day is coming. Uncle Todd'll port it to your dog if he has to, Skyrim will exist on every platform and give your free time the big succ until it cannot take it."
22685,dont think i need to say anything its a great game
22686,"I tried to play heavy but after 40 hours I was a stealth archer...again......somehow

13/10 - great game"
22687,duh
22688,Even though it was released back in 2012  Skyrim is still a must play for RPG fans and people who enjoy fantasy genre of swords and scorcery. The quests are well written and varied. the world is incredible to explore. I wish the combat system was better for melee attacks but there are plenty of mods that improve the games mechanics and visuals. tons of fun.
22689,4653
22690,love skyrim .. ive spent days and days playing it ... on steam and PS4...i like the steam play best but had to go to PS4 when my computer crashed ... glad to be back on steam cause the addons are wayyyyy better here ...

22698,My mom is gay and fat. i give it 10/10
22699,nice story and truly open world
22700,Incredible
22701,An amazing game with endless possibilities!
22702,"I received this game for free when I worked for Best Buy when it just came out.... I loved it so much, that I paid for it (full price) on the Nintendo Switch....  That's all I have to say"
22703,10/10 Would recommend
22704,Excellent continuation of the series.  Had no trouble converting from console to PC
22705,very noice
22706,"I think this is a well known fact but this is probably the best thing that god howard has released and it will be surpassed only by elder scrolls 6
"
22707,"It's Skyrim

I'm not sure what else you want from me?

The mod scene is pretty great, let me take down a mammoth at level 2 with a super kamehameha wave"
22708,awsome
22709,"its a really great game i givit 10 todd howards out of 10
"
22710,"Great Game, can't get enough... Although I've only got 159 hours playing it, I bought it when it first came out, even have a guide book that's never used anyway if you haven't played it yet you should."
22711,Its not too bad not too good i give it a solid 84.9 outta 100
22712,It's pretty okay.
22713,"One of my favorite game's of all time. Skyrim has such an immersive feel to it that just completely transports you into their universe. Replayed the game so many times and thanks to mods, I always find myself coming back to playing this. Definitely reccomend for those who are into fantasy action rpgs. Great story, thrilling combat, completely immersive, and an overall charming game. Only complaint I have is that it can by buggy at times

Honestly can't wait for The Elder Scrolls VI to come out. Would buy almost immediately"
22714,"Skyrim's a great game, your first playthrough will easily net over a hundred hours, then comes all the other playthroughs.
The world is huge, with tons of caves, ruins, towns, and cities to explore, mysteries to solve, and sweet loot to score. And most importantly, there's so many different things to kill, you might just sate a bit of your lingering bloodthirst.
In the end, the game also has it's own wonderful charm with glitches, that very rarely become gamebreaking, but usually are so unique you can easily find videos out there with people having hilarious encounters with flying horses, people taking a stroll in the ground, or just a casual corpse deciding to fling itself so hard somewhere, that it kills a giant and both of its mammoths.

Buy it and you won't regret it. (And if you get bored of the base game, there's so many mods it will make your head spin)"
22715,"10/10 would skyrim, skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim skyrim.... ebony warrior... no"
22716,rah
22717,Its ok
22718,Hundreds of hours played over several years and still one of my favorite games!
22719,i like it but its all up to you to decide if you want it
22720,awesome sia. after many years and this game still rocks
22721,"Love this fucking game so much!!!!!!
"
22722,The immersiveness and scale of the world have always drawn me in. There's so much to do that there have been entire weeks where I didn't even play any major quests -- even after numerous playthroughs (on both the PC and XBOX) I still find stuff I previously missed.
22723,Mods make this the greatest game of all time.
22724,"The perfect game to play for 2 hours and realize you've just played for 8. If you haven't played an elder scrolls game before, just go into it blind and have fun."
22725,Everything !
22726,"Good game, but a little outdated.  It wasn't really my thing when Samus and Mario played cricket w/ normal baseball bats.  And then Aang from avatar came in and killed them with force choke.  Kinda weird, but in a fun way!"
22727,I've been playing this game off and on for a quarter of my life. Nothing else to really say
22728,yes
22729,wgoat literally amazing game
22730,"What can I say other then Mods, so many damn mods"
22731,Best video game to have ever existed. Periodt.
22732,"I have logged 140+++ Hours in Skyrim. and right now starting a new game. ill try to hit 200 soon.
LOVE This Game. Only game I have Played Longer is Fallout 4"
22733,it's good
22734,"Good game 10/10
"
22735,amazing game
22736,nice
22737,Never run out of things to do.
22738,"That's skyrim, iz just never get's old"
22739,"If you haven't played it at this point, what were you doing with your life?"
22740,It's okay
22741,Thumbity
22742,Best Game Ever!
22743,Good game with lot of content
22744,you shouldn't have removed your games from geforce now. disgusting attitude bethesda.
22745,big sex
22746,"get mods after vanilla :(
"
22747,its okay...
22748,"This is a great game, both in its original form and with mods. Tons of replayability. Never grows old!"
22749,"Good old skyrim.

It is one of those game you may spent thousands of hours on it. Or perhaps it was. 

While it is still fun to play today, the games if obviously aging, and not only in term of graphic. 

There are some DLC, which are fine since they add a lot of story content, as well as items.

There also a tons of mods that allows you to personalise your experience to your liking, making this game all the better.

However, if you are looking to buy skyrim, le legendary edition would suit you probably better since it is the most up to date version of skyrim that exist. It includes the necessary yet absent feature of having multiple character profile, to switch between character easily.

If you are really buying old skyrim rather than the legendary edition, just know you are also buying a game that does not appreciate alt-tabbing at all."
22750,WIthout a doubt one of the most detailed and well made RPGs ever made the fact this was released nearly 10 years ago was shocking if it were released today for 60$ i would still buy it in a heartbeat i cannot recommend this game enough
22751,I like the dragon
22752,"Look at all those chickens
"
22753,good
22754,I played for a while... would recommend.

22757,bugs and mods
22758,excellent game
22759,its a great timesink
22760,Classic freeworld RPG that is easy to explore. This is the game that defined a good gaming experience for me.
22761,One of the best games of all-time.
22762,I put naked women into my game
22763,дшллу

22770,"the game dont function well 

im stuck in the intro horse cart bug and i cant do any thing about it"
22771,Baby a triple
22772,It's Skyrim what else I need to say. A great game with many bugs and exploit. Just like any other game from Bethesda. But you are gonna spend a lot of time in this game especially while in quarantine.
22773,Great game
22774,It's been almost 10 years and I'm still coming back to this game. You won't regret the buy.
22775,I mean... its skyrim you know the rest
22776,Very nice much game and you can mod for extra  fun
22777,"Everything I love! Open World, great story and great replay vault"
22778,I'm not sure what you're doing if you haven't played this game
22779,its an amazing adventure with mods
22780,"This is the standard by which all open world games were judged, before The Witcher 3, and it is still a worthy contender."
22781,"good game
"
22782,I've played 328 hours so far. 'nuff said.
22783,fun :3
22784,good
22785,Can spend hours on game. Quests are dope.
22786,"It's so good, it's even available on the alexa toilet!"
22787,fallout with dragons
22788,"Great game hours, days, weeks and months of entertainment."
22789,Oldie but goldie. 200 hours of gameplay and I'm still hungry.
22790,"I have WAY more than 627 hours in this game.  

GET IT!
LOVE IT!
FEED THE ADDICTION!!!
Be a vampire.

Be killed by a Deer.

NO SUCH THING as cookie cutter here.

Want to stab that annoying little bastard kid that wont quit pestering you right in the face? Well there is a mod for that. But you can DO IT!!!!!
Want to be a cat person that gets high on Sugar cocain? Yup, you can do it. lol. 
Seriously, if you can think it up, you can prob do it in ES5 SKYRIM

Did i mention the ENDLESS replayability of this game?
And for such an old game the GFX are STILL better than 90% of the Crap on the market these days.(ESPECIALLY with the right mods.)

So do yourself a favore you will never regret and get ES5 SKYRIM!!!"
22791,"This game is a classic and a must have, if you don't already have it, are you even a gamer?"
22792,so good
22793,"This is my favourite game to play for about five minutes after browsing Nexus for hours and installing every mod that was popular in the last 30 days before I go back and do the same thing again until I get bored and/or run out of space on my harddrive. At this point I most definitely have spent more hours modding instead of actually playing the game. The last time I completed the story I was still playing on PS3 when the game released.

11/10"
22794,This game has changed my life
22795,"Is classically Bethesda good and bad. It has a wide open world with hundreds of quests, radiant and storied. Dozens of settlements to explore and guilds to climb your way to the top of. It has dragons to fight and dungeons to explore.

It also has a shit ton of bugs, so please don't expect anything else. 

With mods the replayability is high, though I am still fine on vanilla after roughly 450 hours, so that isn't a necessity.

It's on offer so often that you might as well pick it up. See what all the hype is about."
22796,"Probably the best Elder Scrolls ever and it's been nearly 10 years since the game was made.

10 out of 10"
22797,100% enjoy this game.
22798,"Great game, better with mods"
22799,its freakin Skyrim. Just play it.
22800,its cool
22801,nice game
22802,"i got this game as a gift when i was having a bad time with illness < my grandson let me use his xbox for a while !! i love video games but always been rubbish ! from settlers ,command an conquer , Total War , i just liked the step back stratergy ! But Skyrim is amazing , the depth and ability to grow while staying as simple as you like or as complicated and manic as well ! i keep coming back to it ! and the mods Oh My Life !!! what clever people out there .A big thankyou to the modders your brilliant !!! i love the extra dialict ones ! i wish they would carry the main game even further ! i could not say how but am sure there are clever people who could make Skyrim Great Again !!"
22803,sick
22804,"nice and all, but i dont wanna buy the same game for 40$ bucks i dont have, first 76, now this, bethesda just stop if you want a fanbase that doesnt hate you"
22805,I like how every character I make can have a different path and change the narrative.  Overall a great game that I have spent way too much time playing.
22806,"Dovahspread, Dragon Toast"
22807,"so much content and so much to do, you'll wish the day can be longer"
22808,"a Really Good Game for people who like Magic and immersion which there are mods for it.
I like skyrim soo much beacose of the magic system and also modding i really love to mod skyrim.
a really cool game if you wanna feel like a GOD XD"
22809,just kill nazeem
22810,"its great 10/10
"
22811,great
22812,.
22813,"If you haven't played yet, do it."
22814,is very good gambe
22815,Better than Minecraft!
22816,Awesome story and full of content world.
22817,"I'm pretty sure this is my single most played game ever. I've spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours across various editions.

The game isn't perfect, far from it.  But it holds a special place in my heart. I'd like to think that it does the same for many other people all over the world. Many people are still actively playing and creating custom content for it nearly 10 years later. I'd heartily recommend giving it a try.

Also, mods open up a whole new world of content and enjoyment."
22818,I like
22819,Such an inclusive world and so many options as how to play through it. It is the only game that I can still visit years after its release and still enjoy it just as much as I did back then.
22820,288 hours playing and still no finished. perfect for casual playing dipin and out of the totally immersive world.
22821,Fun game with or without mods. But i prefer it modded
22822,A game with a issues which let down an otherwise outstanding game now the issue is stutter you will encounter this when you are in many of the inside locations this is a visual issue and is an know issue with game engine there are many fixs online but it down to PC gods if they work on your system it to me number of hours to find my fix my this is as this is a common issue and lot help to be found search: Skyrim SE FPS Boost and Less Stuttering
22823,"The greatest game I have ever played. I've played over 1000 hours on XBOX and thought I should start on PC to mod. When you start modding, you can't go back. 10/10 stars."
22824,"Just awesome... but I spent too much time modding it until it broke in the end and lost the drive to play it... Checking Enderal now, if I can get Ultrawide to work properly. :)"
22825,A Classic
22826,"Oh trust me, once you beat the main story, you haven't even scratched the surface of this game. And boy, don't get me started on the countless possibilities of modding the game."
22827,its a good game play it :)
22828,"One of the best games ever made.
"
22829,Broken at >60fps.
22830,good
22831,"My recommendation for this is purely because it is possible to have fun in this game if you mod the ever loving hell out of it and buy the DLC but your fun will be more down to seeing how many people you can kill in one sitting rather then actually playing the game. It however has several problems even without modding, mostly due to it being as stable as any other bathesda game in existence. Unfortunately modding it exacerbates that problem exponentially the more mods you put in. You will also have to be careful as to what mods you install because sometimes they will crash the game on load up regardless of what you do to fix it. In essence its like editing INI files for anyone who has done that. Throw some shit in, run the game and hope it works, if it works great, if it crashes then go bang your head against your keyboard until it does."
22832,rt dz
22833,nice
22834,"Not perfect by any means, but an infinite source of fun and enterteinment. The game I've play the most in my library.
"
22835,"this is a game you can spend many hours in, absolutely love it!"
22836,"Had this game since release, got SE for free as a result. Still find this fun. Even with all the random buggy things and great mods.
Flying horses, items making your head vanish, broken NPCs, various other funny shit that happens all too frequently.... I'll still enjoy this monstrosity! xD"
22837,good
22838,"600+ hours in, this game is a winner.  Probably one of the best RPG I ever played.  

These are some of the things I liked most about it.
1. First person shooter.
2. Ultima Online style skill system.
3. Modding for personalized content creation.

I wasn't all that impressed with the crafting system.  I also didn't like the fact that it doesn't have multiplayer, but such a system would have taken a massive toll on the game creators, who were already under pressure to release the game.

Every single game manufacture needs to take a long look at this game and realize that open world games are the future of gaming."
22839,hoardersim with some archering
22840,"Fun and some times boring
"
22841,The game is fuln but after finding mods it makes the game so much more fun
22842,"Me: i want skyrim
My mom: we have skyrim at home
Skyrim at home: garfield kart.
Not complainging but garfield kart is different from skyrim i love both games.
Stay tuned to crustymoneky for some cool new reviews"
22843,"them doengeons are scary man
"
22844,love it
22845,I really like the game. I originally starting playing it on Xbox and grew to love it.
22846,fuck this game
22847,bad >:(
22848,It's like being outside except I can stay inside and they let me use a sword.
22849,"me and a horse beat a dragons ass

10/10 would beat nazeem to death again"
22850,"You love it or hate it, but is one of my all time return to play games."
22851,"What are you doing asking if skyrim is good, go play skyrim."
22852,the best to ever do it
22853,Good game!! Play!
22854,I have spent more time fixing this game than i have my life.
22855,It just works
22856,"Skyrim is a good game, however, do not purchase this if you are looking for playing any of the DLCs. None of them are available and you are only prompted to purchase Skyrim: Special Edition instead, for $40. Buy Special Edition if you look to play Skyrim, not this version. Other than that the game is amazing."
22857,"This is literally my favorite game of all time and I really dont think ES6 is gonna outdo it. I have bought this game about 5 or 6 times (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Standard Edition + DLC on PC, Special Edition on PC, and Skyrim VR), and i seriously just cannot recommend this game enough. Across all systems, I have easily logged 2,000+ hours and I am unsure I have even done everything there is to do in this massive game. Thank you Todd, because if it weren't for you, SKyrim Grandma would probably be Call of Duty Grandma or something."
22858,"9/10 - Amazing Game!

Positive:
- Giant Open-World
- Tons of Quests
- Each decision changes Game
- Tons of Mods available
- Great grafiks
- Atmospheric
- Great DLC´s

Negative:
- Several Bugs

"
22859,It's skyrim... you love it or you hate it.  Now imagine having thousands of mods to either make the game brand new again or to improve on just the stuff you loved.
22860,"Fun. Not easy, but very entertaining."
22861,"so... ehm... okay it is a typical Bethesda game, lots of bugs and small mistakes, BUT still a moderate RPG, the Grafiks are old, yes there lots of bugs, yes after a while you can only play it with mods, yes.... okay it inst that great i just like Bethesda. Cmon they did some good games.... in the past.... i just go now...


btw i saw people complaining that they cant buy the dlc's without buing Skyrim Special edition, you can by buying Key's on websides like mmoga or instant gaming"
22862,Good shiet
22863,very fun
22864,i mean it fucink skyrim what more you want me to tell you ? just buy it danm it
22865,Attacking Whiterun be like
22866,If you haven't played within the last decade what have you been doing?...play the game.
22867,This game (mod or no mod) is an amazing game.
22868,Skyrim is taking over my life pls help me
22869,good
22870,MOO
22871,"Can get a bit Overwhelming at times, but otherwise a stable production"
22872,skooma need skooma
22873,Awesome game!!!
22874,My friend Todd Howard recommended me this game. Thanks buddy
22875,"good
"
22876,"Was playing the pirated one since 10 years ago... but decided to buy the original one because of how i loved this game...

Thank you for the best feeling of the first time playing this game... (now back to modding it until it crash!!!)"
22877,"Dude its Skyrim, if you're not on board yet, you've been living life wrong and I don't know what to tell you."
22878,"An older game but new to me, I find this to be quite engaging so far, with a great deal to learn and I am captivated!
"
22879,"It's S K Y R I M. And it has the Workshop! What's not to love? Granted, some of the mods make me question things, but very few do that, it's more the nexus that makes it happen and I can't figure out how to use that, but still, it's skyrim. That's all that's important."
22880,skyrim sex mod gud
22881,i like this game nothing bad to say about it
22882,FUN with or without mods.  Hours of playtime on numerous platforms and versions and I am still finding something new.
22883,Skyrim can be the best Sandbox game you've ever played but after a while you should start to use Mods to tailor the game to exactly the experience you want. Expand all the mechanics and add entirely new systems and at a certain point the world can nearly breath.
22884,"I only have 163 hours currently played on Steam, but across 3 Xbox profiles, I have accumulated 3.5 months of total play time. If you haven't played this game yet, you should 100% grab the Special Edition and try it out!
"
22885,nice
22886,"RANT: Probably shouldn't read. After 9 years of trying to get this game into the shape of playable, endless waves of mods trying to make this game fun, after unending failed attempts of trying to fix all the awful development decisions, awful gameplay systems, awful everything, I am completely done. This game will never be what I want it to be. It will never have deep immersive follower systems, never have deep invested combat systems, never have balance, never have fun new experiences, it will never be anything but a piss poor attempt at following oblivion and morrowind."
22887,mods
22888,It feels like more.
22889,Best game out there! Many great mods available for it too for even more hours of fun!
22890,111
22891,"Mod community keeps this great game, for it's time, relevant and fun for today's times."
22892,"it's skyrim... you know what it is.
"
22893,"The Skyrim Experience:
Add too many mods the game breaks itself.
Spend hours on end fixing the mod errors.
Play for a bit.
Stop playing.
Return after a while.
Reset playthrough.
Repeat for all of eternity."
22894,One of the GOAT. Crazy it came out almost 10 years ago. Still no open world game as immersive as this one.
22895,great game definitely no glitches or bugs whatsoever
22896,I love this game as well as the series. In my opinion it has a lot of replay ability I started around 11/11/11. I have stopped playing and started back up on and off but every time I play I discover something new about it. The date is 4/19/20 and I'm still playing the game I have modded some but I still love this game. As someone who played console and PC it is a good game. So if you love to play a story or live a normal life or roleplay as a bandit or guard or farmer or something else I 100% recommend this game. + for a 9 year old game its really enjoyable.
22897,Ive literally sunk almost 600 hours at this point yes is good
22898,Still playing it
22899,"It's  the worst Elder Scrolls title by far. Having said that, it's still pretty good. When taken out of the context of the previous games you have a pretty fun entry level casual RPG. The lorebooks are fun and the mod community is excellent. It's Skyrim. It doesn't really live up to the hype, but it's still fun all these years later."
22900,":)
"
22901,Medieval times!
22902,game good
22903,"Good game, much recommend."
22904,very fun for those who like mistic type games
22905,"Man, it's lasted as long as it has for many a good reason! If you don't like the vanilla version: Mod it! If you like the vanilla version but just want to experiment with making or using game mods: Mod it! If you don't want to mod it, but want to just play the heck out of it: go for it! It's so open that you can do and be just about anybody! Sneaking thief? Death from the shadows? Swashbuckling hero? Brave folk hero? Oh yeah, all that and more!"
22906,It's alright
22907,good game
22908,p
22909,"Amazing game -- there are no words to appropriately review something over this caliber. Over 1000 hours logged on pc alone (I also own for PS4). The mod community truly makes this endless. It's 2020, so if you haven't yet played Skyrim, you've been missing the best fantasy RPG of the last decade."
22910,Great game. Still trying to understand the mods but this game is worth every penny.
22911,"oblivion is better 

8/10"
22912,"One of the greatest games of all time, which is probably why it gets released on every console under the sun."
22913,"""oh look, your finally awake"""
22914,"has „FEW"" bugs but is fun"
22915,yes
22916,"Best game ever, there is no question in my mind. Have used most of my life playing this xD"
22917,"yea
"
22918,Why are you reading reviews for Skyrim? Just buy it
22919,"Gigantic game, always something to do."
22920,rather fun only played 11 hours would recommend vanilla over modded for a first run though
22921,"This is one of the most important and best games ever made, in my opinion. It paved the way for well made, huge games"
22922,fun
22923,This game never gets old!
22924,yes
22925,Good Game Played a lot would skyrim again <3
22926,.
22927,"Awesome game, even in 2020"
22928,"I like to kill things :)
"
22929,"Bruh, do I even need to explain why? Sure, the new version ""looks better"" (graphic mods are far superior still), but the sheer modding capabilities of this game are unsurpassed by any other. It is THE REASON this game has lived as long as it has. No other modding community is this ridiculous and I'm living for it. I mean, just look at Enderal for crying out loud. An entire new game made from this by fans. Are you kidding me."
22930,cool
22931,Do you realy need my review? You will still consider thr opinion of our community/ But that will come later.
22932,the best game for pc no question about it
22933,I can't think of any other game where you could fly by standing on a bucket and pulling it upward other than this game and Garry's Mod.
22934,good game a lot of mods
22935,"PSB
ALL SPELLS
COMMANT"
22936,Fantastic game.
22937,"Vanilla Skyrim is actually even funnier than I remember. The amount of flaws in this game is ridiculous, but we all still come back to play it because it has this weird fuzzy feeling about it.

Maybe I'm insane or maybe Todd's installed a chip in my brain, I love Skyrim even though I hate it.

4/10 Amazing game."
22938,Yes
22939,1
22940,GOOD
22941,nep nep nep
22942,hdfbvsvjrevbiara
22943,its a fun game and you can modify the game any way you want
22944,"A ton of detail and countless hours can be put into this game effortlessly.... but you already knew that.. so let's talk about the Song ""Secunda"" that plays at night time in the overworld.

The blend of background ambience and strong melodic structure really brings out the idea of what Skyrim is about in an auditory delivery. Hopefully this isn't the last time we hear this piece in an Elder Scrolls Title!"
22945,Good
22946,One of the best RPG. Nice  story and world.
22947,it's alright
22948,Loads of content.  Fun to explore.  Shooting out the Sun?  Big Bonus.
22949,gold.
22950,I loved this game. Until I took an arrow to the knee. Then someone stole my sweet-roll.
22951,It's fun.
22952,Who doesn't like hunting dragons with just your pocket knife and your wits? gorgeous vistas and dank dungeons this has the lot! I give it 5 out of 5 rubber chickens. My only complaint was I rode a horse once and it stalked me for the rest of the game  didn't matter where I was ... I'd leave a room and there it was.. waiting... just waiting .. and watching.. and judging..
22953,"Skyrim is the perfect example of exploiting something very cool and utilizing it in mainstream media to bring players unaware of the genre to symbolize this game as the greatest ever. Skyrim had a lot going for it, yet with every Bethesda sequel comes another disappointment in one way or another. The appeal to this game is dragons, without it , its a tied down excuse of an RPG. Play Oblivion or Morrowing before playing Skyrim, then you will see what potential this game could have. Mind you I have played Skyrim from top to bottom, this game is all rinse an repeat. Quest design is terrible, having played Oblivion before hand, where each guild had a unique set of rules an guidlines to follow. Skyrim tosses these out for a rinse an repeat of 'go here, kill this, come back, good job' quest design. the guilds in skyrim are pointless, thieves guild for example is reminiscent of the dark brotherhood which is a joke! DLC is could have saved this game yet still follows the same quest design just under a paid tier. The second DLC is nothing but a money grab that should be implimented into the base game, yet Bethesda found a way to make a paid dlc out of it. Skyrim is a joke, there are other RPG's new an old that trounce this game."
22954,Itssssss a Great
22955,It's Skyrime
22956,this game is dope. mad memories from when I played as a kid
22957,Lot of bugs.
22958,"This world needs next gen of this shit.
TES VI must worth the wait."
22959,It's just like Skyrim.
22960,"so damn fun but moding sucks ass to deal with
"
22961,Classic. Amazing. Never gets old to play. Always a great way to spend a day.
22962,boobs
22963,obvious
22964,"Look, dude's you can't even find this page on the steam store anymore. I'm not even sure this review matters. Either way, this game has been one of the greatest experiences I've had thus far. The ongoing modding community would agree with me. Also, I wanna give some appreciation to those mod creators out there. Those some cool and talented individuals."
22965,The open play that this game affords is second to none. Just being able to get into the game and walk around and listen to the music and watch nature is amazing. Everything in the game hinges on your decisions. It's like Bethesda asked me what kind of game I wanted to play and made it - all without ever speaking to me. Highly recommend. I would have put in a SkyUI type menu from the getgo but that's just me.
22966,"Its Skyrim. If you don't have it, just get it. Just remember to clear your calendar for a week before you begin."
22967,life but fantasy
22968,Skyrim good
22969,"After many years of playing this game on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox 1 and PC. I still love to play it and mods make it better."
22970,It is awesome
22971,srdcovka
22972,"Great rpg game with tons of stuff to do. I first did it back when it first came out on ps3 and got to 355 hours on 1 save game. Def worth the monney. On the other hand the new spetial edition is not, you are basically paying more for the exact same thing and of course its filled with paid mods cause : Bethesda greed. 

If you plan on playing the old edition (The best one with the most mods available) i highly recommend downloading this mod: Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch on the Nexus mod. ps: ( you can download it manualy and drop the files in the folder ''data'' of the skyrim directory.) It will fix ton of bugs and for real these guys did the job of the devs."
22973,"really nice,everyone should tray this"
22974,my new addiction.
22975,"Timeless game, there's a reason its been ported to so many consoles"
22976,"743th playtrough going, that how good this is."
22977,yes
22978,Pretty good tbh
22979,Probably the best game ever made
22980,Great game...massive too:)
22981,Love
22982,"mental lads. frankly, it's irresponsible"
22983,Deep search just to buy this legend
22984,What can I say about Skyrim. If you just want a good story based rpg then it is good but not the best. If you are looking for a fantasy setting sandbox in which you can do whatever and be whatever you want? Then you might be like me and spend nearly 1000 hours on this game.
22985,.
22986,"hUGE GAME
"
22987,IT ROCKS
22988,One of the greatest games to play
22989,yes
22990,Better than real life.
22991,cool game
22992,"best game 
best mods
best community
ever."
22993,One of the best Fantasy RPG
22994,good game man
22995,Very good i enjoy
22996,Dragons are an awesome sight.
22997,it a great game
22998,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, I've owned it on almost every console I own as well as PC. I've played hundreds of hours over the years and am even recently coming back for more after heavily modding the game. If you're reading this and you have yet to experience Skyrim, oh baby you have a good time ahead of you, this game is immaculate."
22999,yes
23000,"Great fantasy RPG. The endless stream of repetitive quests do eventually get old, but only after hours and hours of excellent gameplay."
23001,noice
23002,Really fun
23003,"Still arguably the best FPS/Epic adventure I have played, I come back to this time after time after time and never get bored. An excellent workshop also, if basic visuals and game elements are not enough, not to mention an active mod scene available on-line. It gives total immersion, and for me total enjoyment. It's not without problems, but it hasn't ever affected my game play enough to down grade my opinion - especially when compared with some other 'big name' releases I have purchased."
23004,Great MMO game!
23005,Absolutely epic.
23006,It's Skyrim. You know what it is at this point.
23007,Better with mods. But good game none the less.
23008,Best game ever written. I'm about to play it through for the third time.
23009,"Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin,

23010,It's another big e moment
23011,"First off I didn't like the game. But when I got longer in to it I started to enjoy it, played for about 10 hours now and its fun to spend some time to (Y)"
23012,good game
23013,it's skyrim what's to hate?
23014,"Yeah, well it's Skyrim, ofc I'd recommend"
23015,"A fantastic game, I recommend that you buy this version than the Special Edition, free mods and you can extend the game as you want."
23016,"One of the best Elder Scrolls games. Some bugs now and then but not that many.
Some times can feel a bit rail roady....

"
23017,it's a amasing game
23018,"Fully Editable! 
Lots of adventure!
Much Grinding!
Much Fuus!"
23019,Modding and Modding .... Keep on modding .... Modding and moar modding. These hours were not for playing. I am constantly ending my gameplay when reaching Whiterun because something broke or I Fucked up. Still a great game though.
23020,Great game. Careful with your time and life because it will become your life.
23021,It's okay i guess.
23022,Hands down the best game I have ever played.
23023,Absilute gem of a game award winner and still great after all these years
23024,"What can I say?  400+ hours speaks for itself.

An epic open-world sword & sorcery adventure RPG of the finest quality.
It has been replaced by the updated 'Special Edition'."
23025,buggy mess after 9 years but nostalgia prevents me from disliking it
23026,it's skyrim. Just buy it.
23027,Its worth the money
23028,Love this game!
23029,This game is worth replaying again and again.
23030,its good thats all you wanted me to say right oh don't write this down stop writing what your saying
23031,yes
23032,Its muy fun
23033,Coming to toaster near you soon
23034,"Great story, funny as glitches. Highly recommend."
23035,bxcg
23036,:)
23037,Just look at my screenshot
23038,"It would be a great game if it didn't feel like it was being held together with scotch tape. I got to level 40, and it started to crash my computer every 15 minutes. Went online, discovered that there are many suggestions for fixing the issue. Each possible solution required long Google searches for me, as I'm not an expert at this. The ones I had the patience to try out did not work.  

Sooo...no, not recommended. 








"
23039,"have over 100 hours across all versions and platforms, have done everything there is to do even with mods, great game would recommend if you still haven't played this game by now."
23040,good story with carecters that make the world come alive
23041,Always enjoyed playing running mods. Not bothered with it for a long while but sunk hundreds of hours over the years and no doubt one day I'll go back and do it again.
23042,approval
23043,"best game
"
23044,The dungeons give me anxiety but the rest is pretty good
23045,"This game has pretty much everything you need for a high fantasy adventure. 

Plus, with mods, you can make it a whole lot better!"
23046,Legendary. Or not?
23047,"Not a bad game, but not an RPG either. It's more of an adventure game since you can't really choose a role to play. There were supposed to be some choices you could make, but they scrapped them towards the end of development instead of finishing the game. Surprising considering how many times they re-released it that they never bothered to finish the main civil war storyline. Also the graphics were a step down from oblivion in many ways."
23048,Yes
23049,the beginning of the game is broken ..9 years on its still broken bethesda are a terrible game company..
23050,Waiting for Elder scrolls 6
23051,"I've only played the game for 32 hours and I have had the game quite some time now,  but the game is worth buying if you are looking for a good openworld rpg, plus, you can add mods which makes it better. It also contains and excessive amount of good quests, plus DLC."
23052,endlessssss adventure
23053,is good with mods
23054,Great game that still stands up after all these years.
23055,I recommend all of the Elder Scrolls products - they've always delivered.
23056,"The endless amount of Modding capabilities that this game has available, offers a wider range of game play possibilities. I mean I've told everyone and anything that will listen, Skyrim is hands down game of the century."
23057,"Wasted my fucking life on this game.











still worth tho"
23058,"Skyrim is by far one of my favorite games. I have definitely sunk way to many hours into this across many platforms.
The base version of the game offers hours upon hours of content, even if I restarted my time I probably could get 500+ hours and still be finding new things. Now the DLC... those add tons of new things to do, easily pushing you a couple hundred hours further. 
If that's not your taste, Skyrim has an extensive modding community, and a lot of it is pretty simple to set up. Want the dragon to become Thomas the Tank Engine? You got it. 

Overall, would absolutely recommend this game. You don't need a super high end PC to run the base game, and it can offer hours of fun content."
23059,one of my favorite games
23060,I disliked never having enough time to finish the game .
23061,Instant classic! Love this game!
23062,:)
23063,GOAT
23064,"Skyrim is an amazingly beautiful game, the storyline, the graphics and even the music is amazing. If you've always wanted to be an adventurer or dragon slayer then definitely play this game."
23065,pp
23066,Good game
23067,Infinite replayabillity
23068,Fun
23069,A virtual world where you can download a girlfriend who wont cheat on you.
23070,there is a big selection of mods  and if you dont cheat it is updated up to date.
23071,Great game that can be played in many characters with different quests
23072,Holy FUCKING SHIT THE FUCKING MLG MODS GIVE ME POWER BEYOND BELIEF I WOULD STRONGLy RECOMDNED PLAYING tHIS GAME HAVE DAYS OF PLAYTIME ON CONSOLE THIS IS MY 5TH PLAYTHROUGH WOULD BUY 30 TIMES OVEr
23073,"its fucking skyrim, no explanation needed"
23074,"The regular game is  ok, but the mods make it great.  Much more fun when its modded out. I've been able to make simple mods with the construction kit and use others that have already been written.  I think with all the extra modules, Dragonborn, Hearthfire, etc., the character starts to have so many powers you never use most of them, for example the Dragon shouts I think you need for 2 or 3 quests then the rest are just extra spells, add on Werewolf or Vampire powers and its too much.  Learning the console commands is good to resurrect NPCs killed in town."
23075,"skrim

this game has cost me over $300 in nearly 10 years and thousands of hours of gameplay.
BUT THERES MORE QUESTS"
23076,Skyrim is amazing if you haven't heard someone say it before. Nuff said!
23077,"good for laptops 
although mine cant handle special edition i only have an i3 processor and 4 gigs of ram"
23078,"this game is better than the cheese dip i ate out of your moms tuna tunnel last night, and thats on god baby girl."
23079,So many hours of gameplay with such a interesting and fun world has undoubtedly made me and instant fan of the elder scrolls. the mods really took it to a shining star of video games. 11/10 would play again
23080,Endless hours of fun. This never ending game is the addictive dream for open world gamers.
23081,Fun to play unless you've got weak knees
23082,rtr
23083,fun
23084,I LOUVE DRAGONS :DDDD
23085,its skyrim
23086,nice
23087,yes
23088,"It's just a classic one you HAVE TO BUY. You can buy the more expensive one for better graphics and all DLC's but can go with the old legendary edition aswell since the graphics are not that big of a problem and it has the DLC's aswell. It is truly 100% moddable and you will achieve better graphics with mods (enb's) than with the remaster anyways. Just download Nexus Mod Manager and it will make a lot of things easier like installing mods and stuff. Sure the graphical mods are a bit complicated but one of Youtube's literally THOUSAND videos about Skyrim graphical modding and and how to do it will make you alot smarter even about your own computer. But if you're not into modding, the Vanilla game just like the DLC's are still awesome"
23089,"best game ive played, no exxaggeration"
23090,"fun game, lots to do, so many mods available to keep it interesting for years to come."
23091,P[ERSNI
23092,I like it
23093,parp
23094,"I'm an old Sword & Sorcery guy, so this game hits all of my high points. It's not seriously complicated, but still manages to provide adventure and surprises. You can ramp up on killing dragons, but those damned vampires are always dangerous."
23095,one of the best games I have ever played. and i'm still playing it after 8 years.
23096,"Pretty good, better impression than Witcher 3, DragonAge, ElderScrolls"
23097,amazing if u download mods for this game
23098,This game is alright.
23099,I like the mods that show tits
23100,Best mod: Equippable C*ck
23101,56465
23102,gREAT gAME
23103,"Top  notch  stuff. Decent  quests and  plenty of scope  for Workshop add ons. Also, being able to build your own home is amazing.   You cant actually place your own home and shape it, just choose from some preset   designs.   Will always drop back in to Skyrim now and then but I  could play this game forever and a day."
23104,"It's Skyrim, nuff said"
23105,Fucking great game. I've played it for at least 2000 hours in total between console and pc and ive never gotten bored of such a great game.
23106,honestly with nexus mods this turns into a masterpiece it failed to be on release cause Todd
23107,The world Building
23108,absolutely everything
23109,One doesn't just simply finish Skyrim
23110,good stuff
23111,its just skyrim innit?
23112,most amazing game ever replayability 100
23113,good game
23114,I've beat the game at least 10 times and its amazing
23115,Skyrim will forever be the best single player game for be due to it being an open world game with great mechanics and outstanding veiws that is just beath taking when combined with the Music. and the amount to explore in this game is so much I that even me with 252 hours of playing isn't even half done with all the achievements so if you decide to buy this game I will just say. BUCKLE UP! Because this is gonna be a joy ride for you if you love advanture and Open world. ;)
23116,"Pretty good i guess. I cut off tons of the graphics using mods so it'll run at a stable fps. I played 90ish hours with the same character and got all but 3 vanilla achievements with the same character. I feel very achieved so good for me i guess. Point being, 94 hours of me just playing Skyrim until the game felt useless to play unless i restart."
23117,never played a more broken game
23118,it's ok
23119,This game has won an award.What else do i have to say...
23120,I like it
23121,"This is a long and winding road of a game, on every corner of the world you will find a new quest to occupy you. But it does not stop there the myriad of fans have crafted their own world and quests for you to enjoy so explore the world of modding.

This will occupy hours of your time, and if you follow the online world as well, you can travel without affecting lock down.

Good travels my friend, I raise a tankard to you."
23122,is good
23123,Good
23124,its lots of fun and there's heaps of room for re-playability
23125,very fun
23126,"Notice: At the request of the publisher, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search.

Hay bethesda go F@CK yourself , wanted to buy the DLC's for Skyrim and looky bethesda pulled all the skyrim DLC's and replaced them with fallout 76 bullsh!t , this company can f@ck right off"
23127,"This game set a new standard. If you've never heard of it, then you are completely behind the gaming curve by 10 years.
"
23128,"It's Skyrim, you buy the game on any platform and any version. Then you don't finish it but just mod the heck out of it then you still enjoy the game!"
23129,love all the length of the game and how many stories there are
23130,its alright
23131,"play oblivion, dawnguard is the shit tho"
23132,aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
23133,"I played and finished this when it first came out, then replayed it in 2020. All the new DLC gives it such a wealth of experience and choices that it's worth a few replay with different races and characters."
23134,buy skyrim
23135,its fun
23136,It good game.
23137,its skyrim you know what it is
23138,it's cool
23139,very good game. I like very good games. this is a very good game. I continue playing the very good game that this game is. I play now.
23140,Second favourite game
23141,love it
23142,"thank you todd
"
23143,"An endless suppply of quests of both good and evil . including thiefguild campaign , assasinguild campaign, Bardguild Campaign , Civilwar Campaign, Demongodess Campaign, Vampire/werewolf/vampireslayer (DLC) campaign. Fighterguild Campaign,"
23144,"If you don't know what this game is by now, you must not have a smart device. If you do have a smart device, you can likely play this game on it. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, was a lot of peoples' first look into the elder scrolls games, because it was released with a TON of hype. The hype was right, it's very worth it. What my current play time doesn't care to mention is the multiple hundreds of hour I spent getting all the achievements then just exploring this game on the 360 when it released in 2011... Then, again, when the special edition dropped for Xbox One."

23148,I like it
23149,tiz fun
23150,"Not at all an RPG. It is a fantasy game with light RPG elements. This is fine for many people but eliminates people like myself who are looking for a deep experience like Neverwinter Nights 2, Dragon Age: Origins, or Fallout: New Vegas."
23151,game
23152,Its Skyrim. Bloodiest game in the reach.

23172,AMAZING GAME
23173,"In my opinion, Skyrim is one of the best single player games to ever have been created. I've played the entire story line nearly 3 times through, and I've beaten the game completely only once. It's a tough feat, considering this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay, but I've managed. It's because it has so much to do that it's so fun. The game has amazing graphics that are ahead of it's time, and it's story line is unrivaled by any games, including other works by Bethesda."
23174,"Like the call of an ex's pussy, it pulls me back in again and again"

23183,It's Skyrim. Who doesn't love it?
23184,Damn pigeons
23185,It's alright I guess ...
23186,"Great Game, you can Play for hours without getting bored. You have so many Options in what to do or where to Go. You're basicly free to do what ever you want. And dragons.. Need I really say more"
23187,Tod Howard.
23188,good game with grate mods but it takes work to get the og dlcs
23189,Still not finished in riverwood
23190,yes i like it
23191,"For anyone with a love of fantasy and have never played an Elder Scrolls Game, Skyrim is one of best games to introduce the world of Elder Scrolls to you. The mechanics are simpler than the much loved Oblivion, but it gets your foot in the door and helps the player experience the gameplay Elder Scrolls is known for. As for the story and the quests, Skyrim's open world leads to a realm of possibilities and I personally have a fond memory of it all. My recommendation? If you want to get into the Elder Scrolls series and don't know where to start, play Skyrim."
23192,One of the best or even the best RPG game that you can play in this century :)
23193,asdfghjk

23206,"It's real good. Hate that Bethesda decided to hide the original, at it is superior to the special edition due to having 5+ years more of mods made for it and that old 2011 low res charm."
23207,"Game is actually quite garbage, but it's a fun play."
23208,Fun
23209,Tamriel sandboxing is a fun way to waste your time
23210,"does one even need to read a review of Skyrim? if so id say you should go back and think to yourself, am i really a gamer? if you need to know about this game before playing odds are, your either a young babe coming of age and its your first rodeo, if so congrats mate, if not well then, what have you been doing since 2011?"
23211,this game is literally sooo good. omg. i cant even begin to describe the sheer pleasure this EXCELLENT game delivers to my gamer heart. for 200 ish hours i log on to the elder scrolls skyrim edition and ngl i lowkey buss a n*t every frickin time! its just dope
23212,one of the best rpg
23213,"I still haven't actually beaten this game on PC, modding scene so vibrant you can spend 200 hours fiddling and restarting

23215,Its pretty good for an indie dev

23230,A GOAT
23231,nice
23232,this game is better than my real life
23233,ALWAYS nice to come back to this game.
23234,"Apparently I've played Skyrim for 430 hours. So, yes, I guess I can recommend this game. :) 

My only regret about Skyrim is that I can't forget that I ever played it, just so I can play it again and everything is a surprise again. 

Oh, and the civil war stuff is a bit rubbish but I use mods to make that more entertaining these days."
23235,"Great game. Try it and you will love it.
The graphics are ageing but not bad at all.
Recommendation : 
There is a UI mod (SKYUI)... subscribe it. (also you might need to download Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE))
I hate the limited inventory... I think it kills the action... use the console command ""player.modav carryweight 5000"" unless you want an inventory management game."
23236,Very nice game
23237,GOOD
23238,"y e s

23256,"Since we already own The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim why should we pay for special edition? I purchased Red Faction: Guerrilla and when they made a remaster of the game I received a free copy of the remastered edition. So why should we, who already bought the game, pay once more?"
23257,"I'm a huge Elder Scrolls fan, have been since Morrowind. This game does improve upon Oblivion especially the leveling system and updated graphics. It'll be a long time before you run out of things to do."
23258,It is amazing and I love the side quests and open world
23259,It's Skyrim. What is not to like.
23260,It gitched and alduin just DIED OVER ME. 10/10
23261,The Quests and interactions.
23262,It's Skyrim god damn it
23263,yes
23264,Made *much* better with mods!
23265,Game is a classic
23266,Masterpiece.
23267,too good
23268,"i love this game, the variety of mods make it fantastic"
23269,"i've only played 26 hours, but they were the best waste of 26 hours i've ever had"
23270,It`s aight
23271,I've put hundreds of hours into Skyrim between all its editions. Very fun to kill some time in.
23272,"I've had many discussions about what I like best about Skyrim, and what I realize is what really has me coming back to this game is the love that other fans have given toward it, in the form of mods. I'd be remiss to neglect mentioning that the reason I started to play Elder Scrolls V in the first place was the ridiculous things that were possible through modifications... though as I started to take the game more seriously, my mod choices became much more serious as well. When I first started, I was adding things such as the Dovahbear mod, and exploding chickens.
In time, however, I was adding basic fixes like SkyUI and A Quality World Map. Then, after realizing how little I was caring about the beautiful locations in this game, I added Skyrim Wayshrines... and then, when I realized how dull the characters can be at times, I added the Interesting NPC's mod. The more and more I added, the less and less recognizable the game became from my first five hours of play. Having had discussions with friends, I've come to realize that the game I played was far separated from the game that he had played... and that's kind of the beauty of mods. 
If many of us were to play Skyrim in its vanilla state, many of us, I think, would be greatly disappointed by how lifeless and sparse a lot of the game can feel. Fields feel dead. Except for maybe the occasional NPC, most are utterly forgettable... and that is a disappointment admittedly. However, I can say that the game that I pieced together through download after download of modifications is one of the most engaging games I've ever played... most likely because through the help of talented mod authors, I was able to make it the perfect game for me. 
For that, I would recommend Skryim. Skyrim is by no means a perfect game, but with a little help from Nexus Mod Manager (because to be honest, I'm not that big a fan of the Steam Workshop), you can make this the perfect game for you. Look up a few guides. Look for mod YouTubers (as long as they don't have boobs in the thumbnails. Those ones are usually awful). They can help guide you to make this one of the best games you've ever played."
23273,we
23274,"it's really good game play 
"
23275,"pfft, if you dont know by now then you never will"
23276,"C'mon. You haven't heard of Skyrim?
Put the computer away and try something else. 
Maybe you have an ear for music.
Or Jazz."
23277,fun and old classic AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
23278,"Although The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim is a rushed and pretty flawed game, it manages to deliver an instant classic of a game with it's big open world and it's 3 amazing DLCs."
23279,good game
23280,"At this point, there shouldn't be a need to recommend this game to anyone. It's just one of those iconic games that every person should experience in their lifetime at least once."
23281,elder scwolls
23282,good
23283,Nice cock bro
23284,fuck you
23285,best game ever
23286,"Pretty fun, don't forget to use nexus mods for easier install and better quality than bethesda"

23291,It's Skyrim.
23292,hehehe mods make boobies go brrrrr
23293,more than good game
23294,actually played for 2k plus hours on xbox and game is awesome
23295,fun
23296,this game is so fun and it went past my expectations.
23297,good
23298,Dope game. Mods only make it better.
23299,The gameplay and expansive sprawling nature of the world that Bethesda has built gives the adventurer so much to work with. I have spent over two hundred hours on quests and sidequests and I am still not nearly done with the game. Very well done.
23300,do you really not know what this game is about yet
23301,"There is nothing quite like playing a game of Skyrim. The landscape, the quests, the enemies, and especially the music are all masterfully handcrafted and make for an enjoyable experience."
23302,awesome game enjoyed every minute of it
23303,Best game of all time. Until Elder Scrolls 6 hopefully comes out.
23304,.
23305,practicing social distancing by slaying dragons and using buckets to steal stuff...
23306,"good gam
"
23307,"Wonderful graphics, challenging game play, you can really get lost in the game for hours at a time, love the quests, the guilds, everything. Hunting, trapping, fishing everything!"
23308,Fun Game
23309,"Skyrim is the most playable of the ES games to date. The story is the most captivating, that I've played. The ability system is more accessible than previous experiences. Morrowind and Oblivion weren't strong examples of graphic capabilities--but Skyrim looks amazing. The game is improved in almost every way--and streamlined in the best ways."
23310,Great classic game!
23311,One of the best games of all time. Beautiful environments and music. The non-special edition version runs great on older computers.
23312,its ok
23313,Possibly the second best game ever made
23314,I really enjoyed the ability to choose. To play the game one way and then starting over and playing a completely different way is what I think makes a really great game.
23315,it's fire

FREAKING EPIC there is also funny sanik mod (He runs super funny fast lol) and magic too shoot fire balls that go like *WHAM* and *KASPLODE* or you can stealth like ninaja from ninjago or shoot with bow and kill from far away. WOWZERS what funny EPIC game defnitatly worth it great job mr Howards keep rereleasing it.

23352,"it's my lifeblood
"
23353,"I love playing this game! Unfortunately, I've never fully completed the game because I like to create new characters too often and then I just delete my old ones. This is a game that I always come back to as it is simple and easy to follow and you make it what you want."
23354,It's a masterpiece.
23355,"Great story line, good action, great with or without the DLCs but definitely recommend the extra money."
23356,Older but still gold. This is still my favorite game ever and with mods it seems it will never end
23357,"What I like about this game is that it has an open world, amazing missions and engaging story. I dislike nothing about it. I totally recommend it."

23363,One of the best 3 pc games ever made! This is how pc games should be! Money well spent!
23364,"I've played this for years.  Starting on the 360 and then moving to PC, I've lived through many different lives, choices and paths. its rare for a game to have such a replay value.  The music, the feel, the gameplay and environments are timeless."
23365,"This game may sometimes be ""clonky"" but otherwise this is an amazing game and if you have not gotten this game, trust me get it, it is one of the best games i have ever played but the beginning is very long."
23366,"It's the original - you can patch it to the eyebrows, and have a version of Skyrim that surpasses the later releases...and yet the cost is very good (it's a very old game now after all)."
23367,"Its a classic, such a great game, just wish they would make the 6th one."
23368,I got kill cause I yelled at a chicken -_-
23369,"It's Skyrim, what more do you need me to say? Base Game is a great experience already and here on PC it's even better due to modding. Skyrim Special Edition might be a better purchase however, because it comes with all of the DLC & upgraded base graphics"
23370,great gaming experience
23371,Haha dragon go brr
23372,"Every time I play, the sidequests and even main story line end up getting boring, yet I still keeping coming back to play. I don't know what about this game is so compelling. I almost want to disrecommend it due to how many hours I've spent playing. It's a very powerful escape. I may have formed a very real addiction more than once. When I've played more than an hour a day for several days, times of stress in my life will make me hallucinate the battle music playing."
23373,OK GOOGLE
23374,"After years of playing this on multiple systems and platforms the opening horse cart glitch just ruins it. I want to play a vanilla game from the start and after installing on a virgin system with NO MODS it still glitches and it makes the experience horrible. It's well known that there are ""fixes"" for this but nothing works just like so many others. I am finally abandoning this game and the idea of playing it on my brand new Alienware m15 R1, specs below. 

Overall game experience is fantastic and I have purchased this for the PS3, PS4, and standalone Win PC. I have the expansions and have played this modded but the prisoner cart glitch at the game opening is just too much.

23375,"ALL my PAID DLCs are gone. the ENTIRE game is now bugged. weird flushing/pulsing sounds, enemies that glitch through the air, NPC's that you cant interact with whether or not you have a quest. And because of the missing DLC's, EVERY item and skill is just gone POOF."
23376,it's a fun game just needs better overlays
23377,You know what it is.
23378,WOW what a way to pass your time
23379,"Almost 4 years since i first played Special Edition on PS4 and this is still one of the most enjoyable, immersive and re-playable games i've played with only 1 game (The Witcher 3) coming close to the feeling i get playing this.
If you're looking to play a game in this whole lock down situation going on, i highly recommend Skyrim."
23380,cool game
23381,"good game everyone should play at least once
"
23382,big
23383,I like the story and the open world
23384,"the game has so many quests and different things to do, it's a game for all kinds of players."
23385,"its gud
"
23386,"Amazing Game, okay graphics good story."
23387,"Very posittive
"
23388,AHH-MAZING-NESS
23389,This is one of the best games I ever played!
23390,One of the best game's ever made.
23391,Awesome experience. A couple of bugs here and there but cool overall.
23392,PERFECT
23393,Awesome.  One of the best games ever coded
23394,fun lots to explore
23395,"It's okay.

I know it's an older game and all, I still don't think it deserves 10s like people give it, it's more like a 7 vanilla with and added 3 when you can mod the game to how you like it. The ability to do what you like at your pace and when you feel like it is very refreshing. It's not something a whole lot of games do now these days."
23396,"Without mods: Huge and great
With mods: infinite and terrific"
23397,Love the game.
23398,"I'm getting back into it cause it's a great way to spend time for yourself, especially in the current state of the world... It's just massive, I found myself when I used to frequent Skyrim finding new things every time I played, even after essentially getting like 99% of the quests done."
23399,It's Skyrim.... why *Aren't* you playing this right now?!
23400,"There's only one way to play this game:

Sniper Khajiit with sneak on 100"
23401,"worst game ive ever played, loved it more than ever. made me remember my family this game is 10/10. i hate this game its my favorite game its really racist too i think."
23402,"its ok, i guess
"
23403,It's Skyrim.
23404,"best game evr bc mods....................
"
23405,"If you haven't played Skyrim yet I highly suggest you do. We're all stuck inside anyways.

Even if you don't like it there's tons of mods to shape it into a game you will like.

PS, don't kill chickens. You've been warned."
23406,Very good
23407,best game
23408,"this game is amazing, i highly recommend it it will always be one of the greats

23411,nice
23412,"i cumded on lydias tits once i swear dont vac banned me plz oh no i just got le banned, sad now i will seppuku epic style!"
23413,Hip hap huuu
23414,It's an okay game.
23415,A masterpiece. This game also shows again how a game can be kept alive if the community is able to create mods for a game.
23416,who doesn't like skyrim?
23417,gud game
23418,"Amazing classic game. Rich and beautiful world to explore, great lore, 10/10."
23419,An amazing open world full of adventure and wonder to get lost it.
23420,GOAT
23421,"Open Plains, Maze like caves, go anywhere, do anything, whats not to love... VR version on PC is AWESOME"
23422,hee hee funny geme
23423,It is Epic Female Dog.
23424,BEST GAME CHANGE MY MIND
23425,Best single player game I've ever played. Used to be a wow addict this broke me free.
23426,"Favorite gamme of all time
I don't recommend playing it without mods"
23427,One of those games you must own on PC you can usually always get it for the low low as well
23428,i think its ok
23429,"Tis Pretty good, Just wish there was a better way to install the dlc packs"
23430,its alright
23431,it good
23432,"My Personal Opinion, This is the reason why I play games. It's chill, lots of quests, constantly becoming stronger, better, more skilled, using magic, learning new shouts, a perfect adventure."
23433,qrw
23434,yes
23435,Can't go wrong with Skyrim. Can play it over and over and its always fun.
23436,Awesome
23437,Mod it until it crashes.
23438,10/10.
23439,This has literally been my favorite game ever since it came out. I cannot describe enough in detail as to how wonderful playing this game really is. It is worth the money.
23440,"very cool, very swag
"
23441,UEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGHAUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
23442,GREAT GAME LOVE THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS YOU CAN BECOME
23443,"Pretty stoked to be playing this - my dad was crazy about all of the Oblivion jams, but unfortunately never got the chance to play this one. Pretty sure he would also be playing this at midnight much like me XD

10/10 would bloody recommend"
23444,Scenery is stunning - gameplay is realistic - quests are well balanced.
23445,"198 hours and I have JUST finished the main quest...
still I have to find those gems and the dragon masks and...then there are the DLCs...

man this game is the real world...I dream about it.

11/10 never stop"
23446,Please help Todd has my family
23447,20/10 would glitch again
23448,good game
23449,"I probably should have recommended this game a while ago...

It is a major shame this specific version of the game can no longer be searched for to purchase.  I've truly enjoyed playing it from vanilla all the way up to heavily modded."
23450,A wonderful world space and game with so much  great extra  user made mod  content
23451,"I have been a huge sucker for this game ever since I started playing it years ago. My favorite type of game is ones where you get to do your own thing in your own time and that's why I love Skyrim. The map is huge, the quests are actually really fun and even if you get bored of the normal killing dragon thing there's a ton of really cool mods you can use to mix things up. It has a few kinks but all together I think the game wouldn't be what it was without them."
23452,Spend 1000+ hours on this
23453,hgftg
23454,"Well, at the time of writing this, I have almost 300 hrs on record. Had few playthroughs already. I am not even sure if writing reviews for this piece is necessary anymore. This is jewel. I played Morrowing, Oblivion, too. Skyrim really offers replayability and lots of specific quests and questlines for specific playstyles. The world is really big, there are so many quests and options and DLCs (which I understand are now part of the edition you can buy) expand it to a crazy level :) I truly recommend this game. BTW I bought this in retail on the day of release - 11/11/11 This game still got it. Not to mention many useful mods like better GUI/HUD, graphics, quests, characters...I used just a few (mainly the hud/GUI ones). As a usually generalist player it took me two playthroughts to try to specialiise and it makes things easier than trying to equally build all perks."
23455,"Kinda buggy, but an overall good game
"
23456,Muito interessante e envolvente.
23457,"Best game i swear
"
23458,good fun
23459,The Goat Game
23460,One of the best RPGs ever made without question. Simple in it gameplay but complex enough that you will being playing well into the hundreds of hours.
23461,"SKYRIM BEST GAME HEHE
I PLAY 120 HOURS SMACKING NAZEEM INTO DRAGONS WOOT WOOT"
23462,I never finished the main storyline. 10/10
23463,"""Its as wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle, but I really enjoy stomping in this puddle"" -Joseph Anderson

Its good but has problems. Mods make this game much much more enjoyable."
23464,"I'm high as a
[h1] kite [/h1]"
23465,very nice game
23466,the best game period
23467,Epic game!
23468,"As if this game needs another review. Get off the fence and get it already, you wanker."
23469,"yeah
"
23470,good
23471,"this game n its spiders are [spoiler] [b] THIC [/b] [/spoiler] <_< in all seriousness, if you haven't played this game you must either really hate bethesda like they murdered your dog. or you haven't heard of it. or you just don't like it... you do you. if you've never heard of it... buy it. right NOW. i've easily spent 4,000+ hours on console and well. [spoiler] yes i had no life as a child [/spoiler] my point is. this is a god dang good game. its been remastered as well. and has an amazing predecessor of a game, (oblivion) and if you liked that game. well think of this as an upgrade in every category. including the gir-. stop reading this review you've spent too much time already, and buy the damn game."
23472,"old love it
"
23473,"amazing
"
23474,Another brilliant addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise.
23475,If you want to have fantastical adventure where you have options and can see the consequences of your actions while wielding an enchanted weapon from the back of a horse or eventually a dragon go on endless adventures being benevolent or evil then  choose Skyrim. It provides hours of fun and you can do multiple play throughs and have endless fun
23476,It is just classic! With or without mods. In fact i have finished it without any mods. I am now replaying it to just see what the experience has to provide with mods on.
23477,Like an old story book. I keep coming back to it. Modding community keeps the game fresh.
23478,One of the best rpg's i ever played
23479,Great game... I mean I am pretty sure everyone already has like 3 copies of this game...
23480,Amazing game!
23481,"this game is realy fun even if it is confusing to find where you need to go or what mission is the next one and what is just side quest,
but at the end this game is realy fun and challanging"
23482,Cool game.
23483,good'
23484,It's ok
23485,yes
23486,fsfrg
23487,The best game ever created.
23488,Have you been to the cloud district? oh what am I saying of course you don't
23489,because the game is highly modable it just goes on forever.
23490,skyrim good
23491,Got me thru tough times  ggs
23492, Very playable for the money. I played it through once then tried all the different mods out there. Currently have about 500 hours and modders are still making content.
23493,"Very entertaining and infinite things that you can do.
"
23494,great
23495,"Great game, easy to get lost into"
23496,great way to kill time just make sure you can run the game
23497,Very  1st PC game. Love it
23498,dovakin
23499,"Who hasn't played Skyrim by now, let's by honest."
23500,Nice game
23501,Yes!
23502,yeet
23503,Great game
23504,"Still a fun game, though add mods for full enjoyment."
23505,Modding is awesome <3
23506,great without mods a real pain to do any mods here i dont have more than 9 mods and the game is constantly crashing
23507,I put naked women in game
23508,It's skyrim!
23509,"A game that is worth the try, at the very least."
23510,Stuff
23511,dank
23512,legendary games with a few bugs :D
23513,"Extremely poorly developed - crashes/freezes every time memory allocation exceeds 256mb, what's the point of the other memory partition then? Special Edition is much more stable, and that's a buggy mess in it's own right."
23514,The Greatest Game!
23515,a
23516,"a description is required, but no thank you. Great game just play it."
23517,Khajiit likes seeing other cats
23518,great
23519,'
23520,It`s Skyrim
23521,"Highly recommend
Best open world RPG's - Skyrim and Morrowind"
23522,10 out of 10 would skyrim again
23523,simply amazing.
23524,IT IS A GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME
23525," is good, much good"
23526,"Boring but worth it with mods
"
23527,"Aight idiots, listen up. I was a stupid face and ran this game on ultra high quality the first time back in 2012. Lagged like crazy, we're talking 1 frame every other 5 seconds. Played through tutorial somehow, didnt pay attention to the instructions though. Got out and restarted and set to lower graphics so game would run smoother. Didn't know how the questing system worked so I just ran around doing what ever for the first 100 hours. Got to lvl 41 when I actually started doing the story line. Finally got to big bad douche dragon and was a bit frightened as all friends in school said he was hard as rocks to beat. Gave him a lil nudge with an arrow and he fell down dead instantly."
23528,yes !
23529,"Love the graphics and freedom to do anything you want to in the game. The only issue I have is that even with a good computer, the game tends to crash a lot."
23530,"Mod it until it keeps crashing!

Would mod again!"
23531,unreal
23532,no longer on steam store
23533,Very fun with mods.
23534,this game will always be one of my favorites but I think it was really scummy to hide the dlc store listing so that people would be forced to buy the remastered edition.
23535,"Total freedom in game, mods make it even better"
23536,"""Never should've come here!""

""Must've been the wind."""
23537,Dragons
23538,"If you haven’t played this masterpiece yet... what are you waiting for? It’s a great continuation of the Elder Scrolls series that leaves a lot for the player to accomplish. The storyline will keep you busy for a week, the side quests will probably keep you busy for months. There is nothing you can’t do with this game!"
23539,"must have, explore the mods"
23540,badass open world game
23541,Just awesome!
23542,"One of the very few absolutely must have games.  Sure, there's a storyline, but, you really don't have to follow it.  The world of Skyrim is huge, and there's enough to keep you occupied that you don't have to play the main quest beyond just a few basics to get you started."
23543,Best game ever to this day. When does ES6 come out???? haha
23544,A Masterpiece
23545,"This cow should have been put to sleep a looooooong time ago.
May you soon find peace, you magnificent beast."
23546,"Bro just buy it, play it, try mods and then get yourself on drugs"
23547,"This game is excellent for learning the lore of the Elder Scrolls series.  There are several games in the series, but this is one of my favorites.  I'm totally addicted to The Elder Scrolls Online, and own quite a bit in the way of digital products from the game.  If you like digital products than I recommend The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim SE version.  Bethesda still makes addons for the game.  If you want to install your own mods, I do not recommend that version as Bethesda updates it constantly and messes up your mods for days at a time.  I recommend if you want mods you use the original Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.  You may find mods for this game using the app Vortex on https://www.nexusmods.com.  I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do.  I would definitely install the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.  It will fix some things that Bethesda overlooked.  Don't overmod your game.  You will spend more time modding than playing at that takes the fun out of it."
23548,Best game ever.
23549,It's Skyrim.
23550,"Decent main storyline, fun, too much to do. It's Skyrim what are you expecting? And ther's mods, so a must play."
23551,lmao its skyrim bro
23552,"Good game, even better with mods."
23553,classic
23554,"If you're somehow hesitant about this game at this point, i'm sorry for you
"
23555,"my favorite game of all time
"
23556,"This has by far the greatest replay value of any game before or after its existence that I've played. Also this game is best played to its fullest on the PC. It has inspired fantastic artwork, videos of all kinds and much more. it accumulated a vast community of millions of members not to mention its influence at Comicon. it also inspired people to make fan games(Total Conversions) such as Enderal, Skyblivion and Skywind. The Modding Community inspired new ideas for the Developers at Bethesda to implement into Other future titles as well. Lets hope we get another masterpiece in The Elder Scrolls Franchise."
23557,fuckin sick aye cunt
23558,dadadadada
23559,It's my favorite game. What more can I say boys?
23560,Easy to get lost in and never want to be found
23561,well its skyrim so
23562,I mean... It's Skyrim. What else can I say. 10/10
23563,"I came back to this game in 2020, and it feels brand new. With some addons of course. lots of content, great back story. It's a classic if you're into RPGs."
23564,FUS RU DAH
23565,My favorite rpg i have over 450 hours so I mean its good.
23566,LOVE This game but cant create a new character i have 0 mods on and the game refuses to work
23567,if you dont skyrim you dont life
23568,PLAY IT NOW!!!
23569,great game
23570,It's good to mod...vanilla is a lil bit trash tho
23571,Very much good!
23572,yer maw
23573,You can do so much. It's fun.
23574,"Probably one of, if not, the greatest game of all time"
23575,It's my third buying of this game and still fun to play and still makes me both scared and fascinated.
23576,good
23577,over 1000 hours
23578,Todd Howard forced me to buy this.
23579,God I love this game.
23580,"Skyrim is a really great game, Just don't over modify the game.  I haven't managed a full play through for customization of the game usually ends up making the game unplayable.  Then you have to start all over again.  But what little i did in the game i did enjoy."
23581,best game ever
23582,"This game is so fun I've literally played for so many hours. steam says I've played for 111 hours but I think its more lol
"
23583,I liek slayin the dragón
23584,Game good.  Like game.  Much play.
23585,"Ive had thousands of hours of fun with this on different platforms,
And while i really like the game as a simple action RPG, i dont think it deserves the title of the ""greatest RPG of all time"" or anything like that. You have very few choices, and those you have barely affect(if at all) the gameplay and ending of the game. You are also forced to be THE CHOSEN ONE on every playthrough, which is a draw for me. You cant play one playthrough WITHOUT being some godly creature that saves the world, sure you can ignore the main quest but then you are missing out on A LOT of content. If you want a game where your choices matter and there is more room for roleplay, try Fallout New Vegas, or maybe one of the older fallout games if you dont mind the turn based combat and old graphics. Its still a fun game with lots of varied builds you can make, but if you go in expecting the ""greatest RPG of all time"" you are going to be disappointed. I still wholeheartedly recommend this game, and if you havent played it you are missing out. The current price is a fine amount to pay."
23586,BEST GAME EVER
23587,"good game 
"
23588,"If you haven't played this game for the 200th time, you're not a real gamer. It's pretty good."
23589,Great game
23590,when you mod the crap out of this game it becomes stable and all the added stuff is good too.
23591,"When I can't figure out what to play, I come back to Skyrim. Before I owned a PC, I purchased the game on Xbox 360 and XB1 - I enjoyed it enough to buy it three separate times. Would definitely recommend. I hear dabbling in mods makes it even better, so that's my next plan."
23592,The BEST game in all of history
23593,best mfing game eva
23594,good shit
23595,Still feel Morro>Skyrim but good game nonetheless!
23596,It's okay.
23597,"just don't attack the chickens
"
23598,"Played it a bit, it's okay."
23599,A truly masterpiece in all senses.
23600,pay me
23601,"It's skyrim, if you aren't sure of what you are getting into hit up the youtube. Possibly one of the top 5 open-world RPG games of all time."
23602,Fus Ro Dah !!
23603,ive got 700 hours on this game on PC alone Best game ever
23604,b
23605,"best game all time hands down,"
23606,Everything an RPG should be. Loved it so much that I've bought it three times on three different platforms lmao
23607,"Bestest of all bestest games.

The most comprehensive review you'll find. You're welcome."
23608,Infinite gameplay and replay value
23609,Best Fantasy RPG I've ever seen.
23610,"Yes and yes ,"
23611,I love this game
23612,"I played through the whole game with theives guild armor, no cheats. 10/10"
23613,its very fun
23614,"The game without mods is pretty ok.  The ability to customize this sandbox-style RPG with so many mods is what makes this game legendary.  My favorite story mods are ""The Forgotten City"" and ""Vigilant""."
23615,Racist towards elves and I love it!!!
23616,I've been playing this game for over a decade and I can always come back to it for more nostalgic fun.
23617,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES i EVER PLAYED TO DATE.
23618,"after playing for this long, I can now say with absolute certainty that I want all 372 hours back."
23619,[i][h1]Best RPG one the Earth.[/h1][/i]
23620,Enjoyable open-world gameplay.
23621,yat
23622,"Despite the bug, still a good game."
23623,lOTS AND LOTS TO DO
23624,"The game that made Bethesda realize they're a brand now and can just slap the name Skyrim or Bethesda onto anything and it'll make them millions, so why bother putting effort into anything? I swear to god if they mess up TES6 i'm going to loose my shit. It took them the same amount of time to go from Morrowind to ESO as it is to go from Skyrim to the next game. This next game better literally suck my dick having to wait 14 years for it. Skyrims great though as long as you don't mind your google search bar being filled with how to fix bugs."
23625,its grrrrrrrrrreat!
23626,Can't beat a classic
23627,"This was the first game I ever bought for XBOX 360 when it came out, and I've been playing it on PC now off and on for a few years. Great way to relax and get lost in another world."
23628,"Greatest open world game I've ever played, Skyrim makes me come back for its thousands of different outcomes and character creation possibilities."
23629,Buggy as all can be but still fun until you take an arrow to the knee.
23630,So much nostalgia.
23631,Good game. Doesn't get old. Buy it.
23632,"The nostalgia is amazing, One of my favorite games. 10/10 recommend"
23633,I got a dragon friend :)
23634,"Epic

23646,gooooooooooooooooooood
23647,Instant classic game.

23650,Probably the best game you could ever invest in.
23651,this game is so old by now. dont need to recommend anything. people know its a excellent game
23652,Дибильно как то все
23653,i like fanny
23654,one of the best games ever made
23655,long as you enjoy playing skyrim and know where to get mods its very playable and replayable and unlike fallout4 it doesnt crash on you cept for the rae chance that a mod makes it crash. as for me this game has never crashed on me even with 119 mods installed most from workshop and some from nexus
23656,This is my new life
23657,yeet
23658,"Such a good game, so easy to get lost in for hours at a time."
23659,One of the best games ever.

23679,yes good game
23680,Mods r cool
23681,"Let's be honest, no one here is reading reviews like ""Should I get Skyrim? I don't know?"" It's Skyrim, at this point It's treason if you don't own it on every platform/console/account and have a mug dedicated to it even though we're all playing Fallout now or whatever"
23682,Can play for years with added mods.
23683,game is nice but requires effort
23684,masterpiece
23685,legendary game the kind you would get back to once 2-3 years
23686,the base game is good but stay away from modding.
23687,"A decent quest based game with dungeons, castles, towns, and challenges to occupy your time. Has a decent story line, but it can get a bit annoying when you branch off the main quests. Exploration: check, annoying npc's: check; Dragons, and Giants, and Zombies, oh my! lol < Still it's a pretty good game overall, and it has mods and add-ons available."
23688,Great game fun and when you use mods its even more fun
23689,"very fun, they need to remaster it and make it multiplayer"
23690,everyone knows this game is a top 10 game of all time
23691,"Good games, lots of monkeys"
23692,One of the best games on steam. Highly moddable and still played to this day by a very active community.
23693,arrow+knee= fuck
23694,Rocks...
23695,Never gets old.
23696,love the game. I haven't played in a years and when I came back to play it (starting over) I can't get off of it!!
23697,"I have over 1,200 hours of gameplay, so....you tell me. 

Seriously though, I measure every other game I play to Skyrim. The modding community is still active and therefore I can have a different game every playthrough. I just can't seem to get tired of this game. 
Mod it til it crashes!

23698,Probably the best open world RPG I've played. You'll get a lot of hours out of it.
23699,its good
23700,TOo good

[h1] A game that needs no introduction [/h1]

The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is the fifth main game in the Elder Scrolls series and, arguably, the best one up to date. Despite it's many flaws, this is a game that everyone, and I really mean, everyone comes back to at some point but you didn't need me to say that, you knew about all of this already.

The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is an open world Action RPG game that offers quite a lot of freedom. It takes place it the fantasy land of Skyrim. It's full of magic, wars, swords and bows, mythical creatures and anything a Lord of the Rings fan could ask for. You start the game off by creating your character and after the annoying tutorial section you are free to explore the world of Skyrim as you see fit. The game hosts a seemingly infinite amount of replayability, despite being very much finite. You can finish everything there is to do in this game but it would take you hundreds and hundreds of hours. Because of this, you will mostly likely just do whatever you feel comfortable doing in an Action RPG which is one of Skyrim's biggest draws.

[h1] FREEDOM! I won't let you down! [/h1]

While you don't do anything drastically different than in other games of this genera, the amount of freedom you get in Skyrim is truly staggering. You can play your character in quite a few different ways. You can be a tanky warrior, a frail but powerful magician or, what I always end up with, a stealthy rogue. Whichever way you choose, you can't go much wrong. 

Venture into the world of skyrim, complete quests, join a brotherhood, assassinate kings or do something completely different. If you want, you can murder everyone in the entire game or you can buy a house, get married and become a blacksmith.

[h1] Story? [/h1]

There is also the main quest about you being a descent of an ancient warrior but, even thought it is a cool questline, it's just not the main draw of this game.

With that said, Skyrim, as any other Elder Scrolls game (and any other Bethesda game) has it's share of problems. The combat in particular is the game's biggest problem. 
You play the game from a first person perspective and you attack by left or right clicking. This is very immersive but it's not the ideal. It works it's just not perfect.

[h1] An infestation of bugs [/h1]

There are also bugs a-plenty. Bethesda has become famous for releasing it's games with loads of bugs and technical issues. Sometimes these can really mess up your game to the point of not being able to continue which brings us to mods.

[h1] Mod until the game crashes [/h1]

If you find that your Skyrim experience is lacking in any sort of way, chances are that, someone has already created a mod to address your very concern. Do you want to drive a car in Skyrim? You can. How about a mod where instead of Dragons there are giant Thomas the tank engine trains? They got that too. If you can imagine it, someone has already done it or maybe you can make the next big mod in Skyrim.

[h1] Love it or hate it... you still love it [/h1]

Despite it's age, clunky nature and bugs we always come back to Skyrim because we forgive all of it's shortcoming simply because of the amount of freedom this game gives us and because of how much we can mod this game.

Skyrim isn't my favorite game of all time but I cannot deny it's charms. At worst, it's a game I don't like that I always come back to. At best, it's one of the most replayable and customizable  game of all time.

Next game: Eliza

23716,Buggy af which really ruins the flow and fun of the game.
23717,"Great game, don't know about the others so I can't compare but this one gave lots of fun, you can tell by the hours i've spent already playing it."
23718,ITS YOU MUST MOD IT
23719,Immersive gameplay in a Fantasy RPG format.
23720,skyrim SE is a waste of money just mod yur game lol
23721,this game is the king of open world role playing games.
23722,best game to EVER be created
23723,"never gets boring
"
23724,Im still building my house 10/10
23725,best game however wish it was not an online game with new versions
23726,"Played across Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Switch, and PC. Even though it released in late 2011 and I have played it consistently since that time, I still continue to find new things and interesting encounters. Starting to finally dip into PC mods. Great game."
23727,i have like 70 mods and the game crashes if i look at it wrong but goddammit i need my 4k buckets
23728,"Best single player game in the world.. hands down
"
23729,dragon fun yell shoot aaaaaaaaaaa
23730,Its good
23731,"I bought Skyrim a while ago, bu have only been able to play it recently. Although its technology might have gotten a bit outdated, regarding effects and animation, I still enjoy it a whole lot.

The game mechanics, the story, the atmosphere, they are all really nice. The character evolution mechanics is really awesome, you can really blend a lot of different abilities to create a unique gameplay. In fact, there are so many cool possibilities that you will catch yourself curious about other play styles and probably wanting to create multiple characters just to explore them (the replayability is quite good!). There are also multiple choices you can make regarding questlines, which also adds many other possibilities for roleplaying, if you are into that as I am.

The game itself can be long, but honestly I  have loved it. Will be one of my longstanding favorites for sure."
23732,"Imagine a sprawling world where you decide your own fate! Be the hero, villain or a bit of both. Tear the fabric of the universe with your awesome spells and incantations or shake the pillars of the Heavens with sheer brute strength. You can be a human, cat, lizard or become a blood-sucking fiend or bone-rending beast.
You choose whom to serve and whom to savage.
Join us in our quest for power, glory and domination!"
23733,My 2nd life!
23734,nice
23735,modding programming is piss poor
23736,WKD
23737,Just a buggy mess. Don't bother playing if you're on a 144hz monitor unless you want to download countless programs just to make the game run at 60fps.
23738,good game
23739,Naice
23740,What is there to say...
23741,nice
23742,Fus...ROH DAH! xD (  epic win )
23743,i havent played very much on this game maybe 5 mins or so but it feels like you get lost in the expanse of this game almost like you cant tell how long you have been playing but i would recomend this game 100% and after a playthrough add some mods thats what is known for after all <3
23744,Very good exploration
23745,one of the best and most addicting games I've ever played and I've been playing games for 11 years.
23746,"Its Skyrim, Nuff said."
23747,Massive game with many facets. Stunning graphics...impossible not to find something to like in this.
23748,This game is waky and if you mod it and cheat - it gets even wackier!!! Lots of fun. Kills time. Weight limit on inventory is annoying but you can cheat out of that too.
23749,"Love it since it came out on my birthday Nov 11th, 2011 on the 360, my close friend got it for me and I have played it for every platform including switch.  Highly underated and probably one of Bethesdas better games."
23750,"Epic Tale of mystery, adventure, and power. Steal and trade your way as a Merchant Bandit King, concoct poisons and control the elements, or curb stomp some NPC as a beef cake with some fully upgraded armor and enchantments. After you spend 500+ hrs doing every quest its time to hit the workshop with another 10000+ hours of community made content that comes equipped with vetted lore, spells, and items. Download them all to crash your pc or hand pick the best for an amazing customized experience."
23751,This is one of the few games I have a deep love for!!! Just about everyone I know plays or has played and will go back to playing in a heartbeat!!!
23752,"pain, agony even, suffering if you will, i'll still play it tho cause its Skyrim, every following generation will play this game. Doesn't change the fact that it's bad though. Recommended."
23753,"It's the coolest because people mod the hell out of it, and the storyline rules. Only downside, you can't get EXP from jumping."
23754,the best game i ever played love it 100%  to everyone to buy and play...
23755,So much fun
23756,Good game but I really want them to release 6 instead of making it playable on the PS5.
23757,"The game itself pretty fun, but mods make it 10x better"
23758,"pog
"
23759,"Awesome need a good graphics card to fully experience it
"
23760,THE BEST!
23761,"This game is an all time classic, needs to be played."
23762,"If you enjoy exploration and adventure, you'll enjoy this game. That said, it is broad as the ocean, but in terms of depth, spilling water on the floor will provide you with more, unless you like mods. Without mods, this game is mediocre, but if you manage to mod it, endless replay value abounds. Just try to ignore the fact that Bethesda has shown themselves to be greedy and lazy in a variety of ways (lookin' at you, Fallout 76). 

Again, adding mods that adjust the gameplay, such as SkyRe (Skyrim Redone) and the Community Uncapper is a great way to customize and radically alter the flow of combat and other aspects of Skyrim. Just make sure your machine can handle it, or you may find yourself stuttering and crashing.

All in all, I enjoy it when modded well. If interested, check out the Skyrim Nexus site for thousands of options."
23763,ok
23764,"I've liked all of the elder scrolls, sense I started playing. them"
23765,Waking up in Skyrim as the legendary Dragonborn has been the only constant in my life.
23766,"MAKE SURE TO BUY SPECIAL EDITION, NOT LEGENDARY EDITION. SPECIAL EDITION NO LONGER COMES WITH LEGENDARY EDITION AND THE MODS ARE 100% NOT WORTH IT!!!"
23767,"Gameplay: Its similar to previous elderscroll games. Its open world adventure with dragons, bandits, and animals to fight. You play as the dragonborn on a quest to save the world. The game has a ton of glitches but most of them are harmless/helpful and really fun. 

Graphics: As long as your not playing on ULTRA HIGH SUPER MEGA graphics with 10000 mods you shouldnt need a super computer to run this game. The game is really beautiful when played with max graphics and does require a good pc if you run it at high quality.

Pros:
-lots of gameplay
-choose your own adventure
-openworld exploration
-plenty of quests and characters 
-lots of customization from character looks to how you play
-tons of mods and modding support
-replayable
-on sale like every other day
-fun combat.

Cons:
-no multiplayer. There are some WIP mods for it.
-game is a bit old now so you might want to wait for the next elderscrolls.
-bugs can be annoying when playing this game
-can take forever to launch and especially longer with mods

Overall: Buy it and try it. Its one of the best games out there. If your not into singleplayer games this won't be your type of game. If you are into singleplayer open world adventures with plenty of content this is for you.  The game is practically on sale every month and for its price its worth it. There is plenty of dlc and mods for extra content if you finish the base game."
23768,good
23769,I replayed this game just so I could mod it and marry a hot goth vampire girl <3
23770,One of the best story in RPG ever.
23771,Fuck the special edition
23772,One of the greatest Store RP games made still to this date
23773,"
1"
23774,"Best RPG ever made, after Witcher 3."
23775,it's ok
23776,"Honestly if your not sure about buying Skyrim after all these years, IDEK what to tell you."
23777,"Legitimate review this time, I haven't played skyrim in the past 4 years after spending countless hours on it. I doubt I will ever return to the game as i have experienced everything but if there ever is a chance I will take it immediately. Skyrim will forever be in my heart and embedded into my mind as a great game, everything that I remember about this game is blissful; I wish i could play it like the first time and experience it all over again, I love Skyrim and it has left its mark on me as an enjoyable game."
23778,Just as absolute classic. Unbelievable that I still find myself getting lost in this game in 2020.
23779,"good

23789,skyrim good.
23790,I have always loved the skyrim games and now that i own it on PC i can add mods i like. GO IMPERIALS. F the stormcloaks
23791,great modding community. new mods everyday to customize game and have current graphics.
23792,all time great
23793,"Saw a draugur walking on it's head. 10/10. Would buy every time it gets released. Again. Thanks, Todd."
23794,It's skyrim. Just mod it until it crashes. Then you cry. Then you attempt to fix it. Then you fail miserably and you have this crashed unforgiving mess that is supposed to be Skyrim but surpassed that eons ago. Then you uninstall and the process starts over again. 10/10 would play again.
23795,"Great graphics, quests are great, in-game choices are realistic as a role playing game with option to buy a horse, a house and even to invest in businesses."
23796,All I know to tell you is to buy it.
23797,:)
23798,As old as this game is I still keep returning to play it over  and over...
23799,Pretty good game.
23800,yes
23801,"A ginormous open world, numerous tasks, abilities, books, story lines, it's always cool to come back. Great job!"
23802,"fight,orcs,dragon, nice game"
23803,a good game for the money. It is vast and challenging
23804,Should have stopped at 420.
23805,Class game apart from if you play on 144hz then yeah the game is unplayable :/
23806,my thuum is better than my english
23807,"I have played a bit of this game. I have a life! Im being honest!
For real though, the MODS make this game 100% better, since i have around a 100."
23808,One of the best RPG's the industry has to offer.
23809,Best game ever made.
23810,I spent more time modding this game than I ever did playing it.
23811,modded skyrim is the perfect time sink
23812,A fun game with random events and a huge world to explore
23813,"I've played for a bit, seems cool."
23814,"nice
"
23815,Wonderful Game!
23816,Noice
23817,"""You've played for 158 hours, would you recommend this game to other players?"" 
That's not including the time I've put in on consoles. 

All hail Skyrim"
23818,Better than some ****** ubisoft  game
23819,Yes.
23820,"There's not much new to add to the conversation. It's Skyrim. Endlessly explorable, endlessly moddable, there's a reason Todd Howard is going to re-release this game on every console for the foreseeable future. It's fun, pure and simple."
23821,Very good game! I love it.
23822,"For the 15th time, i tried to not be a sneak thief.

I am another sneak thief, but also a first time home buyer.
"
23823,"You go with a trip to another city to find one… you find 10 other NPCs, who give you so many quests that by the time you go with the main quest your power level is over 9000"
23824,"I started out being blown away by this game. The beautiful landscapes, the absolute freedom to do anything you want, the many many disciplines to master, the ability to work your way to the top of, or destroy entire organizations - it's all very intriguing and had me playing nonstop. 

But the bugs... Oh my GOD the bugs and crashes. Not even just one kind of crash, no - there are crashes that just shut down the game and you gotta open it up again. Then there is the screen freeze, computer screaming in agony full on meltdown, but the worst kind of crash is the one that just deletes your saves. And most of the time that one happens, it's not just one save - it deletes all your recent quick and autosaves, so if you don't have hard saves to fall back to, you are boned. 

The bugs are varied, there are a lot of them, but nothing game breaking. Arrows flying through people without hitting them, shops being closed when they are supposed to be opened, myriads of quest specific bugs - there are work-arounds for almost all of these. Just shoot another arrow, re-enter the area where the merchant is to unlock the door, look up the quest bugs online where thousands of community members are very happy to help in any way they can. 

If you can stomach that, there is actually a very nice game underneath. All the beautifully designed corners of Skyrim, and funny random people to interact with are really very enjoyable. After 120 hours of playtime it was me going up that mountain to fight through a horde of enemies, to talk to that dude that takes forever to teach me something, and leads me to another dude that talks forever (really nice conversation actually just really lengthy), when all of a sudden the computer goes EEEAHHRHRRHRGHGHHHH again, and the last 2 hours of playtime are just gone, that really cemented my decision to not recommend this game."
23825,"I really loved the game, you cant go wrong with this one."
23826,"Skyrim is a classic. It's part of modern culture now, and has been for years. It's just that good."
23827,game bad
23828,"It's great.
The side quests are interesting and worth spending time doing."
23829,This game is somehow so fucking shit yet i keep fucking playing it help me please
23830,"You thought this was a review, but it was a trap, its me, your Godd Howard.

Buy skyrim you little shit and I will let your parents go alive.
AND GET FALLOUT 76 TOO! You have 7 days to send me the money."
23831,Shallow writing and lazily made but a fun play experience overall.
23832,"It's an extremely shallow game. Quests repeat over and over with different characters. It's another ""expansive world"" that fills itself with copy paste quests that mean nothing to the overall gameplay nor story"
23833,"I bought & played it on release in 2011.  Built my first gaming PC for it.  In hind sight I've got to say all of it was worth it.  I realize I didn't review it at the time so here it is.

They botched the PC menus to make it easily traversed by a console player.  But a few mods fixed that.  Aside from that it was a solid game.  State of the art graphics for its time and many graphics overhaul mods have come out since then to make it better. I have a little over 70 hours in game and I consider it worth it.  (Beating the main quest just to get Storm Call is worth it)"
23834,"One of the best Elder Scrolls I have played, so far. I recommend this game to any rpg fan."
23835,good mods yes
23836,it was fun until i realized you couldn't kill 90% of the NPCs. recommended with mods.
23837,Had trouble even taking off & getting in the air-
23838,Great game and tons of fun mods!
23839,Absolutely awesome!!  Great step up from Oblivion!
23840,"you know this game. i know this game. ive spent well over 1000 hours on this game between the xbox 360, the xbox one, and my PS4. its a great game, and moving to pc was the best choice i made, and now with workshop mods its the best possible way to play. just do it, buy the fricken game. do it. DO IT."
23841,"On any platform, be it xBox 360, PS4, or PC, I am able to delve dee[ into the game time after time
"
23842,It's Skyrim. What do I really have to say?
23843,"Come on, it's Skyrim. Why isn't this game in your library already? It's so good, it still gets ported to modern systems, even VR. Hundreds of quests, items, things to do, sights to see, hours to spend. Plus the incredible modding community takes this game to a whole new level. Like I said, buy it already.
Here's a quick tip: If you're just looking for a fun, Skyrim experience, buy the remastered edition. If you're looking for the modded Skyrim experience, buy this version. Skyrim:SE doesn't have anywhere near the level of a modding community that Oldrim does."
23844,"Old, but gold."
23845,"todd howard told me to buy skyrim so i did and it was pretty good
"
23846,One of my top 5 favorites
23847,"Not much needs to be said about this game, tons of reviews have already been written for it. It's a great game, you should buy it because it's legendary."
23848,Best game ever
23849,"Goanna's are yummy
yum yum yum"
23850,"Only recommending this game because I know how much of an impact it has had on the gaming community, and it definitely isn't a bad game at all. Personally prefer the story, side-questing, and general world of Oblivion more."
23851,"This should be said, I don't like Bethesda as a company. They have destroyed their name, and any good will they had has been burned for the sake of quick money. But this game is just to important to let my opinion of the company get in the way of recommending it. 

While I recommend this game to pretty much anyone, this is the perfect game for those: new to playing video games, who haven't played an RPG before, or don't care very much for fantasy. 

First RPG I ever played, and there was no better way to start. This game is famous for many good reasons: It's a lighter RPG with insane amounts of stuff to do in an awe-inspiring world. I'm sure the more dedicated fandom of the Elder Scrolls was disappointed on release. But this is easily one of the best games ever made when taken at face value. The modding scene, while i give no credit to the developers, takes this game from a solid 8 to a 10. Again, no credit to the devs (Bethesda). But with modding you can alter, fix, and refine the game to be exactly what you want."
23852,game good

23857,if you play it with a bunch of sex mods its pretty nice as long as it doesn't crash every 5 minutes

23879,Played for 650 hours. Still fun.
23880,A game that will be forever timeless and fun with its fan base!
23881,It was good
23882,"It's not an awful game per say, it's just after years of playing on Pc and Console I can definitely say that Skyrim is as vast as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. In saying this however, I have a lot of nostalgia towards the game itself and that definitely affects my views on it.  It's a great starter RPG but once you've played better titles of the same genre this game's appeal really decreases 
"
23883,"Bah!  Play it, you'll see"
23884,"Everything to say's been said, just great, massive world, nigh unlimited quests, fantastic plots, even if it's a touch old now.  Go enjoy the epic a thousand times over."
23885,Skyrim for your Ti-84 Calculator coming soon
23886,i have thousands upon thousands of hours on this game
23887,"It's Skyrim, you'd have to be insane to not love this game."
23888,GG
23889,"There is a great deal to do, and your character is almost 100% your own to craft and shape.  Beware focusing too much too soon on non-combat skills, and know that there are some builds that just really, really need that extra potion/smithing support right around the time your gear needs upgrading (so don't neglect them), but otherwise doing as you like is really pretty easy.  That said... this game seriously lacks a sense of purpose (there is technically a Main Story Quest but it is functionally no different than the hundreds of other quests you can get, so it isn't exactly a priority unless you deliberately make it one, and even then there is just zero urgency to it; heck, you don't even have to do it at all!), which for players like myself leads eventually to an aimless kind of burnout, but that is just the trade-off for the world literally being your oyster.  Just like glitches and clipping are trade-offs for the massive, GORGEOUS world chock full of interact-able items, mobs, and NPCs.  Honestly, the shear beauty of this game alone (minus character/NPC design, which jarringly fugly compared to the rest of the world; OMG, designers, seriously!), is worth buying and playing it for a few hundred hours."
23890,Good story and gameplay
23891,lot of fun =)
23892,"https://youtu.be/ItYrPmt8iQY

My primary motivation to play Bethesda games or similar RPGs (If you call skyrim a ""True"" RPG) is because of the modular element/Moddability , the make-your-own-adventure and the platform for creative role-play ideas/engagement. Call it a ""disease"" but In 10 years I have been unable to create my ""Ideal"" Immersive environment to proceed with the main quest line because of various factors of Optimization vs Hardware vs Visual Appeal. I don't enjoy the Elder Scrolls ""Lore"" which i believe is solid but still not my cup of tea as that's not the driving factor for me in the series but the way you interact with the environment, pick up the mugs, sit and stand, crouch n sneak, have a bed to rest, sharpen your blade, relax in a tavern, craft stuff;  those things. Needless to say I also enjoy the Fallout series for the same reasons and not the ""Rpg"" elements concerning story progression and dialog, though they are also good thing to have and this game has the greatest modding community!"
23893,Tom Howard if you're reading this make it so that you can ride the dragon thank you
23894,the GOAT.
23895,"One of the best games of all time. Played this game a long time ago, but still find myself coming back for another game after all these years. Skyrim does something for me that other RPG' can't."
23896,Very nice game
23897,"
"
23898,is good.
23899,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of those classic games that you can't miss. If you do not have this in your library what are you waiting for? Ive played for 116 hours and still have so much of the quests to play through and finish. You wanna buy a house craft potions and have a drink at your local inn? You can do that! Starting to get the itch to fight dragons explore a cave with a book about a sword then go and grab that very sword? you can do that too! there is no limit to what you can do, and with mods there is tons of options of expanding and having such a fun time overall. The game has some bugs and The A.i is pretty bad when it comes to your followers getting in door ways but that's nothing a force shout or commanding them to move to a different spot can't fix."
23900,"You will start and when you check the time it will be 3 hours later
"
23901,yes
23902,"Pretty good for such an old game, thought tbh the only thing keeping this game alive for me is the active modding community."
23903,A classic
23904,One of the best RPG's of all time. Would recommend.
23905,"This is an okay, but overrated game. At first there is quite a lot things player can  do - exploration, studying alchemy, doing multiple quests. Sadly the game becomes boring after 10 hours of gameplay. The main story is uninspiring, unmature and is full of fantasy cliches, the same is true for most of the quests, and the majority of things you do does not change the world even a bit. The character progression is simplified, there is no physical parameters or good variety of skills. Instead of this there is a perk tree with 1/3 useless perks like lockpicking. Seriously, I've never seen a lock I was unable to pick any lock in this game, so why bother spending skill points on lockpicking skills? There are 4 or 5 types of dungeon environment in the game, all the dungeon maps are rail-like corridors so when I've been about to finish the game, I've been just running them through, ignoring the enemies. This is true for irritating dragon encounters as well, I had been avoided fighting these flying gators, prefering to ignore them. So the main problrm of the game: it is too simplyfied and is lacking interesting gameplay mechanics. It is isn't an RPG game at all, it is more like FarCry in pseudo-medieval setting. No interesting character progression, no choices that matter or change anything. As I said, the game can be entertaining for the first 10 hours."
23906,Mods....
23907,asdf
23908,lots to do i like to play it dnd style for each character

[spoiler] I recommend visiting the greybeards before doing anything else. [/spoiler]

thumbs up, Bethesda."
23914,BEST GAME EVER
23915,Pretty good.
23916,"I highly recommend this game to anyone who is into fantasy open world games. The game is a bit slow in the beginning, but once you get in you will get addicted. The story is pretty short but it makes up the lack of story with it's side quest, and the side quest are pretty well done, especially if you are doing guild quest, such as Dark brotherhood, College of Winterhold and etc. The vanilla game does getting boring after many hours of playing, so if you are playing on PC, I highly recommend using mods, it significantly increases excitement when playing, from new magic and combat all the way down to new story quest and etc. All around Skyrim has a lot of freedom in terms of you can be almost anything you want, with the help of mods you can most likely be anything you want."
23917,"excellent graphics

23947,good
23948,"Beautiful game, epic story, worthy of Elder Scrolls. 'Nuff said."
23949,is great
23950,"This game is sort of like a GTA game...after slaying lots of dragons, becoming master of the Thieft Guild, Listener of thr Mother, Archmage of the College of Winterhold, leader of the Companions, Thane of all Holds, a bard, a hero of a civil war, Deadric champion, a werewolf, a vampire lord, killing several vampires, vamipires slayers, undead Nords, orcish bandits screaming that Skyrim belongs to the Nords, dragon cultists, funny blue goblins and other ugly mofos and doing all of that crazy stuff I got bored, so I built a house, got married, adopted a child, hung up with friends in an inn and lived happily ever after"
23951,My favorite game
23952,"Even after all these years probably one of the best single player RPGs out there, a milestone. Totally still playing this in 2020, especially with the exhaustive modding scene this gem can look up to date even today. 10/10"
23953,"This game is fun but don't expect it to be as good as its predecessors. Characters are shallow, dislikable, annoying and two dimensional. The world revolves around you as the ""chosen one"". Characters don't have their own routines and personalities like Oblivion. Your decisions have no weight, and the main story feels rushed. Mod functionality is great however and can make it pretty good but no game should require mods to be able to stand up on its own. At the price of the game plus DLC I cannot recommend it. If you can find the Legendary or Special editions cheap then go for it. But the game isn't as good as Oblivion in my opinion.

Not to mention it's incredibly unstable and crashes often with tons of bugs.

The soundtrack however (still by Jeremy Soule) is amazing. The game has both completely original tracks and re-imaginings of tracks from Oblivion. The game features stunning vistas but these can be spoiled by the horrible shader that gives the game a cooler look (the FXAA mod adds a warmer image and makes it look better, however I am reviewing the base game) 

The civil war plotline is fun and has great battles with dozens of soldiers and you can invade cities. Fighting and hunting dragons is an amazingly fun aspect of the game and is one of my favourite activities. I haven't completed the DLC's but they're pretty good so far. Not worth the high price. Two annoying things spoil Dawnguard for me. Serana, a follower you can't get rid of till you complete her quests, and vampire attacks that you can't control that keep killing civilians.

Overall with mods it can be turned into whatever you want and improve the base game but Bethesda shouldn't have to rely on mods to have good games. I will not let mods affect my rating so I am still going with not recomended. If you are a huge Elder Scrolls fan I would buy it but not as this edition."
23954,yeah its nice
23955,"This game is perfect. Came out nearly 10 years ago and it has withheld its greatness through the test of time indefinitely. I cannot stress how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. Bethesda always goes above and beyond with all of their installments of The Elder Scrolls and, after playing the sh*t out of this one, I cannot wait to see what's in store for the next.

23956,I have put over 600 hours into this game across three platforms. It is an awesome game I always find myself coming back to.
23957,good
23958,is good yes
23959,The skyrim games are all great tbh.
23960,"Does this game need any more praise in 2020? It's pop culture at this point.

Just great all over, made my teenage years amazing, still play it today"
23961,The Best game of the century.
23962,It just works
23963,It's skyrim bro what do you think
23964,it gud
23965,Fun
23966,"Although it says 53 hours I've played much more than this before I had a steam account. Yeah, the game is older than quite a few Steam users, but I'm older than Steam and more crotchety. Having joined Elder Scrolls with Daggerfall I've visited this world for many an hour. This game is the most arcade of them to its release date and in bad ways as well. The play experience is smooth with melee combat only an issue with Bandit Leaders' having a high critical strike rate which insta-kills you (as it ought to). The world feels dead. You can become Archmage, Speaker of the Dark Brotherhood and Leader of the Fighters' Guild but no minions or strategic decision making powers. It's like your achievements are only titular. Yet, the flash and fanfare make up for the dead world. Yet, with all that said, this game has a great musical score by Jeremy Soule; for the win."
23967,awesome game
23968,"Always a classic, I wish Bethesda would release a sequel to Skyrim in the not so distant future. This has definitely been a great game for them as has all of their others, sad to see they have not kept the ball rolling on the elder scrolls story besides the MMO. The MMO is fun but it will never beat the joy I get from playing this game."
23969,"Infinitely replayable because of the superb and huge number of mods available.   Good open world, decently interesting quests and excellent voice acting."
23970,"this game is amazing
it also causes an addiction i played appr. 8 hours in 2 days
i highly recommend it to anyone who like RPG style games"

23982,wtf this isnt the special edition
23983,Very good
23984,there does not seem to be any way to get the dlc unless i buy the new super mega edition for $40 when i just want the dlcs

23986,On xbox I have over 40 days of playtime. It's ok I guess
23987,It's Skyrim.  You're already playing it.
23988,"Honestly, this game is definitely one of the games I have played. I certainly think it is a game, although most people disagree with that."
23989,good game would play if ur not homosextual
23990,Bruh its fucking skyrim who doesnt love this game maybe a fucking retard but thay dont count amiright... if u have lived this long and havent played this game through at least 5 times u should eat a bullet.    bitch.
23991,Cool.
23992,Good game.
23993,"Skyrim is one of the best RPG games of all time. It's also one of the most buggy, glitchy, and broken games I've ever had the joy and pain of playing. I played through it on PS3 where I had hundreds of hours and I only touched this version of the game for 2 hours just to see what the upgrades were in the better version of the game. Its not much but still good. This is a must play game even if it is a buggy pile of trash. We all love it like a red headed step child."
23994,"O que dizer de um jogo desse, um marco no mundo dos games, um jogo tão fantástico que tem mais versões pra mais sistemas do que Tetris?

É bacaninha. Acho que você vai curtir.

Talvez. Sei lá."
23995,"great game
"
23996,shits cool
23997,Best for now.
23998,"This game by itself is already pretty good. It has a lot of variety, mechanics, and tons of quests to do. When I first played this game I was a bit overwhelmed, but after a while of learning, it got a lot better. I suggest first time players (if there are any first time players left, I am very, very late on playing this game) play the game without mods and then later add mods to help with areas that you don't like about the game. If you are a first time player and immediately download tons of mods without even an hour of playtime like me, you'll feel extremely overwhelmed. GLHF!"
23999,"I have purchased this game 4 times and I do not regret each time I have purchased it because this game is the definition of perfection.

I've never thought while playing this game that it is ""Time to end this little game!"" or that I ""Never should have come here!"".

If you choose to purchase this sensational RPG experience please consider the following:
[list]
[*]Do not progress the main quest line until you are at least 20 hours in.
[*]Stay away from Markarth at all costs.
[*]If you have the aptitude, you should join the Mage's College in Winterhold.
[*]Contrary to popular belief, Grelod the Kind is not kind.
[*]We know
[*]There is nothing more satisfying than backstabbing a Khajiit for 30x damage.
[*]Hail Sithis!
[/list]
Please buy this game if you haven't already maybe even buy it again if you already have it just to be safe.

 it has Legendary difficulty and skills so??"

24054,good game.
24055,"Not my favorite Bethesda game by any means, It is prettier than Oblivion but its story isn't as good IMO and getting around the game map can be a nightmare at times. Has some strange flaws, you start the game as a God basically, kind of the same problems with Fallout 4 and getting Power Armor right off the bat. Magic seems really weak for some reason. Fighting a dragon for the first few times is cool then it gets really old. Anybody can look at the amount of hours I've put into this game, playing it and the DLC's and I have NOT ONCE made it through the entire game without a game breaking glitch. Never seen the ending to the game while playing it and I'm still giving it a thumbs up, that should say something."
24056,"Simply, one of the greatest video games ever made.  The game itself is great, but the thousands and thousands of mods to the game make it legendary."
24057,"A highly recommended for anyone who has not played before i have pushed many hours into this game on many consoles and have not been bored yet so much to do lots of weapon spells and crating to do as well as plenty of quests to complete a very slow paced game depending on what you do if you play the main story or even just completing side quest's.

Great game for adventure and open world exploration with magic and story.

It'd be a lot cooler if you did though."

24100,"Great game, Stands the test of time. Very mod friendly and probably the best RPG video game ever made"
24101,its skyrim
24102,I haven't finished.
24103,It's great... As long as you murder Nazeem early on
24104,mmmmm yes... very good
24105,Shut up and take my life :D
24106,"never ending battles and never ending story
"
24107,IT IS AWESOME!
24108,epic
24109,you don't really need to understand why i recommend you to get skyrim most likely you already have it so shut up and go play once more
24110,Very good I like it
24111,Best gam 11/3.14159
24112,It's Skyrim. Why are you even looking at the reviews?
24113,"amazing
"
24114,very agood
24115,"This game is too perfect ...

I hope Bethesda will not hide this game anymore.

If you wanted to buy this game, i suggest to buy Skyrim Legendary Edition CD key from trusted seller than buy in steam."
24116,"Be careful with the modding, it can get out of control real fast."
24117,LIT AF
24118,very gud
24119,Thank you Tod
24120,stonks
24121,10/10 would be launched into the air by a giant again
24122,I'm dusting this off to come back for the co-op mod. Hoping for the best. Was super fun solo though.
24123,i am so high right now
24124,Best game ever. still playing
24125,"dont like the Nords accent, but its a really cool game to play, beginning is a bit slow but you will be playing it foe AGES so worth the wait"
24126,I'm senoir Chang i'm so ill this is a warning i cant be killed
24127,Best game ever. I cannot find another game like it.
24128,tis good
24129,.
24130,Skyrim.
24131,Best RPG hands down
24132,"This is a game that practically formed my gaming preferences. As a kid, my parents couldn't buy a game like this for me to play, so I downloaded it from a pirate website. I must have played 1000 hrs or more. Now, I can pay for it but I don't have the computer needed to run the f**king Special Edition Bethesda is pushing. So I have to find the old Skyrim (that isn't listed) and buy that one for half the price the new one but without DLC's. And if I want those DLC's I have to pay 3x the price of the new one. And why? Because I can't pay for a great setup. I'm honestly dissapointed in Bethesda. I expected better."
24133,i mean dude it's skyrim
24134,"It can be fun until you realize the game is the most watered down elder scrolls experience. The map is fun to explore until you realize that every dungeon is copy and pasted. The amount of original landscape starts to dwindle heavily after two or three caves. The story is a super generic ""your the chosen one"" plot and every quest really makes you think that it is all handed to you and nothing is actually earned. People really love the side quests but 90% of it is fetch quests and the other 10% is just gaudy flair with no substance. 10/10 IGN Gamespot and Gamer score"
24135,yes
24136,"It's Skyrim, enough said."
24137,102503684
24138,"YES,PURE YES SO ADDICYVE ITS LIKE COCAINE,MUST BUY
"
24139,It's a great game. You will likely not notice as the hours disappear.
24140,f
24141,Given my hours I think Ill leave my review here. The game is amazing and a game I would highly recommend for anyone especially people who enjoy it to be more open ended.
24142,Fun
24143,the best game for the corona times
24144,The game is just too good everything is perfect on it!!! also f*ck the mountains I always die when trying to climb them to continue the story but it's still a sick game!!!!
24145,fun game
24146,"I have not played this game in some time now but it is still one of my all time favorites. Great open world, great visual displays, and fun game play."
24147,Best
24148,"Despite hundreds of hours playing this, I've yet to complete the main story. I went into this game having only played one other Elder Scrolls title, that being Oblivion which I enjoyed, and I had high hopes for this game. Initially I was blown away by Skyrim but after the novelty fades, I found myself criticising many aspects of it. That's not to say that it's a bad experience, just that their is room for improvement, contrary to the opinions of many casual gamers. Overall, Skyrim is a fantastic gaming experience that most competing open-world, fantasy, role-playing games can't live up to.

Pros:
Very replayable
Good character creation
Vast, dense map
A plethora of free user-made mods available
Rich and interesting lore

Cons:
Streamlined for casual gamers (this applies to The Elder Scrolls series post-Morrowind)
Reward system is kind of lacklustre
Can be clippy and buggy at times as is the nature of massive open-world games
Dragons often pose less of a threat than sabre-tooth cats, giants, trolls, bears, and even some human characters"
24149,very nice jes
24150,9.8/10
24151,skyrim is a classic its hard not to enjoy
24152,"Yep.  DLing it years later to play again... yep.  RECOMMENDED, BROS AND BRAS AND OTHERS. <3"
24153,AWESOME
24154,best game ever
24155,"Very Nice
"
24156,is gud
24157,It's ok.
24158,great game
24159,"Great base game, with all the addons made by the community the game is constantly different and fun"
24160,good
24161,FUC YES BISH
24162,"Amazing in every way, but the only downside is that they don't do much updates, nor they are bringing new sequels to the game, just some new platforms or gameplays.
otherwise, the best game I may have played for a long time."
24163,"Its skyrim. The possibilities are endless. Plenty of quests to keep you busy but for fuck sake, dont join the blades."
24164,It just works
24165,food
24166,The Best! (Title of my sex tape)
24167,I could dedicate a lifetime to Skyrim and still find enjoyment in all of its glory
24168,yes fun
24169,"Bought this game 11.11.2011 as a CD and probably played up to 500 hours over the years. Sadly I lost my 10 year old Steam account after not playing for a long time and had to make a new one. At first I tried to rebuy some games but quickly realised that Oldrim was hidden on steam so I just bought the special edition. However I recently wanted to revisit Oldrim so I had to get it from a keyreselling website. I played almost all of the Bethesda games and I really like all of them, but it's honestly how Bethesda tried to resell skyrim like 15 times"
24170,12/10 would recommend
24171,its not the most graphical game in the world but thats due to its age but i have spent so many hours just playing this game i love it and have played through it many times and will continue to play this game as many times as possible lets not forget the sheer amount of mods available to make th game different each time trust me if you can play this game then you should
24172,s
24173,"one of the best games that I've played!
"
24174,I'm sure you've read hundreds of positive reviews. Mine wouldn't make an outstanding contribution. Skyrim is simply an amazing game.
24175,I've been playing this game for almost 10 years.  Love it.
24176,"Good Game . Classic ,  you cannot beat this pure perfection of about 95% (-5% for slight bugs and such due to it being an older game) packed with endless content would recommend this , but once the new elder scrolls is released in the year 9000 i hope it is just as good if not better then skyrim"
24177,I'm not someone who loves doing side quests but I enjoyed the game either way. I still feel bad about the horse  and dog of mine that I accidentally killed. Sorry you guys.
24178,"i love it
"
24179,I like everything about this game.
24180,9.9/10 Second only to Morrowind
24181,Among the Greatest Games ever made without a doubt.
24182,"Near endless hours of fun. I don't even mess with mods and we have hours upon hours played. Shows it age at this point but the environments are still pretty amazing to explore. Combat is decent, a bit janky at times. I wish the spell system was better but does not ruin the game. Get it on sale as it is pretty cheap these days."
24183,"Epic graphics, epic story"
24184,"Its Skyrim, need I really say more?"
24185,Skyrim is a must-have game in everyone's library as it adds so much content with the use of mods that makes every playthrough exciting.
24186,"In a game where you can go wherever you want and do whatever you please, it's hard not to get bored eventually. Skyrim staves off that boredom with far too many mods."
24187,Best single player game especially with mods.
24188,tem nem oq falar né
24189,It's an incredible game
24190,skyarim
24191,the best ever
24192,"Love this game!
Endless wonderful hours of wandering aimlessly through the world, fractal climbing on my mountain-goat horse. Made it to the top of the throat of the world ignoring the Greybeards. Forgot about the main story-line quest, but I was the leader of the thieves' guild, had all the Daedric artifacts and all the houses available. And this was before any of the DLC. (love them too).
Planned on starting a new character as a two-handed sword-wielding heavy armour wearer? 6hrs later I'm a sneaky, shooty, occasionally fire-ball using leather wearer. Ah well. Onto the next one!
HATE THE SPIDERS. My only complaint is those stupid spiders. 10/10 on the ""Oh God augh!"" scale."
24193,Its Skyrim what else do you need to know?
24194,"It's so immersive! It almost feels like you're playing a movie.  There's so much that you can do! In my first couple of hours of playing, I apparently discovered 3 or 4 things that my BF who has been playing this for a while didn't know about."
24195,very good game
24196,its alright
24197,my name baalgruf i have big balls and my ass breathes fire!
24198,Does it even need saying?
24199,On and off playing for years. You gotta at least have the modded bug fixes tho.
24200,yes
24201,"Mods Mods Mods, what more do you want???"
24202,Fun as heck!
24203,I love this game 10/10 would recommend.
24204,After many years still one of the best games ever <3
24205,i love the gaem
24206,good :)
24207,Is great game
24208,"Ive played this game on various consoles since its release and i have to say, the PC version is the best. Never before have i been able to fight Thomas the tank engine with Obama's help while it rains crabs. 10 out of 10"
24209,very fun game
24210,good game
24211,absolutly love this game 10/10
24212,One of my fave games which i have on every other platform.
24213,It's cool but I wish there more children to punch
24214,guud
24215,Love the peaceful nature scenery and ambience music and sounds.
24216,"1st play through: normal with few mods
2nd play through: discover modding and go ham with awesome character mods like Inigo, Recorder and Sofia
3rd: semi serious playthrough. Did not complete
4th: Testing out mods with new quest
5th: LOAD UP ALL THE S*X MODS"
24217,OH GOD TODD HOWARD WHY DID YOU LET MY CART RIDE TURN INTO SKYRIM SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAM?!!? WHY DID YOU MAKE MY SIMPLE RIDE TO MY DEATH TURN INTO 4 LONG YEARS OF ORBITING THE KNOWN GALAXY? WHY!!!
24218,Its Skyrim.
24219,a few hours into into it and i love it! Great game love the dynamics and myriad options for quest and storylines.
24220,Masterpiece
24221,"very expansive, lots to do and in the short time I played I found the charm of the game so many others love"
24222,its skyrim duh
24223,this is the best game in the history of games
24224,"Amazing game. So many options, a""free"" game. Youre not guided by anything, you just wander through the open world how you like. The people reactions or graphics are amazing, if you look its from 2011. You can choose your playstyle, sneaky or loud and dumb, you can cast spells and shouts or just smash everything and everybody (even more when you got Heartfire lol)"
24225,Fun Game.
24226,It just works
24227,is good yes
24228,"Skyrim. Didn't you buy Skyrim yet?...what are you waiting for, mate?. Do it!"
24229,Its so lit brah
24230,fun
24231,"good game all my life
"
24232,fun lots of questlines and stories
24233,awesome
24234,Best game ever made.
24235,LOVE IT
24236,i shouldnt have bought the CD version cus i lost it
24237,"Game of the decade, not up for debate."
24238,A total classic no more descriptions needed here...
24239,"My college roommate introduced me to this game in 2012 (on PS3 originally, have played 1000 hrs of wait load screens alone.) It totally ruined my life, which led to me becoming a fat slob, which led to embarking on a journey of health improvement and self discovery, which led to meeting my wife. 10/10 would recommend to any single guys needing to really finish the job destroying themselves so they can then become the man they need to be."
24240,mods are fun
24241,"oh yeah, skyrim, also know as ""the game sucks but i don't have standards and i play it for the bugs and mods ""
so basically it sucks c0ck and balls and penis and nuts and maybe d1ck and balls."
24242,"it good
"
24243,better than fallout
24244,dogshit
24245,its awes
24246,Unplayable without mods
24247,"very fun and good storyline and choices but you also have a open world if that doesnt interest you definitly need to try workshop mods it adds even more to this content packed game
"
24248,Dis game gud
24249,"Top 5 game ever at release, still fantastic years after !"
24250,One of the milestone for the RPGs.
24251,"Dragon man, good game."
24252,I love everything about this game and the different aspects of it because there is always a quest waiting for you when you load into the game and that just makes me discover more context to past quests or the quest i'm doing now.
24253,"Obviously a new classic at this point, waiting patiently for the next one."
24254,This game has been played for over a decade for a reason.
24255,it fun
24256,amazing
24257,"Just buy it, damn it!"
24258,"It all started when Skyrim came onto the building next to me, I journeyed through the lands of Westeros to find the secret Targaryen, I saw things... the king got the daylights kicked out of him by a boar so I ran north, big mistake it got cold. Then saw a guy get burned at the stake, that was just weird. I decided to go and study but saw some fat dude peel gray skin off some poor sod. Then I witnessed the darkest fight I’ve ever seen, well I didn’t see it because it was just dark! Then some cripple became king, what a disaster this is! 


Wait this game is t breaking bad..."
24259,good
24260,nice
24261,pretty good actually
24262,Possibly one of the buggiest games ever but a ton of content
24263,Best game ever!!  :)
24264,"its skyrim, what can I say"
24265,Its fuckin skyrim
24266,Best game ever
24267,FUS RO DAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24268,yes
24269,"The open World play is great to play in, yes it does have it's limit but it's huge. and so many ways to take your Character. I've played through many times and still find things I missed , mostly by playing my Character in a different way. Still playing , still having fun."
24270,LOVE IT
24271,Thousands of hours of play available.
24272,if you love an open world experience with a killer story and graphics then this game is for you
24273,pretty good.
24274,Immersive AF
24275,One of the greatest!!
24276,One of THE best games ever.
24277,its good
24278,Its skyrim
24279,Best game i have ever played!
24280,"Isn't as good with what came before it, but it's still TES in every sense of the way."
24281,Nice
24282,good
24283,"Get a ""fishing job"" from Delvin and stole an item from my wife."
24284,gd
24285,I am going to start off by saying that my review is very bias as I have a childhood attachment to The Elder Scrolls. I will also put it out there that the year is 2020 and bethesda has seemingly fallen from their golden age. Skyrim was most probably the last great thing bethesda released. I liked fallout 4 a lot however bethesda got lazy with it and it was very apparent. Then fallout 76 which is something I won't post about here. My point is that Skyrim is probably going to be the last TRUE epic RPG game that we will get the way the industry is looking. But here is the kick to it when you buy this game you aren't just getting skyrim and all of it's DLC but you're diving into an entirely different world a sort of society of people that never cross other's minds. This is the modding community. Skyrim is a decade old now and the graphics show but you can easily use programs from nexus mods to download over a billion different files. This game will look better that any other game you can think of if you make it. You are buying an arsenal of games that will last you a lifetime whenever you buy this game. It's not a great game for its story or its combat or even its rpg systems but what does make it a great game is it's versatility and its ability to adapt and change to fit any single person's needs whenever they may need it. You can do anything from turn the game into a souls like experience to making it a survival game. The list is unending. Save yourself the trouble and get this game. It's always easy to fall back on.
24286,its skyrim you know skyrim
24287,"Great game played it on consoles Xbox and PS4. Really great storyline, a lot of alternative choices to quests. Choose your way of fighting (mage,warrior etc.) All and all great game, awesome storyline I come back to this game all the time"
24288,Yeah not bad
24289,"dogshit
"
24290,"atmospheric setting, plenty of opportunity to explore, and a good development of story. The quests are not tedious for the most part and the skill system is a distinct improvement on Elder Scrolls IV:Oblivion. Archery (which I really enjoy and which you don't tend to get in cRPGs) is actually a viable choice unlike in previous ES games where it was quickly underpowered. The metalwork crafting system is still not particularly useful (unlike potion making) but you will need to develop it for some quests. As is often the case, unique magical weapons and armour are always going to be better than an item you can craft yourself. However with an early focus on metalworking and enchanting you may find it more use than if you crack on with other skills and come to those ones later. You really have complete freedom on how to build your character and which skills to practice as there are no ""classes"". For this reason the game has plenty of re-playability and with some quests offering alternative completion paths (or choices so to speak) coming back to the game and playing with a different character is worth doing."
24291,"Classic, nice classic"
24292,"Played it for a bit, it was fun... Then i discovered mods and well, lets just say that things happened."
24293,"I faced him fearlessly, my fate inescapable, yet my honor unstained, can Ulfric say the same?"
24294,"The vanilla version is quite good; but it's getting better all the time with mods. 
"
24295,"if you have bought this game and don't find it fun, just install as much mods to make it fun"
24296,It is Skyrim...
24297,gd
24298,Love it and Ultimate Skyrim is the best modpack ever made for any game
24299,good

I think everybody has already said everything about Skyrim. You can love it, you can hate it, you can ignore it, but for some reasons, Skyrim was one of the games which could survive and become just simply unavoidable. Til I'm waiting for the fridge port of the game (and maybe Elder Scrolls 6 in this lifetime), one thing will remain be certain, this game will always take a very special place in my heart. It's ultra rare, when the combination of art design, level design and music can be so harmonic together - maybe I loved merely roving during my playtime much more than completing quests."
24301,10/10
24302,"Best game I've ever played, PERIOD!"
24303,such arrogance to take for yourself the name of dovah
24304,its Skyrim what do i have to say
24305,"Play the game, be the Dovahkin. Slay dragons,kill Nazeem maybe friq with random NPC hehe you know what im sayin? Skyrim is an absolute masterpiece, Good job Todd."
24306,Unique. The best fantasy game I have played so far.
24307,"its skyrim if you havent played yet you suck 
"
24308,Very good gsane
24309,An RPG classic. The immersive world is one to replay over and over. And now with mods there is improvement to the game week after week. The fun is almost inexhaustable even after 750+ hours.
24310,"Although the quests are no Oblivion, the graphics and music are amazing. This is my 4th system I have played through - first time on PS3 when it was first released. The Elder Scrolls franchise is pretty much the only thing we ever play anymore - can't beat the quality. Obviously Skyrim is really old now but it's still kicking!"
24311,yes good
24312,yo this game is banging 10/10 ign
24313,
24314,Got drunk in a pub with a stranger and woke up the next day being told I stole a sheep from a giant.  10/10.
24315,One of my favorite games ever!
24316,one of the best RPG of all time.  Modding community keeps the game fresh after YEARS.
24317,THIS GAME IS SICK
24318,"so basically
it just works
its ok i guess i never completed the main quest i spent my life on side quests"
24319,yeah its a good game
24320,Slaps with mods. Ok without them.
24321,"Skyrim is one of the best Elder Scrolls I've ever played and now I've got it on PC, its beautiful and i love it more than I did the first time I set eyes on that game"
24322,one of the best game i ever played! i got over 300 hours on xbox 360 and it never get old! i recommend it to everyone
24323,that's a great game!!!
24324,"You want to know what this game is? This is your absolute nightmare because you cant stop playing until you have mastered all quests <3 Its the game of the decade and without a doubt the most special one in this century so far. 

First of all you have an easy gameplay, a nice story with so much decisions and everone has another outcome, so much space in the beautiful designed world of skyrim and also the graphics (pls buy the HD version, it heatens up the game so much) are undescribeable. 
There is also so much space for individual designs of your character, your equipment and the game in total with so much space for mods and DLCs which i would recommend to you as well.

If you want my opinion: buy it! you will not regret!

All in all it is 10/10 and there is no game coming close to it in this category"
24325,"After hours of modding this game, playing through this power fantasy simulator, I have done many things. I have been hero going from town to town rescuing citizens and fighting crime. I have been a assassin that murdered the highest elite in Skyrim and took charge of the brotherhood, and then forgot that I had an over 1000 gold bounty in solitude when I was out buying bread for my orphan daughter that I kinda stole (Its complicated). I have been a begger, who begged for every penny he had while contributing nothing to the economy except plague and being a skooma dealer. I have been a champion in the theives guild, while being the worst pickpocket in history (Thats what happens when you recruit a mage from the guild that was just looking for the gloves that gave a bonus to your unarmed) And the list goes on, and even the stuff I have written out doesn't do it justice. And in these multiple adventures, I have only beaten Alduin once, and to be honest, it felt like any other mission at the point. However with a simple mod, I was able to make it the most bad*** fight ever. So I would say the games worth it, and it is worth even more when you add mods. Now if you will excuse me, I gotta go fight another thomas the tank engine while riding my Tommy Wiseau"

24344,"I love this game and all of its quirks. I have played this game since it first came out and I will never stop playing it. I love all of the bugs, the cheats, the easter eggs, everything and then some."
24345,
24346,This one's pretty good.
24347,"Amazing game - very deep and flexible, wast open world, great music, monsters that are actually scary, good plot, decent graphics. I have spent hundreds of hours playing and will play more."
24348,Even though some times this game is an absolute shit show this is probably one of my favorite games on earth I mean it just works
24349,"IT IS SKYRIM, DO YOU EVEN NEED A BETTER REASON ?"
24350,Its a good game but its pretty grindy at the same time.
24351,"Very good game, changable. many things to discover."
24352,n/a
24353,I wish there were fewer things to do..
24354,Good shit
24355,whooooo
24356,holds up 9 years later
24357,Yes
24358,"very fun if you like the midevil fantasy genre of books and other media, will be playing more."
24359,Honestly one of the best and most customizable games out there.
24360,"What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?  Skyrim is one of the most amazing, insanely huge games EVER, with so much to continually do and fight, and build (if you have the Hearthfire DLC).  I love SKYRIM!!!!!!  FUS RO DA!!!!!"
24361,"It's cool, wish is was on more platforms though"
24362,they declared war on me because i punched a chicken

24368,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
24369,"Still playing this game. Amazing storytelling, graphics and fight mechanics."
24370,AWESOME
24371,good
24372,"If you haven't heard of this game by now, I would be very surprised. This is one of the best fantasy adventure rpgs of all time and it will draw you in for countless hours of entertainment. It does have its flaws but it makes up for it in the huge modding community to make this game even more enjoyable. I have about the same amount of hours on this game as I do for the console version and I still haven't completed all of the quests or even invested that much into modding it. This is a must have for anyone wishing to get into gaming."
24373,"Obviously not my first outing with the game. My first time playing was being a kid and at my older cousins, anyway no sappy stuff so quick story so fucking nostalgic, and mods just make it even better for everyone and i mean for everyone. My sum of hourson this is possibly about 6000? and it wasn't until i got this on PC is used mods, I've 100% this plenty of times, and just have to say its really worth the time, or just play when you're bored it'll pass time so well."
24374,Do it
24375,There's a reason this game is still popular.
24376,"AWESOME
"
24377,A million games in one.  The perfect game for all.
24378,It's an okay game. Good for a couple hours of gameplay.
24379,GG
24380,"crush my cock with a rock I must.

maximum pain i must endure.

ok
here we go...."
24381,One of the best games I've ever played.
24382,"This is one of the best RPGs ever created.  It's a straightforward open-world adventure, where you can be and do practically anything you like.  The main storyline is good, and there are perhaps a hundred or more side quests.  There is also a ton of exploration you can do.  The modding community is strong, and a lot of first rate content has been created by players since this game's release.  We are all waiting for ESVI, but if you haven't played SKYRIM, it's a must."
24383,Addictive 10/1
24384,It's just an awesome game no cap
24385,hny b
24386,Very good Re-playability.
24387,"best. game. ever.
"
24388,What else do I need to say?
24389,"One of the best games in my personal opinion, lots of side quests and the main story is super fun. The DLC's add even more to a game that was already great too"
24390,It's great to have a vidyia that happens to be not violent to the extreme and very personal to me and others i like it.
24391,"I played this game to death and it's still fun to play with a new perspective each time. Funny thing is I only completed the main quest once.  Although I usually did the same character type every playthrough, the land of Skyrim much like Morrowind is varied and diverse that it's always a surprise to go through the same dungeon and find a portion that you've never seen before or missed out on a weapon that wasn't there before. The quests themselves aren't too interesting, though they have really improved with dawnguard and dragonborn dlcs. Though my favorite quest was Blood on The Ice, and my favorite dungeon was labyrinthian."
24392,ye
24393,Duh
24394,"Fun game, Even better with mods"
24395,"its skyrim
"
24396,"Always Awesome, never boredom! =D"
24397,"A very good RPG single player game, played it on all consoles and on pc. Very good.

Also in Vr it is very cool."
24398,"idk I guess I couldn't really get into it, but I see how others could play it for a while"
24399,yep
24400,"cool fun dragons wow
"
24401,"This is the first Elder Scrolls game I've played. Its been in my library for years but i always avoided it because so many of my gaming friends disappeared for months when they started to play it. 

Now I know why :) 

Skyrim is huge, full of lore, packed with quests and has a superb storyline. Its very easy to get lost in it :) 

Sure its buggy. NPC's get lost or stuck. Missions get buggy if you collect mission items while exploring before the missions are active. ALT-Tab'ing out to answer messages regularly crashes the game - BUT honestly all those are simply minor annoyances compared with the pleasure I've had playing Skyrim.

Highly recommended 8/10 :)"
24402,"lets be honest. one of the best games, if not the best released in the 2000s era"
24403,I AM ADDICTED TO RACE MENU CHARACTER CREATION.
24404,"Best Game Ever?
NO DOUBT"
24405,It's Skyrim. Need I say more?
24406,"Gud Game
"
24407,it will never end!!

24409,da real fantasy !
24410,"Good
"
24411,This has been a fantastic game. I have hours playing and exploring. The Entire Elder Scrolls has been worth the money I have payed for this games over the year. Also the Community that has developed around this game is amazing is so many ways adding so many new ways to enjoy Skyrim with expanded areas to explore.
24412,"fun
"
24413,The game came out in 2011 and is still one of the best RPG games ever made. Would recommend.

24419,so GUD
24420,masterpiece
24421,I love this game so much. I have spent hours playing and still not finished it. I love the fact you can traverse the Skyrim world as much as you like with very little restrictions. I love the landscapes and the visuals most of all. The story is ace also. I just wish i had a VR headset so I could completely immerse myself into it.
24422,good
24423,"FFS it's Skyrim, how much else do I need to tell you?"
24424,Awesome game!

Would definitely recommend if you're pursuing a career in aerodynamics

"
24439,ncie
24440,"I have been playing this for over 1000 hours and it could go on forever! I started with Daggerfall, then Arena , tried Redguard, and loved Oblivion! And Morrowwind. I like that you can find literally thousands of mods mostly for free. I am also a Boomer! Not crazy about online games as you run into nasty people who are protected by their anonymity to curse you out for their failures. World of Tanks was fun but too many of those. I like fighting the AI. Actually I was a real soldier deployed in Iraq when I discovered Elder Scrolls. Enjoy this game!"
24441,this game makes you feel like bethesta.
24442,"Mod it, play it, break it, fix it, start all over again. You learn a lot playing the game"
24443,...it's Skyrim!
24444,good
24445,best game ever
24446,tis great
24447,This will be a classic in its Genre
24448,"Skyrim is a great game that brings together pretty much all the (good) things you would expect in an open world rpg. 
even in 2020 the game has aged amazingly well and mods introduce quite a bit more content on top of that. Just get the game if you haven't already. :)"
24449,"The hours speak for themselves. If you are obsessed with being a powerhouse in a vast rpg world with plenty of stuff to do, this is the game. Mods, mods, mods. This game has it's flaws but as long as you are good at immersing yourself you should be good."
24450,"love all the content in the original game, as well as the DLCs and many MODS available.  i am about to start my 4th play-through with some new MODS ."
24451,fuck nazeem
24452,"Get lost, in a good way."
24453,"Hell Yeah

24458,Very immersive game total fun
24459,.

24464,good game no need to explain
24465,addicting

24479,"play the game+dlc for 100 hours and still find new stuff to do, play for another 200 and you might think you are done with the game but then you say mods are a thing and your friends and family dont see you anymore."
24480,very good.
24481,great game
24482,Still one of the best PC games out there
24483,omg so good
24484,"I have had this game for years and I can't say I haven't enjoyed it, but it runs poorly on newer hardware. I was also forced to buy special edition once i reached the ram limit with my mods."
24485,"I think my hour count pretty much says it.

Mod, it changes the game.."
24486,"C'mon. You know what Skyrim is by now. You know what they've all got to say about it. You just have to give it a shot and see for yourself. I don't regret a single second of this game, and I'm betting you won't either. That is if you don't kill Nazeem as soon as you meet the smug miserable bastard."
24487,69
24488,One of the greatest games of all time
24489,Perfection in all ways
24490,Best game in the history of games
24491,Skyrim is just awesome.

24494,"Completed 100% playthrough on my PS4 (all side quests and miscellaneous quests as well as all perks and weapons and armors) and even after thousands upon thousands of hours across all consoles, I still never get tired of this game. Masterpiece"
24495,"If you want to lose yourself in a game-world for hours on end, play this game.  If you want an RPG with countless hours of choices, combat, looting, exploring, and thievery, play this game.  If you want amazing music with sonorous vocals, play this game.  Just play it, you'll only regret all the time you lose in a day. :)"
24496,"Real short, limited replayability..."
24497,it does a fun
24498,BEST RPG EVER!! BRING ON ES VI !!!!
24499,Days lost to an imaginary world. What's not to love?
24500,meh
24501,"obviously this game is a masterpiece, there's a reason it's on literally every platform"
24502,"Endless and iconic open world, what more can you ask for? A great soundtrack? They've got that too."
24503,nEvEr sHoUlD hAvE cOmE hErE!
24504,why is this unlisted
24505,Best game of all time.

24508,It's okay
24509,Great story
24510,I snek man. I Sneak all over place. Snek approve.
24511,"It's a classic. That's really all there is. Not the best RPG, Cyberpunk 2077 is probably gonna get that honor, but certainly a fun one with lots of replay value. Also cheap af! Well worth the value."
24512,Odds on I kill Narfi
24513,skyrim is good vimeo gaem
24514,It's pretty good
24515,must have
24516,Duh...
24517,"Skyrim is one of the best games ever made, it allows you freedom and the world is deep with adventure and lore. the modding community not only seems to respect the lore but also adds to it. The only problem with this game is that it is so hard to find now that the newest edition is out. Though this version is bare bones there's so much more to this game, pick it up if you can, it runs really well on older computers."
24518,"skryim good
"
24519,What to say about my favourite game?
24520,E
24521,This game is really fun because every time you start a new game with a new character the map is generated a little different.  So you don't always get the same game.  It makes it so you have hours of entertainment and  a game that keeps you guessing.  There are so many quest lines and smaller quests to play that the story line keeps you very entertained.  I love this game.
24522,i love skyrim i have hundreds of hours on my xbox 360 as well as on the PC. The games leveling system is exellent the soundtrack is amazing the world is engaging a stunning but over time you feel the NPC's in the game are just npc's what you say in the game doesn't matter in like 80% of diologe
24523,It's ok
24524,Do I even need to write a review?
24525,"Its Fun and involving

24538,Best Game ever so far!!!
24539,I've been playing games since I was about 8.  I'm now 39 and this is quite possibly the best game I ever played
24540,"A classic game with a very rich modding community. Though there are certainly games I love more than Skyrim, this game is one of those timeless games I frequently revisit every now and then. Maybe a little bit overated but certainly not bad - Skyrim belong to the Nords!"
24541,veri gud game
24542,It just works
24543,"It's Skyrim. It's cool when it's modded. It's just as cool when it's vanilla, but you don't get green trees in Riften."

24584,one of those games you must play during your lifetime
24585,THIS IS THE BEST FUCKIN GAME EVER
24586,I <3 the graphics :) game play and overall the game enviroment :)
24587,Years after its initial release and I still find myself coming back to this game constantly. Very well made.
24588,great
24589,good
24590,"God okay so here's why you should play Skyrim, There's not been a game in my life as impacting as Skyrim. I have over all consoles a 1,300 hour streak and have 100% it twice over, it's been over 9 years now and i can say without a shadow of a doubt this game never loses it's appeal. It's a classic in ever sense of the word, the combat is simple and nice, the story is simple yet the lore is so deep, the environments are beautiful (can be even enhanced with mods), over all the game has kept it's value. HELL even the glitches at this point are a staple in the game's hilarity at times, its a melting pot of good lore and fun game play, WHILE ALSO BEING BROKEN AS SHIT, AND YOU CAN MOD IT TO ALL HELL TO HAVE MORE FUN.

So if you genuinely want to play it, grab it, your PC can most definitely run it as its old. 
Live your dreams and have fun, I know I'm never gonna stop playing and loving this game."
24591,Have a problem with an ancient dragon? Old-arse priest? Random Guard? Fruit? Just shout all your troubles away - just like real life.
24592,"I have owned this game 3 times on different consoles and on PC, and I have played countless hours on all 3 combined and I still haven't completed it! Don't let that put you off, you won't regret a single wonderful hour you will spend in this rich world, there is so much to do and explore. There is a reason they have re-released it multiple times, it's a classic, and if you are one of the few people who haven't tried it yet? What are you waiting for?! Remember there is a grannie on YouTube who plays this constantly, so no matter your skill level, there is something for you here."
24593,sick game
24594,This game was my childhood I love the medevil senery and for its age its fantastic leaving you through amazing quest and adventure and modding is also great. GET IT.
24595,The open world is amazing!!
24596,Yes
24597,Top notch
24598,"Pros: Great immersive game, great story line, numerous quests, you get your money's worth, pretty good graphics, many mods out there

Con: eats up you time/life"
24599,Love it i am not a huge gamer but my husband introduced me to this game and i can pay it for hours and not get bored.
24600,"Hmmm i could play one of my 450+ steam games.....

Or i could mod the shit out of skyrim and put another 100 hours in.....


What to do....."

24602, f
24603,"excellent game, very worthwhile of putting many hours into."
24604,Great game. Recommend more people to play orcs this game really flushes out how respectable they can be.  Alot more Stoic than Nords.
24605,"It's Skyrim, you know what it is already"
24606,I have zero mods on this game and I can't even get through the intro let alone play the game. Once the horse pulling my cart actually died!

24616,I like this more than special edition because Id prefer cool features more than cool graphics
24617,It's Skyrim. It's great. Play it.
24618,You already know what Skyrim is. You probably already own multiple copies. Why are you even reading these? Todd Howard is a lizardman in human skin trying to profit off of the foreskin industry.
24619,"Fun, and very entertaining"

AMAZING GAME! cannot go wrong buying this."
24631,"Fuck this game. Over half of the hours I've spent on this game have been me raging at how broken it is and me trying to fix it. The few times I have been able to play I get bored and start a new save only to do all of it over again and again. Fuck this game. Nah just playing, get this game."
24632,Quite possibly the greatest game of all time. Truly spectacular. Does not need any introduction.
24633,Such a classic
24634,Probably one of the best games ever made. Mods only make a good game even better.
24635,"I love this game. It is a ton of fun, even now years from its launch, I play it often"
24636,"Not as good as Oblivion, but still exceptional.
"
24637,"Best game ever, so much content and impossible to ever finish. Perfect for getting you through isolation thanks COVID-19..."
24638,"The best-worst RPG I've ever played. I started playing Skyrim on console and put hundreds of hours into it there before coming to PC, and honestly I think (without mods) this game is better with a controller than with MnK. 

The core storyline of Skyrim is... eh? It's interesting, but Skyrim is a game you end up enjoying for the journey. It's approachable systems have a lot of flaws that you realize after playing the game a lot, but its a very easy game to get into and end up addicted to.

The games art feels somewhat dated by now and I would definitely recommend downloading some mods to alter the appearance as you get into it, along with ""Live another Life"" if you end up wanting to create multiple characters over time."
24639,It's okay.
24640,Awesome game...been playing for a long time and just keep going back and playing more..
24641,
24642,fucking amazing rpg that will show you an adventure so great you might find a cure for coronavirus on the way
24643,It gud
24644,Love Screaming At People.
24645,yes yes yes love the game. lots to do in game and can have mods
24646,"Very immersive, great for escapism."
24647,best way to kill the you can't go out of your house time. its a real time machine.
24648,"Sure, there are bugs and glitches. It's for the memes! Loads of fun with an open world sandbox. There's always something you haven't done in this game."
24649,"Die Dragons, die!"
24650,BIG YES
24651,"good game, with flaws"
24652,ad
24653,ye it's good i guess.
24654,"This game's story has aged gracefully, and there is more stuff to do in this game than you could ever imagine, not to mention an ever so active modding community that takes this game to all new levels."
24655,"Is it worth the money? YES! Is the DLC's bring a very good story-line that attracts to the player, YES! 

There is so many endless quests, dungeons, caves, so much to explore, it's gonna take you at least 500+ hours to explore, this game doesn't get anymore challenging than any other RPG game. The game rewards you in some ways, but also in some it punishes you, but its enough to make it a fair challenge for the game and the player. If you have not grabbed Skyrim yet, all I have to say to you is? WHAT IN EMPIRE ARE YOU THINKING? GRAB IT!"
24656,h
24657,"Not as good as the other in the series as a base game but a lot more flexible with mods which makes it a hell of a lot more fun so base game like 5/10 with the right mods 11/10. I recommend some texture mods as the base game looks a bit dry followed with some new content. Use the nexus for finding mods and on the rare occasion
the steam workshop has some good ones too."
24658,skyrim 10/10
24659,"Best Elder Scrolls out there. I prefer it over the Online elder Scrolls for the way you level up and the method if creating and enchanting items. Also, it is nice being able to into any dungeon without having to have a party of others to play with. I like playing solo whenever and wherever I want. Can't do that in the online version."
24660,good naked female Khajiit mods
24661,.
24662,This game was so ahead of its time. Still a great game to this day.
24663,"When you think you could be a anything, but find yourself sneaking and using a bow 

1000/10 

still way better than Fallout 76"
24664,its Skyrim enough said
24665,"one of the best games to pick up and play, that won't tarnish over the years."
24666,It's worth playing if you played skyrim before
24667,I've bought this game 3 times on 3 platforms. Played on 4. Yes I would recommend.
24668,good game
24669,"I love this game, keep replaying it x'D I'ma a fantasy gal with her bow and arrows <3"
24670,I prefer the skyrim V over the SE because SE thrusts you into the DLC content I never wanted.  No worries about random OP vamps or cultists attacking.
24671,"For sure one of the best games I have ever played
"
24672,the best game ever ngl
24673,Pretty fun. Some bugs. 261 Mods crashes you every once and a while.
24674,this game would be cool to play if it weren't the buggiest piece of shit in the existence of all games ever made
24675,Amazing!
24676,fucking dumb
24677,All time classic
24678,"no point writing anything, everyone knows and loves this game"
24679,It's a phenomenal experience to dive into and just lose yourself for hours!
24680,must play
24681,At this point all there is to be said has been said.
24682,"""It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic: A Power Shriek."""

24705,"I HATE this ""game.""

""D-"""
24706,good game
24707,
24708,it's a solid classic.
24709,One of my Favorites!!! Good Job Bethesda :D
24710,A bygone era. I'd recommend as Bethesda's final masterpiece but would not encourage supporting their more recent cash grabby practices.
24711,Skyrim has a lot of disadvantages but it stills provide the best character development experience.
24712,"Its skyrim, the best game that has been milked for more than 8 years"
24713,wow its so cool i recommend maybe play?
24714,"If you like open world fantasy with rich lore, this is a game for you."
24715,Good. Play many.
24716,"amazing game that's stayed good through the years. 
just play the damn game and you'll never regret it."
24717,"Great game, great story, tons of fun, try it out !"
24718,"First time I purchased this game it was for the PS3, I played the hell out of that game multiple times, second time I purchased it was for the PS4 and again I played the hell out of it. Now that I have purchased it on my first gaming PC I love how it operates on this machine. I recommend this game to anyone who liked anything fantasy. The lore, story, and landscapes are so rich in this game. Definitely a game in my top 3."
24719,
24720,its ok
24721,ok
24722,it just works
24723, it beats skyrim SE any day

24730,"everything about this game is amazeing.
"
24731,dsfg
24732,"Yes
Very epic"
24733,"Bethesda did ok with the vanilla, modding community made it perfect, luckily SE was free for Vanilla owners

a contrario of what ""not recommended"" review mention ... the game run perfectly
having issues with 144hz? well just run it 60hz ( luckily it's not 30hz hardlock ... at that moment it would be a shame ... 60hz is fine for game like that ) doesn't run on your pc? your pc is not the issue, trust me .... 

many other player/modder can make wonder with Skyrim, it is not because you can't that the game is a garbage :p"
24734,"skyrim is my favorite elder scrolls game yet, oblivion in second place!"
24735,cel mai cazan joc
24736,"My name is Brodrick Howard, but my friends call me Bodd. Please buy this game. I really enjoy this game I definitely didn't have a hand in. It totally deserves way more sales than it has."

24740,"I'm honestly tired of Bethesda dragging this thing out for a new release every few years- seriously, if it were a horse I'd take it out back and shoot it- but it's really the mods that make a Bethesda game worth playing, isn't it? Wait until it's on-sale, but if you can get it on the cheap, do so."
24741,its pretty cool thanks tod
24742,My contry is Vietnamese! We want translate your game and give for pepole vietnam play? We can?
24743,amazing
24744,Is Good
24745,Classic. Honestly one of the best western RPGs out there.
24746,"fun, create your own player, leveling"
24747,"This game is ridiculously addictive. If you're not aware of how awesome skyrim is, seriously where have you for the last decade. Only buy if you have a lot of spare time on your hands. Even this long after release this game is amazing."
24748,"well, best game ever created"
24749,"go get it, ive played it for 10+ years"
24750,Bloody great story line I reccomend to anyone who loves to kill shit
24751,penis
24752,"Simply a classic still being played today, with mods galore of every type available. No more to say..."
24753,Well designed game that I like to replay from time to time.
24754,oblivion but even better
24755,"Love to hate the game mechanics, great game tho."
24756,"I havent played Breath of the Wild at this point that im writing this.
So yeah...i will consider this game to be my favorite open world game at the moment! i love it because...well...
Its the perfect norwegian fantasy RPG game! thats all."
24757,"This game is fantastic. I have 9 hours on PC but my Switch says that I have 450 hours or more on Skryim. Whenever I get bored with one character I'll usually just make a new one, and play the game again, this time with an orc, or maybe a kajhit, or an imperial. It really doesn't matter, I just always have fun with this game. Sure the game is glitchy, but usually it isn't too bad, and with the amazing modding community surrounding it, there is an endless amount of things you can do in the game. It's a truly spectacular game, and I suggest it completely."
24758,"HOLY FUCK ITS GOOD
"
24759,Nice.
24760,"Man, I guess it's alright"
24761,almost a decade old and still one of my go to games
24762,Greatest RPG to date.
24763,"It's Skyrim. You can do almost anything you want. Go pure vanilla and fight against dragons and decide the fate of a country on the brink of a civil war. Dabble in some lore-friendly mods. Or mod the crap out of it and have Macho Man-Dragon hybrids, Pony followers, and even Serana as a potential wife. This game is the perfect time killer."
24764,"I have played through the game twice, and enjoy it immensely.  I like every aspect of the game including keyboard controls, scenery and travel, companions and NPC interaction, character design and development, quests and the abundant number of quests, and other things that I am forgetting to mention.  I like that an old guy like me can play without needing ultrafast button mashing capability in three dimensions (if I wanted to time a jump perfectly to catch gold coins and drop in a pipe I could play Mario Bros, but I was never interested in that).  Note that I am incapable of playing The Witcher 2 because I lack a certain acrobatic skill.  I am more of a geek than an acrobat so keep me away from The Witcher games beyond the first. 
As with Elder Scrolls and Fallout series games, the main story line in Skyrim is adequate, but not as important as the wide open roaming opportunity over a vast landscape.  The only real complaint that I have with my Bethesda series is that they don't come out with new adventures often enough."
24765,"A masterpiece. This game utterly enchanted me, and has provided far more hours of entertainment than I should have let it. I have no regrets though, and have re-downloaded this game countless times."
24766,The only game you'll ever need.
24767,best rpg ever made
24768,"If you haven't heard of or played Skyrim yet, I'll keep it real with you. Just get it brother. Play it. Its quality and stuff."
24769,I AM THE MOUNTAAAAAAAAAAIIIIINNNNNNN!!!!!!!!! *EPIC STONER ROCK GUITAR RIFF*
24770,peaceful place to spend hours
24771,"One of the best games of all time, amazing way to spend my off time"
24772,such a time eater and a great story
24773,i remember this on the ps3 i used to play this non stop
24774,This is the best game in have ever owned on pc
24775,My dad left me.
24776,good game so many things you can do in it that r just amazing if youve never play i def recomon it
24777,It's good but way better with mods.
24778,its lit
24779,had this game in 2011 on my xbox 360 and been having this game for a while on the PC and even my switch. I cant get enough of this game <3
24780,yess
24781,Hard But Epic.
24782,It just works
24783,420/69 Would recommend. It got magic and shiz and is cool. I stayed up from 9:00PM to 6:00AM last night and i don't regret a thing!
24784,"its not the special retard edition that has no workshop no reason for existing and no value, bethusda messed up ever releasing the special edition and should pay people to ignore its existence"
24785,yes
24786,not enufgh arrwo to knee tehe
24787,this is by far my favourite game!
24788,"Legendary game, a classic. Must play."
24789,"Well, it was going pretty well, I completed the main quest a lot of times, but when I tried to move the damn folder location, it broke down. This may be a rating, but pls help."
24790,tgggttyhth
24791,Screenshot simulator
24792,Like one of the best games ever made. Bethesda can suck my fat juicy balls I plopped on the desk.
24793,fantastic
24794,Great game
24795,Its and amazing game but my pc usually crashes when running this game. The quest lines are amazing and every single game from this franchise is pretty good
24796,skyrim is great
24797,"Excellent gameplay and graphics, great story line, tons of side quests. Lots of replayability."
24798,its skyrim
24799,"lOVE THE GAME PLAY, THE QUEST LINES, HE MULTIPLE OUTCOMES."
24800,I have never played a game and enjoyed it this much
24801,My favorite game of all time
24802,"Great game, even for 2020 (with mods ofcourse)"
24803,"After years this game is still one of the most liked games ever. It never gets old and you always keep feeling powerfull after that first ""Fus-Ro-Da!"" moment. If you do not know this game yet... I strongly advise you to play it at least once, if only to have the reference when people talk about it, cause... they will."
24804,like shrek
24805,Endless hours of play with several different builds to run and test. Mods are great and overall it is a masterpiece. Buy it if you aren't a square.
24806,grate game
24807,"the goodest game ever
"
24808,Great old game
24809,Just yes.its skyrim.
24810,yes good. A little bit old now but it still very fun.
24811,Good game
24812,after 9 years skyrim is still the most beutiful game i 've ever played
24813,"The most meme-able game since the 2010s, and thats a fact for a reason"
24814,
24815,i like it...just that
24816,Skyrim is best game hale papa Todd
24817,5555555
24818,Good game and dedicated community.
24819,at this point you know what this game is.
24820,AMAZING!! it reminds me of game of thrones or something like that i highly reccomend it
24821,"Fantastic game. Sure, there are bugs, but there's a reason it was as big as it was, and still is to this day. Not to mention the modding scene continues to crank out great content to help bridge the gap a little between 2011 and the present."
24822,Awesome game.
24823,"BEST RPG EVER, old but GOLD."
24824,excellent medieval base sand box! excellent story! excellent music!
24825,Great Game!
24826,Its ok
24827,"yeet i have played 1,165 hours. does that convince you"
24828,"Fun, and mods make it even more fun."
24829,"A great RPG all around. While many long time players of TES titles will be upset at the loss of many true RPG elements, they will undoubtedly respect the story and additional features the game has to offer. Players new to RPGs will be able to experience a world full of lore and a non-frustrating interface which will serve as a fantastic introduction to the genre. Ultimately, this is a great game which I have logged endless hours on and you will absolutely fall in love with the breath-taking scenery, story line, and characters."
24830,"I owned it on ps3, Ps3, switch and Pc and I still love it."
24831,rabit
24832,"dont be fooled with my playtime, its just  unplayable garbage. Ive spent weeks worth of time trying to get rid of old mods and files that could have been contributing to game issues, but even still with a fresh install and even new computer, nothing but bugs and crashes. Such a disappointment."
24833,#6 please
24834,the story line with the weapons and armor
24835,this is the greatest game ever.
24836,truuu
24837,Love this game :D but definitely recommend the Special Edition over this one.
24838,"When this first came out I was a wee boy, my dad burst through the door after purchasing it on the way home from work at 5am and threw the cunt at my head. Havent stopped playing it since."
24839,Eats your life. Perfect substitute for going outside in these trying times. Mods highly recommended.
24840,NOICE. DUn dun du du dun dun
24841,its skrim
24842,Limitless fun and bugs.
24843,"With mods it can become new again, over and over. On its own it is immersive, gorgeous and a lot of fun."
24844,Absolutely heaven. So much freedom. Beetheesedee made a classic with this one! Funnest game of the century! I've only played 500 hours! I want to play more! I'd buy it on every system i have for no particular reason! It JUST WORKS!
24845,It's Skyrim.
24846,"I've never written a formal review...? Dang.  Anyway this game has been out for a long time. It's hard to think of something others don't already know???  But, if it's you're kind of game you're going to love it. And if you get into and learn how to use mods successfully you're never going to play it the same way every time. After years it's a game I still come back to. I was prompted to review it because I am installing it YET AGAIN, and I'm using the ""Oldrim"" because certain mods weren't updated to Special Edition (which I also have).  It's always a lot of fun."
24847,Nice~!
24848,"Absolutely splendid unfortunately Bethesda has hidden it, tricky to download mods on in initially if you didnt know much about it like me but an excellent game. x"
24849,Great so far
24850,"Huge game! You can explore the world forever, if you wish. Lots of towns and castles with interactive people and enemies. You can walk, run, ride horses, hire a horse and buggy, fast-travel. Making and upgrading stuff: potions, armor, weapons, spells. Graphics are awesome. Audio is great. Ambiance galore. You can really lose yourself in this. This is my second play-through. Dozens and dozens and dozens of quests and side quests, which I never finished on the first run-through. You can find lists of all the quests out there and hit them all, if you wish. :)
"
24851,it is just skyrim
24852,amazing fun and vast its like you are entering another world it is an escape from the one you are in now trulya master peice
24853,best game ever
24854,good game
24855,Skyrim yes.
24856,Simplesmente o jogo da minha vida.
24857,Epic game
24858,I really enjoy this game.  I've played it for years and still haven't gotten bored with it.  Plus there's ton's of mods out there that just enhance everything.
24859,11/10
24860,"I love the story-telling, the use of magic, and of course the Dragons."
24861,"It's a classic , what more can i say besides try some mods, they're still being released."
24862,'Nuff said
24863,Countless quest  and seemingly endless world
24864,good
24865,The game play makes the bugs forgivable
24866,i like
24867,Good Game
24868,good
24869,"its skyrim if we're being honest, of course anyone would recommend this game to anyone else who hasn't played such a game"
24870,Just a legendary game
24871,Amazing... even years after first playing I find myself returning to this solid game.  Plethora of mods make it more interesting for re-playability without detracting from ambiance and story.
24872,its skyrim
24873,its good
24874,Not much to say - an amazing imersive game
24875,Great fun and gets me lost in hours without realizing
24876,"This is an old game at the time I'm writing, and I haven't played many RPGs, I'm mostly a 4X strategy gamer. However, The Elders Scrolls III-V have consumed quite a few hours of my life. Immersive, beautiful and extremely rich, these games are a fantastic get-away."
24877,pretty fun although i want to slam my wifes pussy how do i do that????
24878,itz gud fam
24879,"after almost 700 hours i think i can say
yes i enjoyed this game"
24880,SKYRIMMMMMMMMMMMM
24881,"1, Why do I rate this game now?
2, Why do I still get new shit in this game?
Awesome broken shit, fun as fuck, 10/10."
24882,rerererererererere
24883,"It's Skyrim. Everybody loves Skyrim. It's really bad, yet so good. 

The modding community also REALLY pulls through."
24884,"I liked this Game, but not as much as I like sex.         I'm sorry Todd Howard."
24885,OGEST
24886,I LOVE THIS
24887,ysolda makes my peepee big
24888,"I have been playing this game for years, and it never gets old"
24889,pretty good i guess
24890,Masterpiece
24891,"A masterpiece. Sets the bar for all other RPG's. incredible replay value. Beautiful graphics, tons of variety. 10/10, and anyone who tells you different hates you. A+ game"
24892,"I used to be an adventurer like you, till I took an arrow to the knee and had nothing to do but play 114 hours of this game"
24893,Requires xBox controller for best play.
24894,its a classic
24895,"Best game ever made. In every way it is amazing and extremely fun. Great memories, very inspiring. I'm writing a book series based on my character. Skyrim is Phenomenal."
24896,will always love this game sooo much
24897,it gud
24898,10/10
24899,You can do anything. That's it that's the review.
24900,yes
24901,Fallout but with magic and swords ;)
24902,"Hey, you!
You're finally awake!

24926,Romanced a crab.
24927,Amazing and still going strong after all these years thanks to mods.
24928,a ground-breaking game if I ever saw one. Not being an RPG gamer.

24961,"This game can be replayed endlessly. I have played this game on the Xbox since my childhood in 2012, I had roughly 1000+ hours on it. Eventually, I stopped playing the game because i felt satisfied with my experience and didn't want to beat a dead horse (Like bethesda did...), but I didn't quit because of any boredom or irritation. 2 years later, I finally manage to get my own gaming desktop and bought the pc version of the game 1 year later, the experience made me ecstatic. Not only was I fascinated by the short loading screens (That took ~10 minutes to load in console), but I was amazed by the wonder of modding. It allowed to replay the story, the adventure, the game, the experience, you name it, in countless ways under the conditions of a hundred differences, maybe even a thousand. It was an renaissance endless (or a remaster as you would call it), beautiful graphics, outstanding mechanics, fascinating systems, extraodinairy characters, endless or unforgettable adventures, all crafted by it's modding community that keeps it alive to the present day. I am grateful that the modding community of this game remains persistent and creative to innovate countless ways to view and play the game. Keep up the great work guys, Ignore bethesda's greed to make us play limited versions of the game chained to micro-transactions. Either way, I don't think the elder scrolls 6 won't be good as any other of the series with bethesda's current behaviour."
24962,Yeah
24963,"TES: Skyrim offers a uniquely vast and practically endless fantasy experience to enjoy. The game has deep layers of customization, an extremely large map filled with places to explore, and features 3 uniquely distinct playstyles: hand-to-hand combat, magic use, and stealth. You are, however, not bound to each one, and can freely swap between them or combine them at will. 

If you decide to mod the game, there is so, so much more that you are capable of. The modding community has had 9 years to polish itself, and continues to do so, outputting some of the most creative and enjoyable content I have ever played with in a game, further enhancing the already incredibly enjoyable experience.

25005,"My review for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (SPOILER WARNING):

Introduction:

I first played Skyrim when I was just a bright-eyed 14-year-old in 2012. It was the first RPG I ever picked up. Suffice to say, it quickly became one of my favourite games and my gateway into the RPG genre. I especially loved the modding community and what they had to offer, as well as Bethesda giving said modding community an outlet to create mods for their games.

What the game is about:

As mentioned in the description, you play as the Dragonborn. Your deal is that you slay dragons and pick up their abilities. I won't go into further detail, for the sake of spoilers.

The good parts about the game:

The skills system that Skyrim utilises has it set up so that the player has to actually use a skill to level up, as well as picking up any skill books. That is good as it prevents the issue that I notice that Fallout 3 and New Vegas suffers where the player can just farm XP so that they can level up and dump skill points into a particular skill: Whereas F3 and F:NV turns the skills into literal dump stats, Skyrim makes the skill increase feel earned.

Another good point I would like to point out is the fact that the game world itself is what can be best described as visually attractive: From the icy mountains of Winterhold to the autumn valleys of The Rift to the stunningly beautiful view from the Throat of the World, Skyrim never fails to disappoint with the beautiful scenery that it's game world has to offer. Everytime I step out into the game world after the tutorial section, I always am blown away by the stunning visuals that the game world has to offer.

To add to my previous point would be the soundtrack by Jeremy Soule: His track record and style as a composer never fails to disappoint. If anything, this could easily be one of the best soundtracks he has ever composed in his career. From the main theme that plays in the main menu to the track that plays as you enter Sovngarde for the final quest, the soundtrack for Skyrim easily further enhances the gameplay experience. Other noteworthy examples includes the tracks that play as you explore the game world, and the One They Fear track that plays every time you fight a dragon.

The bad parts about the game:

Compared to previous entries to the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim does away with classes and has no level caps: This creates issues with both the role-playing element and the replayability element of the game, as the player can easily master every single skill in one playthrough.

Another issue with the game, going back to the skills system, is that the number of available skills have decreased from previous entries to the Elder Scrolls series: For instance, while there were separate skills for different weapon types (i.e. sword, axe, etc), they have now been separated into One-Handed and Two-Handed weapons. While this might make the game easier to digest for the more casual player, this again adds to the issue of diminishing the role-playing element within the game as the player cannot specialise in one single weapon type, creating a Jack-of-all-Trades kind of scenario.

Another issue I wish to point out would be the Radiant Quests system: The quests within the game always keep randomly generating which creates bloat within the game where there doesn't need to be, and naturally bloat within video games can be a huge issue as it means that the player's interest in the game could end up devolving into obligation as they would have all these quests that they need to complete, whereas an ideal RPG and, by extension, an ideal video game should always be set up so that the player's investment is organic and not forced.

Speaking of quests: I would like to point out that there are a few issues with certain questlines within the game: Some questlines are built in a very linear fashion, where the player doesn't get to choose how the questlines end, instead being forced to complete quests in order to advance the storyline to a conclusion that has been essentially hard-coded into the questline: For any other game genre, this would be acceptable, expected even. But for an RPG, this is something that should be avoided at all costs: The point of RPGs is that the player is given total agency to change the game world in whatever way that they see fit; And for an RPG game to steer their players into a particular direction not only creates a rather repressive gameplay and narrative experience, but it also completely goes against one of the core attributes of the RPG genre.

The most egregious example of this would be a tie between the Civil War questline and the Main Quest itself. 

The Main Quest does not allow the player to change the game world or the story during gameplay; The ending itself just involves defeating Alduin, the Nordic dragon god of destruction, and not even changing the status quo beyond that. 

As for the Civil War questline, it is essentially Attrition Simulator: You pick a side, and just work to defeat the other side by taking all the major cities and defeating the leader of the opposing faction. There is no option to talk to the leaders and resolve the quest peacefully, and the battles themselves are pretty underwhelming: All they entail is NPC guards/soldiers running at eachother until one side is decimated.

Conclusion:

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a game that is, objectively, a good game, but not a good RPG. It lacks some RPG elements while underperforming in what little RPG elements it seems to have at best; While implementing them in the worst way possible at, well, worst. I still enjoy the game and will still acknowledge it as my gateway into the RPG genre; In fact, I hope to take the lessons I learned from this game and use them in entries I contribute to the RPG genre.

Lessons that can be learned from this game:

- Never make the story or questline of the game incredibly arbitrary.

- Give players more skills so that they can easily specialise in some weapon types, enabling better role-playing.

- Add classes

- Make skill increases feel earned and never fall into the ""dump stat"" trap"

Stay safe everyone and Game on!"
25104,"I could play this game for 10,000 hours and still do things I've never done before. It's pretty hard to get bored playing Skyrim. Once you start adding mods, this game gives even more to do. Nearly ten years since release and it still competes with some newly released games aesthetic-wise. Not to mention, I own this game on just about every console possible, with upwards of 500 hours on each. Evidently, Skyrim reigns among the most superior of video games. If you game, and have yet to play Skyrim, you have yet to experience gaming in its purest form. It's quite enjoyable to partake in the merriment that is being Dovahkiin.

Skyrim, truly the most fundamental constituent of a gamer,
Bright-eyed and curious."

25112,"Come on, you know what Skyrim is."
25113,oh my god i need to stop modding this forsaken game
25114,Skyrim as a game with its open world and lore is pretty good. You can easily spend there many hours. But Bethesda is so lazy and greedy that instead of making different game they just adjusted some visual effects and textures (mods do it better) and sold it as Special Edition. I could understand that but now you can't find original Skyrim on Steam and even with its url you can't buy DLCs. And we thought that horse armor was pathetic...

4. Pretty well balanced for the most part with not many crazy glitches/bugs.
5. The expansion packs added another 10 years of life to the game...at least for me.
6. Owning your own home in the Hearthfire expansion was well worth it. The homes in town are okay but Hearthfire is better.
7. Can marry an NPC in game...they become even dumber after you marry them...which is normal...I think...

Cons;
1. Main story line is cool but hate any game that does not allow 100% freedom. Solved with mod's.
2. Added the Hearthfire expansion to romance a woman to drag back to the cave but then they are as intelligent as a rock. 
3. In the original game you could pick the lock on shops after hours and rob them blind. 
4. No Linux version but I play it on Linux anyways!
5. Can marry and NPC in the game...wife wants to kill her...
6. No kids from the marriage so not sure if that is a pro or con...

Bottom line, if you have never tired this game you are missing out. Best bang for the buck and countless hours of fun. Get it!"

25166,"There's sooo much that you can do. I have maybe 500 more hours outside of what Steam says I have in this game, and have never finished the main story-line. The workshop has a ridiculous amount of mods that improve gameplay, features, graphics, etc."

25183,This game is a legend when it comes to games. I have played it and actually have no at all beat it. But what I say is that it is a great game to play. It is almost like playing a online game without anyone. If you are looking for a game to play and not be online and have SUPER fun. Then this would be the game and also it is a major classic now!

25194,its really good its going to be the first game to be remastered the remastered
25195,This game is amazing!!! I prefer the elder scrolls over a lot of games? Not really a huge fan of ESO. I wish Bethseda would continue the Elder Scrolls Saga as being an in depth first person RPG.
25196,Very nice... The only steam Game i've ever had that crashes on me
25197,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Review
Say goodbye to real life.

Iwas stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.

Part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.



It contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.

Many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.



Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.

Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.

Skyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.

25200,"Fuck you Bethesda for hiding this game. I know this came down from your corporate overlords at Zenimax, but stop bending over and taking it up the ass from them. You used to make good games. Skyrim, Fallout 3 and 4, Morrowind, Oblivion, Daggerfall, were all fantastic."

I'd compare it very favorably to Knights of the Old Republic, but with many many more hours of gameplay and much more of a sandbox feel than KOTOR."

25257,it's the elder scrolls
25258,"No regrets, Im have been addicted since release date, wife left me, I think I quit my job."
25259,Game of the decade? Perhaps. Made by God himself? Perhaps. A terrible game? HELL NO BUY THIS 20X OVER YOU TWAT!
25260,yeet
25261,needs more dragon dongs
25262,amazing game
25263,Best fantasy RPG ever released with mods included... but god are the bugs bad!
25264,One of the best RPG's of all time.
25265,"Skyrim is a classic warrior/magic/thief game. You build your character and level up in any way you like. No restrictions. Consequences, yes. But you make your own way in this world. It offers a beautiful open world, simple enough to play casually and in depth enough to play for hours."
25266,i love this game and hope tes:6 will be as good
25267,"Vanilla game is very good, but with mods this game is my absolute favorite.  I have probably spent more time modding the game than playing it.  I just love how you can play one time and have one experience, then install new mods and have a different experience.  I actually have a hard time playing games that you can't mod now.  I guess that would be the only bad thing about the game."
25268,MJÁLM
25269,"The story is lacking for sure, some quests are pretty cool and interesting but most of them are ridiculously similar to one another in the most boring ways. The game will have you going through the exact same looking dungeon for four hundred times, which gets so annoying and repetitive so fast.

The combat lacks something even greater though. I mean they feel like something out of the 17th century, it just feels horrible horrible. I don't know what it is about the graphics but they hold up pretty well, this game is just gorgeous. I love it. But that just gets brought down by the shitty just-press-mouse-one combat mechanics that it has. Its kinda sad tbh. 

However, despite all of its flaws this game will always hold a place in my heart for being one of the best rpgs i have ever played to this date. If you get into it you will easily play this game for months on end, it can be so much fun at times.

Then there is modding, which is a different thing in its entirety. Everything that I dont like about this can be fixed with a mod or two, and it is often said that youre not playing the game right if its not crashing from all the mods youve installed. So thats fun I guess.

Overall I would recommend this game to just aboit anyone who has ever played anything ever. this game is and always will be a monument of open world rpgs.

9/10 its pretty good fun"
25270,its ok
25271,D
25272,"I've spent more time watching the loading screen crash because I've modded this thing to hell and back
11/10"
25273,"Where to begin, yes its going to be one of those long reviews. Lets get to it.

An old one, nine years old now, is it still good? Yes a little dated perhaps but certainly well worth it. Why, lets find out.

Traditional beginning: what is it with bethesda and prisons? Morrowind starts on a prison ship, Oblivion starts in the Imperial prison, Skyrim starts you being arrested and driven to prison...someone has a prison fetish. Not that I realy mind that but needs to be mentioned.

Moving on to the main story, right away you are introduced to your main enemy of the game, wow thats fast. Afterwards a lil turtorial dungeonrun with a temp companion, and then you are free to roam as you please. You do receive some basic gear as you would expect.

Content Overview: 

Main Quest: straight forward, sometimes a bit too easy, but nicely done (for me anyway). The classic zero to hero story you will find in many rpg games. Dragons, yes dragons I say, storyline dragons are named usualy a bit stronger then the generic version, and the generic well they can be found at dragon mounts(no pets, but mounts as in mountains)

Factions: Appear to be unbreakable, meaning to say you cannot betray your guild when you are a member, except for one wich is dark brotherhood (be it not for you chosing to be a traitor but for the benefit of the empire wtf). Guildquests are pretty much the same as the previous installement, do a few quests and you raise in rank, simple. At the joining basic guild gear is provided.  Afterwards there are generic repeat quests wich give you a small reward. Ideal for those that want a clean game with no console cheating. Wich btw is very much available should you wish to use it. Storyline for the guilds can be short but is rewarding, meaning to say at the end of almost every guild questline you will get an unique gearset or weapon(s) fitting to that guildstyle. Also characters of that guild will become available as companions to join you beyond.

Level system: same as TESIV Oblivion, your enviroment evolves with you as you level meaning to say for example in a dungeon at lv1 you may encounter a bandit, at lv 5 that will be a bandit thug and so on... Meaning that as you level enemies become stronger and the game becomes harder and will require more strategic thinking in some situations if you don't want to get instagibbed (for those that dont know, instagib refers to a mutator(gamemod) in the '99 game Unreal Tournament wich allowed everyone to one shot kill each other.) That is what will happen if you decide to go frontal attack in a dungeon after levelling a bit. Certain quests mainly daedric (god item quests) require a specific level to start, others you can can commence by finding an item in a random container. Legendary edition also offers the choice to make a skill legendary meaning at lv100 (skill mastery) u can reset back to lv0 and the perk points will then be available to distribute amongst other skills should you so choose. Basicly removes the lv limit. Some hard challenges are only available at certain set level, why? because they are hard, thats why, otherwise you would not be able to complete them, and als keeping in tune with the previous lore, certain levelled entities have returned. Oh yes dragons also level, when you reach a certain level, they will become legendary dragons and those are serious m*f*s. Then again with levelling so do the rewards and quality of the items found. Unlike TESIV the enemies don't dissapear and are replaced with others, but stay the same just a stronger version. 

Battlesystem: What would you like?

All kinds of combos available, being able to set a weapon in one hand and magic in the other, dual wielding, shield and sword or ranged (2 handed) and two handed weapons (maul and greatswords) or dualwield magic. Keeping in mind you are able to favorite weapons, magic, , armor, consumables  so u can one click equip or use them from the favorites menu as the situation of your character changes in the field or battle, allowing for a varied playstyle. For example use light armor in the field for fast movement and then quickly change to heavy armor or stealth gear when you start exploring a dungeon. 
Do not forget the shouts, your unique character power that can support or in some cases even save you. 

Scenery: Large and varied world, its the north so lots of snow, what u expect lol. landscapes go from tundra,marshes, hillside, plains, riverbeds and the sea. Plenty of caves, dungeons, bandit/smuggler camps, dwarven ruins to explore, not forgetting small settlements in between towns. If you get the free HD Texture pack making it even better looking. 

Crafting: limited, ranging from blacksmithing to enchantement (the ones you will use the most) to alchemy wich is only necessary on higher difficulty.  Cooking can easily replace alchemy for healing and stamina items. Funny thing its hard to find salt, thinking in those time didnt they use salt to prevent their food from spoiling? But ya anyway...

DLC overview:

Dawnguard: vampire/vampirehunter dlc, u can choose to be either of the two, comes with a complete new area, few new enemies and a well written story and oh yes crossbows. Unique faction gear for both vampires and dawnguard hunters.

Hearthfire: Housebuilding dlc, get a deed and build your own house to your own specifications, and yes you will have to work for it. Mine stone, mine clay, buy lumber, smith locks and hinges for your doors, nails for your boards...lot of work. Comes with the ability for the player to adobt a child in the orphanage or a begger kid in one of the towns.

Dragonborn: Learn that your are not the only dragonborn, and the original want his place back...at your expense. Go back to Morrowind, mainly Ravenrock on the isle of Solstheim (was part of the Bloodmoon expansion in TESIII) Unravel the mystery of the great unclean one (no not WH40K lol). Not that he is that unclean but there is ooze and tentacles involved so yeah. Basicly learning that your are part to end of a plot of general enslavement of the Isle that ends with you realizing it was nothing but a Daedric deity having some fun with everyone. A great area to explore, new gear, and classic gear that comes back, the Stahlrim (ancient frostmetal) and regular nordic gear that also looks good. 

Bossfights: The only real bosses u will find will be at the end of a quest or dungeon. More random with no quest u can go search after the tombs of dragonpriests. These priests are undead and usualy have AOE attacks (Area of Effect) like fireball and chainlightning, higher levels blizzard attack that can instagib you. Recommended u decide a good tactic in advance before you go at these guys. Sometimes solo, other times with minions (ok) or strong dungeon spawns that can count as a semi boss them selves (not ok). Reload will sometimes happen. Giants, yes the one hit make u fly in the air and game over type, at low level anyway.

Ai: yes and no, during battle the ai mostly will charge straight at you when in melee, ranged they will sometimes move to prevent you from shooting back, look for cover to avoid you. If you keep to the left semi camping it will come at you from the right, so the ai does try to compete with you in battle. That being said if you run from battle the ai will simply return to its previous position, allowing you to exploit this through repeat hit/run tactics. 

Repeat value: vanilla not much, sorry to say. Yes there are many races to choose from but that doesnt realy change all that much in the storyline, and since the class system is gone and replaced with guardianstones that will give you a bonus to skills so that way u can evolve those skills to your style of play. Meaning if your willing to take the time you can change the bonus to a different skill group and after some levelling be a complete all round character, no need of any classes. That kind of takes away the repeat value. Mods are available for this.

Give it a try

25281,This game is very dynamic in many ways. Lots of quest and plenty of Map space.
25282,Been playing since 2012! still love it in 2020
25283,nice
25284,Yes

25286,bangin
25287,eh its ok
25288,legendary game
25289,always one of my favourite games
25290,Great game. I have played it for years. I'm sure it will get many more hours during COVID 19 2020.
25291,gud
25292,such long game but you dont even get bored
25293,"literally the best game i've ever played. Love the open world, character building, like living a whole other life. Great quests and can be played over and over without doing the same thing twice. Love it to bits, it's going to be hard to find a game that will live up to this masterpiece."
25294, very awesome game with amazing plot!
25295,INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF PLAYSTYLES! HUGE SKILL TREE! MURDER CHILDREN!
25296,Modded Skyrim may be one of the best games ever thought up.
25297,Niasu
25298,"This game is just amazing, the soundtracks make the battles more epic, the story as it progresses becomes better and better giving you more knowledge about the Dragon War and how it affected Skyrim and it's people. The environments look very nice and often beautiful at times, a ton of secret items like weapons, armor, spells, books and some other things which make your playthrough more rewarding. NPC interaction is a big thing in this game and works very well, there is a huge variety of enemies from humans to giants, beasts, vampires, spiritual/elemental beings, undead (known as Draugr in norse mythology) and the dragons making the encounters more badass than anything. There is quite a lot of content in this game and I am still not sure why they unlisted this game on the Steam store. This is simply a masterpiece."
25299,AWESOOOOME!
25300,gg
25301,"Thanks to the Corona Virus I'm back on the Skyrim-needle for the first time in years and it turns out I still love it. Who'd have guessed, right?"
25302,Best RPG game ever
25303,"I love skyrim. Almost unlimited content bcs of the mods and even without you can play it for more than 100 hours
"
25304,its a good game
25305,"GREAT GAME
"
25306,THE best game if you're into RPG. Unlimited playtime and unlimited extra content. A time-sink or casual fun activity at the same time. Can be as hard as you'd like it to be. Special shoutout to all the content creators that make mods for the game a decade after it came out.
25307,fun.
25308,"Your typical wizards and warriors affair that is still fun to this day. ""It just works."""
25309,nice one
25310,"8/10 vanilla game. Amazing game in its time. Hundreds of quests, plenty of things to do. A couple of bugs here and there, as with any Bethesda game. Tons and tons of gameplay; you can put hundreds of hours into the game and still not have finished the main questline. Sometimes you don't know what the main quest even is, because of how many quests you start to eventually pick up.
A little clunky, as it doesn't feel particularly smooth. 
Very flexible character stats; your character can be very unique. Most stats are nicely balanced, but descriptions of skills can be vague.
Highly flexible modding platform; you can literally make your game whatever you want. Billions (no exaggeration) of mods at your disposal in the year 2020. If you know what your doing, you can install hundreds of mods with little repercussions. Want to be a vampire-mage-dragonslayer that steals your enemy's very soul with the flick of a wrist and a magical purple sword in your hand? You can do that. Want to be in a thief ring and do shady thief-related business? It's got it. Want to screw a dragon? Go ahead, my friend. Anything you can imagine, Skyrim and the mod community has it. 

10/10 modded game. You're no gamer if you haven't at least tried playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim."
25311,I've put so many hours into the Elder Scrolls and this is the best. If they remade the others with this engine it would be awesome.
25312,its a fun game
25313,"I like how the game has been vigorously developed. There is so much to the game and you can tell a lot of human effort has gone into the various aspects of the game. I also like how the various aspects of the game are interlinked - the main quest line intersects with other major quests which in turn intersect with other minor quests. You can progress through the game using a number of approaches such as being objective focused, exploring, being skill focused or achievement focused and each aspect progresses the others. Particular aspects of the game I like include: woodcutting for money (a great way to start out), blacksmithing, the town of Solitude, presence of a fictional world history in the game and General Tullius.  Ulfric is also an interesting personality in the game that particularly stands out to me."
25314,nice boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
25315,5/5
25316,"Cmon. It's Skyrim. You're legally required to play 100+ hours to be granted ""gamer"" status. You've already committed a crime (against Skyrim and her people) by going into the reviews to question the quality of this game. Is it perfect? Only metaphorically. Without mods this game is kept together with duct tape and an engine so old Todd'll have to pull the plug on it's life support soon. In summary, this game should be the the first thing newborn babies should play as soon as they realize the voice in their head is theirs."
25317,classic
25318,"yes
"
25319,"Just a very well done game, a classic that'll always be remembered."
25320,I like to steal cheese
25321,"I used to be an adventurer like you, until I took an arrow to a knee while stealing your sweet roll."
25322,I would highly recommend this game. It's a lot of fun and easy to get into. While it is a bit buggy I enjoyed the game every second I played it.
25323,"I still play this game all these years later, it is obviously a great game!"
25324,love this game
25325,Fucken amazing
25326,weri gud jes

25330,Skyrim.
25331,Good game!
25332,"I simply love this game. The immersion, the soundtrack, the quests, the lore... and the most important thing: an awesome community that don't let this game die and can fix almost anything that bothers you while playing.
I would recommend it to anyone who wants a game to keep playing for years, and anyone who loves medievel stuff. Good gaming."
25333,good game
25334,Best RPG ever.
25335,its alright.
25336,Its fun
25337,Modding paradise
25338,this game is amazing and you could literally over 200+ hours and still not have it complete
25339,"Meh, 1000+ hours on Xbox 360 I still find more to do."
25340,"Believe me, if you buy this game for the first time in 2020, or any other year hence, you will not have to worry about buying another for an incalcuable amount of time."
25341,IT IS LIT
25342,One of the best adventures for me.
25343,.
25344,Very good game it is. To play it I suggest you. Regret it you won't.
25345,"Absolutely NO, i wasted 88h of my live just to yell at some flying lizards!"
25346,"I've played 3,000 hours, enough said"
25347,NICE TO PLAY
25348,BEST GAME AND VERY BALANCED
25349,"So vast, and so much to do! Very fun, wonky and overall amazing!"
25350,"Where to begin? This game (and it's mods) are IMMENSE. I've lost so many hours playing this game, I've gotten all the achievements and I'm still playing it. Most replay value of any game I've ever played."
25351,It's a classic.
25352,"Its a good game, I've played through the main line in vanilla mode and all the DLC. but it can get a touch repetitive and the mechanics of warrior, thief, mage are not well balanced. I can't imagine there is anyone reading this who does not already know this of course."
25353,"Top notch, as good as everyone keeps saying."
25354,"Buy Skyrim.

     -Tod Howard, 2020"
25355,Im addicted...
25356,Come On New Elder Scrolls
25357,"It's a broken f*cking mess and I love it, go mental. Mod the ever living f*ck out of this game to reveal its full fecked up potential. :)(:"
25358,"lets face it bethesda hates us and our opinion........but, here me out.... when it comes to elder scrolls they make a good game, great?... no the modding community does that, but to me... thats okay these games have got me through some shit. Their lour mainly but the modding community too. i have bought this on 3 platforms no regrets; however, if 6 doesn't have multiplayer i will riot."

25361,"it's Skyrim, what's not to love?"
25362,"this game... omg, nearly 10 years later and still has massive replay value. this game is honestly one of the best games on the market for some one who loves to explore vast maps where developers took the time to create lovable worlds. i cant really put this game into words but basically if you havent yet played this you are missing out bruv"
25363,"TES V: Skyrim is a great game and a modders heaven or hell depending on what you know and what you want out of it.
The game is old at this point but has redeeming quality none the less.

I highly approve of Skyrim."
25364,"epic
"
25365,its cool
25366,It's honestly one of the most OG games I've played.
25367,"The greatest single player RPG ever made IMO. The basic game is a great experience on it's own and with the plethora of MODs out there the game can be freshened up with new graphics, UI, quests, creatures, NPCs and items indefinitely. Bethesda has set the bar extremely high for TES VI!"
25368,"It's a classic. There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. It is more shallow than more recent games but still a must play, particularly with mods"
25369,"The greatest RPG in my heart, none can surpass it."
25370,No words
25371,Stop looking in the bad reviews this is an amazing game and you should join the millions of players and buy it right now
25372,"Best and forever the best Bethesda game :)
5/5 Paws 🐾"
25373,"Fantastic game, great story lines. The best part is you can play this game 20 times, and each time will be a different game. Would recommend"

25379,i play this almost every night in my spare time lol
25380,It's ok i guess.
25381,"[h1] Temper Tantrum and escapism [/h1]

This game beautifully depicts childlike wonder - almost like in a dreamlike statis - trying to avoid responsibilites metaphorically represented and manifested by creatures such as 'mr.nightnight' symbolic of ones fear of sleep, isolation and much more. - just as H.P lovecraft once mentioned ""I shall never sleep calmly again, when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life.. time and space.""
I think this is why the creatures are often depicted floating, in an almost melchonic way.
This game really makes you FEEL like a baby, much like my childhood, which was filled with tourment, alcholholism, death and fear - mainly from my alcoholic father who often beat me with a frozen fish, that began to rot.
Due to this, I have gained a very harsh tempter, and it feels good to break and destroy like I once fantasised about when I was a young boy, the act of having a 'tempter tantrum' is something i am often mocked about, mainly when i complain about that alt right facist trumpl.
I really like to see the artistic beauty in all things, I guess you could say I'm rather deep, I often ponder and question even simple things, such as the term ""life"" and what it really means. [i] based on what, that is the question [/u]

I am really just pretty insiteful, like a glass is half empty, however the rest is really just filled with unanswered questions, like where did the rest go? who drank it? was it dranken? was i the one, will i be dranken one day? possibly.. maybe. not not.
Male masculinity is often questioned, and I like to think that i am safe because i do not waste time watching adult videos, that will decrease my masculinity as it is proven in studies - read a book.
because instead i ponder and wonder about the vast world, and how we came to be.

Please pick up this game if you have the chance, 
tldr.
funny baby

25382,Dragon Dragon Dragon Dragon
25383,the strongest item in the game is a wooden bowl
25384,Fantastic!
25385,"I love this game. Every time I get a little bored with it, I find a new mod. ""Beyond Skyrim""  ""Beyond the Reach ""Blackthorn-Build your own city"" ""Thieves Guild for the Good Guys."" Follow the Loot by Marypele, Elizabeth Jackson- Brynjolf mods,  and Hooneyside mods, just to name a few.   And, of course, ILHE- the author I love, who made it possible to marry Brynjolf, Ralof, and Ulfric. It makes the game brand new for me. 

The one thing I don't like is  favorite mods I love to use and the author has flown the coop. He's moved on and left the mod unattended. 

But never fear, luck would have it, a new mod comes along to replace that, and it may be better than your old favorite. 

SSE is Alright, but, it still mods to enhance mountains, trees, grass, cities, establishments, so I can't see a real difference.

If you've never played Skyrim, or have left Skyrim for greener pastures, take a look at the new mods Skyrim  has to offer. Try it again. You won't regret it."
25386,:o
25387,"if you dont like skyrim, your nuts"
25388,Nearly a decade old but still one of the most beautiful games to be produced by Bethesda.
25389,Great game and even works on my piece of s**t laptop
25390,play with mods for the ultimate experience
25391,Todd you tricked me again
25392,"Do you want to fight dragons? Want to get chased by everyone just for killing a chicken? [spoiler]Would you like to install some sexy body mods and hunt for major booty? [/spoiler]This is the game for you!

You play as some guy who tried to cross the border and- blah blah blah you should just install this alternate start mod to skip that cheesey intro: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102287878 trust me it won't ruin the lore of the game. There are other nice mods on the workshop to install and you can check out nexusmods for much more!

This game is famous for the ""I used to be an adventurer like you, but I took an arrow to the knee"" meme of 2011. It's a dank meme and much more tasteful than the trash those zoomers crap out.

It's a great game overall despite some bugs here and there, but remember the ol' saying from our God Todd Howard:

25397,"A classic of our time
"
25398,I dont need to explain it you know why its good
25399,Bethesda Should be ashamed of there work on this game and all it's trashy dirty files they made millions and millions of $ on and never took pride in repairing any files resulting in a truly  unstable Game I've spent 900 hrs playing the game & twice that CRASHING and it's not my Gaming Rig !
25400,What hasn't been said about this amazing RPG its hands down the best game I've played. Tons of replayability and on PC there's even more content through the workshop.
25401,It's always good to comeback
25402,"Hours and hours of entertainment. Still one of the best open world games to play, even though it is quite old at this point. I have loved this game from launch and continue to love it now. Highly recommend, this is one for any type of gamer."
25403,"cool
"
25404,it is a must have
25405,This is one of my all time favorite games of all time. I have sunck count-less hours into this version and the xbox version of it. 12/10 rating from me.
25406,amazing
25407,"skrt
"
25408,"I'm a huge fantasy fan, but this game can only reach most modern player's expectation by installing external mods and ENBs, The Vanilla version is great for its time, but its not better than fallout 76, I rather play Fallout 76 which I hate instead of playing through the vanilla version of this game, in conclusion. spend your quid with triple considerations because this is a modern price for a vintage game"
25409,great game and it modable
25410,great base game and even better with decent mods. (use nexus mods for better gameplay whilst modded)
25411,Fantastic game with a ton of replayability and a plethora of available mods that'll always keep things interesting.
25412,Perfect game
25413,Could't find a better game.
25414,"this is game is bad unless you mod the hell outta of it then it is good but like also its addictive but not cuz todd howard
,"
25415,"love it
"
25416,"This  game  is really cool with  its, fighting, graphics and  more. If you looking  forward for good fighting  experience, I recommend this game."
25417,good
25418,gud
25419,"I have this game on several platforms and it fills the role of the game you dip into and a game you can binge. I've re-started the game (and gone to make a coffee during the opening cutscene) more times than I remember. I'm still finding new things, the world feels really alive and you are rewarded for approaching situations in the game in the character style you have chosen. 

For anyone on the fence about this, maybe if you missed it when it was re-released the last dozen times, it's the story of a born jack-of-all-trades who falls and fails upwards wherever they go. It's the ultimate fantasy trip where you're a wizard-fighter-thief, can pick any lock with enough lockpicks, can pick up any weapon and use it and can set things on fire with your mind. You're not only destined to be the lynch pin in the local civil war and the chosen one who will decide the fate of the realm in the end times, you're also about 3 chores away from being the grand master/high priest/guildmistress/poohbah-in-chief of any organisation that looks at you. And despite all that unlikely luck, the story you create as you play will be surprising, unique and even a little challenging at times. No spoilers, but I visited Shearpoint in the early game while on a hike up an interesting mountain and got both buttocks handed to me for not knowing when to run away.

I've seen this game played as a godspawn murderfest, a flower collection simulator and a therapy device for a hoarder. It's got enough depth and variety for a full playthrough on every release it has had and you'll still struggle to see everything. 

The 2 story DLCs are full-size expansions with satisfying arcs that are the length of full games, and additional features that seamlessly merge with the main game - I recommend starting your first playthrough with both Dawnguard and Dragonborn installed because they integrate perfectly and really add to the size of the world and the depth of two common enemy types. 

"
25420,"Actually the game is bad. It's the mod that make ""ALL"" the difference. Please support the modders."
25421,"You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Why do you care? A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.

...looks like the Thalmor are with him.

General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.

Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us."
25422,"This game has bloody hours of endless fun awaiting you. Fun gameplay, a decent story and an expansive open world with secrets and battles around every corner. And especially with mods, this game is unending fun. 10/10. You will not regret purchasing."
25423,"This game is amazing! Played the vanilla experience first then played with mods. Just Visual enhancements and quality of live mods. Everyone should try The Elders Scrolls: Skyrim vanilla at least 4 times.  Sure some aspects of the game are dated(graphics, menus, combat, etc) but during its time, the game was legendary, even today. Many memorable characters to traverse the land of Skyrim with or when you meet them on quest. Love this game."
25424,I have spent 6 full days (136 hours)  of my  life playing this game and let me tell you it was worth almost every hour. Would I reccomend it? That depends on how bad you want a social life.
25425,"Best RPG out there by far in my personal opinion. There is SO much to do and collect and complete. And all the Mods make this game an extra fun / excited game. 9.5/10   HIGHLY recommend it,"
25426,"IT IS MY LIFE NOW, JOIN OUR CULT"
25427,SUCH an open world. its amazing. Roam FOREVER

25430,Best Sandbox Ever! Get Script extender to help with glitches.
25431,"Great game, better with mods. You can play this game for hours and just not get bored. Highly recommend the game."
25432,"Skyrim is (for me, that is) addictive. Like the signature start of TES, you're a prisoner. Yet this time, instead of in jail, you're on your way to...whatever fate the gods have install for you. Here starts an epic quest line that can be followed at leisure. You need not hurry. Given the graphics of this particular Elder Scrolls, you might want to consider just cruising around and enjoying what the land of the Nords has to offer. Interesting and memorable NPCs to be had. If you wear an amulet of Mara you might just end up being propositioned by members of any race and/or sex! It's all about sharing what little time there is left in this world with someone - not about the sex.
There are numerous mods available (of course) some of which provide amusing and entertaining companions and further quest lines to keep you at this game for hours. Other mods do an amazing job altering the graphics and atmosphere of the game to an almost photo-realistic level. I tip my hat to the talented people who are that creative. Other mods make life ""easier"" but no less fun.
You will have choices to make, naturally. These all have an impact on the world around you in sometimes subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Want to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood? Can do! They're still kicking around. Want to be a werewolf? Yup. It's possible! Vampire? Sure. Just get infected with the right disease. Unfortunately, vampires in Skyrim for me, are a bit of a let down. In Oblivion you actually ""fed"" off your victims. The graphics even depicted you leaning over the sleeping victim as you drank. In Skyrim it's a vitality draining spell. Bit of a let down to be honest with you. I'm sure there's a mod out there that might take us back to the days of Oblivion and the endless need to feed. Haven't found it yet! I'll be diving back into Skyrim once again to see how far I can push the war, the Jarls and the dragons. I think Skyrim is becoming more and more home for me.
Must be a Nord.

25433,"With enough mods (by enough I mean over 100), you can turn Skyrim into an entirely different game."

25471,it's ok
25472,Its one of the best RPG. Still in 2019 very playable. Good mod community. With mods its graphics / sounds still very good.
25473,Holy hell good game.
25474,fuck off
25475,"GLITCH AS FUCK, but still a good game.

I had to resort to console commands several times to fix broken quests, I don't remember the game being this glitchy back on the xbox 360"
25476,"swords, dragons and magic. 10/10"
25477,"One of the best RPG's of all time, done very well. 
A must play for any true fan of RPG's."
25478,Pretty neat
25479,10/10 best adventure game I've ever played
25480,"Played the shit out of this game on xbox, pc has more glitches."
25481,all
25482,good
25483,"Buggy, boring, soulless game. DID NOT live up to the hype surrounding it. You shouldn't need mods to make this a fun game."
25484,its skyrim my guy its one of the best games ever made who cares about reviews
25485,"best game ever
"
25486,good!!!
25487,"great game. I really like the solo player.  This is my 5th or 6th time thru, I've lost count. I think the weapons action is what sells me on the game; that is why I like to play it over and over."
25488,i live and breath skyrim lol love it
25489,This game is an automatic classic!
25490,"its skyrim, need i say more?"
25491,Make Elder Scrolls 6 already
25492,I play this game when i want to forget about the real world. its so magical and inviting. i honestly just walk around looking at the landscape. fun for people who like exploring.
25493,I love the base game and recently started trying out mods and I've fell back in love with this game. So much variety and hours of fun!
25494,It's a very modible game.
25495,"THIS IS AN AMAZING FANTASY RPG 11 OUT OF TEN. sorry i had capslock on... this is a game you should pick up. very similar to fallout new vegas, another masterpiece https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/
--NOTICE--
this is also a way to get this game if you see this review as bethesda decided to take this out of search

--PS--
if you want the great dlc you cannot find them for the old version"
25496,Good game
25497,Great Game. Too bad the new company hides all the good stuff.
25498,It skyrim thats all need be said
25499,"The current benchmark that the next decade's sword-&-sorcery single-player games will be measured against.  Very replayable with different play-styles, especially with mods."
25500,Love this game. Its a classic that you can play forever.
25501,"It's Skyrim, what more is there to say...
Vast open world, close to an infinite things to do especially if you mod it....

GG"
25502,Fun game mods add so much more to it hrs on hrs of enjoyment
25503,"It's Skyrim. I mean, c'mon.
"
25504,"It's skyrim, what do you expect?"
25505,One of the best games
25506,"Free roam, good graphics, good story line
Dislikes- mainline quest are forced on  you to move maybe sooner than you would like, Dungeon crawling to obtain enough gold."
25507,"Detail, immersion and story...one of the best fantasy RPGs ever!"
25508,"Best Game ever, no word of a lie"
25509,"shits good
"
25510,"If you actually complete the story, you get hundreds of hours of play time. I just beat the main story line a day ago and it was a lot more interesting and fun than I thought it would be."
25511,A beautiful adventure yay!
25512,its good
25513,oh yeah
25514,"I had fun, that's it, get it."
25515,"Its the best game ever -_-
"
25516,great games
25517,"FUS RO DAH
"
25518,skyrim
25519,"this game has ridiculous amounts of playtime and replayability, bit nuggy sometimes, but not always, and the mods make it 100 times better"
25520,well y know theres a lot to do
25521, good
25522,great
25523,"Some people think they're querky like ""oh yeah I've never seen star wars"" or ""i think the beatles are overrated :)"" well to all those people I raise my cup and say I've never modded skyrim and I thoroughly enjoy it that way."
25524,Can't stop playing this awesome game.
25525,one of my favorite games and still play  it after 9 years lol
25526,"Skyrim is a well known game which has been sold many different times, I didn't think I'd want the DLCs so I bought the 'Oldrim' however now I would encourage any buyers to purchase either legendary or special edition. The base game has no horrible issues, only parts of it that leave one feeling unsatisfied, and the DLCs don't fix that but they allow you to more easily solve skyrim's issues with M O D S, the guardian angel of Bethesda. There are thousands of mods that can completely change the way you play the game, and most people told me before I installed the game, that I should install mods before I even start it up for the first time. I regret not heeding their advice so I pass it on like an old war veteran does to his son to warn about the horrors of war, in the feeble attempt that they might believe my true regret in not modding the game.

Really you can just play without mods it just gets kinda boring."
25527,"This game is timeless, no matter what changes in my life this game is always there, either on steam or any other consle, this game makes me so happy, every quest is a masterwork of story telling, everything feeds into each other. If you haven't played this game, just buy it(also download some mods)"
25528,"good game
"
25529,"Had to find another way to buy the Legendary Edition, totally worth it"
25530,Havent been bored for dayyysszz...................thx Skyrim!
25531,"Modding this game consumed many hours of my time and I'm pretty sure I spent more time doing screenarchery than playing...but still so worth it. Plus, it taught me how to use photoshop, GIMP, and 3DSmax. Oh and the roleplaying is always a plus. :)"
25532,This game tho
25533,"bang
"
25534,what can i say except stop crashing from the damn mods <3
25535,She's a server; she likes to serve
25536,The best game ever!!!
25537,"An immersive world.  Lots of entertainment to be had for hours, days even."
25538,:D
25539,Classic DnD feel without all the necessity of parties and mmos. A dream come true. :D
25540,Yes.
25541,"best game ever by far
"
25542,It is like an ex-girlfriend that you can't get over and keep coming back over and over throughout the years.
25543,"Perfect game with no flaws, it just works"
25544,"i have slaughtered every town and city too many times to be considered the hero of skyrim but when i pay off a bounty i'm good as new 
10/10 would slaughter anything that moves again"
25545,Its okay I guess
25546,yes
25547,"My first time playing Skyrim was OK, but forgettable (prefer older TES titles). However, the thriving mod community for this game lifted Skyrim up to one of my favorites, making up for what the ""vanilla"" game was missing. Modding does have a learning curve, but allows more character customization and excellent fan-made graphics/texture/lighting/weather updates, quests, locations (including player homes), companions (and other NPCs), talent tree revamps, ways to skip ""cart ride"" intro sequence, ignore the boring main quest, and much more. For its absolute abundance of awesome fan-made mods, I'd recommend Skyrim."
25548,It's a game.
25549,Best Single Player RPG ever.
25550,nice
25551,"This is the best game i have ever played. I've already sunk over one thousand hours into it, and i will gladly add a lot of time to that count. The game itself is really good, but what really makes it great is the ability to mod it, and mod it beyond any borders. I don't think there is anything that you couldn't achieve through mods in Skyrim, and that really boosts the replayability value of this game, as evidenced by the time i spent on it. Absolutely love it; if somehow you haven't played it yet, you definitely should!"
25552,Good
25553,ah yes my favorite half life mod
25554,It's  good
25555,"This game is just beautiful! I am a casual player but this game ticks off all my boxes for great lore, amazing action, beautiful settings and stunning design, and pure entertainment in a fantasy atmosphere! I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoy open world game play and fantasy!"
25556,Love skyrim so addicting.
25557,Great singe player storyline. No stupid mandatory mutiplayer requirement
25558,"It's Skyrim, need I say more? If you love open worlds with tons of non-essential side quests and places to explore this is your game (like the ones before it)."
25559,"this is literally the best game ive ever played, and i have quite the extensive library. It's compatability with mods is a slight plus, because mods can make the game better or worse. Skyrim by itself is just such a beauty and i wouldn't change a thing."
25560,its fun....
25561,"Weird to give it a negative after so many hours played, but I guess the dissapointment was bigger because I really wanted to like this game, I was waiting long for the moment my actions will catch up with me, trying to build my character and the world around him. But the moment never came. Huge world, but very shallow. Ultimately your actions in one place have little to no effect in others. I much prefer the Witcher series."
25562,Regardless of what anyone else ever says. Skyrim will continue to be my favorite game for quite some time. I have yet to actually get tired of it.
25563,good
25564,This is the best game I have ever played.
25565,the best game ever :)
25566,"nice
"
25567,"Pro's: Ragnar the red
con's: not enough Ragnar the red"
25568,Just the best game
25569,"I played a lot of Oblivion and I like Skyrim even more..  If you don't like some things, you can go to nexmods and download mods and play it however you want..  Lots of mods to choose from to make the gameplay more fun."
25570,is gud.
25571,nice adventure
25572,Definitely a must play
25573,very gud
25574,dope af

25577,This game is amazing! The Detail! The lore! The whole damn series! Awesome!
25578,"It's skyrim, if you haven't played it you have no idea what you are doing. Every game is a skyrim clone, every game wants what skyrim has but can't have it because it belongs to skyrim. Just play the game1"
25579,One the greatest games ever to be released .
25580,awesome game..always come back to restart and throw down

25593,"This game made an old lady famous, so yes, it's a good game"
25594,pretty okay
25595,Download mods for a wacky experience
25596,Just one of the best RPG's ever made with an epic modding community. I Hope this isn't peak Bethseda.
25597,"Great game for stress relief and you can add all kinds of mods to make the game just how you want it,"
25598,This game slaps hard bro
25599,"I find this game to be a bit more simpler than other Elder Scrolls games, which is honestly fine for me. I like to unwind after a long day, so in Skyrim I don't really have to worry about a lot of stat mechanics. I just hop on and do whatever I want."
25600,"when this world lets you down, why not choose another?"
25601,its my favorite pc game
25602,Sklaricinir!
25603,best game ever

25630,fun grind
25631,Open world freedom. Excellent.
25632,Great game one of all time favorites
25633,Great game. modding is tricky at first but then it turns into a cake walk.
25634,"Skyrim is Great. I have 883 hours played to Date. Do I like it? Ugh,,,,,Yeah....."

25649,fus-roh-dah

25652,g00t
25653,"Good game, probably should play the special edition though."
25654,game fun i like game
25655,This game is huge. Every now and again i keep coming back to this game and it is always worth it. Definitely buy this game if you have a spare £15. You wont regret it.
25656,there is more than enough to do as you can see *cough* 682 hours *cough*
25657,big yes. do it. buy. it. its great
25658,"I love, all off it."
25659,"A runner-up to the RPG of the century, right after Witcher III: Wild Hunt"
25660,Best computer game ever created.  Infinite play ability with mods.
25661,its good.
25662,It's fun
25663,SkYrEm.
25664,g
25665,Started playing. wanderred off and did some sidequests for hours. Got bored and decided to finish the main story. 10/10
25666,An amazing game!!  Worth the purchase.
25667,very good gem i lik
25668,Good
25669,its skyrim...
25670,Godd Howard hes blessed us with this game.
25671,still a fun game to pass the time and lots of mod options
25672,I fuckin love Skyrim
25673,9.5 out of 10.
25674,Great game! You get lost in this for days at a stretch if you get in
25675,Best Elder scrolls
25676,"This is one of the greatest video games ever created, simply for its factor of limitless creativity. I beat the first without mods, got bored, and left for quite some time. I now find myself in cycles of downloading new mods, having new adventures, and waiting for my next ideas to come. That being said, it does have its problems, but they don't detract from the beauty of this game whatsoever. I highly encourage everyone to pick up this game. It's a classic, and 100% necessary to fully understand various pop-culture references to this game. 11/10. I cannot wait for their next installment to the single player series."
25677,"I mean, its Skyrim boi."
25678,drink ale out of cUuurved horns
25679,"Yeah, it's fun, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already."
25680,This is Skyrim.  All you need to know is you will be transported to a land where you have the ability to do whatever you want. Follow the story?  posh go out and do what you want. Rob a man and kill him in front of his kids. Be whoever you want and you will see why this game is 10/10
25681,Great Game
25682,BEST Game ever
25683,It just works
25684,"I usually playthrough until I'm about level 35, then I create a new character and go a different path. Great to play any way, any day, although you'll usually end up as a stealth archer, no matter which direction you start with. Giant battles are awesome. If you get bored easily like me, then there are hundreds of easy-to-install mods for things like character customization. killing children, and making the world more beautiful... also shieldmaidens, if you're into that."
25685,My wife left me because I played this too much
25686,LOVE IT!!
25687,This game is one of the best games around. Kept alive by mods and is able to withstand the age of time. This game overall is a thumbs up with many things to do in it. Never gets old due to open modding. Little glitchy here and there but with mods from supportive modders this game has been outstanding.
25688,"this game is amazing, you can never run out of stuff to do, theirs always another build you could play as or another mod you could get to make the game 10x more fun"
25689,YES
25690,Give me vr free and i give thumb up
25691,"Bethesda keep desperately trying to resell Skyrim, just because they're incapable of releasing a new title. I am outraged to discover that there is DLC that I now cannot download separately without buying the full game. As a fan of the modding community that has grown around this game, this creates a particular issue in that many more recent mods require the Dawnguard DLC. I do not want to pay £30 for a game I already own in order to obtain this one particular piece of DLC.

Just because legislation around these sorts of shady business practices towards consumers has not yet caught up with video games, isn't an excuse for this genuine extortion. Unchecked it will be what eventually ruins, and is ruining, the industry.

EDIT

OK. So what I didn't realise is that there are now several versions of Skyrim available on steam... I am lucky to have the older version, for which the DLC is still separate... However what is just as disgusting is that when you search the store for Skyrim, this older, more mod compatible version doesn't show. You have to hunt around the community section to find it. Disgraceful on Steam's part as well as Bethesda's for continually trying to trot out this badly ageing wreak of a bygone age for full price."
25692,"It's Skyrim what is there really to say other than if you haven't played it yet, play it. You won't regret it."
25693,its all right
25694,"Man did they screw us over, I cant even get the one DLC im missing you aint getting my money ever again Todd."
25695,it is an amazing game with great graphics
25696,10/10
25697,Great.
25698,its Skyrim its great and  unlike some of soft-boys on here i wont change my review for first world problems
25699,yes good game am like
25700,"But...
there's one they fear...
in their tongue he is dovakhiin, 
DRAGONBORN!"
25701,(((todd howard)))
25702,Just amazing
25703,11/10 would let this game steal my sweetroll again.
25704,Is oke
25705,"So far, probably the best game ever made. Virtually unlimited ability to be replayed (replayability?), insane amounts of mods, which go from smoothing out gameplay in tiny but significant ways, to completely overhauling the feel of the game, and a story that gives you enough places to make different choices that you rarely get bored. I've put hundreds (plural) of hours playing this on Xbox, over 100 hours on PC, and I still come back to this game year after year after year. Game Of The Year? I think not. Game Of The Decade...maybe we're getting somewhere."
25706,"After a recent update by Bethesda, I am no longer able to launch the game. WTF Bethesda. I want to play this game NOW, but I can't."
25707,great game if they could just make npc's a bit more human with personalites that react to situations instead of being like robots from westworld would be 5 stars but ill just give it 7/10
25708,its like dummy lit
25709,One of the greatest games ever made.
25710,"Skyrim, and you found it!!! SKSE route or...?"
25711,one of the best rpg games ever.
25712,best rpg I have ever played
25713,Play legendary only
25714,thanks todd
25715,yee
25716,Addictive
25717,FuuuuUUUUUUUUUS RO DAH!
25718,nice
25719,Don't support Bethesda.
25720,cool as hell
25721,Kinda good
25722,"Game is great, publisher is horrible.

Combined with all the other crap that Bethesda has pulled in the past 5 years, they have now revoked all access to their games through GeForce now.

Bethesda has unilaterally decided that you don't have the right to play a copy of a game you paid for on a different computer.

Greedy and Anti-consumer.

Regardless of how good the game is, if you have a principled stance on consumer rights, you cannot support this company.

EDIT: I also didn't notice until I went to make this review that Bethesda has unlisted the original version of Skyrim, making it impossible to buy it or any of the DLC, so if you have anything short of already owning the game and all the DLC, you're forced to use the Special Edition where they can force Creation Club down your throat. Disgusting."
25723,"Ideal for the adventure loving free roam thrill seeking gamer who also might just want to do nothing at all but screw around. This is the best game for someone like me, who loves adventure and quests, but the option to just not even, and do whatever instead."
25724,RPG at its best
25725,yes
25726,game's pretty fun if you get the right mods
25727,"It has aged not like fine wine, but honestly that stuff sucks anyway. Fun and relatively basic RPG game from 2011 with hundreds of hours worth of content, good DLC and a simple but also somewhat flexible combat system and much effort put into it. And that's not even mentioning the modding potential of this game, which you might not have heard of if you have been living under a rock for years (or avoid video games). Fun use of time and has had many people entertained and still playing it, even close to 10 years later. Keep enjoying it guys. X)"
25728,horse
25729," If you have not played this game yet, you're wrong."
25730,"Open World, Engaging Story, and mods that give this game a longer lasting effect."
25731,I've been looking for you. Got something i'm supposed to deliver. Your hands only. Leeets see here. Ahh looks like that's it. Got to go.
25732,Here be dragons.
25733,awesome awesome game.....
25734,Awesome game
25735,"What is there to say, third time I buy the bloody game, before Steam I lost it twice. Epic af."
25736,Just do it! ;)
25737,Well finished product and then some
25738,even after 400 hours you still wont see/do everything
25739,"forever will love this game lol, started on xbox and now we are here"
25740,Hundreds of hours and I have never made it past the main quest in Whiterun.  10/10 will probably keep playing for years without actually getting anything done.
25741,gets better to play when you've learnt to how play it abit (it takes a little while to get used to all the settings)
25742,You can spend so much time in this beautiful game.
25743,Great game. Great 'modability'. What more can you ask for.
25744,nah lol
25745,dude it skyrim google it if you really care
25746,GREAT GAME TO  PASS THE TIME WITH.
25747,h
25748,its fun to pass the time if you have no life....
25749,It's Skyrim dude
25750,i LOved everything and disliked nothing.
25751,"super fun
"
25752,killed a dragon 10/10
25753,good
25754,"So... redownload this on PC after years, only to find I can no longer buy DLC for it, essentially rendering 3/4s of the workshop useless. Thanks Todd."
25755,yep
25756,It's Elder Scrolls. Nuff said.
25757,you do not play with 1773 hr if you do not like it.
25758,Outstanding!
25759,Despite unfixed bugs - this game was made to be played for an astounding amount of hours. This is a live DnD session for everyone to be tossed into. Worth the money still
25760,I like it so I would assume my friends would like it also
25761,The best open world action rpg game ever !!!
25762,it was a revolutionary game of its time and is still enjoyable today. It's simply a legendary game.
25763,Alright RPG. Mods make it great
25764,"I've played through this game dozens of times, and it hasn't gotten boring yet. Some parts of it get stale, like repetitive quests, but there is more than enough exploration and subtle details to make every playthrough unique. 10/10 amazing game"
25765,9/10
25766,Great to spend time in
25767,"Play this
A true masterpiece"
25768,I think I've spent 400 hour trying to get this piece of garbage to run. A couple years ago it ran fine.  Keep away from this pile of garbage.  I feel like every time you want to play this you have to uninstall & then wait for the reinstall.  And 90 percent of the time that does nothing.  As everyone knows Bethesda basically has no consumer support
25769,"Bethesda's best game in my opinion. It is beginner friendly, there is a vast amount of quests and items. The gameplay is fun with the combat being a little repetitive. I would recommend modding the game to improve visuals and gameplay. The game is quite buggy so I would roccomend skyrim unofficial patch which fixes a large number of the bugs and glitches. 
10/10
"
25770,Best RPG ever made. Need I say morre?
25771,"Base Skyrim is good.

Skyrim with mods is even better.
"
25772,"I love this game, so much to do init. I never get bored of it. You can add sooooo many mods to it to make the game different each time you play it. The only downside is that you have to check for updated mods and also if they are compatible with other mods."
25773,"in my opinion, skyrim stands next to the witcher 3 as one of the greatest role playing games ever released. 2020 and it still keeps up with modern rpg's."
25774,good
25775,Sprawling adventure RPG
25776,"love this game one of my favorites
"
25777,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH this game with mods is amazing it was great 10/10
25778,"Never gets old, still playing in 2020"
25779,Always great games from the Elder Scrolls series.
25780,REALLY FUN AND AMAZING... *drop mic*
25781,Skyrim is a fun game that has almost unlimited playability.  When you add in mods that distant limit lifts.  I still come back to this game and play even though I've had it since it first came out.
25782,"Considering the 54 hours is the lowest number I've put into Skyrim on a platform speaks volumes.

Skyrim is legendary, and one of the games of the decade for the 2010s. Seriously. How have you not played this yet?"
25783,mods
25784,"Majestic snow-capped peaks beckon in the distance as you ride your horse along the winding road surrounded by lush forest that conceals both threat and treasure, adventuring in a vast landscape accompanied by lilting beautiful music. This is Skyrim.

The huge variety of skills your character can earn and the combinations of magic, sword fighting, and thievery that are possible will allow you to play the game the way you like the most. That is not unique to Skyrim as most RPGs will do that, but it is a very appealing feature. The edge this game has over most other RPGs I've played is the quasi-medieval fantasy setting. No guns, no skyscrapers, nothing to remind you of the modern world, total escapism.

Having played this game for 333 hours and spending nearly 290 of those hours before finishing the main questline, it is abundantly clear that once Skyrim has you in its grip there is rarely a reason to leave it. Indeed, the radiant random quest generator in many NPCs ensures that the game never really ends. You could play Skyrim forever if you wanted. The enormous number of community-built addons for it could certainly keep you entertained forever, but I've had a wonderful experience with the game using only a few enhanced texture packs and the baseline gameplay. I didn't even start the Thieves Guild, Vampire, or Dark Brotherhood quest lines and there was no shortage of fun quests to do. The game is huge. It is fairly light on politics and heavy on fighting, and the most enduring mystery of the game is the fate of the Dwemer. Raiding dungeons, fetching unique artefacts, solving basic door puzzles, inventory management, and fighting for survival are the main activities. There's even a few moral challenges along the way, as you choose your occupation, who to side with, who to save and who to kill. 

Many achievements await the dedicated adventurer, such as your first dragon kill, first enchanted weapon, first house purchase, two epic battles with Alduin, and winning the Skyrim civil war.

All I know is that Skyrim is the most enthralling game I've ever played, and that is still true nine years after it was originally released."
25785,simply the best !!!
25786,Great game some of the bugs are hilarious 10/10 would recomend.
25787,yes
25788,great graphics atmosphere and a huge array of things to do.
25789,good shit
25790,Great Mods : D
25791,todd howard.
25792,ilugoufougyf
25793,Best game ever.
25794,Awesome sandboxy rpg. A true classic.
25795,It just works
25796,"Great, no Awesome, no wait LEGENDARY."
25797,"It's fuckin Skyrim, what's not like."
25798,very good game
25799,"Everybody knows what Skyrim is and everyone knows how good it is.
You know of all the bugs and you jstu simply love it. The world is the most interactive one in video game history; you can go throw a dart on the map and land in a village with a guy offering you some quest that's gonna take you 1.5h to play through and feel adventurous and rewarding at the same time.
You can either play through the main quest line and be an awesome dragon slayer or just ignore it and go out to seek your own path.
All in all, eventhough often times dungeons feel somewhat repeated, it's not only a worthwhile time investment but also the top notch of video game quality!"
25800,"You should get the special edition if you're gonna get this game, but it is very fun and really easy to spend hours playing. I think it looks great for when it was made, but if you download a few free mods, it can look just as good as most of the games being put out there currently."
25801,I should not have to type anything here. The game speaks for itself.
25802,fun
25803,The best elder scrolls game.
25804,Fun game and with mods never gets boring
25805,todd did good on this one
25806,I put about 400 hours into this game on my playstation 4 before switching over to pc. 10/10 would recommend.
25807,got this for $8 its skyrim dont pay again or any more
25808,Recommended
25809,One of the best games ever made.
25810,favorite game ever
25811,One of the most amazing games ever created on Earth.
25812,Great game
25813,Best game ever.
25814,It's a classic anyone can pick up or you can always come back to
25815,This is an amazingly detailed game. The deep story that you affect as you journey across the vast continent of Skyrim is one of the most immersive experiences ever coded!
25816,"sex
"
25817,"So far the best elder scrolls game. If you like sword and sorcery genre rpgs, this game will most likely draw you in for hours. Plus, all the available mods can make you keep coming back years later with always something new to try."
25818,Its good
25819,Bethesda has illegally blocked me from accessing my own products on a third part service (GeForce Now) I will not be buying another product from a company that treats its customers and licenses to worthlessly.
25820,"Theres many things to do to the point where you will NEVER become  bored, with many quests , and even mods where u can add even more quests and have more adventure this game can be one of your actives for many years"
25821,it good.
25822,It's not bad.
25823,"I put 536 hours into this game and I can honestly say that I can never get tired of it, no matter how much I play it."
25824,slyrim
25825,it was okay
25826,THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND AND CLASSIC OF A GAME BUY IT NOW
25827,best game ever (so far (bethesda cmon))
25828,"The fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls Series.  Of course I bought it right away; Daggerfall amazed me as a kid, I spent hours in Morrowind in high school, and after college I had a great time playing Oblivion.  I have almost nothing but good things to say about those games.  The stories and characters were fun.  The magic systems were great, I had a blast creating spells in Morrowind.  The quest lines in Oblivion were fantastic and worth doing twice. 

Then I got Skyrim...  It has none of the good things from previous installments.  I kept playing expecting it to ""get good at any minute now"" and it just didn't.  I blamed myself at first, and consulted a friend who loved the game.  ""Well, here's the thing"" he said ""Its a really fun game, great.  You just need some mods. Like a lot. Total game overhauls, reimagined systems, everything, its great as long its not anything like how the developers made it.""  

...
...
-.-
That can be said about any terrible game, and usually only said about terrible games.  If it has to be totally changed to be good, then it is a really bad game.  And that's the best thing a huge fan and Bethesda shill had to say about the game!  When your selling point is that players have modded the game to a playable state you know you have made a downright garbage game.  

Now lets get into how terrible Bethesda is.  Paid mods, removing game versions from the store, their greed has gotta be barely legal at this point.  They left immoral in the dust, zipped right past shady business dealings, and now Todd Howard is synonymous with Avarice, of the seven deadly sins.  Bethesda is straight up ripping off fans and using the fan's passion for the franchise to get away with it.  I've met self proclaimed Nigerian princes with more ethical business sense.  

In short, do not buy this game.  There are plenty of good RPGs out there for you.  Even if for some reason you think you'll enjoy the bland, dumbed down, thoughtless, empty gameplay... You still shouldn't give money to Bethesda.  When you give money to the kind of greed Bethesda represents, other companies think they can act that way and gamers everywhere get fucked."
25829,Best game
25830,Good
25831,duhhh... it's my baby.
25832,"goeie
"
25833,this game is one of the best games i have played
25834,I have this game for about 6years. Still playing. 0 mods installed
25835,"Thanks for hiding the Original versions of Skyrim AS WELL as all the DLC, so that newcomers would spend more money on Legendary/Special Edition. You Bethesda are dropping at such an amazing rate it's amazing there are still people who are trying to defend you.

I own Skyrim since 2011.
I want to buy the DLC.
i DO NOT want to spend 40 euro on Special Edition just so i can unlock the Hearthfire DLC wich is worth less than 5 euro!
Stop fishing for money like this, it's gross.

 Also, for people who looking for review about the game in case you are new and never played it, i'd say buy it. It is Skyrim, there are countless Mods that change every aspect of the game as well as amazing people out there who keep this game looking fresh since 2011. I can't start to point out goods/negatives because there are so many of them but the game is totally worth it."
25836,"Skyrim is still one of the best games out there, with a lively online community and beautiful story line and graphics."
25837,u
25838,"kinda weird how Bethesda continually rereleases a sandbox with a main objective being a bucket collection, but great fun all the same."
25839,"Had this game for 9 years and never made a review. Well, the answer is obvious."
25840,favorite game!
25841,"You always find something to do... And if you don't, you find a mod with something to do."
25842,"yes
"
25843,It's an ok game only worth a few hours at best
25844,The ability to go where ever you wish is great.You have the freedom to choose how you want to play.
25845,Only game that i really came back to time and time again. From vanilla with all the different mods you really can play forever
25846,"it's a fun experience, with amazing graphics"
25847,Best game ever and even is old but still the best...
25848,THIS IS A GAMING CLASSIC !!!!!! If you love RPG'S this is an absolute must play
25849,"One of the best Rpgs out there and this was my first RPG game ever 
"
25850,"This game is great I can't recommend it more but like who am I even talking to at this point that hasn't played it by now. I wish you could still get the DLC on here, do yourself a favor and buy one of the other editions so you get the DLC because it's worth it. Also look into some mods that improve the game tenfold."
25851,"This is easily one of the best forms of media ever created by human hands. If you're even considering purchasing this product, don't consider anymore, Skyrim is well worth any amount of time you put into it if you enjoy a fantasy setting."
25852,I guess it's ok.
25853,Great old game. I have recently returned to playing the game to add a few mods to enhance and add to the play. There are some really decent mods for Skyrim Eldaerscrolls. Am currently also installing Skyrim SE to see the difference. Looks good. SE mods also look a bit better than the older 32bit game. See what happens.
25854,"Great game
"
25855,MODS it till it crash ORRRR end up becoming another game that looks like syrim......
25856,"Great graphics, and the beginning is awesome! I am almost done making my first character!"
25857,skyrim
25858,One of the most amazing and immersive games I have ever played. It is full of all sorts of fun play-styles. Worth every cent I paid and more.
25859,I T  J U S T  W O R K S
25860,yes of course
25861,"The reason this game is fun is mostly because it doesn't need you to be connected to the internet.  It doesn't need you to play with people online.  It doesn't need you to be busy for 50 minutes at a time for rounds.  It doesn't have a toxic community.  This game is like playing Banjo Kazooie as an only child.  You go at your own pace, and find what there is to explore.  You were look things up less and less as you play, and you will see the world for what it is."
25862,<3
25863,i like everything of it... cannot think of anything I do not like... except being a better player than I am... Hummm. That's about it.
25864,BEST GAME OF ITS TIME!
25865,I love this game always have very original. Great story line. Good graphics. Just all in all one of my favorite games!

25874,Amazing game! I never get tired of playing this classic.
25875,its skyrim
25876,Amazing
25877,"Its a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. A lot of things are really basic and it certainly isn't perfect (I really wouldn't buy this game if you want a serious RPG), but it is fun in its own right. Lots to goof around with and weird mods to get. The modding community is half the reason to buy this game anyway. A must have when it  goes on sale (like it always does)."
25878,"gpoog
"
25879,"This game has sucked so much time out of my life and while a lot of it was really fun, there is nothing in this world that makes me more depressed and upset with myself that looking at my playtime for all my games. If I could see the total hours spent in all my games, in and out of steam, I'd probably kill myself. 10/10"
25880,A classic.
25881,"I played it, its good."
25882,
25883,"good
"
25884,oh god
25885,"fun
"
25886,"The game is fun but after a while it does eventually get boring after seeing the same thing over and over again which is why I would get mods after a while, only when you start getting bored of seeing the same old moon, sky, grass, trees, building, people, etc."
25887,"if you have beat the game at least twice, its time for mods."
25888,Historic
25889,play it its a nice game so yeah PLAY IT
25890,es
25891,"Class almost as good as farming simulator, almost but not there just yet"
25892,amzzing
25893,I love this game. Looking forward to the next installment.
25894,"too realistic woman i want reject me
"
25895,amazing mods gameplay and over all great game for everyone.
25896,It skyrim
25897,"It's skyrim. Probably a 10/10 with a handful of mods. It may be as shallow as a puddle, but that puddle is a ton of fun to splash around in."
25898,"you wont be able to find this review
"
25899,Yes
25900,gg
25901,it's very attractive;)
25902,good but wish you could fuck
25903,♥
25904,Fantastic game. Just sad that I haven't been able to play it on my microwave yet.
25905,"Very cool

just ask juan"
25906,top
25907,very good
25908,"Great game, wish there were more like it."
25909,...
25910,"One of the best games ever made - if you love a good story, real rpg and a large world full of adventures allowing you to be - for once - a good guy. Not the least: the mod community is awesome."
25911,"OK so, the base game without mods is sometimes incredibly broken, a Bethesda custom at this point I believe.
With the unofficial patch it gets much, much better. Even without it, I would recommend this amazing game. 
Almost every quest is a joy to play (except the thief's and mages guild, those feel like they were rushed without much thought)
The DLCs are all worth it and expand the already huge game with even more hours of play-time.
And thanks to an amazing community, many mods improve and complement the game even further. 
Even though its an older game, I still find myself coming back to it again and again."
25912,great
25913,Great game still in 2020
25914,"One of the greatest games of all time. With arguably the best, (and sometimes worst) modding community"
25915,"Ok so like this games old, like really old and it looks it and feels it. But the modding community is so vast and varied that you can basically take the relatively cool and generic template of ""Nordic midevil simulator"" and build a whole game around it. Think of it like buying an old mustang, it'll show its age but you can make it kick a**"
25916,eeeeeeeee
25917,Game Of The Millenium
25918,Worth buying for $20 or less.
25919,"Good game. Lots of replay value,"
25920,Millions can't be wrong.
25921,"This is a great game, the only problem is the greedy scum who limit modders as a way to make people buy their DLC and keep stuffing in microtransactions. Creative Assembly is FAR worse when it comes to this, especially Rome 2 Total War. We need to stop buying Total War games until they stop restricting modders and then creating 15 different DLCs as they restrict the modders to try and get people to buy their highly overpriced DLC (Most of which should have been included in the base game in the first place) that kind of stuff is really making me very very VERY angry."
25922,"I love this game.  You're not confined to be a mage who only casts spells and doesn't wear armour.  A warrior and thief can also cast spells. As you play, your most used skills are what makes your player unique. 

i keep coming back to this game. Now in 2020 I'm still playing it."
25923,"This is a endlessly replayable game. Especially with the MODDing community. If you don't already know about Skyrim, its time you find out"
25924,Goo
25925,"Even though it has been out for years, this is my all-time favorite game, no holds bar. Nothing could beat Skyrim."
25926,i enjoy
25927,"I've had this game on other systems, and outside of Steam since roughly 2013. Absolutely adore it. Hundreds and hundreds of hours pumped into it.
Honestly, there are probably thousands of hours of playtime in just the vanilla game (with DLC).
Cannot recommend it enough!"
25928,"It's Skyrim, why wouldn't you?"
25929,love the atmosphere and size of the virtual open world
25930,Mods fix this game.
25931,it good

25947,"Let`s be honest, Without mods this games is a dull piece of shit."
25948,You'll find something to do...
25949,"This is not merely a game. This is a beautiful, living world with endless possibilities. There never seems to be an end to all the content Skyrim has to offer. Truly a masterpiece."
25950,Believe the hype.
25951,is fun game with tons of mods that let you change the game so much you can actually make it unable to run if you choose the possiabilities are endless

25955,its fucking skyrim
25956,FUNNny sowrd game
25957,todd
25958,"I absolutely love the immersive qualities of this game. I sunk countless hours into mods, but the game is amazing without them. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys exploring open worlds and finding surprises."
25959,The best game ever made... the end
25960,Everything is just... perfect. Even in 2020.
25961,Great game! With a number of challenges and quests it keeps gameplay interesting and fun.
25962,Installed mod to make female models feet look really pretty and nice. Learned cheat to remove shoes on any NPC I find. :)

25970,like it
25971,With 144 hours you'd think I would've finished the main story by now...
25972,"yaes
"
25973,"Not as jank as Oblivion unless you immerse yourself purely in how the game works, so it works much better as a casual, pick up and play, semi-serious (in comparison) RPG. That being said, Oldrim is (largely) outdated compared to the re-releases, and only really advisable to pick up if you want to use a specific mod that was never updated. Otherwise, skip for whatever re-release is most present when you read this."
25974,I regret nothing
25975,the best game ever
25976,"Its Skyrim. Why haven't you played this?

Enjoy this, take in every last drop of passion and creativity because this is the last game Bethesda will make that isn't a pile of garbage rushed out of the door for a quick buck."
25977,"It's skyim, there's 30k people playing it after 10 fucking years, i ain't gotta explain shit."
25978,Epic Game
25979,EPIC!
25980,"Likes:
-Ability to mod my games to how I like it. It is the essence of what games should be; what the consumer wants
-Worth the price; Single Player with the prices like a Multi-player, developers need to put more content? Worth It.

"
25981,Lovely game
25982,"After playing casual for 60 hours i discoverd alchemy. 

10 minutes later my game crashed because i made a potion to boost entchanting by 14.000.000%
11/10 would destroy the world again"
25983,Fus ro fucking dah
25984,"Excellent rpg game that lets you explore the Tamriel region, Skyrim, at your own pace."
25985,"this game is a masterpiece. just everything about this game is amazing. dlc and main story is pretty ""meh"", but you should still get this game if you havent played it already. 10/10 one of my favorite games ever"
25986,"Do I even have to say anything about it? It's Skyrim. It's a classic, it's going to go down in history and I am going to force my kids to play it."
25987,Enough said...
25988,Amazing Game and it will be probably stay an amazing game for a very long time. Wish I could get that feeling of playing it for the first time again.
25989,"Holy shit, this brings back so many memories. I remember being in middle school when I used to look forward to the mythical time of three o'clock, when the school bells would finally ring, so that I could berate my dad into getting home quickly to sate my appetite for this game. 

I used to have a shitty lenovo laptop with an i3, 4 gigs of ram, and an integrated intel GPU, but I remember being satisfied with my 20 fps and immersed in the foggy and realized landscape of Skyrim. It was as if I really was staring at the beautiful leafless conifers that dotted the sprawling mountains, and that I really felt the water splash onto my legs as I ran alongside a wavering stream. 

This was the game that truly solidified my love for video games: it helped me reach the milestone of finally having over 100 hours in a game, it helped me see that video games were more than just another past-time—but a medium of art in itself. If you haven't played this game yet I'm envious of you, for you have yet to experience Skyrim's magic for the first time, like I did so many years ago."
25990,It's an Elder Scrolls game. Nothing more said =)
25991,good
25992,Loved everything about it!
25993,"  Hands down, a fantastic, entertaining game with hundreds of hours playing adventures that allow you to advance to level 100 should you so desire.. There are tons of races each with their own unique abilities, but you are more than unique. You are dragonborne. There is so much to explore and experience. Worth every penny. Loads of DLC, opening vast new worlds of wealth, You can even adopt a couple of rugrats to keep your home tidy."
25994,yes

25996,Come on Bethesda it's my first time playing Skyrim and I can't beat the first conversation boss fight.

26008,Fucccin litt!
26009,"modding makes this endlessly re-playable. also, modding can do wonders for the graphics."
26010,df ga ewTRf era gsze 4s
26011,One of the best RPGs.
26012,can't even get my dlc anymore thanks todd now i have to spend another 40 on a whole another copy
26013,great game love the freedom of the game
26014,don't add too many mods it only takes  one to update and break the game
26015,Pretty good
26016,"After all these years, Skyrim is still fun to play. Even if it crashes every time i play."
26017,meh
26018,It are very best
26019,One of the best games of all time.
26020,"Fun to play, easy to play, 100s of mods,  it seems like there are  unlimited quests, monsters and books to read from. A game I would recommend to anyone who likes single player story games"
26021,maybe the best game ever made
26022,"Find it to be a good game, can free roam which is one thing i like in games, if get bored of doing all the normal story missions / normal game play has many different mods for it which can add different story to said game."
26023,"Excellent first/third person role playing game that does NOT involve modern firearms.  The ability to modify the game gives it an endlessly ""new"" feel on subsequent playthroughs."
26024,"after min maxing into a godlike state and beating most enemies to death with a wooden sword, i ca safely say that this game gets a 10/10 from me. 
definitely enjoy the mod community allowing me to meme up my world"
26025,I like that part where you kill that old lady at the orphanage.
26026,"I mean, it's Skyrim. It's 2020, you know what's up."
26027,its such a fun game and ive played it ever since it came out on xbox and just recently finished it on pc such a good game
26028,"It's Skyrim.  It's been released for every platform known to man, including the Ti graphing calculator and the Samsung smart fridge.  One of the best Single player fantasy romps."
26029,a classic that'll live on forever
26030,"I love the fact that you can go where you want and do whatever you want.  Also, love the way you can build your character the way you feel suits your playstyle."
26031,"Really fun game,  like the interactivity. there are a few bugs, but they're usually pretty entertaining."

26035,Is it really so wrong to want to copulate with Paarthurnax?
26036,SUPER FUN
26037,You can spend countless hours playing and replaying especially after some mods are added expanding on the gameplay time
26038,"BUY SKYRIM, THEN BUY SPECIAL EDITON, BUY A COPY FOR EVERY CONSOLE, DIGITAL, AND PHYSICAL, BUY A SWITCH EDITION, DONT HAVE A SWITCH, BUY IT ANYWAY. YOU WILL BUY SKYRIM, AND IF YOU DONT TODD HOWARD WILL MAKE YOU PAY, FUS RO DAH!"
26039,:)
26040,thanks to the wonderful people at Bethesda I can no longer buy the DLC for my copy I am not going to pay the extra money to get the remastered.
26041,Good and fun needs mods to have characters and npc look ok
26042,"An amazing classic title, one of the few all time great RPG games through gaming history."
26043,"My only way to play this title was NVIDIA GeForce Now, where it is no longer available thanks to Bethesda. Of course I cannot request a refund, because I played like 8 hours already. I have no idea what kind of dispute the companies had, but it feels like I'm being told ""oh wait, we changed our mind, you can no longer play this game you bought, on a VM, because, well, reasons, and it's in our power to forbid you. thanks for the purchase, sucker""."
26044,It's Skyrim.
26045,good game better than Fallout 76 :P
26046,amazing so much to do an discover
26047,good
26048,It's atmospheric. Perfect for running away from your real world problems.
26049,"Very indepth RPG lot's to do, various story lines.  Played for over 200 hours."
26050,"Skyrim is a deep, immersive game play experience. It's fun to start over with different characters and try to play utilizing a different play style."
26051,One of my favorite games.
26052,Its a good game
26053,
26054,Ah yes!
26055,Still second best game ever made. right below Morrowind!
26056,"The cockroach of the gaming industry. 
I can't wait to play it on my toaster"
26057,"Hello
The game is real nice, but better with mods on your choice like enchant the graphic and realistic displays of environmental and items and npc.
I would recommend this game but if u have more money then grab the Special Edition instead, because it basically this one vision with all dlc automatic attach to it and packed along with better graphic environment."
26058,"After over 900 hours played on my own disc plus 334 here on steam, I must say this game is alright. Sometimes."
26059,"Fantastic, all around.  Console commands help in glitchtastic areas, too"

"
26062,i mean its skyrim yall come on you dont need me to tell you its a good game
26063,download sexy girl mods
26064,It's good.
26065,Mods make the game endless. Its a great game on its own but mods keep this game looking as good as the best looking games. With projects still to this day being created.
26066,"what are you even doing not playing this game, if there was more than 5 stars i would give it 100 out of 10. Praise God Howard"
26067,"its Skyrim
#FuckThalmor"
26068,"Worship this game from the PS3 & here I am buying PC for the sake to play Skyrim. I don't think I need to review this game while this series itself is probably a legend in game industry.
You seriously need to buy Dawnguard DLC, it even frustates me.
The mission is endless & pls no lollygagging.
Bethesda is your source of mods, magic & unique NPC.
Remember chicken is more important than any men lives."
26069,good

26074,"its skyrim, you know its good"
26075,10 out of 5 stars love this game
26076,i liked everything.....
26077,"Magnificent and immersive. Runs really well on modest hardware. The only real complaint would be the console menu systems which is ill suited to PC use, but everything else is fabulous."
26078,good i guess
26079,"Shit's lit, yo."
26080,great game
26081,Instant Classic!
26082,yES
26083,"stop, you've violated the law"
26084,Bethesda's inability to program a stable game engine is legendary at this point.
26085,remake oblivion!!
26086,I've been playing skyrim for around 8 years now and it has remained my favourite game EVER for all of those 8 years. If you haven't played yet you're missing out big time!
26087,AWSOMEE
26088,"Let me start off by saying, ive more then gotten my money's worth. And that this is by no means a bad game.

Now on to the meat of this rant.

Combat.
Combat has improved exponentially from oblivion and can be a lot of fun. From dual wielding, to magic I enjoy all of it. The problem with combat though is gets really stale really fast. Dual wielding seems to get the most repetitive. ""Spell-Swords"" type builds seem to be the least repetitive.

The big issue in combat is that.. there just honestly seems to be so little of it. And it looses its charm playing the game so much. Where are all the enemy's? Enter cave, kill about 10 bandits and leave. I can expect that same formula for just about any cave with the occasional cave having some draugr in it. Its just monotonous and repetitive. It just feels like when combat starts to get exciting, they're no more enemy's left. I feel like they should have added more skeletons, bandits, bears, elementals, etc to the world.

In closing, combat can be repetitive as long as the game has a strong driving story. Look at oblivion, combat was horrible, and I loved ever single bit of that game. Skyrim really falls short in the story department.

Story
The story this time around is by far my biggest gripe about the game. Skyrims story is a muddy, messy, insufferable piece of crap. The companions guild line quest is an amazing 6 quests long. One of the quests has you run into a cave, kill a bear and its complete. One bear. The dark brother quest was entertaining, but still so short. I miss oblivion's quest log that gave extra information, the extra little info the game for quests, and the stories that drew you in.

Lets move on to non guild/mainquest related quests.. Fetch X item, for Y reward. Plenty of games do this, but the difference is that you can have fun doing them. The amount of gold you get for completing these fetch quests is miniscule. Your better off doing another large quest and get some story while your at it.

Graphics
The graphics in this game are amazing, and you can tell they worked really hard here. From the reflections of your character in the water, to the night sky, or the way draugr's eyes glow the faintest blue under there helmet everything has been meticulously created. I thought it was amazing I could pick up a book and hold it by a cover, and it opened in game, then I can actually inspect it, then read it. Its things like this that draw you in.

But graphics aren't everything. Its like hanging out with a vegetarian friend and them serving you dinner. Sure you like the salad, tofu, and the fresh cut fruit salad he made but you hunger for that meat.. That meat is the story. You can only sustain yourself so long off of graphics and combat.

In closing, this is a great game. But its also comparable to a siren. It draws you in and your hooked, everything is amazing. But then you spend so much time in the land of skyrim that you realize something is very wrong. Play it and love it, but dont expect an amazing story. The world honestly doesn't give a crap if you are or aren't in it.

And there you go. Great game, with some personal negativity. Ive never given a ""quick-review"" of a game before so flame on."
26089,"The peak of the Elder Scrolls series. As part of an ancient prophecy, this beautiful and vast world is your oyster. Adventure through ancient ruins and dank caves, fight massive beasts, collect untold riches, and save the world from all manner of threats. Highly recommend this to any fans of Oblivion or newcomers to the series."
26090,It's Skyrim
26091,yes
26092,good gam e
26093,"I have enjoyed this game. good replay ability.  Multiple charter choices and  multiple story options make this game very entertaining and fun.
"
26094,epic very cool
26095,"I used to be an adventurer like you
then i farted"
26096,hey at least better than the special edition
26097,"So, I love this game. Due to mods, I don't really feel I need the new version and honestly, neither do you. If you already have this, don't bother unless you really want it. As for the DLC, well, some Google-fu can be used and you can STILL get it on Steam, even in 2020. I just bought it before making this review on 2/24/2020. Again, Google. That's all I'm sayin.

Anyway, this game is beautiful, full of content and has so much to offer the casual and hardcore players. Want to do story only? Go for it. Want to do the bajillions of side-quests before the main story? Have at it! Don't want to do any of that outside of the initial starting area and simply explore, gain XP, hunt, and so on? Yeah, you can do that. It offers everyone something to do and with great visuals to boot, even by today's standards. Got more advanced hardware? Check out the various enhancement mods for this game and you'll get even more for your money than you bargained for.

I didn't get this game when it first came out because I didn't have the money, or a PC powerful enough at the time, to play this gem. I wish I had. Still, coming into it about 3 or so years ago, I have loved it ever since and highly recommend any to play this! If you know someone that would love to play this but doesn't want the special edition, the link to this store page is still available, so please link them here and have them play it. It's well worth it! And as always, be careful not to take an arrow to the knee, adventurer!"
26098,its skyrim
26099,so much fun
26100,yes
26101,Best game of all time!!!!!!!!
26102,extremly fun sandbox game
26103,"I have 1000+ hours in this beautiful world across 2 Steam accounts and 4 consoles.

Let's just say I took an arrow to the knee. ;)"
26104,"Really amazing game , made 10000000000% better if you have mods in this -
It's a classic ."
26105,"Skyrim is an awesome game. Can't wait for Elder Scrolls VI! Also try Morrowind and Oblivion. They all have their charms! Get ready for another chapter, Dragonborne!"
26106,.
26107,Best game
26108,Yes.
26109,"The Ultimate in a Gateway to Modding from Greenhorn to Master.  There is so much support for Mod's and Modder's alike.  
From Steam Workshop to Nexus and Beyond.  The Skyrim Community is a Great place to learn modding."
26110,This game is a classic that i highly recommend
26111,"Everyone already knows this game is awesome, or it wouldn't have tons of people still playing it and making mods for it. BTW tons of cool mods for it too, thanks to all the creators out there."
26112,
26113,This is a really good game
26114,over 9000
26115,One of the greats but mostly because of mods.
26116,Skyrim is going on 9 years old and I still come back to it
26117,My steam play time doesnt display how much time i have spent and how much enjoyment i have had with this game but if it serves for something i have this game in all my consoles and have fully played it in all of them except steam.
26118,"Skyrim is my favorite game!  Although, I do play SSE much more often now I am reinstalling SLE to play some challenge runs.  There's just so much to do and see!!!"
26119,Sexlab + Schlongs of Skyrim = immersive porn RPG. 10/10 would install dicks again.
26120,"Classic.

Immense mod support.

MXR rockz!"
26121,"The game was bigger than most others back in it's release date. It's hundreds of in game miles across, even without DLC. In spite of this, the sheer modability and the expansive and beautiful scenery along with the characters of the game make it an experience you have to play to see for yourself. The mods are a bit finnicky to manage, but it's something that can be bypassed if you know what you're doing."
26122,Best Game Ever Made!
26123,Can't buy the dlc
26124,masterpeace for the time
26125,Great world to dive into
26126,A vary engaging game.  Takes months to go through the first play through.
26127,This game's pretty gangsta because you don't need to have friends to play it.
26128,Amazing action RPG that I have spent years playing on both Xbox and PC packed with plenty of content to keep bringing you back.
26129,i like the game a lot
26130,This game is amazing. there is so much to do let alone adding the DLC's to the game. I can't wait till they re-release this on the samsung smart fridge.
26131,Still fun 9 years later.
26132,It was a vedy epico gammen i lobed the grophics i t was a very eating monster if you have my lobster-crab i would suggest eating it cas its yummy and scumpioux
26133,This whole game is a Bruh moment.
26134,"Hey, you, you're finally awake"
26135,"Of course, why havnt i upvoted this anyway?"
26136,gweat game
26137,Need something?

26139,Couldnt fuck the child
26140,d
26141,gud game
26142,"it just works
"
26143,"It's an awesome RPG game with so many cool stuff, textures are awesome, sounds are awesome, it's pretty realistic."
26144,"This is todd howards last good game before the dark powers of the daedra corrupted him, do yourself a favor and play it to appease the dark overlords so that one day there may be a good bethesda game again."
26145,for an older game its still fun to play .just do and go wherever you like.
26146,"The only problem that I could have with Skyrim is that it and all of it's DLC have become unlisted on Steam, so I had to go through what should be a bunch of unnecessary hoops to get to the steam page for the game. Not to mention the fact that I still can't find the DLC. If it wasn't for mods, I wouldn't have gotten the game anyway. But if you're looking for the full game then get the remastered edition cause I aint got a clue as to where I'm gonna get the DLC fer this version. But you're already here, so you clearly want the OG version like me."
26147,Open world awesomeness
26148,A legendary game.
26149,"I will always love this game
I reccomend it to anyone who wants to play games. 
"
26150,Do I really have to say why I like this game?
26151,shame you have to google the base game and dlc to find them now to be able to buy them
26152,cool
26153,Bestes Game
26154,Where Bethesda peaked.
26155,"Skyrim is such an amazing game, a game where you can do anything you want and be anything you want"
26156,"This was one of the first PC games I really got into when I started playing on PC. It eventually became my most played game. I've played both Morrowind and Oblivion, so I know how this game is compared to those. Well I will admit the roleplaying aspects have been reduced considerably, I still find this game to be very enjoyable. In fact I will personally put this as one of my favorite games of all time."
26157," Hey you, you're finally awake? tried to review the game and walked into a shill trap same as us? Memes aside Skyrim is still a great game all these years later and mods make it even more fun! 100% Recommend!"
26158,"I have played for years and will never get bored with being able to do anything anytime.
highly reccomended, although the lore isnt all there as in depth as the others, my favorite for example, morrowind, and oblivion.
beyond the less depth of lore and story, skyrim is amazing and super fun, extremely replayable and i have spent COUNTLESSSS hours on it.

so yeah, get this if you love free roam RPGs. FPS or third person.
also, tons of mods, visual and such, so the gameplay is limitless.
"
26159,Elven Supremacy is the only truth.
26160,SIIIIIIICCCCCCKKKK
26161,good shit
26162,It's Fun!

26164,classic
26165,"good game 
"
26166,sex mods
26167,GOOD GAME BUY NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT WEEB
26168,"Oldie but a goodie, spent a lot of hours with quests and little secrets. Modding community adds so much more opportunity and enjoyment to the game.."
26169,AWESOME GAME
26170,"entertaining and nice time hog
"
26171,"It's been almost 10 years and I'm back again. If you haven't experienced Skyrim already, you're doing yourself a disservice. 10/10 every time."
26172,yeah
26173,Still one of the BEST singleplayer games ever made! Wish they one make a new one
26174,"I've bought this game 3 times, and it was worth it every time. I purchased it twice on Xbox 360, the 2nd purchase was after I broke the first disk. The third and final purchase was on the Steam store for PC, thus successfully entering the world of modding and being buried under a mountain of content. I've played this game since 2011, and still have not gotten more than half way though the main story because there is so much content."
26175,I bought the Original and it no longer works? so Im Forced to buy the Special Edition? Why the Hell do I have to pay full price again?
26176,"It's Skyrim
"
26177,Hi
26178,great time
26179,"I've purchased Skyrim 6 times since it's original release date of November 11th, 2011 for the Xbox 360.  Almost 9 years later, this game is still striving with a plethora of mod support, exploration and features. A lot of people would say ""Why play Skyrim? Morrowind/Oblivion is better!"". The answer? Because this game is a great entry point into the series. If you are new the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim is your best entry thanks to the casual controls and gameplay.

8.9/10, please stop releasing it for every console."
26180,"Amazing game, standing to the test of time very well. Mods continue to keep the game looking amazing and playing smoothly so don't shy away from using them. Just as fun as the first time I played it."
26181,Great game that will keep you entertained for hours and hours.
26182,Skyrim is a good game. It has a high degree of goodness. There is almost no badness to be found in this game.
26183,"This is hands down my favorite game of all time. The wonder and awe that i experienced playing this game in 2012 is rival to none. If you haven't already played this game, do yourself a favor and play it."
26184,It's Skyrim. DUH!
26185,Is nice
26186,If you are interested in modding this version is better.
26187,"os mod deixa o jogo muito melhor
"
26188,"This game is the perfect example of how modern Bethesda open-world games function: You get back what you put in. The base game is okay for a playthrough, maybe two, but it really comes alive when you begin modding it.

You can expect some bugs, you can expect some jank, but if you put the time in to craft your perfect mod-list you can also expect to immerse yourself in one of the best open-world fantasy experiences that gaming has to offer."
26189,"EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
26190,this game very nice! i love it! blat
26191,I mean like its pretty cool i guess
26192,Good game always come back to play it.
26193,"10/10, Utter Masterpiece. I love all the  unforgettable scenes such as, The Dancing Wagon, The Floating Horse, The Dislocating of Limbs. Ralof = Good. ""So your finally awake"" funny haha moments. 
iz gud."
26194,If you haven't played it there is something wrong with you.
26195,I have been playing this game for almost 10 years and am still finding new things to do and new places to discover. The depth is unbelievable.
26196,"I've got 524 playing hours in this game and over 200 hours in SE and really like it. the glitches make it right, t wouldn't be the same ithout them and you can realy challeng yourself. I for example am doing a fur armor playthrough (only headslot isn't fur armor, I use a mage hood), and it has been really fun.
Go and buy this game if you havn't yet."
26197,best game ever
26198,Quite good for a classic open-world game. While it lacks a sense of impact from character actions (the game interactions change very little wither the character completes a quest or not) it is still a fun romp through a fantasy world setting.
26199,niggah
26200,"It's so immersive, beautiful and can't get enough of it. Been playing it since it first came out . The modders also make it hard to stop playing.
"
26201,its just good
26202,Probs the best rpg I've ever played
26203,gg
26204,very good and extremely customisable with mods so you will never get bored
26205,"one of the best games of the decade.
"
26206,"great game,"
26207,best game ever made hands down. incredible replayability and simply stunning.
26208,Immersive and well done can play without being linked to other players or online
26209,Get a good PC then mod the heck outta Skyrim.
26210,"Awesome game. I've been playing for years, every time I create a new character, I do something I've never done before."
26211,It's okay.
26212,"Well, this is a great game to explore and have fun with. Once you've played it to a certain extent though, youll find that you want to put space between playthroughs and then put 8-20 hours in each time. Wonderful experience that constantly has me coming back for more!"
26213,if you havent played this game then ur dumb
26214,"amazing game, and runs perfectly inside a VM with gpu passthrough"
26215,DON'T BUY IT
26216,yes
26217,"oh heckel yea
"
26218,cool
26219,Bring back Bethesda games on GeForce Now
26220,It's Skyrim.  What more is there to say?
26221,Game is good
26222,i mean its ok
26223,"It's obviously great, it's Skyrim."
26224,"I have at the moment played 1306 hours. Most of the time modding this game I have searched for function over view, which had lead me to create the best compilation of mods for myself. I enjoy this game because of its infinite functionality. For instance, you can pickpocket enchanted goods off of Jarls and disenchant to further both pickpocketing and enchanting! The combat aspect of this game is amazing because there is legitimate strategy, such as bashing to stop an enemy's attack.

Why should you get this game? It's a grind, it's worth it and it makes you feel powerful at every corner. You can summon a ghost wolf to maul your enemies down or bring the dead back to life! You can move in slow motion and knock any foe down with your voice!

I aim to play another 1300 hours.

Great game, great graphics, great potential.
10/10"
26225,I like it...
26226,yes
26227,Best RPG Game ever.
26228,"it's skyrim
"
26229,All around great game! Fun to mod and see what you're able to get away with.
26230,It's Skyrim
26231,"Todd Howard, why do you do this to me? 

You create a game so great you have to port it to everything imaginable, I could be in my 90's and you will still be porting this game and il probably be stupid enough to buy it yet again.

Oh Todd who is so wise in the ways of science, please consider using your mighty porting experience to share some love with oblivion and fallout 3.

10/10 would recommend for hours of sinking your life into.

Ps : I heard they are reforming the Dawnguard"
26232,"This is one of the best game ever. It may have glitches, but it is still amazing. I love skyrim"
26233,"i mean its the game that has been released on the legendary date it is then legendary like the date... 11/11/11 :)
"
26234,This is a pretty good game
26235,The best.
26236,PG FOR PRETTY GOOD
26237,May the lord Todd Howard be praised.
26238,Would sell my soul for another skyrim virginity 8.5/10

26244,"Had a bunch of fun!! I didn't get to play this as much as I would have liked to, but I just got tired of farming for the Gauss Rifle.
"
26245,Great game. Hours of exploration and adventure. Nice graphics and good storyline!
26246,.
26247,Steam and bethesda are dumb for removing this from the store.
26248,"Time consuming game, who will take hours of good gaming and very nice story"
26249,guud game

26253,Amazing and Addicting game that will consume a lot of your hours.
26254,its awe some
26255,good
26256,"It is Elder Scrolls, what more to say?
"
26257,oof
26258,always come back for more.
26259,"Hopefully the elder scrolls 6 is just as good.


Or i'll be smoking meth fulltime again."
26260,Best game even in 2020
26261,Idk man this game just has a vibe you always wanna come back to.
26262,Da is good
26263,Great game!  Very Beautiful textures.  Takes a long time to play and keeps you busy.
26264,It's just a great game!!!
26265,well it is skyrim

26269,nice
26270,"Epic world and everything you would expect from a ""The Elder Scrolls"" title. A Must have!"
26271,".
"
26272,"its skyrim, mostly its not a really good game technically, combat's about as subtle as a battering ram. lots of systems are either poorly thought out or poorly implemented, and on the whole the writing is pretty uninspiring. HOWEVER. its still surprisingly fun. but the real backbone of this game is in mods. Modding this game means you have hundreds of hours of playtime. its highly moddable and generally you can find a mod for anything you want. thousands of modders have lovingly crafted incredible stories, hand modelled and textured hundreds of armours and weapons, built entire new races, fixxed boring mechanics, added whole new ones, meaning that as a whole skyrim has the capacity to be turned into exactly what you want from it."
26273,"I just wanted a bagel, but then every guard in Whiterun wanted to kill me :("
26274,great games
26275,On of the most enjoyable RPG's
26276,Fun game good game yes
26277,It's fun to play.
26278,adventuring that goes on for what seems forever. I love this game and its calming music and beautiful atmosphere and lore.
26279,My favorite single player game ever made
26280,You must mod it.
26281,best game i've ever played
26282,skyrim is an awesome game an at one point my favorite but i wouldnt reccomend this just for the fact they make you buy it over and over and over AND OVER.... instead of just letting everyone that ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME update it to the remastered version or get the DLC for it... or ANYTHING that doesnt make you buy the same game YET AGAIN...... and i LOVE SKYRIM but nope.... i still cant say go buy this game bcuz youll have to buy it 4 and 5 times....
26283,Great game so indepth in what you can do and what you can explore! Ive spent 48 hours playing and ive felt like ive not even scratched the surface.
26284,"Glitchy as crap, but good Lord, if this isn't one of the best games I have ever played! Even before adding mods, there's nearly endless possibilities, and the game is filled with amazing stories and hundreds of little secrets and references to uncover. The community is incredible, with over 650K mods on the Nexus that will keep you occupied for months, if not years! Amazing game, 10/10!"
26285,"its skyrim, enough said"
26286,"yes
"
26287,yeetus
26288,HAIL TALOS
26289,Best open world game
26290,"if you dont have this game , please do and get it, its one of those games from a golden era"
26291,I have played this game on console for years and I recently got the game on PC. Simply put it is without a doubt one of the top 5 games of all time if you have not played it yet give it a shot you will not regret it.
26292,"""Hey you, you're finally awake."" ""You were trying to cross the border right?"""
26293,good game babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy but knack 2 was better
26294,Great game. Even better with mods
26295,it is a fun game with allot to do.
26296,very nice
26297,gud game
26298,Still good game after all the years I have played this. Started from console and then switched to pc.
26299,ok
26300,fuckin duh
26301,xd
26302,its pretty good
26303,When Bethesda was still good.
26304,In a lot of ways still better than SE but that's counting for mods either way one of the best games of all time
26305,o
26306,eh
26307,"OOF
"
26308,very gud would reccommend 69/10
26309,"gud game
"
26310,"Need something?






Anyway, Skyrim is a great game, It interests me about music, terrain and more, Funny moments as well.
Using mods will improve the ""Greatness"" (Or not)"
26311,It's okay.
26312,Big pp game
26313,"Best open-world game of the millennium.
You can craft your own armor, travel with your companion, fight with dragons, become the werewolf/vampire, marry with your life partner, adopt a children.
This game is so immersive (Modding is highly recommended).
"
26314,Get it
26315,good game
26316,its skyrim... what else is there to say... lol
26317,um its skyrim.......
26318,amazing
26319,Amazing
26320,Good game is good
26321,good
26322,"Great game made much greater with a few mods, first and foremost would be SkyUI for some much needed quality of life improvements to the UI."
26323,when the fuck did i get 800 hours put into this game?
26324,You can easily get 300 hours of play time out of it.
26325,superb
26326,I like this game its a bit easy but the story is good join the stormcloaks.
26327,"to simply summarize:
it's awesome 😊💕"
26328,.
26329,gg
26330,"Excellent Game, played it in other formats aswell"
26331,My horse can stand on air. 10/10 would continue playing.
26332,skyrim make me feel YES
26333,"Great RPG, don't miss the fun and play it!"
26334,"I love the immersive, first-person experience.  Despite some serious fighting and dungeon exploration, I find it relaxing. Maybe it is the music and the graphics. I love that it is open-ended, so if I don't want to fight, I can gather ingredients, cook, smith a few things and even enchant them to sell and make money.  Some of the locations in the game are breath-taking. The graphics are amazing. Can't wait for Elder Scrolls 6!"
26335,One of the best games i have ever played. There is lots of action. there are story lines and lots of quests. the graphics are decent but it's good for a game of it's release date (2011). I've played this since i had an xbox 360 and still love it.
26336,Still the best game of the year.
26337,play or die
26338,good game
26339,no matter how old this game gets it never fail to surprise me
26340,its a great game with lots to do
26341,Excellent game
26342,"It's skyrim, you know about it. Is it worth buying and playing as a game ? 
-Yes. 

Is it worth buying to support bethesda? 
-no,

Should you play it at least once? 
-yes 

You know if you want this game or not. 
just go ahead really."
26343,Plenty of game play for everyone.
26344,Still fun even after comming back to it years later
26345,"Great game by itself, Better game with mods."
26346,"i love this game , moding it sso amazing that make it like a new game for replaying it over and over"
26347,chimcken nugget
26348,neat
26349,great
26350,"I've probably got like 2000 hours on the PS3, so you can tell this game is at the very least, a very effective time waster."
26351,"A definite classic. So many hours of my life have been dumped into this world over the passed 9 years, it's not even funny"
26352,Good game. Bethesda has become a corporate monstrosity. You can find and buy dlc by searching for it through the web browser. Not on the Steam Application. Thanks Bethesda. You used to be nice. But oh well.
26353,It's only really worth it if you mod
26354,"This is probably one of the best RPGs of its generation. P.S.: Check out my mod ""The Forgotten Keep""!"
26355,"Enjoyed the freedom
"
26356,"It's Skyrim, you all know why you want to play it."
26357,"Game is great, would recommend it to any regular rpg player however i can not recommend it as now you cant purchase the dlc seperately. if your like me and have already been forced to buy the game 3 times (forgot my first steam account info, bought it again for this one and bought it for my wife) then your not keen on needing to buy it again for a 4th time just to get access to dlc that used to be 10 bucks a piece, guess ill never play the other dlc as you wont get 40 from me for the one i dont own."
26358,Gud Gam
26359,love this game have played it too much
26360,<3
26361,yes
26362,"Stick it with a few sex, graphic overhaul, and skill tree mods and you got about 50 hours of entertainment, at least."
26363,"Took me years to pick up Skyrim, but BOI HOWDY am I glad I finally did. So far I've played 101 hours Vanilla™ and have yet to beat the main story line. Or really even attempt to progress the main story line. Who's Parthanax? I don't know. But I do know where every mine is in the game I tell you hwat.

It's Skyrim: why the heck are you looking at reviews by this point?!"
26364,fun game
26365,The game is everything it's supposed to be. Also: Mods.
26366,It just work
26367,"One of the most complet RPG game that i know! Characters, Quests, Wonderful place, everything is there! And with the mods... you can literaly shape the whole game to your wish until your PC dies in an explosion of flames cause of the 40+Mods of 4K texture/Effect."
26368,"really good game, replaying it for the millionth time and still loving it"
26369,"I think the Mods/Modding Community is what made this game even more fun then what it started out with. 
But besies that... Skyrim will always be my top most favorite game ^~^"
26370,"Don't pay £30, pay £10 & upgrade to a similar quality game with mods. You'd need to take an arrow to the knee not to!"
26371,This game is always going to be my go to during those times I don't know what else to play. First time experience with this game is good. Mods make it go so much further though and makes it a new experience all over again each time you restart and play again.
26372,"In the tradition of Morrowind and Oblivion, Skyrim takes you into the world and makes you believe in being a hero."
26373,"I LIKE THE STORY I LIKE THE MODS I LIKE THE AWSOME DLCS
"
26374,Just sexy greatness baby
26375,G00D GaMe
26376,"let's face it, the only reason a lot of us have this game is to screw around with mods"
26377,Good game would wake up in a carridge again
26378,Skyrim is definitely one of the best games ever made. It's a complete masterpiece (excluding all bugs).
26379,"Shot humans as a cat person while high off my mind on skooma.

10/10 would play another 300 hours"
26380,this game with even 5 mods is way better than Fallout 76 in 2020
26381,its skyrim
26382,"The map is massive and has multiple DLC's and other things you may such as looting and crafting etc.
You can also level up skills as you use them more and more and the variety of magic is great."
26383,aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
26384,"liked mods, disliked not mods"
26385,"Yes, especially with mods
Who wouldnt play with mods
"
26386,"I don't think I really have to write this review.

There is a reason the re-release meme exists, and it's because this game is absolutely phenomenal. The modding community for this game only further improves an already amazing game."
26387,it's bad. the only reason people like it is the modding community. and even they can't make it much better
26388,only if you're playing with mods tho
26389,"I mean at this point who hasnt played skyrim? This game is phenomenal even without mods. The world is immersive the quests are interesting and unique, and you actually feel like an important character to a game. This game is what  you expect and more. You even have the option to play in either first person or third person and can switch when you please. The dlc's are great too. It's not like one of those games where you get a skin and it's done.. The dlc's take you to a new area and a whole new storyline. I  highly recommend this game."
26390,Old but gold.
26391,spent about 20 hours getting all the mods i wanted for game to crash repeatedly perfect 5/7
26392,gud
26393,"love it
"
26394,The ultimate open world adventure RPG
26395,"If you play video games than this is for you if not well... why you here? If you only like walking simulators, puzzle games, or fighting games with good mechanics... than go away we don't need that kind of negativity here."
26396,I own this game on multiple other consoles and even to today's standards this is the best game in the world.
26397,fuck you
26398,obviously amazing
26399,its a awesome game
26400,Wide open world to explore
26401,This has to be one of my top three games! play it once and you will be drawn in!
26402,"It's... Skyrim.  Everybody should play it at least once.   I've purchased it twice so far - original and VR - and will eventually buy SE so I can play the oblivion and morrowind total conversion mods.   In 2020, here's what I think of the game:

Pros:
    it's very beautiful and atmospheric
    It runs effortlessly at 4k/60hz on my aging i7-2600k/geForce 1080 setup
    there are endless mods.
    Writing and voice acting are mostly pretty awesome.
    There are endless dungeons, caves, forts and so forth to explore.

Cons:
    I ***HATE*** the UI.  Compared to earlier PC-oriented Elder Scrolls games, it's very awkward and
    inflexible.  Even mods don't really help.  Console UI on a PC - super turbo UGH!  Spellcasting is particularly
    cumbersome.
    Combat is just silly, although the visual effects are good.  Enemies are dumb as rocks, and there aren't 
    enough of them to be a threat most of the time. 
    The world, though beautiful, feels somewhat empty and dead.   Mods can help with this though.

I'd recommend Skyrim to anybody remotely interested in open world RPGs.  It's a classic.
"
26403,It sucks
26404,i love this game. don't force me to write steam!
26405,I like this game ...
26406,It's Skyrim...play it use the standard edition for mods because there are more of them currently also if your computer is a toaster like mine.
26407,Absolute classic at this point.
26408,Good game
26409,"STILL as amazing as ever, i have several copies in dirrerent formats and for different consols - its been years since its release and im still going strong! All time favourite."
26410,shout stab flying kamoll
26411,better than the remake 9/10
26412,It's 2020 and Skyrim is still fun.
26413,"Hey, you, you're finally awake! This game is my childhood."
26414,it's alright
26415,i used to not pay skyrim very much attention bc i just didnt have the poise to sit there and grind but i love this fucking game
26416,"I've spent more hours attempting to fix this game to run on a 144 hertz monitor than playing the game. Bethesda using an archaic and garbage engine to create games is a show of laziness and refusal to create a new engine or use an alternative one.

The game is pretty fun, a pain to fix it though."
26417,"Its Skyrim, how have you not played this already?"
26418,!!!!!ITS SKYRIM!!!!!
26419,.
26420,I love playing with mods it makes the game amazing harder and really fun!
26421,best game 10/10
26422,Gucci game!
26423,"very open, and lots to do. be ware of the cat on the mountain path, he is a bandit"
26424,It's just the best game ever.
26425,its pretty good
26426,My most played game on Steam and probably one of my favorite games ever played.
26427,I mean... it's Skyrim
26428,love it
26429,very good
26430,"The amount of things you can do in this game from killing dragons to getting married, I'd say this was probably the best game ever when it came out in 2011. 100 hours of pure dragon slaying, monster hunting and dank armor to keep you busy. You got all sorts of things trying to kill you.
Here's a list:
Skeletons
Dragons
Wolves
Trolls
Elves
Humans
Soldiers
Tigers
Mammoths
Robotic spiders and soldiers (foreal tho)
Vampires (you can get infected by one also become one FUN FACT)
Bandits
Giants.
And the fact you can add mods to make your game look like it was released in 3005. This game is packed my fam, PACKED.

10/10 - I will never forget you lydia (companion of mine she died when we went to kill some bandits) RIP.
"
26431,I've been playing Skyrim since its been released. I love this game. There is no other game that will ever replace the fun and love I have for it. You forget how old it is. The only wish I have is that they added more DLC's.
26432,it is good
26433,GG
26434,"Hey you, you're finally awake and all the memes...
It's skyrim, you either like it or you don't but since a lot of people do, chances are you do too..."
26435,A cool game and modders delight.
26436,After playing on Xbox 360 PS3 AND PS4 I finally purchased this for PC and have never enjoyed the game as much. Not as many glitches and the game allows me to add mods. best game ever.
26437,really can tailor it with mods to what ever u want
26438,"i mean, what can i say. Im sure you've already heard of this game 100 times already. One of the best RPG's ive ever played and one of my personal favorite. Great STORY, CHARACTERS, ARCS and Scenery."
26439,gg
26440,
26441,"Great game. The kind you play when its released, then when your 80 look back and remember the hours you have on it and start weeping and just get those nostalgic shivers down your spine. Could. Not. Recommend. More."
26442,"This game is very engaging. There are so many things to do after you finish main story quests. Amount of content is impressive: quests, locations, characters. Looking forward to spending more time on it."
26443,"Todd Howard can suck it, this is the blandest and most mindless baby-game I have ever played. Literally only playable if you download 400 mods to replace every last bit of content in this game with something tolerable."
26444,"A lot of fun, has kept me entertained for an embarrassing amount of hours, but I regret nothing."
26445,i love this game
26446,"Its still fkn great I love it and always will. Would definitely love to have Special Edition though lol,"
26447,I opened up this game and got stuck on the loading screen for 6 hours 10/10
26448,"The mods keep the game fresh and on its feet, the combat isn't as forceful as oblivion but it is rather ingaging, even without mods the game is great and an amazing game with a gripping story sprawling open world with many quests to discover, the guilds don't take center stage but are great side stories and are somewhat included, the dragons returning make for some fun boss battles and the civil war is great for figuring out who you are."
26449,skyrim is awesome duh. It just keeps getting better and better with mods and updates/upgrades.. I can personalize it anyway i want and make it perfect. what more could you want?
26450,10/10 Would Skyrim again
26451,it good
26452,"best elder scrolls gsme ever
"
26453,I keep coming back to Skyrim because of the mod community. There are some absolutely great mods out there that really take your experience to the next level
26454,YOU FILTHY S'VIT
26455,great
26456,"A solid base game that will keep you entertained for a time.
It is the modding scene that will bring you back to keep playing character after character and is why this game seems to have an eternal lifespan.  Mods can range from bug fixes, (Bethesda game, go figure.) to cosmetic upgrades, to total overhauls that can change the way the game is played.
I recommend playing vanilla for your initial playthrough and then tailoring your own personal experience with mods."
26457,Better than real life.
26458,the best game
26459,yes
26460,meh
26461,very great game and you get some great companions ! wish they would make lydia more intellegent and not act so dum and talk about making some kind of stew more like the other companions ! she is very cool and bad ass ! the one quest i hate ..of course theres others is going after all of them dum ass red weeds !
26462,It's just a very good game with great graphics and plenty of action. I have been enjoying this game for a long time. Always great to come back to.
26463,"meme review, purdy mods, tig ol bitties, and a few new places to go."
26464,mad cool sick thing ini fam
26465,"I feel like if you're a fantasy fan, Skyrim is one of the best games you can get. Its beginner friendly, so if you're new to RPGs you should be able to get a grip on it fairly easily. Of course it has its problems, but I think the hours and hours of fun you can put into the game is worth it. 

I started playing Skyrim on Xbox 360 so while it says I have 52 hours, I probably have hundreds. I managed to sink so many hours into it because there's so many different quests and options for things to do when you get bored. Take out a bandit camp, slaughter a village, hunt a dragon, get the best armour, learn to smith, there's so much to do and its enhanced by the DLCs, but I dont have those on PC."
26466,gg
26467,It is the funnest and more engaging game I've played. I suggest this one for just about anyone to try.
26468,"There is a tremendous amount of versatility and flexiblity involved with every aspect of Skyrim.  The strengths/weaknesses of the various races (Argonian, Breton, Dark Elf, High Elf, Wood Elf, Imperial, Khajit, Nord, Orc, Redguard), when applied to the ten different types of adventurers (Warrior, Mage, Archer, Berserker, Spellsword, Necromancer, Assassin, Battlemage, Weaponmaster, or Rogue) allows you to fashion a unique adventurer to travel a world filled with tens of thousands of events that change with every action you choose to make, every path you choose to follow, and every conversation you have with game characters."
26469,eh
26470,"The classic bread and butter to all RPG, plus can be heavily modded for fun spin on the already great game!"
26471,it just w.orks.
26472,Its Skyrim. What else is there to say?
26473,"good game
"
26474,"This game is just all around AWESOME!! The graphics, especially for their time, were absolutely amazing. I write this review many years after the release of the game!! Everyone should own a copy!!"
26475,is ok
26476,yeeeeet
26477,Nice!
26478,"wow v cool, dan flanal can speak english"
26479,on all levels except physical i am a cheese wheel
26480,Mods
26481,"Amazing enough as a a stand-alone game, but when mods come into play it becomes a true experience."
26482,It's Skyrim.
26483,"one of my favorite games of all times!
"
26484,good game
26485,"I mean, it's simple: If you haven't played this yet, pick it up with the DLC and just explore, Just do it."
26486,"The moderate learning curve and immersive environment (and story) make for easy game play.  The downside is that it's pretty difficult to reach naturally satisfactory stopping points, so excessive play is highly probable."
26487,"It's a great game, but it is REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLY hard.
You can explore the whole map so I thought that was really cool. There are plenty of missions, so it will take a long time to finish the game. Sure, you can just do the important ones, but whats the fun on that.

GREAT GAME, LOVED IT!!!!"
26488,"Yeet Yeet
"
26489,Great game by itself! Lots of quests in a huge open world. Better with the expansions and the modding community is vast.
26490,nice gaem
26491,Seems fun so far
26492,CHARACTER IS LEVEL 54 & CANNOT PLAY ANYMORE BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WORKING ON MY WINDOWS 10 MACHINE.  THIS SUCKS.  NOT HAPPY.
26493,Probably my second favorite elder scrolls game (my favorite being Morrowind at the time of release). Great graphics. Best combat in the series by a large margin. Nobody is surprised Skyrim gets a positive review.
26494,A perfectly balanced game with no exploits
26495,great
26496,amazing
26497,WHERE NOMBER 6?!?!?!
26498,"No, DLC? wat"
26499,"I just now noticed while installing this game on a new system that I've played for a total of 339 hours.  I must have enjoyed it, so play it already."
26500,"Between Steam and the original version I had for 360 when Skyrim first released I've got something like 1700 hours in Skyrim. Just saying, if that's not an endorsement I don't know what is."
26501,I am so addicted to this game i love it! Its my favorite game i have ever played!! i really recommend it!
26502,its good
26503,love it
26504,yeeeee
26505,Okay I re-bought skyrim please Todd let my family go
26506,yes
26507,good

26509,try this with mods it is amazing
26510,reat Game
26511,"What can I say?No words needed...!
Any words I can show?No!...none of words can show it properly,what else?
GODS BE PRAISED."
26512,Be warned: this game can be extremely addictive!
26513,yell so hard
26514,69 nice
26515,its ok
26516,The is good
26517,This game is amazing make sure you play it before you lose your hand and are unable to play it
26518,IT JUST WORKS!
26519,Still worth playing all these years later. Mod packs make it look much more like a modern game.
26520,"I mean its Skyrim, like duh.."
26521,is skyrim
26522,"This game is sh*t on so many levels.

Bug riddled, unbalanced, dumbed down, finnicky, like a sh*tty console port. I played it again and again, just to go back to oblivion. 

People who say that skyrim is objectively a good game must be utterly retarded. They may be many, but skyrim is the best example that dumbed down BS can still be popular. It only shows that bethesda never learned from their mistakes and people are so fking stupid to buy literally anything as long as marketing sells you the world's sh*ttiest engine time and again with a new graphic overhaul.

Plus, have fun if you ever bought the base game but want the DLC now, you have to buy the ""special edition"" with all dlcs, if you want them or not. And let me tell you, the only thing that's special in that is the obvious ret*rdation of fanboys and bethesda, as it was hailed as a great improvement and STILL every single bug remains."
26523,amazing game
26524,Too many bugs and glitches some of them need console commands. Many remain.  The player loses out on immersion into the game.
26525,"First of all, let me say: NEVER buy games from Bethesda as soon as they are released. They are always unspeakably filled with bugs, to the point that they are sometimes barely playable. 

That said, their games, especially Skyrim, always have STUNNING graphics! I found the storyline to be compelling, but then I'm of Scottish ancestry and from the South. Joining, or better leading, a rebellion is in my blood. I was disappointed to note that I couldn't join the clerical group, but you can join a handful of other groups/guilds. They have kept the Brotherhood, so now I will have to go back and play this again as an assassin. 

I started this back in 2012. I found the opening scene incredibly hard, because the controls seemed very foreign. One of the first things I did was strike-out on my own to explore, because that's who I am as a person. My initial character was modelled on me, to get the ""lay of the land"". Beware! This can get you into situations that are above your level! I feel that they have done a reasonably good job of not utterly succumbing to the modern power-gamers, who are ruining all of our RPG games for us. 

Travel the length and breadth of Skyrim. 
Meet new people. Make new friends. Kill them. 
Be hunted down by dragons, and hunt them down. (Requires Dragon Born add-on)
Acquire trusty travelling companions.
Acquire or craft lovely and powerful items. 
Buy your own house.

For those who have played previous Bethesda games, you'll notice a number of skills have been taken out of Skyrim: Acrobatics and Athletics, most notably.
There are no more pearls.
The water is murky. This is a known issue, which Bethesda refuses to fix in the game. There is a module in Nexus to fix this.

In fact, I advise you to look in Nexus. There is also an unofficial patch for this game that fixes many bugs. I have no respect for a company that forces its users to come-up with bug fixes, because they couldn't be bothered to properly test their software, or to properly respond to bug reports.

Still, in the end, the game is a good investment and will bring you hours of fun."
26526,Best game I have ever played
26527,"this game is very fun even 9 years after its release date. if you want a fun fantasy rpg to play, many would consider this the standard. and while some of the graphics certainly don't hold up today, it still looks gorgeous."
26528,"First time playing this game on PC after playing for hundreds of hours on Xbox 360. I plan to play hundreds more. I mean, there's not much I can say. It's Skyrim. And it's amazing. But if I have to be nit-picky, I'll try. 

As with any open-world RPG, Skyrim really makes you hit the grind. Hard. Of course, if you use the plethora of exploits and ramshackle hacks for the game engine that players have found over the years, you can get ahead a lot faster, but playing the game normally can feel very tedious at times. While you have the freedom to take on any quest or none at all, the only real way to progress in the game is to loot and kill (Or just upgrade your enchantment and smithing skills until you can craft the necessary weapons and armor to become God). I mean, that's really the only downside. But it all depends on how YOU want to play. I have come to enjoy the monotony of walking down into caves and taking care of Draugr (however this can get intense), or walking through Skyrim, enjoying the natural world, and finding new places to explore. If you amp up the difficulty (which I recommend) it makes all enemies more challenging, forcing you to actually try when in combat situations with higher-level enemies, this is how the game should be played.

This game can require patience when first starting off, but if you're just playing to become God, complete all the quests, and move on, I think you're missing the point. It's about the experience. I've played Fallout 3, and while it's very similar to Skyrim (same game engine I assume) it's just not the same. There's a certain charm, an atmosphere, about Skyrim that's unique to every other game I've played. The music in this game moves me emotionally, I love it, and each environment has its own soundtrack that fits it perfectly. The NPCs, while some of their faces are ""nightmare-fuel-levels"" of ugly, have extremely extensive dialogue that can be interesting to delve into. And the books! So many books. I know I've spent hours just reading about Daedra and other Elder Scrolls lore. I'm wondering how many people Todd Howard had to hire to write all the different books in this game, it's amazing. I know that's not important but I find it facinating. 

I'm sure I could write many pages about how exactly to level up the fastest, what quests to do at what level, best ""classes"", how to farm xp and whatnot. But it really doesn't matter. You do whatever you want. People have spent thousands of hours playing this game without ever touching the main quests. Skyrim is truly a gamer's game. Want to be a stealth archer? Mage? Battle-hardened warrior that wields the largest thing they can find to bash the enemy? Vampire? Werewolf? Or just walk around in the nine different holds and enjoy the incredibly detailed environment without killing anyone? Go for it. Once you get out of Helgen at the beginning, you're free to go wherever and do whatever. Completing quests and leveling up will open more doors and again, more ways to play. And that's the beauty of it all. In my opinion, there's no right or wrong way to play Skyrim. Just have fun.

The virtual world of Skyrim is special to me. Not really for any particular reason. I just fell in love with it. The atmosphere, the music, the stories, it made a huge impression on me. It's quite the experience. I'll have to experiment with mods in the future to make the game more beautiful. If you actually read all of this, thank you. I love this game. And I hope you do too. Try it if you ever find the time. I think It'll be worth it. Peace.

26529,Intriguing game with hundreds of hours worth of content. The graphics are decent and the AI isn't nearly as bad as in Bethesda's past games. Overall it's a good game with a great reputation.

But but go to the modding community and you will  option to extend and enhance your experience.  It is worth the price of admission to own perhaps the greatest single player RPG  game in existence.

26591,I guess it is a good game idk really
26592,"its fun but a pain in the ass to find
"
26593,best
26594,please don't look at my mod list
26595,It's Skyrim.
26596,"395 hours and - I kid you not - I've never even started the Dawnguard DLC until now. Not for lack of trying, mind you; I just keep getting sidetracked."
26597,Classic
26598,I would definitely recommend this game! It is one of my favorites! I really like the stories and open world. It's still beautiful and fun to play years later.
26599,"I enjoy this game enough to have played it 3-4 times at least. I like the way it's open-ended, with lots of ""new"" areas of the world to discover and explore and with several separate quest lines. The open world is great. A few things about it could be improved. There are a number of odd bugs--some potentially game breaking without accessing the console. They appear to happen unpredictably, though there's one involving the thieves' guild that has happened every time I've played it (the Karliah bug).  Some bugs can also be resolved with mods, though not all mods appear to be accessible to steam players.

I do find some of the npc dynamics a bit tedious, what with their repeating certain scripted comments over and over (like Lydia always standing in your way and saying ""Owwww"" when you push past her, or your kids and housecarls always saying ""stupid dog"" when you bring Meeko home). NPCs really do need to get better about NOT stopping in doorways and about not getting in between my avatar and my target too--never found a mod to fix those issues. 

It would also be nice if the mechanics for picking up objects and moving them were less cumbersome. I will say, as someone who also plays bioware games, that the ability to decorate one's dwellings and to move objects not directly related to the plot adds an element of realism and personalization to Bethesda games. It would be nice if the follower characters and npcs, especially the ones who offer potential romances, had more interesting personalities and stories and if they interacted more realistically with one another too.  That's one place where it would be cool if they took a page out of bioware's book.

The moody, broody darkness of the game's color scheme takes some getting used to, though it grew on me eventually. Feels weird to go back and forth between this game and ESO, which is much more vibrantly hued.

Overall, though, the vast scale of this game, along with the potential for replay and discovering something new each time, makes it more than worthwhile. I'd say it's still one of the best RPGs of the past decade. I hope the next Elder Scrolls installment lives up to it."
26600,good game
26601,Obviously a classic.
26602,Just the absolute best open world rpg on the market. Hands down.
26603,"Skyrim is one of my favorite open world rpg games, even if there's a lot that could be better, i can spend hours only playing the vanilla version of the game XD or just exploring around"
26604,great game
26605,nice game
26606,First game I fell in love with at the start of my video game career and holds a special place in my heart.

26615,"One of the best games ever made
"
26616,w
26617,"Buy the FULL version. If you've accidentally found your way here without already purchasing DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VERSION. This is the no-add-ons, no-DLC version (to be fair, there are mods that may or may not be available to players of the SPECIAL EDITION ((the one you want!)) but there will be no adopting, no vampire hunters, no expanded weapon, armor or item lists added to the base game.) Don't buy this one. Go get the real one. Bethesda owes us an apology for the existence of this game with no CLEAR EXPLANATION of why this is no longer listed in the main store. Actually, it has taken me over a week to realize that I was playing a version of the game I couldn't really talk about with my brother or friends, because there's was DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT. The fact that one friend bought this for me as a gift makes this whole situation especially irritating, as they feel like they were tricked. Why does that feel worse? To scam a friend with a gift than to fall into one on your own. I'm angry for them, too. Don't buy this version."
26618,"Clearly the BEST, and I mean the BEST game to ever exist! Forget what I once said about Saints Row: The Third! That game is for those who have yet to ascend! This game is the superior game, and those that say otherwise are the ones to pity, for they do not know what they are missing out on! Todd Howard, I want to personally thank you for fabricating such a masterpiece! A masterpiece that we petty humans do not deserve!"
26619,"Just amazing when modded, a completely different game"
26620,"A massive game with loads of replay potential, and very easy to attach MODs to to make the game even bigger and customisable"
26621,yes
26622,Good game
26623,"I've been playing this game since it first came out, its an amazing adventure packed game. You can never say ""I have nothing to do."" There's always something to do. The DLC's are great, but my game is glitched, so i can't say to many good things! But I love this game, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an adventure!"
26624,"Its Skyrim, you dont need me to tell you why its good.
Its been 9 years since it was released and i still feel like its a new game, that kind of new game you play wrapped in blankets in the winter because it adds to the immersion.
Instant coffee and ramen noodles will sustain you while neglecting to do the houe chores."
26625,it good
26626,Very Good!
26627,Awesome game even after the many years that it has been out.
26628,yes
26629,"very good game! with mods installed, it's amazing"
26630,Just a classic
26631,Its skyrim
26632,This game is so good if u haven't played it yet then you should I've probably put in over 3000 hours on console and every minute of it was fun
26633,420h baby hopefully there will be many more
26634,It's good
26635,the best game of all time
26636,"Seriously? it's skyrim, everyone's played it and everyone likes it at least a little. its amazing,"
26637,
26638,amazing
26639,"I think we can all agree that Skyrim isn't perfect, and that you can't fully enjoy it without a couple of texture enhancing, and lighting enhancing mods, but this game really lets you just explore and find stuff, I personally love walking around the world instead of fast traveling just for the experience. This game isn't perfect, but it has it's moments. and if you can overlook all the bugs, then those moments can really make this game worth putting time into, and learning how to play the game. and how to create your own content, or make your own scenarios for whatever. This game vanilla I would rate a 7/10, but with mods that work well and keep things lore friendly and just make the game a bit better it would be bumped up to 9.5/10. I highly recommend buying this game even if it means giving Tod more money."
26640,This game is Ebic
26641,after 204 hours its still fun and even more with mods i would highly recommend this game
26642,"I have purchased skyrim ten times, would recommend"
26643,Timeless classic
26644,"Pretty Good
"
26645,Even now after almost 9 years I think it holds up .  It's even better with the workshop feature. :o)
26646,good stuff buddy
26647,"its a bad game. just awful. glitchy, broken, all sorts of jank, and yet every year i come back and binge it again. why? because there just aint any games that are like it. the modding community is huge and the actual way that the game plays? its heroin. i keep coming back even though i already know everything about this game because it feels so nice to play. i like world of warcraft but playing it makes me feel like my brain is turning to goop as i complete mundane tasks but the quests in skyrim are just engaging enough to make me feel invested but not overwhelmed. 

highly suggest the dragonborn dlc (idk if its spelled that way but whatever) cus the voice acting and story are great. yeah it was kinda homophobic for todd to not let me marry teldryn sero but nothing that the modding community cant fix. im glad someone actually put in the time to make a marriage mod specifically for him because that mod cleared my skin, watered my crops, and cured my plague. its called A Serious Wedding - Teldryn Sero Marriage Mod and holy shit i have never loved a mod more. 

anyways if you already have no life its a good game."

26662,"So its been 9 years since release, but i couldnt recommend it more:

-Great Story
-Lots of side quests
-Awesome ambience
-Pretty Basic but nice combat system
-First/Third Person
-Looting
-Serious & Memeable NPC's
-Dragons
-Community/Modding that keep this game fresh and updated (incase of bugs etc.)

If you havent bought it yet, i would highly recommend buying the Special Edition instead for an Updated Engine, better Mod Support +built in graphical updates.

Have fun with this one!"
26663,FUSE RO DAH
26664,"Best Game ever for RPG fans and the lot. Just make sure you mod it first ;)
"
26665,I am extremely disappointed in Bethesda for removing the DLC for the original version. I couldn't get it at the time I first bought it. Now I can't get it at all unless I buy the Special Edition. That is very bad business. This makes no sense for people who already had the game. Greedy!

26673,Amazin game!
26674,It has its faults and bugs but still even in 2020 a great game
26675,The base game is simply amazing.  I beat this game on 360 when it came out and I'm still playing it now.  With over 300+ hours I haven't even gone through half of the main story line so far on steam.  This is due to the variety of mods available and generally just having fun running around.  Highly recommend.
26676,It's amazing watching the characters freak out so in my opinion 10/10

Try it yourself, but don't expect much"
26693,obviously compared with my total time this hour log is inaccurate. partially due to having hella fun mods to play with. this game is fun and refreshing especially when its been years since ive played consistently. and to mention that this is the last good bethesda game. would play for nostalgia alone.

26712,chicken killing simulator is great
26713,Good game most players will get 100+ hours
26714,"Skyrim is an old classic at this point. Everyone knows it, most people love it, it's still as buggy as hell, and man, is it fun. I've played most of my 1400 hours in heavily modded saves, ranging from the Requeim Overhaul with light seasoning to the full-blown Ultimate Skyrim mod list. But since I've discovered Requiem, I haven't played it any other way. I've sort of forgotten what vanilla feels like.

That being said, I love Skyrim for what it is. Unmodded, it's a bit like a theme park: come, see the sights, do what you want to, go where you want to, when you want to. The amount of time that was obviously spent fleshing out Skyrim's open world is what makes this approach successful. Everywhere you go, there are little stories to uncover and quests to complete.

An overhaul like Requiem that forces you to pick your fights very carefully, effectively limiting the places you can go to the places with enemies you can manage, makes this even more abundantly clear. Every time I play, I find something new I've never seen before, even 1400 hours in, even though I only see a very small portion of the map because my characters rarely become powerful enough to take on the endgame content. The level of detail is amazing.

And it's still a buggy nightmare. A disastrous spaghetti mess of code. Seriously, Bethesda, if you spend half the time on fixing bugs as you did fleshing out side quests most players are going to miss, the game would be 5 times as stable. You're lucky the modding community likes the game enough to fix this for you."
26715,DLC unavailable EVEN if you own the game on steam already.
26716,I like the first person gaming. The combat. The mods.
26717,This just might be the perfect open world (and kind of open quest) game.

26725,One of the best games out there
26726,good game
26727,Very good game they need to make another one following the same plot. Top 5 games ever made
26728,you can make your own character and explore the world even after you complete all quests
26729,"This is the game of games, you may think, ""Hmm Skyrim is a kinda old game, why would i buy it now?"" well the answer is. becuase THIS IS THE GAME OF GAMES, it got a ton of replayability but what really makes this game the game of game is....

The mods!

Do you want to be a master of the dark magics? there is a mod for it,  do you want to fight giant mudcrabs with monocles? there is a mod for it, do you want to fight dragons looking like Thomas the tank engine? guess what? THERE IS A MOD FOR IT!

I myself have usually around 100-240 mods installed, and most just gets me more immersed, bigger cities, more guards, bigger dialogue overhauls, rings, capes, guard patrolls, better ai, smarter followers. you name it!

this game is the one game I will always give. 10/10"
26730,One Of The Best Games Ever Made
26731,tel me a better game then this
26732,the dopest free-roamingrich storyline adventure rpg game of all time!! will never get old
26733,"""SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS"""
26734,mod it till you break it
26735,"Nothing more can be said about this game. It lives up to its reputation, and with all the honors. Infinite game, tons of hours of gameplay, and of course, the PC version is the definitive version, with all the mods at your disposal."
26736,It's Skyrim. What else can i say? Of course it's good.
26737,If you don't already know about Skyrim quit wasting your time and buy it already. You will not regret it. this game is way far out
26738,Good
26739,yeah its okay i guess
26740,"It's definitely a super game. Don't be fooled by the Special Edition, if you want dlc, buy them from website of steam. That game is better than Withcher with mods already."
26741,I got this game for free back in 2017 and still playing in 2020 the longivety of this game is crazy. If you love to replay Rpgs doing different builds and things like that this game is for you 10/10.
26742,ITS DUCKING AMAZING!!!
26743,Its Amazing just like the other elder scrolls games heheh
26744,It's alright i guess
26745,if you haven't played skyrim then you need to. love rpg get it. hate your your other half and want an excuse to ignore them this will do it with over hours of game play with out mods.
26746,I sure wish there was a port of skyrim on <blank> right now
26747,Always get bored halfway through and probably would of forgotten it existed if it weren't for it being everywhere. Mods are great but there's better games to mod.
26748,[h1]10/10[/h1]
26749,good
26750,"For the love of god, yell at Bethesda for TES VI. Or at least play Morrowind or Oblivion instead."
26751,   ouytr
26752,dopest game on the planet. to this day 2020
26753,"Are you really checking the reviews for skyrim?
If you don't know what this game is about, just go check your smart toilet.
it's been ported to every system possible, and has remained a mainstay for many gamers for years.
you can lose your life in it."
26754,its sick bro
26755,i have been lost in this game since it first came out. hours upon hours lost wondering and just looking for what i can see. shoot got to the top of one mountain and turning you can see what looks like the white gold tower. the detail is fantastic.
26756,good game :D
26757,"Without mods 8/10
With mods ∞/10 - the game can be whatever you want - even Sekiro as of february of 2020, must have"
26758,No words could describe my love to this magnificent game. Best game of the decade <3 <3

26761,BETHESDA I AM LOVIN THIS GAME BUT HATIN YOU YOU F U C KING DIC KS I HATE YOU FOR MAKEING FALLOUT 76 ITS SO RETARTED
26762,hours of fun!!!!!
26763,It's Skyrim.
26764,I mean... if you don't know anything about the game just buy it and get addicted.
26765,"Played enough, but haven't, so I play more, then get bored after another 100 hours, then get bored uninstall and repeat the process, interesting, don't recommend because it doesn't take place in middle earth, but you can fix that with a few mods"
26766,Words can't describe how good this game is
26767,It's fun to fight dragons.
26768,ye
26769,has its bugs for sure but is definitely a great time even after the 9 years of release.
26770,"Good game, immersive easy to follow.. or not"
26771,Meep
26772,it good
26773,There is so much detail put into this game that I still find new things. I occasionally get stuck in places my character can walk into but not walk out of (code errors) but it's 99% amazing.
26774,"134 Hours in and I'm loving it awesome game, very good with or without mods I'm doing a vanilla playthrough and level 10 so far. great game a contender for best game of all time"
26775,"eveerythjiniv djg :) good
"
26776,"Endlessly playable, fun, and very immersive!  I don't normally like first-person games, but Skyrim is truly amazing."
26777,I have done so much on this game with and without mods. It is incredible the first time through and the various mods extend the lifespan so much.
26778,"It is Not a bad Game overall it has nice story side quests and mysteries to unravel, it's a really deep experience with quite a bit content to explore and sights to see, by far my favourite adventuring type of game, its a good game for how old it is and i would definitely recommend."
26779,Awesome
26780,Meh
26781,I killed a dragon. 10/10.
26782,"Played like 400 hours on console, just picked up the pc version. Just as fun as I remember, plus mods."
26783,Hmm. I guess it's okay.
26784,It is forever great.
26785,"It's fucking SKYRIM!!!
Oh you are awake, Seriously Get woke!"
26786,If you haven't played Skyrim know Todd Howard is out to get you.
26787,It's ight
26788,"506 hrs on record, more on Xbox. One of my all-time favorite games. Only killed a dragon once."
26789,"とにかく膨大なマップを歩き回れる剣と魔法の箱庭RPG
前作には無かったシャウトという特殊能力もありますが、使い勝手はあまり良くありません
大量に存在するダンジョンの9割以上はメインシナリオに関係なく、フィールドも行く必要も無いところばかり
そういったところを1つ1つ潰して踏破するのがこのゲームの醍醐味になります
一応アクションゲームっぽいですが、スキルツリーの関係上そこまで幅の広い戦い方は出来ないため、
長いことやっていると飽きてしまうかもしれません
その際はこれまた大量にあるMODを探して少しずつ導入しながらやってみるのもいいと思います"
26790, This is the latest of the ES stand alone's (ESO is out now).   It holds up to ESO as a stand alone.
26791,"Honestly this is my favorite game of all time. I will never stop playing it Im pretty sure. If I added the time spent on Steam with Playstation 3 and 4 as well as Xbox and Switch, it would be way more than a measly 406 hours. That's just on Steam alone."
26792,"Don't kid yourself, you don't need to read this review to know why Skyrim is great."
26793,Need more modssssssssssss!
26794,The game on its own is fantastic! There are mods that have additional quests to add more adventure..
26795,"FALLOUT 76 DOES NOT LET YOU UNINSTALL FROM WINDOWS, YOU HAVE TO LOAD THE BETHESDA LAUNCHER. AND I FORGOT MY PASSWORD. SO I DELETED YOUR LAUNCHER AND REVIEW BOMBED YOU HERE. BE BETTER BETHESDA"
26796,.
26797,Hours of replay value.
26798,"Fantastic game that has aged well, and with the massive modding community there are literally no limitations. I've come back to the old standby time and again over the years and I never get tired of it."
26799,I prefer this version over Special Edition just for the free mod support. Still one of my favorite go-tos for fantasy combat.
26800,i've bought this game for xbox and playstation my cousin said i need to try it on pc it just keeps getting better.
26801,some good shit aint gonna lie
26802,Fus Roh Dah.
26803,What can I say that hasn't already been said.
26804,wack.
26805,"The mods keep it interesting. Been playing the game for years...lol


"
26806,"Started playing this when I was 12 on the xbox 360, glad I went to PC much better. :D Will play this everyday."
26807,Great game!
26808,"Why they're hiding this game, Is still greats for gaming without a dlc, but you can get them for free or buy them for support, in the near Future they can build own for vr game in Skyrim or other games, I love the mods project from NexusMods and skse in their website."
26809,
26810,duh
26811,Its skyrim.
26812,Its Skyrim
26813,It's nice
26814,e
26815,it fun
26816,good game
26817,"I love the open world, and how much detail was put into each story."
26818,"love elder scrolls
"
26819,y
26820,It is an awesome game and it still holds up to this date :)
26821,fun
26822,It good.
26823,What I love Best about all Elder Scroll games is the freedom to do and not do whatever you like.  If you don't want to do the main questline you can still play for hours and hours.  the graphics in the game are absolutely amazing.  What I don't like about the game is that the quests are more fully developed for the fighting and thieving players than the spellcasting players.  I also wish they had developed a way for players to delete or move items in their homes more easily.  The homes you can buy are not set up well.  Luckily there are mods that you can use to adjust the homes to be more useful.  I highly recommend using them.
26824,it's nice game)
26825,AN INSTANT CLASSIC
26826,"10/10
"
26827,is skyrim
26828,NICE
26829,"wah keuren ya
"
26830,Its Skyrim ffs
26831,Epic game. One of the best role play games ever.
26832,like
26833,lets get real this is a pointless review since this game is so old and every one has played it. but if by the slim chance you haven't played it you really should. hands down the second best game ever made. And as far as hours of play goes it has the most to offer with all the mods and stuff. you really should already own this
26834,"honestly the most fun i had playing a game in a very long time
"
26835,"Why are you here? You've already seen 15 different Let's Play series, 5 million memes and 12 bazillion mod reviews. You don't need more reviews, you need the game. Just don't get this one, get the Special Edition. Unless you want Enderal, then get this one."
26836,
26837,100%
26838,Amazing.
26839,"There's a reason why Bethesda can release Skyrim for every console imaginable, and people still buy it. It's fantastic, that's the reason."
26840,The best offline game from my POV!
26841,dont play this game if you have a life same goes for any elder scrolls game because you will be sucked into this game and end up writing a review for it at 3am when you have exams in the morning but you're to busy trying to kill a dragon with a fork and knife that you found on your way up to the highest mountain under a wooden bridge and have now vowed that you will play the rest of the game with said fork and knife.
26842,Skyrim is fantastic. I love it to death and played countless hours between pc and console. Its fantastic.
26843,"TESV:skyrim is not a game, it is life style.
Edit: After playing this game over 1000 hours (include steam and other platforms) and unlock all of achievements of the game, more i try to write my experience and feeling more i understand that i can't. i feel and loved this game with every single cell in my body. if you tired of your real life you can make a life in Skyrim and live it, you can be a cold blood killer or be a healer, you can be  ruthless or be merciful, you can be a dishonorable thief or be a lovely champion, your choice. You may get tired of it but you will come back to it eventually."
26844,One of the greatest games I've ever played.
26845,"It's Skyrim, bruh."
26846,there is just so much to do
26847,This is... the third or fourth time I've revisited Skyrim since purchasing it years ago. I am in love with Skyrim and the sheer amount of work that the modding community has poured into it over time.
26848,It is one of the greatest games I have played and continue to play!
26849,I've played over 800 hours of Skyrim. Enough said.
26850,just get it if you havent already
26851,This is truly the best game I've played and the modding makes it infinitely replayable. I've had this game on ps3 and ps4 and now on pc. This is a must play for anyone who enjoys open worlds and its definitely worth a play through.
26852,"It's Skyrim! Buy it or don't; I'm a review, not the cops."
26853,"Its a huge world with so much to explore. While the main story is just blah, I spent many hours just exploring all the fascinating and secret places hidden all over the world. Make sure you check out the MODS for this game since they can really change the entire experience and make the game far, far better."
26854,It's just so fun.
26855,i love a game with an open world sandbox concept and storylines
26856,...its Skyrim...obviously everyone should play it.
26857,great game
26858,Unfortunately can't get the dlc without buying the game for another 40$ again. Thanks todd.
26859,"very involving, with moral chotses"
26860,its fun and there is so much mystery and places to explore
26861,Who's laughing now
26862,"Its lit
"
26863,"you see

todd is gaben 2.0
ive been playing this game for as long as i can remember

i enjoyz it"
26864,Its skyrim!!! how have you not played this
26865,hell ya
26866,"This is a solid game years after it first came out. Huge modding community helps to make game more fun and realistic. You'll never run out of things to do in game, especially with the tons of DLC sized mod worlds!"
26867,its good
26868,its skyrim... what did you expect?
26869,yes
26870,Just buy it.
26871,it's skyrim what else should I say
26872,"great game
"
26873,"if u never played, just fucking do it already"
26874,"This is not a good game. Really, it's bad. It's bad because of a lot of reasons, I'll list some of them below. Now, *modded Skyrim* is a whole different beast. With at least over 50 community mods installed (ideally 150+) this can actually become an epic game. That's not thanks to Bethesda, though. On the contrary, they nearly destroyed the modding scene with the Creation Club mess, which was basically an attempt from them to monetize and gain ownership over the community's content made for their game. Nowadays people see how bad Bethesda has become, but it was already something visible on Skyrim, that's for sure.

Some of the reasons why this game is bad:

- Tons of never patched game-breaking bugs, including CTDs (crashes-to-desktop) all the time if you as much as sneeze at the game;

- Bad graphics that haven't aged well at all, different from what happens with other older games;

- Terrible main story with dozens of plot holes. They admitted it by saying the game's moto is ""KISS"" (keep it simple stupid). Yeah, because everyone loves stupidly simple plots. Sure, Bethesda, now go sit over there.

- Annoying repetitive side stories with their ""radiant AI"" questing system. Basically you go through the same 4-5 quests from each guild over and over again, changing some of the names and locations each time.

- Superficial character customization with a lackluster perk system, again following the KISS philosophy.

- Repetitive dialogue with comically bad written characters throughout the world. Most of them say the exact same lines and a lot of the times with the exact same voice. Very lazy voice acting (not because of the voice actors themselves, but the developer clearly didn't care about how immersion breaking it is to have the same lines being repeated by different characters with the same voices all the time). I know they DID have the resources for something better, but even if they didn't, it would have been better to just not have every character be voice acted than this.

There are many more reasons why this is a bad game, but suffice to say it's only really liked by extreme Bethesda fanboys who have lost their critical sense. AGAIN: I'm not talking about modded Skyrim. Modding is something that can improve any game, and the *modding community* for this game has always been very active and creative. This is not, however, a review about the modding community, but rather about the vanilla game itself. Which is BAD."
26875,"It's Skyrim, enough said."
26876,It's considered a classic for a reason.
26877,If you never played Skyrim or any other elder scrolls game. Your gaming life means nothing...
26878,Fus-ro-dah
26879,it takes all your free time
26880,The best game to ever exist if you have never played it or don't like it your a disgrace to this world
26881,400 + hrs lmao yes
26882,I like this game
26883,its fricking amazing bruh. amazing content good gameplay
26884,"In most games, you cant break the laws of physics with a bucket. Skyrim is not like most games. You can break the sound barrier by tilting a horse. You can find inventories in rocks. But most of all, you can have fun."
26885,Very addictive
26886,Will Always be Epic
26887,it is very cool gamer time u go stab stab fus row dough to dragon
26888,There's nothing I can add that you don't already know. Yes it's good.
26889,"Played 3000 hours, yea, I guess I would recommend this game."
26890,"this is an awesome game man, one of the best games i've ever played. I can always return to it and play more, which makes it a very very valuable game to own."
26891,amazing
26892,As I'm sure others have said Skyrim is one of the best if not the best game I have ever played.
26893,skrooom
26894,pp
26895,Quite simply my favorite game of all time.

26914,"This game is so bad, I don't even know where to start. Shallow writing, terrible storyline, awful optimization and mechanics. Why did it win so many awards again?"
26915,"Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border , right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and the thief over there. Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks... Skyrim was fine until you came along! Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you I’d have stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. Looks at Dragonborn You there, you and me, we shouldn’t be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now. Driver: Shut up back there. Lokir: looks at Ulfric What’s wrong with him, huh? Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion... if they’ve captured you... oh gods, where are they taking us? Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits. Lokir: No, This can’t be happening! This isn’t happening! Ralof: Hey, what village are you from horse-thief? Lokir: Why do you care? Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home. Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m from Rorikstead. Hadvar: General Tullius sir! The headsman is waiting. Tullius: Good, let's get this over with. Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh! Divines, please help me! Ralof: Sees Tullius Look at him! General Tullius, the Military. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves, I bet they had something to do with this. notices where they are This is Helgen... I used to be sweet on a girl from here. I wonder if Velod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in... Funny, when I was a boy Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe. Child: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going? Father: You need to go inside, little cub. Child: Why? I want to watch the soldiers! Father: Inside the house, now. Child: Yes papa... heads inside Driver: Woah... pulls in reins Female Captain: walks up to cart Get these prisoners out of the cart! Lokir: Why are we stopping? Ralof: Why do you think? End of the line. 

TLDR:  Pretty good game. 11/10"
26916,"A huge and detailed world populated with several races and cultures of humans and creatures. Your chosen character can be selected from any one of those races/cultures and be equipped from a great selection of weapons,spells, clothing, and weapons. The freedom to roam freely all over the game world interacting with people, places and objects means you can carry on re-playing this game many times with each game being quite different and new discoveries being made in the Skyrim world. I've just picked up this game years after I bought the original and loved playing it again. I am 75 years old which indicates the games's wide-ranging appeal!"

26924,"167 out of 168 hours spent installing and testing mods

26926,"What's there not to like?  A huge open world game with enough stuff to do that you never need to finish the story.  This is classic Bethesda game design, and with a much better storyline than Oblivion."
26927,"So I'm 9 hours in, and I've never played skyrim before. Here's hoping Todd Howard doesn't hear me...

It's a good game.

I like it a lot."

26929,"Dude, it's Skyrim. Buy it."
26930,this game is really good for the amount of times you can replay the game
26931,.
26932,"It's Skyrim, everyone knows Skyrim."
26933,"I wouldn't recommend buying the newer ""graphically enhanced version,"" because if you have 1 brain cell left in your head, you'd simply download the mods they scaveneged from the internet... FOR FREE! :) OH WAIT! They took the old version off the purchasing list! Wow! It's almost like they want you to buy the new version so you can't simply mod the old one to the same standard! Wowwwww! Cool! Gotta love cooperate scum fucks making money off the ignorant. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim. GG bethesda. There's also G.2.A where you can buy the original though. And fuck over these thieveing cooperate fucks! Enjoy. (G.2.A had to be spaced out because steam doesn't want it's competitors displayed in reviews! Cooperate scum fucking money grubbing cunts!)"

26937,I highly endorse this game its is a sand box with a huge base of modder's who have created full dlc level additions. This really is a must have game for any library just be sure to visit the Nexus online to get the most value from this and other Bathesda titles
26938,this game is shit
26939,greatest game of do what ever you want in a midevil fantasy world
26940,"Greatest Single Player Game Of All Time. TES Series In General Is A Must Play, Even In 2020."

Been playing this ever since it came out and mod authors STILL coming out with new mods for this game, it's hard to get sick and tired of it. Definitely worth every penny."
26961,"There is absolutely nothing to say is wrong about this, a masterpeice, fullstop."
26962,It's Skyrim.
26963,.
26964,If u mod there is many tiddis
26965,"It's alright I guess
"
26966,fun
26967,"No matter your playstyle, Skyrim will always be fun, sure you may get bored of it and stop for a few weeks, but watch a few videos about the game and you'll want to restart playing again. 

If I would have to give the game a rating on 10, I would give it a 9 simply because of all of the bugs that could have been fixed, but, with the mods that can solve many of the games issues, it is still one of my favorite games of all time."
26968,Damn.
26969,yuh
26970,This is one of the best games I have ever played.
26971,"The classic, anyone looking at this on the fence, just do it. The level of freedom is staggering, coupled with a story line that just gently entices you to follow it, makes the game so open and a true RPG. Want to be a cat person that is also a healer and also mines ore and travels the land making huge profit go for it. Want to join a brotherhood of monster killers? do it. You can come back to the story whenever you want. 

A massive tree of combat / crafting / etc lets you fully customize any weird whacky gameplay experience you want. With tons of side quests and other fun avenues to explore you could play 200 hours and never do the main story line, though its well worth it."
26972,it is the shit especially with mods
26973,nice game love to play rpgs  now you can put mods into it to inprove game tottaly awsome skyrim still my favorite  rpg game
26974,Greatest game I've ever played!

26979,I like everything
26980,it's aight
26981,Its fun
26982,"To be honest, I've played this game on all the platforms it is available on. I really love this game and there is so much to do. I like it on PC the most because of the Steam Workshop Mods from the community. I will keep playing this game for the rest of my life and on all platforms."
26983,"There's always something to do. It's one of those games I constantly go back to when I've run through my library, and have nothing else to play."
26984,Very fun and creative. You will be challenges and can be anything you want. Mods make it a lot better.
26985,its skyrim what do i need to say?
26986,It is a really fun game and had really good graphics for the time and I really missed it
26987,I like the game but i wished i was playing breath of the wild :(
26988,"So if you've never played skyrim before, I can't reccomend it high enough."
26989,its good
26990,"this game is a gift from the mighty god todd, i have devoted my life to experiencing it for ever and ever"

26992,Great game. Get it if you like RPG's
26993,good game
26994,This is a great game I just wish there was more add on's.
26995,"Game mechanics are simple but provide for a wide range of play options. Play is in real time, giving you the feel of a true simulation except when doing crafting or trading. There are numerous mods that can customize the game to your particular bent. It is a sandbox style, allowing you to go almost anywhere, anytime with day and night time settings."
26996,i play it for the romance options
26997,Yeah I'm still stuck in the character creator.
26998,Is fun
26999,huge game everything is awesome!!!!!

27013,"It's Skyrim, the game that changed everything! Enough said!"
27014,"Spent more time modding, than playing"
27015,its  skyrim
27016,"I normally love these kinds of games, and it does seem to be a really good game. But, for some reason i just can't seem to get into it outside of modding it with a bunch of fun mods. I don't know why. 5/5 for it either way."
27017,It´s Ruuuuuuu-ruuuu to have this game if you haven´t get it yet.
27018,Best rpg exp

"
27024,It's a great game.
27025,"best game I've played. allows a lot of exploring and many, many quests."
27026,so much to do in this game. theres even a mod to hit children!
27027,He.
27028,This game is shit. 10/10
27029,"It's damn near an endless game. There's a mountain of content in the base game and the DLC expansions are massive additions. The visuals and audio are beautiful. Character development is simple but allows huge variation in how you play the game. The lore is intriguing and provides nice opportunities to add a bit of flavour to your characters for hardcore roleplaying fans. The number of mods available is limitless. 

Full of positives. Probably the last great Bethesda title."
27030,Big tits and dragons? All good my dudes
27031,Amazing experience
27032,GREAT BIG EPIC STORY
27033,"Limitless play, allows you to take different paths, even if they wind up in the same place. Looking forward to the next iteration."
27034,"it is FUN 
"
27035,Awesomeness
27036,"A very good open world game where you have your own oppurtunities to go by, the story of the game, characters and even the books which you can find while drinking your ale in an inn are so interesting and well thought out."
27037,wee wee
27038,"This game deserves more attention, very under-rated"
27039,"A classic game filled with hours and hours of game play. Personally, I use the plethora of mods available to make this game truly the RPG I want it to be. Along with doing screenarchery on Instagram. Been playing since 2011 and probably never put this game to rest. Fus Roh Dah!"
27040,So nostalgic to play again!!!! Would recommend 10/10
27041,i like it
27042,Rip bethesda but this game is still good.
27043,love it but it would nice bethesda re list the dlc or gave everyone the new version for  no cost so we dont rebuy a game we dont want rebuy at full price
27044,"I slept on this game for years and years and then finally decided to give it a college try. I did a great deal of research on how to become the most powerful mage, and grinding everything to make myself as strong as you possibly could get. After a good 15 or so hours of resetting npc inventories, transmuting iron into gold, crafting necklaces to enchant and sell, crafting potions, and casting the same spells over and over I finally got everything I needed. I used enchanting to create a set of gear for alchemy, to help create potions to help with future enchanting and smithing. I then enchanted the best possible set for smithing, to use to craft the best possible armor in the game. From there, I enchanted it with the best possible mage enchants available. So now that my destruction required no magika to use and my mana pool was big enough and regenerated fast enough to cast any spell ever. I bought the most powerful spells currently for sale and I began my journey. Within an hour it became apparent that mages are weak as fuck. It took me 36 casts of the most powerful spell I had to take down a random npc in the wild, who could easily kill me in 2 hits. So I decided to hit him with this random axe I had picked up. Keep in mind that my 1 handed skill was under 20. The axe killed him in about 6 hits.

At this point I figured that maybe there was something special to learn at the college. After being forced to lower the difficulty by one level so that my spells actually felt powerful, I finished the quest chain in about 2 hours. Legitimately was about 5 quests long. Not a single memorable moment whatsoever. The chain was also incredibly predictable and contained no rewards worth anyone's time. 

The disappointment I have for mages in Skyrim as a whole is immeasurable.

TL/DR: I spent over a dozen to make the best possible armor and enchants to become the most powerful mage ever, only to find out a random low tier 1 handed axe trumped my entire build by about 600%. Also, the mages guild quest chain equivalent is a complete joke.

If you enjoyed the depth and complexity of magic in previous elder scrolls game, you certainly wont find any of that here. I plan to play more of this game, but I guess i'll have to use console commands to reset my stats or start an entirely new game with a melee build in mind. 

I'm only not recommending this to anyone who enjoyed mages in previous titles and was expecting more. Everything else seems to be enjoyable. I'll update this review after I change my entire build and try out some other (hopefully more interesting) quest lines.

UPDATE: Yeah, this is boring. The entire world is bland, just nothing but snow. Might be great for the lore masters out there, but when I have been walking across the same textures for hours on end, it gets old. Same goes for the dungeons. Every single quest so far has lead me into the same cave to fight the same creatures for the same lackluster rewards. Also, the game is just too dark in general. I understand the reason behind building an atmosphere, but damn I can't see anything. I don't remember having this issue in previous games. As far as quests are concerned, nothing is of any interest, and everything I have done so far is completely forgettable. All the NPCs are more boring and lifeless than ever, dubbed with pornography grade voice acting and lame dialogue choices. The races are just too similar too, I can't tell anyone apart from each other. Also, nobody seems to care about you at all. I became the leader of the thieves guild and not a single person in the guild has any different voice lines to make me feel important, or that your actions mattered at all. Aside from all this the balance doesn't feel right. Without a class system you are free to level whatever you want, but I don't think this aspect does the game any favors. You have no identity in this game, you don't even get to chose a sign when you start the game, which has been a part of the elder scrolls lore forever. Also it just has so many bugs. I get that with these 100 hour games it's impossible to get everything working properly, but some of them are just awful. I broke many quests and had to reload in just the 35 hours or so that I played.

So yeah, I don't get why this game is loved so much by everyone. Oblivion just did almost everything better More memorable quests, NPC's and dialogue choices. Better loot and balance. More interesting environments and dungeons. Also, spellcrafting exists. About the only thing that Skyrim really did that I enjoyed was the crafting system, and the improvements to enchanting. Also giants and dragons are pretty cool too.

So I'm over it. It's not a horrible game by any means, it's just not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be. Oblivion just did it better, and received half the praise at best.

Another update: Tried again as a bow master and I couldn't be more disappointed. Your arrows go about half an inch above where you are aiming. Even at like 25 feet you basically have to aim at someones chest if you want the arrows to hit their head. Completely counter intuitive to how any other game handles bow mechanics. Another issue I remembered when playing again was how incredibly bad the map markers are. Specifically how your quest marker just blends into them. I usually spend a good 30 seconds to a minute just searching the map trying to figure out where I'm supposed to go. More often than not I have to aim my character towards the quest marker on my HUD, then go the map and look at what direction I'm facing and go from there.

I'll surly come back in like a year with more things to complain about.

"
27045,"I find myself returning to have a few hours of gameplay every now and then.
Thats how good it its."
27046,"Does anyone really need to know why Skyrim is recommended? 
It's more prettier than Morrowind, but not as good as a game. But it's good. Except the main quest line. That's bad."
27047,GOAT! Love this game so much!

27102,"*buys Game several years after it's release*
""you're finally awake"""
27103,"In the middle of writing this it became apparent that this review is more of an analysis on the state of the TESV modding community rather than the game itself; read on if you care to:

The base game is epic and entertaining, but add mods at your own risk. Not that modding this game is terribly risky; but it will severely impact your enjoyment of the vanilla game. Playing Skyrim is like discovering the joys of swimming for the first time: at first it's daunting, seemingly insurmountable, but you've seen and heard others do it countless times before you gave it a shot, so you're no less determined to try it for yourself. Once you start adding mods to your game, you'll slowly start to realize that the vanilla game was more like a kiddie pool or a puddle. And if you wanted to give the Special Edition a shot, let me simplify my feelings on it and say that all editions of Skyrim can only be as enjoyable as the least enjoyable mod you can add to it; and the Legendary Edition (the OG Skyrim that came out on 11-11-11 + the official DLC packs that came later) has a wider selection of compatible mods that are easy to use, fun to play, and have the benefit of being more refined and user-friendly than all the mods for SE - because the authors of the LE mods have had more time to work out the kinks in their mods. Not to mention that there are some awesome LE mods out there that were more-or-less perfected then abandoned by their authors before they could be ported-over to SE - you go on the Nexus site and you'll see all sorts of mods that were originally for LE but have been converted by other authors using the source codes of the originals (with permission, of course) that are not affiliated with the original authors. You'll also find unfinished betas and alphas of SE mods based on popular LE mods, and SE mods that work differently from the original LE versions. I'm sure my first couple hundred hours in Skyrim were purely vanilla, but I've played with mods for so long that going back to the game's roots feels like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling; so, I can't really give a review on the game without addressing the state of the modding community at this time. 

Long story short: play SLE for the mods, play SSE for the vanilla experience. Mods aren't disabled in modded SLE, so if you were at all concerned about missing the chance to unlock the Steam achievements, there's no need to fret."
27104,good game great mods
27105,"It's Skyrim. I have been playing for 8 years now and am on my 6th play-through.  It's like open world D&D in an apic videogame format, what else needs to be said?  Get it."
27106,"Even after all these years, this game holds up. The exploration is extraordinarily good fun. The dungeons are unique and exciting even after hundreds of hours over different versions of the game. The characters are not a strong point, but they're good enough to want to share the world with them...

...Except fucking Nazeem

If for whatever reason, you still haven't played this game, pick it up and start adventuring."
27107,Be whoever you want to be. The possibilities are endless.
27108,Pretty good game. beautiful visually and has amazing dynamic branching story lines. it can be quite buggy though so if that's a pet peeve of yours i would say to get it on a different platform. the game is amazing tho.
27109,Hella fun but mods are even better
27110,it's ok i guess.
27111,"It's perfect, can't wait to continue this on special edition."

27124,I hated every second in this game. Todd Howard really pulled one over on me. This game is absolute garbage. I'd rather remove my toenails with a can opener than play this game for even a minute longer. Fuck Bethesda.

27126,The game where you yell at people.

27131,"it's awesome and well thought out,"

27133,"Even Vanilla Skyrim is an engaging gaming experience with a wide variety of quests that accommodate different playing styles. If modding your games with Vortex is something you are comfortable doing then the impressive support form the modding community, which adds everything from minor tweaks to game transforming rebuilds, is not to be missed."
27134,An interesting main story. Lots of side details and tons of mods to play with. What more can you ask of a game like this?
27135,very cool dragon game lots of yelling
27136,"Played a little, pretty fun."
27137,great game. always loved rpg games including fantisy games. worth the money worth your time . on a side note don't buy the online version. not worth it. stick with the original. there's workshop stuff increase your play time

Damn Dragons could swoop down anytime. Oh, what was I sayin'? Right, I'm in Whiterun, yeah, and Helgan... destroyed by a dragon, Hard to believe, isn't it? Anyway, I'm helping the Yarl with this whole dragon problem and this guys says ""I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble"". It wasn't for glory or nothin' it was more like, If those Whiterun guards can kill a dragon so can we, you know? Anyway I take down the beast, all the men are cheering, yelling ""By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon!"" an I got to thinking... maybe I'm the Dragon born and just don't know it yet?

I have a house and a child who is nice, 10/10 wholesome."

27165,Awesome literally endless fun
27166,"It's a good game.
Download it, get a couple of dozens of mods from Nexus to make it excellent and just have whatever fun with it. It's as much of a sandbox game as it can be, without turning into Garry's mod.

Do stay away from new-er releases... or new Bethesda games in general."
27167,This is a very fun game. I've played it so much that i have actually gotten burned out.

27199,"You know what it is, its skyrim it might not be the best game but god damn if there isn't something about it that's just bloody amazing, as you can see I've spent a lot of time in this game even more on the various other versions so it clearly doing something right to keep me hooked for that long, It's not the deepest but its still great"
27200,honestly a disappointing and lackluster game
27201,"yes
"
27202,"good
"
27203,"If you have a toaster like I do, unable to run Special Edition, and you can even find the store page for the original version, it's worth the price. Eat a dick Todd."
27204,good game
27205,"Gods, I love this game. I can play it for hours."
27206,"SKyrim is a badass game. Tons of glitches and craziness ensue, but despite its hiccups it's amazing. It reminds me of Bethesda's lost greatness. Remember when they cared? Skyrim just might."
27207,gud geme
27208,5/7
27209,"I have spent more time in Skyrim, on the computer, the switch, the Xbox, than any other game so far in my life. With mods it is a brand new game whenever I want in a million ways. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in this genre."
27210,I love this game so many options on how to build
27211,Just an awesome game you can relax to without wearing out your thumbs.
27212,"Skyrim is a wonderful ""classic"". Had great times playing when I was younger, as well as watching my dad, who was much better than me, play. Great times can still be had and even more with the plethora of available mods."
27213,Very cool game with a huge world to explore. Some bugs exist but they are not entirely game breaking. Definitely worth adding to your wishlist and buying during a sale.
27214,do i really need to say anything its skyrim
27215,good
27216,Absolute classic
27217,"Yes, good, very nice."
27218,open world is great.
27219,"This is most amazing game to play to date with millions of mods to play with it never gets old been playing this game sense 2011 and still impressed in how long people pour many hours into this game to come up with some of the most amazing projects such as beyond skyrim, skyoblivion, and many more shows how people really love elder scrolls and it ever expanding universe :)"
27220,"Skyrim is a fantastic game that i have spent countless hours enjoying my time with. I highly recommend you play through a vanilla game before modding so you can get the real feel before modding it out. then i recommend going to nexus mods downloading vortex and modding this bitch out like pimp my ride from 2004.
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO STAY STOCK, SEND IT BROOOOO...."
27221,sdgfsdfgfds
27222,well i dont like single player games a lot.. i didnt even bother much with this one.. i liked how it is.. but still single player games are boring for me.. (NEVER MIND.. i love this.. just some mods and is a  amazing game..if you know what i mean)
27223,"Good Immersive game, not nearly as complicated as something like Witcher, but still plenty in denpth to sink hundreds of hours into and get your fantasy rocks off while you wait for your next D&D session"
27224,Not bad
27225,You can play this over and over again and itll never be the same
27226,I find myself coming back to this game again and again regardless of system
27227,"This is one of the best games ever made, the crafting system and graphics are vastly improved over it's predecessor. I don't think it's possible to not like skyrim."
27228,Great game.
27229,"A fun RPG! I would highly recommend getting all the DLC or the Legendary edition package, you'll end up buying it later anyway. I use 28 mods right now, be sure to make use of the steam workshop. You can get left handed rings, improved magic, better ai combat, and more from free mods."
27230,"Skyrim is a game with a great cenarios, amazing context, funny to be played, on the char that you create. Hours of gameplay that will bring to you good moments. You can create your own char from diferent races and personalize them as you wish.
The game has a large community that provided tips, mods and immersion to your gameplay."
27231,"It's fun, and has plenty of mods. Save frequently."
27232,"Swords, armor, axes, magic. Just a few tools for you to use whilst you fight the undead, vampires, dragons, and other creatures in various dungeons and other locations. May the Gods watch over you battles. Hail Sithis. And happy adventures."
27233,Yes
27234,"Easily one of the best games i have ever played.  Maybe one of the best ever made. Good graphics, great stories and lot's of RPG choices.  It's a Bethesda title so expect some strange glitches.  Buggy is the norm. But inspite of it this game is one i go back to frequently! Well worth you money................"
27235,Love the game. Definitely recommend.
27236,"great
"
27237,Ages well and has a lot of replayability even in 2020. Loads of fun and you will always have something to do.
27238,It's skyrim.  What more do you want.  One of the best modding communities around.  Just buy it!
27239,"11/10 no bugs. great devs, loving the continuous updates."
27240,played a little more it's still fun
27241,decent
27242,I mean what more can I say...It's Elder Scrolls we're talking about.
27243,Great game
27244,itz ok
27245,Legend
27246,"Okay Game, Oblivion was a better game though."
27247,"ADDICTED. My co-worker Eric got me hooked on this game. Thank you Eric, wherever you are. I purchased the original Skyrim game from him in 2013 for just $10. We worked at BestBuy at that time, he was going to trade it in. Eric explained to me about the game and was blown away by his review of the game. At that time I was looking for a new game but had little funds. I asked if he was selling his copy of Skyrim and with only $10 in my pocket I purchased one of my best buys from BestBuy. I will never forget that day because after the deal I played for hours. My life was consumed in the lore of it all. Then when I thought the game could be coming to an end, here came the Legendary Edition. I was thrown back into the game. This time I had just discovered mods from a friend and another couple of years flew by it seemed. I didn't care what was going on when around me because when time was free, I was free to escape into my game. The Special Edition came out not long ago and that is my go to version though I highly recommend this version because for me it's what started it all. My addiction."
27248,Cool winter sim.
27249,"Why are you reading reviews? everyone knows this game. I would say you would have to have lived under a rock to need to read the reviews, but I'm like 90% sure that Daddy Howard released this game on a rock before."
27250,Is good game
27251,"Pretty cool. Don't get the Special Edition. Play the vanilla version, then come back and mod the shit out of it for more immersive experiences. Pretty cool."
27252,"Having had a homestead in the Alaskan wilderness, this game touches my heart's memories and desires of returning (impossible due to disability).  It touches dreams of past worlds and past times while encompassing the best of all the gaming I've done in the last 25 years!"
27253,ok
27254,greatest game of all time
27255,Best Introduction to this genre for those who don't often play this type of game.
27256,Fun.
27257,OH SHIT
27258,"After Arma 3, this is the game which I have spent the most hours on. One of the best games I've ever played."
27259,It's Skyrim. Enough said
27260,"It's Skyrim, just shell out your money to Todd and spend 200 hours beating it. Then another. Then another. Then another."
27261,Best. I have played only one character and still going. I always like to get back to this game.
27262,"One of the game, which even after the tens of played hours suprised me with a lot of new things. I´m always very sad, when I had finally gotten all enhancement and the game become death - per - one - click and I had to start from zero."
27263,Great Game
27264,94/100 metascore [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim] on metacritic [/url]
27265,"Good game, it does have a lot of problems, but I had and still have fun with it and a couple of mods"
27266,just a great game... developed well!!! AMAZING!
27267,This game is a timeless masterpiece its very very good epic and just Perfect
27268,"Fifth game in the famous Elder Scrolls RPG series and a smashing hit as soon as it came out in 2011, Skyrim brings another large world to explore, more combat-oriented gameplay (at the expense of classical RPG elements), radical shift in the lore that brings the story into the fourth era, plenty of quests on the background of middle-scale war and the return of the mythical dragons, crafting, vastly improved graphics and outstanding soundtrack, in short everything that fans of the Elder Scrolls yearned for. The game has its flaws (it’s Bethesda we’re talking about here), but despite that it’s incredibly immersive and captivating to last for hundreds of hours, and remains the most popular TES game until this day (or at least is a very close draw to Morrowind). On Steam you can get the full GotY edition with all official DLCs (Dawnguard, Heartfire, Dragonborn), and you can buy additional mods from the Creation Club, or get thousands of free mods from the Steam workshop."
27269,It's Skyrim. Just get it.
27270,Can't wait to get out of the tutorial and see what this game is really about!
27271,Epic
27272,"Great Game,One of the best ever made for its kind, and the classics are great to! But yea, story is wonderful, so is the lore, the game is beautiful with how the open world looks, unique weapons and characters. So i do recomend getting the game!"
27273,Excellent game
27274,Is good.
27275,h
27276,EBIC
27277,This is my favorite game of all time. Certain things haven't aged well but that's to be expected.
27278,its a diffrent game type with its open sandbox style most enjoyable
27279,"Probably one of my all time favourite games.
Played on every possible platform, sunk close to 1000 combined hours.... and still haven't finished it."
27280,Somebody stole your sweetroll?
27281,"If you Like medieval games where you get awesome gear, Skyrim is the way to go"
27282,skyrinm
27283,fun
27284,yee
27285,great game
27286,"Almost 290hrs with the same character... Ever going fun!
After a few years, I'm back and up for 100+ more with a new one <3"
27287,"So where to start, I don't write many reviews I guess that's a good place. So this will be sporadic and probably not very helpful but for a game that took two of my summers away it deserves a notice. The graphics and voice acting are probably the high points, the cinematic kill sequences that came from the Fallout series was a really good idea. The story is well not so much, but you get to watch yourself behead people in slow motion so the pay-offs are there. The quests have been simplified for meatlumps with eyes who can't do more than toss and fetch, but still fun. Overall a great game with good replay value, if you haven't gone dragon-slaying yet, go quit life and do it."
27288,"When I play Skyrim, I just lose myself. It's as if I am in another dimension walking, running, swimming and jumping around the beautiful locations. Everywhere I turn, there is something new to be discovered and it is truly breathtaking. If we were in a desolate future with no source of entertainment or anything alike, this video game would be one of the special things I would reminisce about. This game has a special place in my heart."
27289,"I.....feel like this is the better version, the workshop content is more random and fun. the special editions workshop is kinda watered down, if you want full, unfettered madness, load up some workshop mods on this version and go to town."
27290,Good game with a lot of content and a nice story.
27291,IT IS A MUST TO PLAY THIS GAME
27292,yes
27293,Best game ever!
27294,Duh it's Skyrim... and it's Elder Scrolls. You would be made not to like these games.
27295,I was really into it for a couple years. Haven't played it in a long time. Completely unplayable without mods. Good fun though.
27296,"Still got some bugs, but its one of the best games EVER. (legendary edition)"
27297,one of the best game i played
27298,SIMPLY THE BEST!
27299,"fun and never ending quest
"
27300,Great game
27301,"My gaming life can be described as ""Before Skyrim"" and ""After Skyrim"". This game completely changed my life and now its extremely difficult for me to play anything else or similar. Sure, I've played Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition and other fantasy RPGs, however the standard has always been Skyrim since I played it. Needless to say, I highly recommend this game. I am writing this review in 2020 and I purchased the game in early 2012. I still play it regularly."
27302,just buy it
27303,very good big wow
27304,"If you haven't played this game, where have you been?"
27305,Tod will be made if you don't play .
27306,game of the decade
27307,amazing
27308,is good
27309,"Great open world that nudges you towards the main quest but you figure it all out, your character and the quests on your own terms... loads of fun."
27310,GOAT
27311,this is by far one of the best games that has ever been made. Not many games can be almost 10 years old and still have as much replay value like this game does.
27312,Ah! Ro! Fus! 11/10
27313,Skyrim. Need I say more?
27314,"Best RPG I've ever played, and likely ever will."
27315,like the best RPG ever created
27316,good story
27317,Bethesda sucks but Skyrim is fun so?
27318,Phenomenal game absolutely one of the all time greatest!
27319,4
27320,best game of all time
27321,One of the best open world games iv'e ever played!
27322,this game is really cool and i would tell everyone that likes to play games like this about this game
27323,Yall already know how good the game is
27324,THE BEST.
27325,gg
27326,
27327,cunt
27328,"Its good. Very active mod community, I've been playing it intermittenly for like 9 years and I'm still not bored of it."
27329,"Skyrim is just Skyrim and if you been living under a rock for the past 10 years then you 
need to pick this up and waste 10 years of your life playing this game but it will be 
so worth it.  
You got work nope Skyrim your job now 
you got family duty's Skyrim is your family now 
You think you have a social life nope Skyrim is your life now.

27330,"odlican rpg

27331,how do i write a review on steam?
27332,ultra-pog
27333,Third time through... still stable and fun.
27334,"Absolute classic, cannot fault it, played the game more times through that I care to think about and still come back"
27335,"it very gud
"
27336,i like it when it crashes
27337,"Pros: Endless hours of entertainment, interesting world/plot, lots of weird things to get involved with, including the bugs--I mean ""features.""
Cons: You can't marry Teldryn Sero. Luckily, there's a mod for that ;)"
27338,"This game is the titan of RPGs for me. I love to just enter in the world and start adventuring in random dungeons, sneaking and sniping around helpless creatures.  You can customize so much and have different play styles over so many runs that you will not get bored easily.

Horses that go 90 degrees vertically, bugs that glitch you through map, giants with big toes that fling you like a sock puppet, giant dragons that attack you every 3 minutes, entire towns that want you dead over a chicken... This is a blast!"
27339,"This game is fun, sexy characters, in depth story lines, Magic, combat, wars, and dragons. So many options on how to live the life of your characters. It is a classic addictive RPG. You will not want to stop."
27340,Explore a beautiful world and play the way you want
27341,"Once upon a time, I used to enjoy this game.  Then Bethes-duh tried to monetize the game (at almost 10 years in - presumably out of desperation)  ala disgusting greediness and creation club idiocy.  Impossible to play the game without having all your mods broken every day because of Toddler Howard's endless smug slap-worthy greediness.  Then Fallout 76 happened.  The rum thing.  The cheap plastic bags for people who paid for canvas collector's items.  The micro-transactions.  The banning of innocent players.  This company is an arrogant train wreck.  I'll never play another Bugthesduh game nor will these corporate manipulators get another penny out of me.  Greedy tw@ts."
27342,it's dangerously amazing
27343,amazing game
27344,it's pretty ace.
27345,This game is the most oversimplified elder scrolls ever. The best is daggerfall followed by morrowind. Check out unity daggerfall project and skywind .
27346,"Do I really have to give a reason for you to get this game?
This is the best Openworld RPG game that I've played, it's enjoyable, it has tons of gameplay, and if you get bored there is a community full of mods to spice up your save,  It's just too good, You have to get it yourself to really experience what it has to offer"
27347,fun game to mod
27348,legendary game
27349,.....
27350,"Would 100% recommend downloading this game, modding it until it's barely usable, playing it for a few hours, then uninstalling it.

Repeat every 6 months."
27351,"Its Skyrim. You've played it before. Still fun, still pretty."
27352,I love this game!
27353,"216 hours is a lot of time for a bad game
but it is not a lot of time for a good game"
27354,This is a great game! Nuff Said
27355,great game still.
27356,LOVE this game! World exploration is fun but it would be more fun as a MMORPG
27357,"Its skyrim, pretty good.
"
27358,"10/10, side quest so good you forget about the main quest"
27359,great game
27360,You want dragons? It's got dragons. You like magic? It's got magic. Don't get to the cloud district very often? It's got the cloud district. Don't like something? There's a mod for that.
27361,"I prefer 'solo' (non multiplayer games), and they can be hard to find in this type of fantasy role playing game.  Skyrim has a great storyline, with complicated main quests and lots of smaller side quests.  I've played through the main quests several times, but have not yet ever completed all the side quests.  You can do the various quests in different order, so that replaying the game isn't boring.  Plus there are many options for your character-- you can choose to develop various different skills and use different weapons and spells.  The graphics and music are marvellous.   This game is wonderfully absorbing, and there aren't many bugs left, so your gaming experience is rarely disturbed.  The auto-save feature works really well also; the only time you can 'lose' a chunk of play is when you travel a long way without encountering any combat, and then get suddenly defeated.  This is easily remedied by saving regularly as you travel, plus the fast travel between known points works very well if you want to avoid tedious running along the road (of course, when you fast travel, you miss out on adventures and opportunities along the way...)  Skyrim was my first experience with a Steam game, and I love it!"
27362,"you can't climb that mountain 
"
27363,fun game.
27364,Awesome
27365,11/10
27366,Good old Skyrim
27367,A hotshit overrated garbage made by bethesda.
27368,been a fan for years love elder scrolls and will always love it
27369,"muy bueno
"
27370,fv
27371,bandits
27372,yes
27373,It's amazing. any other opinion is wrong.
27374,"Best game, I play it on my fridge all the time. 10/10. Thanks Todd Howard!"
27375,I mean come on. Its skyrim.
27376,The graphics will make your mind explode. Plenty of player made content to keep you content too! - if you manage to complete the main game and side quest and explore every inch of the game.  I get lost in this game every time I play and I'll be playing it over and over for many many more years to come.
27377,Grunk approves
27378,Excellent Game
27379,
27380,"he is nice game my friend have 800 h :P
"
27381,"I played a few hundred hours of this on the Xbox, PC is so much better as you have hundreds of mods, graphics, sounds, new quests etc, its still a great game after all these years."
27382,noiceeeeee
27383,"I've put thousands of hours into this game, even more fun with mods."
27384,"its skyrim
"
27385,Quality
27386,One word MODS
27387,hell ye
27388,10/10
27389,"My playtime with the Elder Scrolls series only goes back to Morrowind. In my younger days I even spent a while modding the game to suit my own tastes (although I never published my mods). In all I have probably spent close to 1000 hours playing games set in the Elder Scrolls universe.

Looking back on this I would have to accept that the games must be doing something right to draw me in for such an extended period of time. The lore is well developed and the open-world sandbox environment is simply huge. You can spend ages exploring and never see it all.

And therein lies the biggest problem I have with the games. The temptation to see it all and do it all means that there are too many distractions. It is easy to get lost and forget exactly what you are doing. Simpler RPGs can be more engaging from a story perspective as a result. In Skyrim I never felt like I really cared. It was aimless wandering and discovery of little secrets that made the game intriguing.

Another mechanic I feel detracts from the game is the fast travel. Once you have discovered a location you can travel there immediately (as long as you are not engaged in battle). Whilst I understand the necessity of doing this in a game world this large, it has the perverse effect of making the world feel smaller and thus completely making redundant the point of having a large game world in the first place. Furthermore, the environments do start to feel very similar after a while. In contrast Morrowind was a much smaller gameworld (with very slow travel speed and lots of fog to make it feel bigger) with very varied environments. Quality, not quantity.

So is the game worth playing? In a word, ""yes"".

I may feel that the series has lost its spark but that doesn't mean the game is not good. It just has some big boots to fill from its predecessors that really pushed the boundaries of what was possible in a computer game. In other words it is merely ""good"" but not ""groundbreaking""."
27390,Skyrim/10
27391,I love how every time I make a new save file there is something I get to discover like I am playing this game foe the first time. The vanilla game is wonderful and because this game has been out for so long you can get mods to make the game weird or enhance the beauty of this game
27392,"it good
thanks for coming to my TED Talk"
27393,great
27394,"one of the best games ive ever played still has a vibrant modding community 
cannot reccomend enough"
27395,ITS S CLASSIC
27396,"I have played months worth of time of Skyrim before on consoles. Skyrim isnt really a game at least it wasnt for me, more of a lifestyle. It was my life by choice, it is beautiful, it is raw and it was mine, something I couldnt say for anything else especially at the time."
27397,Great game that will give you hours of play.
27398,"Yes, good times"
27399,Todd is Godd
27400,good
27401,"if you need my advice, where have you been since 2011?"
27402,"you can be a lizard, a cat, or a werewolf. what's not to love?"
27403,Obviously
27404,Ya buuuuddy
27405,I liek gaem
27406,Dude. It's Skyrim. It's just good. ??? I feel like you don't need to explain it too much to understand it's a good game to play.
27407,Its ok I guess
27408,"banging game
"
27409,"Mods keep me coming back,"
27410,i like it good
27411,fun
27412,If you haven't played Skyrim yet I don't know what you're doing in life
27413,very erotic
27414,"The game is still in many people's library for a reason. Despite it's age, modders do amazing work keeping it fresh and playable. Default there is still plenty of replay value, I tend to decide to make new characters constantly as i think of new styles of play to try."
27415,Skyrim REEEEEEEEE
27416,"i reley dont wan to say this, but i have to now.
this game is so esey. i mean, all you do is hit the spacebar. thats it! how is this an RPG anyway? you cant contrail anything but what it says on the screen! what if i didnt want to buy the potion? what apout quests? all you can upgrade is stranth? there is no way you can lose to the boss at the end! this game is crap! its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time! explain to me! the athore coments al totol lies! is it supposed to be stick dudes? i dont even know how this damn game got the daily 3rd prize, or a rating of 4.26!
pepole think this review is worthles.
go ahead! say it! i dont care! im just trying to make a point here!
blam this piece of crap!!!!"
27417,"a very fun and outlandish ideal is the way i play, its so fun how you can choose who and want to play."
27418,"Dunno why I didn't already review this. Cool game. Lotta silly bugs, but still a fun experience overall. I personally recommend getting some mods to improve graphics. Makes the game look a lot better. 8/10"
27419,ff
27420,"Ye old classic
"
27421,Just get it and stop asking questions
27422,Awful
27423,never a bore
27424,I fucking love this game modding is really fun
27425,you can sink hours into it per session. and i mean hours. added benefit too is that with mods or even without them it has nearly inifinite re-playability. though highly recommend that you get all dlc to make it a true master piece.
27426,"its skyrim you already know what it is
"
27427,"You haven't played skyrim bro?
thats kinda cringe"
27428,One of the best games you can play!
27429,"The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim  is a very popular game with a huge fan-base. It has been updated with countless add-ons, player constructed mods, new worlds to explore, and fine tuning upgrades over the twelve or so years that it has been out. It's my favorite game because there is so much to do, with no set story line or path to follow, no specific order to do it in. As you work on one quest several more are revealed, making new friends (factions) but gaining even more enemies, no matter what you do there are consequences! 

     So you always have adventures to go on, you can help people out, help out the leaders in the cities, learning secrets about yourself that you never knew in the process, or just lazying about in the taverns enjoying an ale or two, listening to cultural music, maybe finding new contacts or flirting with the very interesting denizens of this magical Medieval world.

	You start out in a daze, from mysterious backgrounds, strange things happen to you as you move about in a dangerous and challenging environment, it's an escape from reality, with some real life problems, controversial social topics, and dilemmas, living in a beautiful but dangerous open world. Play it anyway you want, dive in deep and be immersive or import other less immersive characters from other games, Movies, or TV shows, it can be very addictive. I recommend that you pick a few races and classes, trying them out by following the main quest until you find a few that you enjoy to play, because it's almost impossible to get all the achievements with just one type of character, and you wouldn't want to anyways, so you have to make a few different types, they each have their own set of problems, strengths and weaknesses, learn more about the game along the way, maybe even contribute back to the community by making a mod, a player home, a cheat, some playing tips, or even a completely new land for others to explore."

27441,It just works.
27442,It's a classic.  You basically can't not like it.
27443,"I've wasted 12.5 days of my life on this just on the pc version, my family doesn't love me but at least I have Serana.

27446,Everytime I play it its like a lighting bolt hits the head of my pee pee. 10/10 doctors would recommend
27447,"good,  thumb upwardf"
27448,Yes.
27449,bought this game when it first came out still play it to this day.
27450,for the age of the programming it is still one of the most elegant and dynamic games ever.
27451,Great mods are available
27452,You can pretty much do whatever you like on this game. Even the bugs just make it hilarious. I enjoy the free roam and building your own house (requires DLC).
27453,"First Game I played on Xbox and the first game I played when I got a PC, I love the story, the environment and everything about the game. 10/10 would recommend"
27454,"The stability of the original Skyrim is absolutely awful. It's practically unplayable until you tweak it with some essential (seriously) mods. Once you get the game stable, it's a great modding platform. It actually becomes fun. Then it crashes again and you have to spend another couple hours modding and tweaking to get it to not crash every ten minutes.

I don't regret my purchase, but there is no reason to buy vanilla Skyrim now. There's LE, or even better, Skyrim SE, which is a bit more polished than old Skyrim if you really want to play. It's clear that Bethesda has put a lot of care into creating the world space, but not enough into bug testing and such. Really makes me hesitant to buy TES VI when it comes out, but I damn well know I will despite how much I hate the bugginess of TES V."
27455,Good stuff
27456,yes
27457,I think I'll let my playtime tell the story...
27458,fye
27459,Its a great story with 100 hours of gameplay maybe even thousands too complete every quest
27460,"Now you may be wondering ""why buy this version? why not buy special edition"" and without getting too game sorta boog talking about ""creation club is killing RPGs"" I'd say the main advantage is a larger library of mods and a more flexible engine. You don't really lose much at all getting this version. if you're looking for amazing graphics ENBs are widely available. Overall well worth the time I've already given and plan on giving in the future!"
27461,"I picked up this game on a whim for the ps3 in 2011 probably. i dont know why, id never played a fantasy game beforehand. never looked back. opened my eyes and then some. especially when i went to Raven rock. I learned about my Dunmeri roots, ive never been the same since. house Telvanni for life, N'wahs be gone. All i do is think about morrowind now. I play ESO too."
27462,The greatest game of leaaaafeee !!
27463,"really good game love it alot
"
27464,this game is good and everyone fush ro dah
27465,great game
27466,its skyrim
27467,recommend 100% one of if not the best rpg game i've ever played 274 hrs and still not done everything
27468,Can kill chickens
27469,VERY GOOD GRAPHICS AND GAME PLAY ECEPTIONAL GAME WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND
27470,Game with many funny and rages
27471,"Classic game, should be played through at least once - mods can add hours of content."
27472,"probably bethesda's best work ever, it is an extraordinary exprience being a part of such a big detailed world. the game is really big like you can be hundreds of hours in to the game and you still come across some new stuff its crazy. it has a weird but nice feeling of freedom, story is not bad but you dont really play it for the story i guess at least i was not i was wondering around exploring and completing every side quest i can find which there are fuck ton of side quests and upgrading my character. i would say technically it has issues but no major things. i would recommend you to play with dlcs and mods the vanilla is just old and the game is much less fun without them. as an rpg its not that great cause you dont really see much effect on the world after your actions which you should, only considerable effects you can do is within the main storyline. the game could do some stuff much better but overall the exprience is worth the journey and with some mods you can improve the other downsides and the game becomes close to perfect in my sense of a videogame. its a big wellmade world that waits for you to explore, and i think everyone should exprience being a dragonborn. ( and yeah bad ai,good music,beatiful designs, same people doing voice acting of all characters )"
27473,This game is awesome. Graphics are great. Gameplay is just all out good stuff. If you haven't played please do. I would recommend being an archer.
27474,nice
27475,good
27476,yes
27477,Good e
27478,"What can I really say that hasn't already been said about the Edler Scrolls. Skyrim has been the perfect RPG style game that always keeps me entertained and keeps me playing all through the years. One of my most favorite parts about the game is its simplistic combat style. With this style, you don't have to worry about making good combat decisions, or have a complex strategy when attacking other opponents. Still getting your ass kicked? Hell load back up your previous save lower combat difficulty and launch your oppressors straight to Oblivion! You can do this in multiple different ways. Just let your imagination run wild. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and maybe get a cheap laugh or two."
27479,Exploring is very spicy.
27480,GAME!!!
27481,"dude it's skyrim, if you haven't played it by now than you are doing something wrong..."
27482,this game has been good to me even after all the time i have put into it. endless modding possibility if you know what you're doing. the vanilla game is amazing i played this game on the xbox 360 first and played well over 200 hours and it just took off after i played it on the pc. the game is totally different on pc if you have played this in the past and want to re-kindle some nostalgia look no further! buy this game and have some fun!
27483,What can I say? it's skyrim. coming back drunk year after year. constant companion. high school. college. marriage. divorce. a kid. they better never make 6.
27484,Endless replayability.
27485,Do it!
27486,this game is awesome
27487,This game is all around a great game.
27488,It's okay
27489,"good game
"
27490,"good but you know that
"
27491,"It's an old but great game. People play it for many reasons. Personally I modded the hell outta it. I like the freedom you have in the game, the amount of choices, how little or much you want to ""enhance"" your own game experience through mods. Do you want to just enhance the vanilla experience with some ""nordic"" mods to really play as a savage dragonborn, sword and shield style, or do you prefer to add 200+ mods to really enhance a stealthy playthrough. Perhaps you turn all of Skyrim into an anime fantasy, the choice is yours. Thank you to Bethesda for creating the game and for giving us access to the Creation Kit. Thanks to all the modders for making such an old game come to life in a million different ways!"
27492,a classic
27493,:]
27494,"""Wait, i know you."""
27495,its good
27496,Game of the year 2011 - 2013

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uziknZUjpq0"
27518,An extremely dull game that i indulged in as a kid who didn't know that less can be more and just bought into the general hype of the Bethdesda fanboys.
27519,Can't go wrong with this game
27520,Skyrim is a fantastic game with fantastic community how can you not recommend?
27521,"You can download a mod that will let you kill children, Best experience of 2020"
27522,is good life waster

27527,its ok
27528,qqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxv
27529,THIEVES GUILD
27530,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? Not much. So I'll just say this. Since this game came out in 2011, I've spent dozens of hours across multiple platforms playing and replaying this game, and every year or two I reinstall and do it all over again. If that isn't proof of a masterpiece, I don't know what is. It's incredibly rare to find a gem like this, but maybe that isn't a bad thing. Makes you appreciate it all the more."
27531,It's GTA5 with horses that climb cliffs and MxR's goto guide to higher octane horses
27532,"Bit of a grandpa in the gaming world, But still has a good review from me :)"
27533,GOAT RPG
27534,"wonderful game

I also recommend anything elderscrolls"
27539,Great Game
27540,Skyrim is the Best D and D type game since Baldurs Gate!!!!!!!!!!!!
27541,Great game so much to do and so many things to see. Allows different playstyles and can be as hard or easy as you want it to be. Also many of the mods are great
27542,i mean.... its skyrim... whats not to love
27543,good game
27544,Love it! Can play it again and again and again.
27545,I used to be an adventurer like you...
27546,This is a great open world game that has lots of mods available to keep it fresh re-playable.
27547,"I love Skyrim, I've played it a lot more than it says here, this is just my own game, before this I played my other halfs. The graphics are fantastic and the music is lovely. The downside is the amount of times it crashes!"
27548,This is legit the best game of all time! Its my all time favorite game and i would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a new game to play. But be warned it can be very addicting.
27549,"A little glitchy, but otherwise a fantastic game."
27550,great game
27551,is good
27552,its skyrim
27553,"The only current elder scrolls title. The best current elder scrolls game merely by the merit of it's mod support.

A hard 6, maybe a soft 7 if you really enjoy bethesda RPGs."
27554,good stuff
27555,The best open world RPG I've played.
27556,"Absolutely amazing, great story, tons of side quests, large map but the horses are slow."
27557,yes
27558,You can buy it 5 times
27559,Everything I wanted out of World of Warcraft with the plus of not needing to interact with other people.
27560,"Great game - be careful when you allow cheats, because you wont be able to stop"
27561,The greatest game ever made. Play it to get hair on your nuts.
27562,Great Game
27563,Best game I've ever played.  I've spent nearly 2000 hours consumed with it.  It's overwhelming though and ridiculously addictive - I've had it for years and constantly come back to play it again.
27564,Best game for people who never took an arrow in the knee
27565,"It have dragons, veri col"
27566,its skyrim. its god damn dope
27567,"is good

27568,Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!!!!!!!!
27569,beauty
27570,"veryyy goot 
"
27571,"Skyrim - IMO - has become the benchmark of how innovative a modding community can be. The sheer scope of nuance in the base game is nothing to sneeze at; however, it is the way Bethesda was, circa 2011 - very much about letting the indie modders have a free hand to put the game through its paces - that has kept the game going.

However, this came at certain prices. Skyrim released at the beginning of a trend by the major game makers to create stories that had no ""clean"" ending -- that is, the games always end up with you forced to choose a side, beyond the role you already play in the larger scope. Fallout 4 took this direction, too; to a conclusion closer in form to the 'no good solution' endings offered by FarCry 4 (no matter what side you choose, it just continues the bloodletting). Also, the overall breadth of the primary campaign is smaller than that of Oblivion -- something that, to me, seemed like a wasted opportunity to truly delve into the lore of the Elder Scrolls. I mean, hell -- Skyrim is where Tiber Septim came to Tamriel! That alone should have a deeper impact on the overall story of this game alone!

In the end, Skyrim is proof of how to create a lasting playground for those of us who are in gaming to build in a sandbox; without that, I don't think it would have survived as well."
27572,"This is a game to become completely absorbed into.  I especially like the ability to just walk around and explore.  After computer hiccup, am now starting a new life.  Can't wait.  :)"
27573,pi lol
27574,"I loved this game for many years, although i'm not a big Elder Scrolls fan, I haven't played any other Elder Scroll game, expect for Skyrim, Skyrim to me was my first big open world on PC, and I was memorized with how much you could do in this game, also the dlc's are really good. If you've never played Skyrim, and are looking into getting it, honestly go for it. It's such an amazing game, and I'm glad i've been able to play it."
27575,"Yeah its alright, didnt play it for too long though"
27576,"It's a good game, and there are a multitude of excellent mods for it."
27577,456 hours... what else is there to say...
27578,Me likey
27579,best game ever
27580,"Very enjoyable, the best open world game ive ever played."
27581,"It's Skyrim, i don't think i need to say much else"
27582,It's Skyrim. You know what it its.
27583,Somehow one of the biggest buggy messes and also greatest fantasy adventures at the exact same time. Both are fun
27584,"Skyrim is the best game I have or will ever play, It's so diverse and is just amazing."
27585,Its skyrim
27586,"best rpg
"
27587,"good
"
27588,... its skyrim
27589,"Could use a little bit of salt and pepper, overall alright"
27590,It's Skyrim have you not played it yet whats the holdup.
27591,Best of all time.  No game will every beat it.  Ever.
27592,The best
27593,Its good bro
27594,Am thief.  Doing a bow and arrow.
27595,Its a good game. Took me a little while to get hooked but as soon as I was I could not stop playing.
27596,"while spending $60+ on a new version the same game every couple years is ridiculous, there is certainly a reason why people keep spending the money, this game is one of those with enough content that each playthrough will always feel new and different, all the glitches and bugs are fun, unlike some bethesda games, and only one is gamebreaking, and it only happens approximately 0.007% of the time at the very beginning, also the mods people have created vary widely from OP, to goofy, to helpful, to beautiful, to simple bug fixes."
27597,bruh
27598,"Other than the first 10 minutes of the game, this has to be one of the most open world experiences out on the market. If you have vr, I would highly recommend this game to the fullest."
27599,e
27600,Shit game
27601,ehh its ok
27602,I find this to be fun and interesting. You can add additional story and what not with mods from Nexus if you wanna spice it up a little.
27603,A great open world game that gives you many choices that affect how the rest of the game goes.  Mods are amazing
27604,blah blah blah go pirate or buy it. It's becoming a OG game IMO.
27605,The all time greatest game!
27606,Great game but kind of annoying how Bethesda made it a pain in the ass to get this version
27607,good
27608,6/10 with out mod 11/10 with mods
27609,every time i boot this bitch up i spend 3 days gathering ingredients for soup. i havent been to whiterun yet. five stars
27610,"I addicted to this game. As we all are. Kind of sad the developers decided to remove it from the store, tho."
27611,it is grate you will love it
27612,Mods are the saving grace to Skyrim. Mods are basically the saving grace to any Bethesda game.
27613,is good
27614,Great game ever
27615,yeet
27616,ver igood
27617,"Buggy game with mid-tier graphics and a whole lot of glitches to exploit or fall victim to.

What can I say about Skyrim  that hasn't already been said? I really enjoy doing little sidequests, exploring the areas, and killing bandits in one hit from a warhammer.

I'd absolutely recommend Skyrim to casual players looking for a chill single player RPG.

Tip: Don't grind your smithing skill to 100. Yeah it's cool to get dragon bone armor without cheating, but the game gets super boring after nothing being able to take you below half health."
27618,Shit be poppin. especially with some boomin ass mods
27619,lol
27620,10/10 Would play stealth archer for 100th time !
27621,it's a very good game
27622,good
27623,"It's Skyrim, shouldn't have to add to that ^^"
27624,bro its Skyrim. Enough said.
27625,"Story is 8/10 and side quest depend from 2-8/10 
Love the game but it's broken. I can't play because of glitches. 
NPC's in the air and my horse can fly? 
Great game, horrible glitches that ruin the experience. 
I cannot play this game anymore because of the glitches. 
I'm gonna get the Special Edition."
27626,I hope this game will be released on my calculator too.
27627,
27628,Its okay I guess.....
27629,dis shit cracking cuh on my momma
27630,The graphics are great. the story is ongoing and repetitive but still a one of its kind sandbox. i still play after all these years. classic game.
27631,"I loved the story, but never had a good enough PC to play on full graphics. This time, I'm prepared to lose a significant portion of my life delving into its beauty."
27632,"its an elder scroll so its amazing, even better with around 100 mods.  defiantly a good game great story, great everything"
27633,awesome game! great adventures! massive map
27634,"I have no clue whatsoever why Bethesda are getting so much hate for delisting this game. This game is an unstable mess with terrible optimisation. Bethesda made special edition for the sole purpose of fixing those issues, and furthermore, if you owned the original Skyrim with all the DLCs before it got delisted, you got Skyrim SE for free! People are just complaining for the sake of complaining at this point. Buy the special edition if you want a great Skyrim experience."
27635,Very cool Kanye
27636,The best game i´ve ever played!
27637,"Vanilla Skyrim is a good experience, and ultimately what made me want to get the game after seeing my brother play some of it. However: the reason I have so many hours put into it and plan on putting in more are because of the pure amount of mods not only on Steam, but available on Nexus as well. The modding community, at least in my opinion, make up for any slack caused by Bethesda's (accurate) reputation of buggy games. 
Can't afford the DLC? No problem, there's (FREE) mods to help you expand your Skyrim as you please.
Want to enhance your graphics? There's a mod for that.
Want more flora and fauna? There's mods for that.
Want to be able to kiss your spouse? There's a mod for that.
Want to make an atronach made of sweets? There's a mod for that.
Want to use a pot as a weapon? There's a mod for that.

TL;DR: This game is worth it if only for the modding community."
27638,Nice Sky good Rim title says it all.
27639,still a very good game in 2020
27640,"very addictive, even when i have finished the main questline there is always more to do, and the steam workshop and outside modding platforms have made this game as popular as it still is, the average player can really tell the creators have put much effort into making this game immersive"
27641,"Almost a decade old but still 1 of the best Bethesda games available. ""Fallout"" sucks compared to this."
27642,"It's skyrim, everything to be said has already. If you haven't bought this game yet and are thinking about it, just do it."
27643,"mod it, play it, delete it, repeat it."
27644,"Best game of all time, not really much else to say lads."
27645,d
27646,"Break point in gaming
Perfection"
27647,"15 hours on PC. About a billion hours on Xbox 360 and PS4. The game needs no introduction, it's epic."
27648,"Can not express my love for skyrim, played it on the 360, xbox one, ps4, PSVR, PC no matter what platform the game is worth getting, the PC version just adds more to do a bigger more beautiful world to explore with vast mods at your hands, i recommend it 100%"
27649,fumg
27650,"I can't really put my finger on it but I just can't seem to enjoy Skyrim for the long hours like nearly everyone else.

I've tried spicing it up with mods, I've tried to keep a long playthrough vanilla and it just doesn't stick with me. It feels cold, bland and uninteresting. There are a few times where its been pretty cool, such as your first dragon etc but everything else to me, just ends up feeling laborious.

It's an older game now and it's really showing its age. It's only really being kept alive with mods.

19 hours in, I think I tried."
27651,.
27652,Yes
27653,"yos gud gaem, they recognise koryak minority group"
27654,"I mean, its skyrim. Its a classic game everyone should try at least once. If you are any type of RPG fan I 10/10 recommend you to try it"
27655,Always fun to come back to for a new playthrough
27656,"Enchanting, If not a little streamlined.

I enjoy the game don't get me wrong, but I do wish you had a bit more freedom in terms of player choice and who you chose to align with. Mods are this games saving grace."
27657,its awesome
27658,One of my favorite games. Don't like the spiders though. Similar to my opinion on Terraria.
27659,Game good
27660,Adventure!!!
27661,One of the greatest games still. Mods make Skyrim a timeless classic.
27662,"Very fun, Much Hours"
27663,"It's Skyrim. If you haven't heard of or played it yet, you're missing out. Just friggin play it already!"
27664,"Its skyrim lol, one of the most fun games on earth."
27665,"its Skyrim, play it

"
27666,"Vanilla Skyrim is much better, the new one is just as bad as all there online only cr** if this is the path Bethesda want's to go RIP Bethesda the company was good but online only is awful we want single player only.

Plus skyrim has 100k mods compard too SE only having 20k"
27667,I had to write something cause good
27668,Glitch
27669,one of the last few good games from Bethesda I do not know where it all went wrong but now it seems like have ass pot shots to try to garner income from an ip with no love
27670,"AMAZING GAME, STILL HOLDS UP. caps was on and i was too lazy to fix it."
27671,hell yes
27672,👍
27673,"11/10 best game ever
-not Todd"
27674,"Its skyrim whats not to like.... Lol
"
27675,I find this to be one of the most entertaining games around!
27676,ytee yeee
27677,Fun. The amount of mods is awesome. you can make it like legend of zelda to pokemnon. its awesome
27678,q:^)
27679,"It's Skyrim, what more proof do you want?"
27680,"Played a good bit of Skyrim on PS3 wayyyyy back when, finally built myself a gaming PC recently, decided to play through with mods, and lemme tell ya, being able to play as a big-tiddy big-booty thicc-thighed thot with HD eyes, hair and skin, and being able to make everything hella jiggle? Its a good time."
27681,skrim
27682,INFINITE VARIERTY.
27683,its skyrim. i really dont have to say anything.
27684,Better than the remaster
27685,"It's pretty good.
"
27686,good
27687,i like everything about it
27688,It's kind of good
27689,It's alright.
27690,Spent many hours and days on this game. Never beat the main story line but did mod the hell out of it!!!
27691,"This game is several years old at this point. Still amazing. Has held up really well, especially with all the mods available."
27692,FuN gAmE
27693,Lots to do and the environments look amazing!
27694,nice
27695,yes
27696,"While I personally love to talk smack about Bethesda these days this game is still excellent. I prefer it to the Special Edition for a couple reasons 1) You don't need a Bethesda account to log in. 2) There are a bajillion and a half mods on Nexus that you can customize your experience with. (More than for SSE)

The game is not nearly as deep as it's predecessors which is unfortunate but the core experience is much more polished.

I would suggest finding a mod to get rid of level scaled quest rewards. I also prefer playing the game with a mod that allows more than one ring to be worn at a time. lol.

Everything else is icing. Pimp the game out. Do some dope shit. Kill people in their sleep or save the world from dragons. Whatever. :D

Edit: Shit, I forgot sky UI. Download SkyUI if you're going to play this game on PC with Mouse and Keyboard. The menus are made for consoles and suck big peepee without this mod.

Edit 2: A last note, if your monitor has a refresh rate over 100 hertz you need to limit it somehow, the engine bugs out when going over 100 frames per second. there are a few methods to fix this you can google them all."
27697,good game
27698,good
27699,"amazing game,"
27700,Perfecto!!
27701,theres a reason i have nearly 300 hours on this masterpiece
27702,It just works
27703,100% mana reduction on all destructive spells.... gg
27704,its skyrim
27705,Skyrim baby
27706,i mean if you haven't heard about skyrim in 2020 then you are probably living under some sort of rock-like thing. One of the best games I have ever played and i am willing to fight whoever disagrees
27707,hell yea big viking game
27708,"i love everything about this game actually :D 
I suggest modding Inigo into your game everyone! he's a great person ,despite being a modded npc.."
27709,best game <3
27710,no killable children
27711,egg
27712,Haven't played this game in years but when I did it was just as good as it was back then.
27713,this game good
27714,Bugs and exploits galore. At the start of the game use the guy helping you escape as a punching bag to level up.
27715,"Great game, great sound track. Still replayable after all these years."
27716,This is game is the best
27717,"The Elder Scrolls series is one of great storylines and extremely in depth gameplay.One could play through the entirety of Skyrim's main campaign and,even without having the DLC,can still have SO much more content.It is this reason alone that I own Skyrim on so many platforms.Not to mention,owning it on steam means MODS!!!Who doesn't like lightsabers,nudity,human meshes put on horses,and Thomas the Train Engine dragons?No one,that's who!"
27718,yes
27719,I absolutly  Love this game i have played over 100 hours by now and it is the best and i definitly recommend this game to anyone out there with a hearty for adventures as this game has basically no end to the possibilities.
27720,GOOD
27721,It's Skyrim. Not much else to say
27722,Shit banging
27723,"Hands down best game of all time.
Prefer the Oblivion storyline though."
27724,It's like fallout with guns
27725,With mods this game never gets old.
27726,I keep going back to this one.  Still have host of Achievements and task to complete. The dragon fights are always entertaining. Graphics are still great. Just fun to step into another world for a few hours at a time.
27727,great classic
27728,It's fun by itself but when you get the mods the adventure is endless
27729,"this is a good game, provided you install all the game crash fixes, the audio fixes, the graphical fixes, the ai fixes, this game is actually broken hell and is a prime example of a bethesda game"
27730,Bruh It's Skyrim
27731,Love it
27732,what they said
27733,This game is really fun and will keep you playing for hours. It has a massive map and the game is never ending there are always new missions and side quests to do.
27734,"Better than special edition, by a LOT."
27735,"cool game, kinda sucks tho"
27736,Buy it
27737,"its cool i guess
"
27738,I have about 400 or so hours but that was all offline play so it didn't register but this game is great when you wanna kill time and then you'll kill more time than you wanted to with how fun it is. 9 years later and still great.
27739,'S got buckets.
27740,The game that got me back into gaming after years away. I love this.
27741, good game
27742,yeah
27743,"epic. but actually.
great story, great customization, endless support for mods, near infinite quests to do... an awesome game.
super replayable, but I still want TESVI."
27744,As fun as I remember it. Playing it for the first time on PC and I love it even more. With mods this game is endless fun. 11/10
27745,Best Game ever made

27751,"easily my favorite game since 2011, amazing without mods and ASTOUNDING even with just a few"
27752,A fucking amazing game and a great RPG if not one of the best RPG games of all time.
27753,lol
27754,"Its good
mods make it good too"
27755,"I own this game on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 in VR, and on my Laptop. I have never put this amount of time into a game and still want to play it more and more. I absolutely love this game. A huge PLUS for me is that there is ZERO swearing in this game, next is everything else about it like the huge world, story, quests, game play, graphics, interaction, etc. etc."
27756,this shit good
27757,"I haven't played Skyrim in a long time, but I finally managed to get a copy of the original Legendary Edition. I love the game when modded, however, it is also one of the most painfully unstable games that I've played. I recommend it, only if your prepared to deal with lots of crashes when modding."
27758,
27759,Masterpiece
27760,good game but only if you install 600 mods and make your mc a disproportionate  s e x   doll
27761,It's Skyrim... what's not to love?
27762,Good
27763,its skrim what do you think
27764,ggggggggggggggggg
27765,"It's an interactive game with character communications.  Also has plenty of problems and challenges to solve.  Not a dull game, has lots of discoveries and locations to go to to obtain items needed.  Single player game which is what I prefer as most online games are meant for the younger generation."
27766,Good game
27767,skyrim
27768,"Figured out a lot of my kinks from the mods of this game, ngl"
27769,"Played it almost every day since it came out on 4 different platforms. I've put in well over 10,000 hours all in all, and well it's just amazing. Speaks for itself really , we all know what a ""Skyrim"" is..."
27770,"Well, once mods are installed, what's not to like? lol"
27771,What can i say? The only game for me. Waiting eagerly for ES6!
27772,This is my favorite game of all time. Hands down
27773,"This game has so much to offer, the best Open World RPG game ever! 10/10"
27774,i love skyrim!
27775,It's neat.

27782,a
27783,forget real life
27784,Love it
27785,"Don't play this game  period. Bethesda games nor Steam/Valve have fixed a very a serious problem with game  just stopping dead while playing. If these companies don't care about there customers why should I recommend this game  to anyone. If you want to play the game, play it at your own risk."
27786,"The freedom of gameplay is what makes this such a fun game. It has its limits, but after almost nine years of playing, it is still a worthwhile experience."
27787,do i need to say anything?
27788,i hate you todd
27789,uwu
27790,Very good game.
27791,"It's amazing as hell !!
"
27792,It's awesome
27793,"If you're all about atmosphere and graphics, this game will blow your mind. And it has an interesting storyline as well. Customize your hero down to their eyebrows and go save Skyrim by killing some Dragons (etc.) in epic ways."
27794,"Very thrilling storyline, many exciting quests to offer, and overall a brilliant RPG game. Definitely worth the coin."
27795,Been hooked on this a lot even before I played the game
27796,"I've been playing this on and off for years. I'm nowhere near endgame but the game is so massive it's a new adventure every time you restart it.

I highly recommend anyone who likes playing open world fantasy games with great replay value to purchase this. 

I'm not very well versed in games like this as I mostly stick to casual and sandbox games, but this takes the cake in being playable for anyone regardless of gaming experience."
27797,"df

27798,"I mean, it's Skyrim."
27799,best rpg lol
27800,"Todd Howard is holding my family hostage, unless you buy 69 copies of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, I may never see them again, oh god oh frick.

Other then that, the game is okay I guess"
27801,"Tell me, how many times have you bought this game?"
27802,"mod it to the tits 
"
27803,Still playing and enjoying every time I update my monitor and graphics.
27804,its skyrim or nothing
27805,"Great sandbox game, best modding scene ever.  Gameplay should be better, but it is what it is."
27806,its skyrim i know you have this game
27807,BEST RPG!!!
27808,lizard sex mods recommended
27809,:)
27810,"I just played this game for the first time on 2020, I was a bit worried,  as I normally get super dizzy with FPS games and was worried it would happen with this one (Tried Fallout 3 once, could not play more than 30 minutes) I then decided to give it a go, and I have to say that zooming in and out of First person view to explore/fight works great for me, I have over 10 hours and have started downloading some mods.
If you are on the fence, wait for a sale and buy it, it is totally worth it. 
"
27811,GAME GOOD
27812,Skyrim is an excellent game that I can endlessly sink hours into.
27813,It's Skyrim. If you don't like it there's a mod for that.

27853,"boobs in my mouth

please
please
please"
27854,Yeh
27855,"played for 16 hours and got nothing done 
Highly recommend"
27856,"J'ZARGO WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OF THIS THERE IS NO DOUBT."
27857,Skyrim is what in years to come will be called a classic. It is wonderfully immersive and fun to play for any skill level. The stories are fun to follow and can really tug on heartstrings sometimes. The game continues to evolve to this day with both balanced and unbalanced mods making for some hilarious times. Highly recommend
27858,"years ago I played Morrowind, Baldur's Gate And many other games on and offline in this and other genres. I have come back time and again to Skyrim, and now especially with all the amazing mods available created by so many hardworking players ..Skyrim has become much more interesting again. I am trying to learn to Mod atm to maybe contribute in the future but for now. despite it's bugs (all games have those) Skyrim has all the elements needed for aha hours (years) of fun and a great community supporting it if you do have any difficulties you will always find some kind of help in the forums. I fully endorse this game"
27859,"When I first got Skyrim, I did't think much of it. Just another Bethesda game I kept saying. I'd maybe play a few minutes at a time. Then I discovered how much of a masterpiece this game really is. It quickly went from a game I didn't care about to my favorite game. Without spoiling anything, I would recommend this game to 100% of players."
27860,"When I was a kid, most summers we all hung out in one place.
Now I go to Whiterun."
27861,"This game shits on the rest of the Elder Scrolls games, it's dumbed down a lot. Many mistakes were made and many bad trends were set (yet no one realized at the time because Beth was sacred... was).

That being said, this is probably the best game, immersion-wise. Great entry point for western RPGs, and cheap enough to be worth it.  Skyrim is filled to the brim with things to explore, contrasting Oblivion's empty-ish Cyrodiil. Story feels like ""Baby's first TES"", so if you need to introduce Elder Scrolls to a friend, this could be it! 
Don't expect a particularily deep plot, this is pretty much to games what ""Fast and Furious"" is to movies, so just sit and have fun."
27862,gud:):)
27863,game play
27864,"Do I really have to convince anyone?  Not only are TES games consistently ""Game(s) of the Year"", they offer support for a long time after release and the MOD community is dedicated, talented, and very creative.  Seriously.. if you're looking at this and haven't yet played, buy the darn thing already!"
27865,"great game
"
27866,"well am not getting any of there games tell es6 is made and they fix fallout 4 allways crashis on me sens that last update in there c club cant even start a new game same with skyrim s bug it out to were it cant be played this old skyrim still works cus it ant link to there bugy ass c club for updates. ben over a year addig this t=nothing ben fix no es6 yet and all the creshing of the other games still going on tod nice that it just dont work other then old skyrim cus ya f it all up with ya retarded cclub

27869,"Amazing even being old, but even it can be solved with tons of mods the community has made!"
27870,its a good game
27871,best game of 2011
27872,Its priceless that Bethesda would remove it from the search engine and that you cannot even get the dlcs for the game.
27873,"A great game that made me feel like a god - my style of game. Lots of bugs here and there which broke some quests but i still love it. Also, the mods you can get are hilarious."

27895,It's Skyrim.
27896,Great game but there are a lot of bugs when doing some quests like quest markers not appearing and finished quest that are still in your quest board thing.
27897,Loved the game all up top 10 for me
27898,"Like runescape, but possible to max everything and first person"
27899,i wish i could go back in time where i had never played skyrim a day in my life becasue the game was so much fun playing i would give anything to play it again unknowingly of its amazingness
27900,It's Skyrim
27901,good game very big good mods would play
27902,Over 1000 hours played and still going. Best game of its genre hands down.

Great stories, great characters, great environments & creatures, great Dragons! AI path-finding could be better. But it has a great combat & magic system, less weapons than previous titles but I personally find it just less headache. & also Dragons!! The DLC's are cool and don't feel forced, they feel more like content they couldn't add In due to deadlines or as a story-line the they thought up after the games release. Did I mention Dragons!"
27907,Very good game
27908,MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE GAME
27909,this is THE game to play
27910,So what if I've recreated the same elf who focuses on sneak and archery 100 times....  It's fun every time.
27911,yes
27912,"dragons
"
27913,"Skyrim, a game that is so beloved and revisited that alien archaeologists uncovering the remains of our civilization will believe in dragons, giants and that most of the population had ""Took an arrow to the knee"". If you somehow don't own this game and have never played it then it is a must buy. 

With the games very active modding community it's already substantial replay-ability is only increased further allowing you to sink hundreds of hours into the game while it only feels like a few hours have passed. This game set the bar for adventure RPG's and its a bar that to this day only a few developers have been able to reach.

If anything this game is a must buy to look at the old days of Bethesda when they were a beloved developer, a far cry from the festering cesspit of controversy and monetization that infects the company today.

27933,Bethesda Studio thank you for this game
27934,"This is the best RPG I have ever played. You keep learning more - it is infinite. You can choose your character and modify them. The action is good - either distance with a bow or close with axe etc. I suggest new players to the game take the main quest slowly and build up armour, weapons, stamina etc. And you can increase your wealth easily if you have patience by smithing and alchemy. Brilliant."

27937,"No matter what other games i play and fall in love with, i keep coming back to skyrim. It's a classic"
27938,A blast for anyone with a thirst for adventure and insane modding!
27939,great offline game but even better with mods.
27940,"EVERYTHING!
"
27941,"Despite all the gripes people have with the game constantly being re-released, and Bethesda's refusal to fix any game-breaking bugs in those re-releases, Skyrim is still an immensely entertaining game. And honestly, it's most fun when you ignore being the dragonborn. Whether you simply ignore speaking to the jarl of Whiterun so the dragons never revive, or you use a mod that gives you a random new beginning, setting out as an average citizen of Skyrim gives the game new ways to be enjoyed."
27942,good
27943,"There is something in it for everyone.  With the game and the mods, you can be almost any type character and do almost anything."
27944,It's an expansive game. I've logged almost 500 hours and still haven't finished the game.
27945,Good Game
27946,very good yes
27947,It's Great
27948,"Skyrim is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games I have ever played.  The storyline is amazing, the gameplay is wonderful and addicting, the game mechanics are superb, and the modding community adds unlimited replay ability.  I recommend Skyrim to anyone interested in role-playing games."
27949,A timles classic
27950,ye its a pretty good game
27951,"This is a classic that squeaked in just before Bethesda quit given a $hit.  Great game.  Lots of bugs...mostly entertaining, not typically game breaking, but compared to the size of the game, the bugs are almost non-existent."
27952,fun
27953,Where is the dlc ?
27954,"I used to play this game every day, until I took an arrow to the knee."
27955,"Go download a bunch of mods from Nexus, and you'll probably have fun. Without mods, this game feels unfinished and bad."
27956,well... what to say about the best RPG video game ever made?
27957,"godly
"
27958,is good
27959,you arent gonna find a better open world rpg even to this day

27963,It's Skyrim. Of course you want it.
27964,There is nothing bad about this game its so much and the game play is smooth and some fun. Love this game.
27965,Modding is easy and makes the game much better but even when it is alone without mods it is still pretty good.
27966,One of the if not the best casual open world game ever made
27967,i do enjoy getting on my horse and being stuck in a standing position. very nice
27968,Skyrim is like cold pizza its pretty bad but still pretty good

27973,There are so many ways to play I never get tired of playing

27975,I HSTE IT@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27976,It's okay.
27977,Bad game if not heavily modded
27978,"it's skyrim, just buy it"
27979,One of the best games ever made. Even better when you add the right mods.
27980,"You know what it is, and you've probably bought it to play on your smart fridge. Absolutely worth it."
27981,With some graphic mods and a mod where potions have no weight it is super time consuming game :-)
27982,it's fine i guess
27983,mod it
27984,"good
"
27985,"I mean it's my favorite game of all time. Bethesda are assholes yeah, but I keep getting suckered in by this modded work of art."
27986,great game many hours on console
27987,"Lots of fun, so much to do with mods and vanilla gameplay."
27988,"i had to jump through hoops to get this version and not the more expensive one, bethesda are greedy as hell

good game tho, 10/10"
27989,"Its Skyrim, with mods... No need to say more"
27990,"If you are into the  world of dragons-this game is for you. Graphics are super, game play is excellent, story

[i]Totally[/i]"
27998,"Over the past 2 years, I've played over 1,000 hours of Skyrim. It's a nostalgic part of my life, and I wouldn't give it up easily. I've spent many of those 1,000 hours role-playing as my character, sometimes forgetting about the main quest lines. But, still, this is an amazing game, and I highly recommend it to anyone."
27999,This is an awesome sandbox game which can take so many directions. I have played now for over 250 hours and am not half finished....
28000,"It was fun the first six times it was re-released, but since Bethesda still doesn't give a single FLICK about their customers I cannot recommend this game. You only matter to Bethesda as long as you give them your money. While money has been the only thing they care about since their business started, which how little they've been hiding that fact you're better off buying games like The Outer Worlds or even New Vegas, since everyone knows Bethesda as a whole has been jealous of Obsidian Entertainment for making a better game in less than a year then they have in decades."
28001,i have always liked the game but i now have an issue just finished my first PC build but i bought skyrim years ago on my old laptop and at the time i only bought the heartfire and dawn guard DLC and now i am unable to buy the dragonborn DLC i have already bought the original xbox 360 copy back in 2011 and later i moved onto ps3 and bought the Legendary Edition am i now expected to buy the game again because SE Edition no i am done i will have to do without some mods that require dragon born DLC
28002,its awesome :D
28003,PLAY IT
28004,GOOD GAME
28005,v good
28006,"bruh, it's skyrim. Honestly we all know you got bewby mods for this game. don't try to lie to us."
28007,there is no words feel it for ya self ya will understand
28008,Love how there are so many different quest to go on and explore! Keeps me engaged for hours!
28009,Great game. The mods make it absolutely fantastic!
28010,still best game
28011,This game offers many hours of playtime and the mods make the game even better.
28012,Noice.
28013,"i rebought this game several times between, xbobx 360, xbox one, and on PC. I have loved countless hours spent."
28014,"If you want to play a subpar boring combat game that aged horribly, then sure, play Vanilla.  As someone who played Vanilla Oblivion, Vanilla Skyrim disappoints.  It felt like a step back, like the challenge was gone.  Any challenge that remains in Legendary mode isn't a challenge, it's just damage sponges (they reduce your damage, etc) so fights are easy, but tedious because it just boils down the enemy having more HP.  That's not difficulty...that's laziness.  Without armor degrading, memorable guild quests, and tiny cities with no hidden nooks and crannies, the game felt linear.  Oblivion, graphics aside, was the better game...or that's what I would say if it weren't for mods.  See my 2000+ hours played?  That's thanks to mods.  Maybe in 2011, Vanilla Skyrim was passable, but by the time of 2020 writing this review, it's combat system feels noticeably dated and lacks any impact.  The mods fix everything.  Think of it like this.  A great game is improved by mods, a bad game is FIXED by mods.  This is the latter, unfortunately.  I can say mods made this game addictive and always a fun experience to return to.  Thanks to Nexus Mods, Combat Animations are fluid and impactful, Combat and AI are dynamic.  Quests and new worlds to explore are neverending.  I chose to make my Skyrim Dark-souls esque, but some people even go for Devil's May Cry styled mods and some even turn it into some JRPG combat game with big anime tiddy's included. I love all kinds of mods and have become accepting of the modding community.  It's a shame ES6 probs won't come any time soon.  And if it did, I hope it doesn't rely on mods to fix the game.  I hope it's LEARNED from the mods of ES5 and implements the bettter combat/ai by default, that way Modders can IMPROVE it!  In summation, Skyrim is only a great and well remembered game, especially on PC here at Steam...because of Mods."

28016,it good
28017,Fantastically wonderful Escape
28018,"Great game!! Repetitive at times, but if you know where to look the questlines are really good!"
28019,ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
28020,its a bethesda game nuf said
28021,"A Weak RPG: 
- No Real Interaction with the world outside of choosing what side of the civil war your on. (and even then it's simply an aesthetic choice since the questlines are exact mirrors)

- The World itself is not affected by your character. (IE. You can become the head of a mages guild without ever casting a spell or a master thieves in the the thieves guild without ever picking a lock or having no skill in sneak or lockpicking.)

- Your able to complete every questline in one playthrough, as such no real replayability.

And an even weaker Action RPG:
- at their core action rpgs (Diabo, Titan Quest etc.) thrive on fun gameplay and interesting progression of the class skills, Skyrim lacks both... 

- Base combat is weak with no real fun element to it, usually simply resulting in a ""stealth archer"" focused build that comes from the simply fact that the ai is incompetent with pathing and the navmesh is poor so they can't track you correctly. Outside of that there's the ever fun mash button to smash melee weapon in opponents face. 

- So all that leaves is magic, which in itself is severely lacking with a clear progression line that prevents you from ever using the previous spells as the next is simply a better veriant of the last and the old spell don't scale. That omitting the fact that most of the spell trees are worthless since the combat itself lacks any real difficulty, as such the only real worth while trees are destruction and restoration. 

- Game difficulty is non-existent with no real way to enhance it outside of increasing the setting which simply increases the amount of damage you take and decreases the amount of damage the enemies take, which fails to actually do anything outside of making the already tedious combat even more tedious and longer.

+ The only real positive I can give it is that it's quite simply an excellent time sink especially so if you can forgive its aforementioned weaknesses or use mods to repair this quickly abandoned failure of a game.

+ It's also has a good amount of content when it comes to questlines and world location.

In conclusion it would be beyond hard to recommend this garbage to anyone outside of hardcore elder scrolls lore fans and people who simply have nothing better to do with their time."
28022,It's Good as stuff.
28023,yes yes yes
28024,Best game of the decade.
28025,get it and all the DLCs with it
28026,"Its alright, I guess.

I still haven't actually completed the main story though.

It's not a joke."
28027,Best game I ever played. It's even more fun with mods.
28028,Good fun
28029,Great Solo game full of puzzles and high adventure. 480 hrs later and still playing new Characters.
28030,no
28031,this games fuckin dope.
28032,VERY few games can match this one. Every aspect about Skyrim is brilliant and deserves praise from any and all.
28033,I love this game. i borrowed this on my laptop and it ran smoothly. i think this is way better than any elder scrolls game so far.
28034,It's alright I guess
28035,"its alright, nothing special just alright"
28036,W
28037,great game always lots to do and uses the steam workshop for easy mod use
28038,i love the open world and how the mods keep even an older game like this new and fresh.
28039,Hail Sithis!!!
28040,good game fun
28041,Cool Game

28049,lovely game
28050,its fun
28051,nice
28052,Definitely one of my most favourite games ever. A vast open world of fantasy and aventure. Where your choices define your character and quests are not in short supply. Absolutely would play this a thousand times over...
28053,its as good as it was before
28054,The game is a blast

28058,great games there a lot to do
28059,:)
28060,"Reason #1: 32-bit client. Would've been fine, but...
Reason #2: Ugly crap for PS3 (past-past-gen game console), so here we go to...
Reason #3: Empty world and lack of content, which brings us to ...
Reason #4: Year 2020! i doubt many of customers still running VaultTek's LGA775 or FM2+ or AM2+ generation PC. That's why we go to the Nexus mods dot com and here we go after ...
Reason #5: Your modern PC can run so many mods and fixes for that game, but still you can chech reason #1 with memory allocation issues for RAM and vRAM, so pray SKSE tool will fix it to you and you'll not crash every hour or each 5 loads.
Reason #6: Skyrim: Todd-Howard x64 special edition for modern PCs. Does it really important to whine about re-upload of the old game with new label over it and ugly graphics (compare to the old one SE alot more better) and you will download mods anyway to fix it.

Summary: OLD UGLY CRAP WITH MANY TROUBLES AND BARELY PLAYABLE WITH OUT ANY MODS, BUG FIXES AND SCRIPTS. Too many positive review from old-time nostalgia."
28061,ITS LIT
28062,Good game
28063,Fun to play with lots of mods
28064,It's good as fuck dude
28065,"Just bought myself a brend bew Legendary Edition. Thanks, Tod. 
Loved it."

28067,it has so much to explore and with mods its even better
28068,"You know the deal, mod this game into OBLIVION!"
28069,Skyrim is Skyrim.
28070,good
28071,Timeless game. Still playing it almost a decade later (definitely helped by the fact that it's a digital copy!)
28072,A game that will lock you in for hours working on missions and quests. Time flies by and you just want to keep playing
28073,"It is a fun rpg game with a ton to explore and things to do.
I'm going to stop typing this review as I realize that you can't get this version on Steam anymore"
28074,"Is a good open world game filled with magic ,spells, adventures and dragons"
28075,"I haven't really played long enough to give a solid answer, but looks great so far."
28076,just look at my hours on this game it says it all lol
28077,"Do not believe a word of the mainstream masses who talk like this is a good game. This is one of the most shallow rpgs I've ever played. Only reason why I kept playing is because I'm trying to beat my backlog of games.

The only good things that I can say is that's it's fun to kill things in this game and when it goes slow mo, it's pretty cool. The feeling of exploring a dungeon is fun here but it is short lived because pretty much all dungeons look the same. The main quest line is easy to follow and has a marker that guides you through this lifeless world. Fast traveling is essential to play this game. Do not waste your time walking to one area to another unless you absolutely have to.

This games story is crap. 

The games writing is horrendous. I seriously cannot believe someone got paid for this shallow attempt at writing. My god man, write a story with care...

The world is shallow and empty with tons of reused assets all over the place.

NPC's have multiple voices when talked to. Shows a lack of care in the product.

The voice actors are terrible. I'm sorry but they really are. 

The sound of characters are truly hard to hear, even at high volume while using headphones. Like, I was literally standing next to NPC's and it was so hard to hear. Good thing I had subtitles on but then the writing is so bad that I just stopped reading altogether. Pretty much just glance at the dialogue at one point.

The books are filled with a try hards writing of a story. Sure it's lore for the world and it's cool that there are tons of books with lot's of pages to read but the writing in them is so bad that I just couldn't waste my time reading it.

My follower person just disappeared at one point and she never came back when ever I load my save.

My follower also attacked someone by herself and I got blamed for it and had a bounty and because I didn't do it, I said I'd rather die than pay the bounty or go to jail which sent an army of men after me...

Throughout my whole playthrough, I've never seen that orc in the store page picture. False advertising I maybe? Is it in dlc? And the whole store page is showing images from a different perspective than how you actually see it in the game. It nonsense. Show the bars of health and mana. 

I do not recommend side quests. They will be wasting your time.

The end of the game just leaves you and there's no credit sequence. I read online and it's true and people defend it like it's a good thing. What a joke. When I finish a story in a video game, I expect a credit sequence. Then after that you can put me back into the world.

This game is shallow and lifeless. You're playing this game because you want to play an rpg and you're just there doing things. Everything doesn't feel right but you keep on playing because you want to finish the game but it seriously is not worth your time. I'm honestly amazed at how many times this crappy game came out."
28078,imma fus ro dah yo ass
28079,
28080,One of the best adventure games out there!
28081,"They wouldn't have released a game over and over if it wasn't good.
Just buy it already.
Go on.
I know you're going to"
28082,"Amazing game, lots of opportunities :D"
28083,yes
28084,Its a great RPG game.
28085,Yes.
28086,Good game. Lots to do. Fun combat some good stories and quests. Some bad quests. Too much power fantasy.
28087,"This is literally my favorite game ever made. Good old Todd Howard loves to release this game as many different ways as he can though since Bethesda wants to milk it, but I personally have played it since 2012."
28088,"For a novice player, I found it easy to do the quests and very intrigued by the graphics of the game.  All in all, I would recommend it to my friends."
28089,"LOVE!!!!!!
"
28090,Loved it
28091,It's Skyrim.
28092,best game eva
28093,"You're finally awake
"
28094,do i really need a reason to recommend this?
28095,"good
game"
28096,Do I need to say anything? It's Skyrim. Of course it's good.
28097,"I originally started playing this game on the Xbox 360, that was years ago, if not a decade ago. I still have never beaten the game fully, and there are many quest lines I do not know. One thing is for certain, this game will never die in your heart. Once you start playing it will be easy to sink numerous hours into. The best thing about the game is the open world exploring, if you have played past elderscrolls titles, it is quite a bit different. Comparing to Oblivion, TESV is ""dumbed down"" to attract a newer market, which makes the game a lot easier to play. Personally I would still buy this game in 2020 if you have not already done so. I am excited to re-dowload TESV and start modding right away to get the nostalgic feeling I had when I first discovered this game. 10/10 game"
28098,"i guess its alright
"
28099,Best game. No question.
28100,Good game but when i went to go get the dawnguard dlc it showed that the game doesn't have any dlc and i cant get the dlc so i am big sad ):
28101,"Its a classic, pc and console version are the best. I don't recommend the microowave nor the washing machine versions tho, they are hella hard to control and 0 mod support."
28102,Plenty to do with the largest Mod Community there is.
28103,u have to play it
28104,"just good.



some glitches lmao"
28105,"it's alright I guess...
"
28106,"The best game, my whole childhood, god its so fucking good."
28107,Tis Quite The Game You See
28108,Most certainly a must play
28109,Game cool
28110,Why not if you haven't started playing Skyrim damn it get to it.
28111,"The game has a great story, very thrilling, combat is somewhat realistic. Very fun overall"
28112,Its lit af even after all these year bro!
28113,Awesome!
28114,Just play the game at this point. If you haven't you either just got into gaming or you've been living under a rock for the past 12 years

28123,best game of all time
28124,Can be modded to your liking.  Change up mods each play through.  Never gets old.
28125,"A nearly flawless game with voluminous replay value. If you are a fan of single player action RPG's this game is a must have. It also fixes the flawed leveling system of previous Elder Scrolls games, where you had to keep track of what skills you'd increased in order to get the most efficient leveling."
28126,Best Elder scrolls so far.  Cant wait for 6
28127,very fun bethesda game. 10/10
28128,"Yes

28129,"yes. just yes,"
28130,"It's skyrim, what isn't there to love"
28131,It's awsome
28132,"This is a classic, if anyone where to ask me what my favorite game was, I would be forced to say skyrim, It was one of the best of its time, and the best now even, one of the first TRULY open world games I have ever played, and has so much content, and so many possible things to do, not to mention mods, it is near impossible to ever get bored of the game."
28133,I had played this game when it was new and just reinstalled it. This is a great game.
28134,It's Skyrim... you know what it's about.
28135,best game ever
28136,funny when foos row dar goat off mount everest
28137,"it just works...



with over 6000 mods.."
28138,"It's a fantastic game with an active open world with lots to see and do, and an epic storyline on top of that."
28139,never gets old!
28140,decent
28141,my fav game.
28142,Fantastic Game!  It boasts an expansive world full of content and an active modding community that has kept me engaged for years.
28143,I like how this game keeps me entertained even though I'm only running on an open field killing wolves.
28144,still good in 2020
28145,"very fun, so much content, well detailed"
28146,i like the game
28147,Yes
28148,This game is legendary.
28149,This game is a staple and a legend of its own class!
28150,What can I say? It's a classic. Incredible replayability.
28151,Mods are great
28152,"best game ever
"
28153,"Awesome game, always love the open world"
28154,Great Game
28155,Good Just difficult to mod properly.
28156,Everyone who is in their 5th+ playthrough should definitely get the Requiem overhaul mod. It makes skyrim into a new game!
28157,Addictive :)
28158,"Did you know? 
Todd Howard, the Prince of Bethesda, can chew through steel and concrete with his extremely strong teeth. This has made containing him virtually impossible."
28159,"Is there anything else to say other than this game is timeless??
"
28160,"One of the best games ever made.
"
28161,its good
28162,good
28163,.
28164,very yes
28165,Very Nice game!
28166,"I mean, it's Skyrim."
28167,"THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME!  since iv started playing this game there has never been a bored moment if u have never played i very much suggest this game
"
28168,"Favorite game, have over 1500 hours if you include PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox 1 and PC, played it on all those platforms and still play it to this day."
28169,Its skyrim just buy it
28170,"Great game, to many hours spent. :]"
28171, 1095 hours played. Restarting today!
28172,"Overall, a fantastic action-orientated single player, single-character RPG. Perhaps what is most impressive, over time, are the many ""hidden"" consequences to quest resolution one discovers with each different playthrough. This virtual world is beautifully rendered, engrossing, and many of its questlines are very well written."
28173,it's fun for the first playthrough but being railroaded through the story and an all powerful murder monster who is already the most powerful and famous being in the game's universe gets old very quickly. without mods it is borderline unplayable
28174,cool i guess
28175,The graphics are wonderful and the game is immersive.  There are multiple pathways to be taken and it can be replayed many times with different outcomes.
28176,Do you want the modding experience of a lifetime without Bethesda ruining your mods just to add some creation club content. Then Oldrim is for you! Buy now don't delay. And remember Mod Organizer 2.
28177,A huge open world Rpg where you can sink untold hours into. GET IT!!
28178,Excellent game if you like exploration. Mods also can turn skyrim into anything you want.
28179,Timeless classic in the Bethesda Library. Only wish they'd stop re-releasing it to every platform known to fucking man and give us the next game
28180,its skyrim.  its 2020.  play it if you haven't.
28181,A great game made greater by it's vibrant community.
28182,i can get lost for hours in this world
28183,This is a fun game and I give it 10 out of 10
28184,"Bethesda's most succesfull title, it took me almost 200 hours to beat just the base game!"
28185,What can I say it's Skyrim!
28186,"I'm honestly surprised that I haven't written a review, I mean, look at my playtime! It's mostly due to mods... But even vanilla is super fun. It's not a traditional rpg, but it's still good enough that you come back. If you're expecting an rpg, you're probably going to be disappointed, but if you're looking for a good fantasy based game, you've found it! Still dodgy on graphics, so if you want it better, just grab special edition; they're not big on price difference. Although, there's more mods on the original, which is definitely a tempting point to consider.
"
28187,the juniper berries are made of people
28188,i mean its skyrim
28189,pretty good game but i have died more times to a pot than a freakin' bandit....... but its still a lot of fun and a lot of replay ability (trust me I have done the start about 60 times) its also great cause it has different ways to play the game. the 60 hours of playing this game was definitely worth it. and it only being £10 its probably the greatest game i have played for that price. 10/10 would play again (and i have)
28190,"If you're considering getting this game then you already know what it is and there is no reason for me to explain it in this review. I obviously think its a good game, so if that counts for anything, you should get it."
28191,Second Best RPG  i ever played ;)
28192,best game.
28193,Great game
28194,We love game-breaking bugs. Except we don't (thankfully this game is still decent despite them)
28195,"veri good yes
"
28196,fun
28197,"I'm calling Dark Brotherhood to kill Todd Howard: give back our free modding experience. I'd rather stop playing Skyrim at all than switch to Special Edition. Stop ruining our 'Forever Free' community work even if its already too late.

Long live SKSE! Rest in peace."
28198,its like skyrim but with swords and magic
28199,"i honestly love it, perfect game <333"
28200,this game is and always will be amazing
28201,Perfect.
28202,GOAT
28203,I like skyrim
28204,Good game
28205,"Mods make this game go round baby right round! Its a fantastic game, solid foundations, but the polishing is really off. But Bethesda has modders, and their games become gold! This one being no exception!"
28206,Too many mods my pc crash
28207,"Base game is fairly fun with lots of stuff to do, dlc add a fair bit more entertaining content + there are TONNES of good mods to further improve it, overall id rate it 10/10 with mods 9/10 without mods."
28208,"Whilst I would no longer recommend this game over the special edition (except in the case of a particularly old PC), I can sing the praises of this wonderfully flawed, beautifully cathartic adventure.

It's not Witcher 3, but Witcher would be nothing without Skyrim."
28209,Great game for Fantasy enthusiastd
28210,is good
28211,Good stuff
28212,Great Game with great atmosphere. Legendendary Game.
28213,placeholder text
28214,Amazing game even 9 years after realease
28215,simply one of the most quality games ever made. i have put countless hours into multiple playthroughs and it never gets old
28216,"Bro, pretty good ngl. 420 fire fire fire."
28217,of course...
28218,"Probably one of, if not the most immersive RPG(s) to date. There are so many things to do, to discover and to explore. Not to mention the modding community, which has helped keep this game relevant and is still going strong to this day. Be prepared to spend a great many hours playing this. Perhaps you will even find yourself creating your own content for it some day."
28219,Yes
28220,it's aight
28221,"Explore and kill everything, lol"
28222,I've put thousands of hours into this game over the years. Still love it to this day.
28223,hell yes this game is amazing
28224,Its a pit you throw your time in.
28225,"Adventure, character building, open world, a must have rpg"
28226,You can ignore the main quest for hundreds of hours.
28227,More mods then SSE but less stable
28228,nice
28229,It's my 2nd Favorite Game of All Time
28230,"good game
"
28231,"love the graphics good play time lots of adventures
"
28232,My kid managed to play this for 700 hours and never finished the main sotryline. Meanwhile I finished every sidequest 10/10 would recommend.
28233,"played it a bit, its pretty fun"
28234,sa
28235,"Beautiful, open world RPG with seemingly endless things to do."
28236,Mods save this game
28237,"It's Skyrim... 
What's wrong with you for not playing it."
28238,it just works
28239,Its skyrim
28240,perfection
28241,"Did not get into the hype train years ago. That was a mistake.
Extremely immersive, I have no interest in the real world anymore. 
5/5 Would recommend."
28242,play it
28243,Oh yes!
28244,One of Bethesda's finest works...diverse and deep
28245,
28246,Old but a Nice Game
28247,Amazing game. This is classic and still good after 9 years.
28248,cool
28249,noice
28250,good
28251,great game that trully never gets old
28252,Depressed but well dressed
28253,succ
28254,"i bought mines on amazon and it brought all the DLC it came with just for 20$. The reason why i did that is because i couldn't find it on the search store thanks bethesda :D 














the remastered version sucks decent mods but it sucks"
28255,"With such a HUGE modding community the possebilities are next to endless. you can easily add soo much stuff that (besides main story) it can feel like a new game. + it's a big open world, go explore and do whatever you want more or less.
This is ofc just my opinion, and a small note on my thoughts"
28256,"Countless hours on console, this game is outstanding."
28257,"Theres a reason they released the game 7 times. its the best if the elderscrolls games. best mechanics, best graphics, and even the best glitches. (im looking at you backwards flying, fire pooping dragons)

on pc i only have 24 hours, but on ps3 i had over 1000 and the platinum trophy. 

GOOD GAME!"
28258,mind numbing
28259,Cap the Fps to 120 and Hz to 60 - 120. Enjoy the best game ever made!
28260,Great game
28261,This game is a classic that will never die.
28262,The   W  O  R  K  S  H  O  P  is the main game!
28263,Quick game (~15 hours) to beat. Plus 150+ hours of sandbox play. Lots to do and lots to keep you entertained.
28264, this game bad do not buy 10/10
28265,love this game
28266,"hcealoh fghtrs bjght... GG
"
28267,it crashes 24/7
28268,yes game good
28269,"Bad game, tbh i don't even know why i'm giving it a good review"
28270,gud
28271,"Great game, its simply a must play."
28272,Classic open world game. I you're looking for literally endless hours of gameplay look no further. Don't take my word for it though. Ask your friends about Skyrim. Odds are at least half of the people you know have played.
28273,everything is amazing
28274,My cousin's out fighting dragons and what do I get? an arrow in the knee
28275,Great fun
28276,The Best Game ever created NO CAP
28277,"It just works, what else can I say"
28278,definitely kek
28279,best  game ever created other than the fallout series bathesda is just amazing
28280,dis is gud
28281,"it good i guess kinda glitchy sometimes its ok
"
28282,"The iconic fantasy game of the past decade, leaving Bethesda's atrocious recent behavior aside, is an amazing game. It is one of the last good ones they made, ""good"" being relative as just like always it was a bit of a buggy mess, but it was complete. Modding was not monetized, instead encouraged, and great mods and modders were recognized for their hard work. Those that had it already received the special edition for free, and the game was supported to hell and back. This is still a great game, and a memorial to what Bethesda used to be, before being consumed by the titan of greed as many other AAA companies."
28283,kinda glitched and some plot holes but its fun so no worries
28284,"its fucken skyrim m8, wat else u wanna know"
28285,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

28286,love it
28287,its skyrim
28288,Not quite up to the specs for modern games but a good starting place to learn how to play these types of games without being to demanding.
28289,"Awsome and very modable, not more to say. ^^"
28290,"Skyrim is a masterpiece, that is worth playing."
28291,"This game is chock full of exciting adventures and interesting NPCs. While -due to recent and inevitable technological advances- the graphics leave something to be desired, a well placed mod or two can leave you stunned at the beauty of Skyrim and all its provinces. If you choose not to mod, don't fret as the game is far from ugly, and playing vanilla will still give you hours of immersive entertainment. The hours of writing and lore that went into this game are not to be overlooked, and even after clocking thousands of hours on multiple platforms (PC, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch) I still find myself surprised to discover something new every time I load the game. When all is said and done, Skyrim is an amazing game that still delivers 9 years after its initial release."
28292,"I spent sooooo many hours on this game (offline)

It went to the point where i was trying to do all the achievements.

Iv'e replayed this game so many times, so much diversity in the way you play and always adds replayability.
Ever bored? always download a few mods to spicen things up and add more content.

The game is a masterpiece, there is a reason it has such a commited fanbase, due to the perfection of this game.

Just make sure you save regularly and enjoy the amount of story and fun gameplay that it has to offer."
28293,"Its skyrim, play the game"
28294,"it`s a grate game for a
ny one who is a game player and likes to solve puzzles"
28295,"Just buy the OG version, unless SE is on sale......... BUT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
28296,"It's skyrim, already good base game, add mods to your own flavor and bam.

Got yourself one hell of a game."
28297,Greatest game of our time
28298,"gut
"
28299,"Skyrim`s a game of legendary proportions.
Wether you are a puritan, playing the game without mods, add-ons or texture packs, or you are someone who moulds the game to their own preference with immersion, textures, and all different kinds of fantastic files.
A game where you can lose track of time, trying to do one last sidequest before continuing on fighting dragons and saving Skyrim.
This game for me has been a source of inspiration and many hours of fun. If you have no experience in the Elder Scrolls universe and this will be your first travelling into the realm of Tamriel I cannot recommend this game enough. The Special Edition caters more to the puritans, where the classic version will have all the mods you could ever need.

All in all, play this game. I can`t recommend this enough."
28300,Veri eskelent gam
28301,obviously
28302,it great
28303,"fucking love this game i been playing for years and still love it
"
28304,What can I say? It is and will be one of the best games forever!
28305,"While I don't think that it could necessarily even be considered a true RPG, (although Hearthfire tires to rectify this to some degree) there is something truly so magical about this game and every time I play, I AM Dovahkiin.  Skyrim will always hold a special place in my heart, and I anticipate the day that we finally get Elder Scrolls 6. Although at the way things are looking... that may never happen ;C"
28306,It's alright
28307,Mod it until it crashes.
28308,It's Skyrim
28309,Is good.
28310,"good game, def worth the money, buy it"
28311,"well what can i say, its skyrim. i would suggest getting this skyrim because  you can easily mod this one."
28312,"the game you always comeback ,mod it until it crashes"
28313,I been playing this game since it's release and still do today mods help hail ulfric true high king all hail stormcloaks from a true legit blooded nord with love.
28314,I feel 10 again
28315,"If you don't know what this game is and you want me to give you an explanation...

I won't, because if you told me you didn't know what this game is, I'd call you a liar."
28316,This Game took away my social life. Damn you Todd.
28317,Real good
28318,good af
28319,"Ive been playing this game sense I was about 11. I started on 360, and moved over to PC. And man can i tell you, this game is so fun! It puts you in your own little world of imgination"
28320,"VWQY
SD"
28321,"Superb game. Have more than 900 hours of gameplay so I don't think I need to say much else. Vast open world and a lot of freedom to customize your character and play the way you want. Want to change how the game looks, feels and works? Throw some mods (or hundreds of them) and you'll completely revamp your experience. Can't get enough of this game."
28322,ITS FUN
28323,"old, but still a favorite."
28324,gud game
28325,its skyrim who hasnt played this game yet?
28326,"I've been playing Skyrim my entire life and it's always been the best game I have played. I would really recommend Skyrim to pretty much everyone. It has many quests and is an open world, so you never get tired of it. :)"
28327,Simultaneously both the best and worst game I ever played.
28328,good meme
28329,Do I really need to tell anybody how f***ing fantastic this game is?
28330,10/10
28331,awsome.
28332,"ITS AWEsOME
"
28333,"Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls games are the best in my opinion on open world games. For the year it was released and updates sense, plus the amount of MOD's you can get for this game. Brings in graphics and sheds new ideas into the game that i have not seen in a long time."
28334,
28335,good
28336,over 5k hrs...whaddyou think
28337,"Endless things to do and customize. I can't stop playing this game, even after years of taking it off. It always beckons me back."
28338,"Great game-play, amazing graphics and loads of things to explore and discover!"
28339,the best roleplaying game of all time
28340,Nothing like it.
28341,good but buggy
28342,One of the best games ever.
28343,its fun to run around in
28344,"It's skyrim, what more do you want?"
28345,its one of the greatest games of all time.  It's not perfect though but it's hella memorable and fun.
28346,Chaotic
28347,"Played a little. It was fun. 
"
28348,It's Skyrim. What more do you need?
28349,skyrim good
28350,good yeees
28351,Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies
28352,Great game I never played it until about 2014 though and by that time It had all the decent mods and patches I can Imagine what a cluster fuck it was like on release. Dawnguard is my favourite part of the game Two Different stories I liked DragonBorn but I hated the main story the tentacle monster parts in the books annoyed the hell out of me the rest is great though
28353,Great Game! I think it really lets people play with their imagination in the form of near limitless content over a wide variety of play styles!
28354,"I'd say one of the best RPG games I've played ever. Even thou it has many other platforms to play with. Still, my favourite RPG."
28355,"Skyrim, and TES all together, are outstanding. the story connects nicely, with cross-references and replayable conent. I couldn't recommend this game more. loveable characters, nice story, and, oh look, mods!"
28356,"Timeless, Stunning, A broken masterpiece"
28357,good
28358,good game
28359,funny
28360,"With as many hours logged as I have, yes i'd recommend this game to EVERYONE!  Played WITH and WITHOUT mods, and discovered that the mods truly make this game unique to the player!"
28361,"Yaes Very gud, No?"
28362,"It is a really fun game and i love messing around in it, you can do so much plus with the DLC kinda expands the stories"
28363,i like
28364,SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!
28365,One of the most iconic games of all time
28366,its big
28367,yes
28368,One of the best games ever made.  I have played this for hours and hours and never get bored.  Sometimes magic is made and this happens to be one of those magical things.
28369,"Despite most the guards having a knee fetish this game was enjoyable.
I owned this game on ps4 so i have way more then 50 hours ;)
Anyone looking for an rpg and somehow hasn't played Skyrim should definitely buy.

p.s the claw has the password on it. (I had to randomly guess the password because i was retarded)
"
28370,"Yes, very good game"
28371,It is good game.
28372,the best game ever made. a must have
28373,Fun and adventurous. Played it since i was a child
28374,It's Skyrim....
28375,yes
28376,It is skyrim.. duh. it is good
28377,its my favortive game
28378,"This game is fun enough, and it's sometimes very broken (In a funny way) However, if you're not a fan of games where you walk a lot, you might not like it very much."
28379,"Played this game since I was 12. Thoroughly enjoyed it despite after a playthrough or 2, I needed to get mods to make it interesting XD"
28380,Easily one of the best games of the 2010s
28381,yes
28382,Ye
28383,The best game ever even than Naruto which is best than anything in the world

28385,brilliant. a gods damn masterpiece.
28386,"It's Skyrim, who wouldn't rate it good?"
28387,"lots of melons
 best game ever"
28388,"This game is great. Never use mods. They ruin the game. You install them, and some may make the game better, but it never stops. You keep adding more and more mods making the game more beautiful and more immersive until you realize you're spending more time adding mods than playing the game. Then you try to play the game, but then the game doesn't work, so you have to figure out which combination of mods broke the game which is an ordeal. Then eventually, you just want to play Skyrim, so you delete all the mods to start fresh, but you're no tool! You can't just play un-modded Skyrim! So the process begins again. The only way to enjoy Skyrim is to never let the allure of mods drag you down the rabbit hole. Not even one. Even that one that makes the plants pretty. 

No."
28389,Giants got that spicy old-man look
28390,I don't think i need to explain. It's Skyrim.
28391,Is good and fun. I've played it a lot.
28392,This game was great when I was able to play it. Apparently it no longer works. And it is now hidden from the steam store.
28393,"No, Absolutely not."
28394,Like Fallout ... its Bethesda and like all their games it's Modifiable.. which means endless play options ...
28395,"Despite the vanilla experience being close to horrendous, with the modding capabilities of the Creation Engine, there are so many things you can do with Skyrim. For that alone, I'd recommend it. Besides that, the game itself isn't all that great if we're being honest. The story is the same, ""you're the chosen one, the end of the world is near"" yada yada, the gameplay has not aged well and it's nothing to write home about in the looks department. But, given enough time and tweaking, there's a fun ride here."
28396,its rad
28397,"skyrim good, special edition bad."
28398,You don't need me to tell you that Skyrim is great. Just buy it already and you won't regret it.
28399,"Skyrim, bethesda's last good game"
28400,"Skyrim is full of the 2010's nostalgia, not to mention you can play over 10,000 hrs and not get bored."
28401,This game is like an old friend. You keep coming back for more and it's always a good time.
28402,"Skyrim is by far one of my favorite games of all time, with a well made story and the sheer amount of content makes this game possible to play through again and again, and even after you have exhausted its original content you can still get the dlc and even mod the game through skyrims MASSIVE modding community."
28403,Still better than ESO.
28404,A Master Piece.
28405,Just fun
28406,great
28407,"Played it a bit. Haven't completed all content yet, but pretty good so far"
28408,"I could repeat pretty much what I said about Fallout 4, but I'll just sum it up: it's not an RPG. It's a game about mucking around in a huge but mostly featureless open world. It pays RPG lip service with it's stats & quests, but it doesn't stand by anything that makes RPGs actual RPGs.

I guess it's serviceable when you're GUI (Gaming Under Influence), but there's better RPGs for these occasions. My personal suggestions: if you're mostly an RPG player (to put it differently, aren't huge on reflexes), Hellgate: London. If you, like me, got a knack for action games, Shadow Warrior 2 and maybe Killing Floor 2.

While finally writing a proper review for Enderal (which I PERSONALLY consider the best & only reason for Skyrim to exist), I think I can say with confidence what's wrong with Skyrim: it's shallow everywhere except the, admittedly strong, art style. It's got a well-choreographed intro but doesn't offer much afterwards. Humongous but monotonous world. Quests are few & far between, rarely offering well-written little stories. POIs generally don't even deserve the I as there's barely anything of interest there. There is interesting stuff in Skyrim all right, but what's there is hidden under a mountain of monotonous time sink.

You could object here, since when am I opposed to monotonous gameplay? Just take a look at my Killing Floor 2 stats! Well, KF2 has deph in melee (and gun, but that's not the topic) combat, offering a nuanced blend of player & character skill. If a game like Skyrim existed, one with a huge map, a few interesting places, a few (or heck, none) quests, I'd totally play it if it's combat had the depth of Killing Floor 2 or Dark Messiah. The environments in Shadow Warrior 2 are, ultimately, only somewhat less boring than Skyrim (SW2 has among the best-looking and most-fun-to-play-in procedural worlds I've seen) but I still consider it a masterpiece. Why? Because the stats system is rewarding once you pour thought & planning into it (which you kinda have lest every single dude will take ages to kill) and the moment-to-moment-combat is satisfying both in the gameplay (weapon choice, reflexes, target priorisation although there's better games for the latter) and presentation (meaty weapons, enemies flying back when hit) departments."
28409,"This Game is so great, it deserves a remaster."
28410,legendary
28411,its good
28412,feels mythical man.
28413,"Skyrim, there has never been a dull moment with this game. Graphics are amazing, story is unable to be forgotten, the music is still sung to this day proudly and triumphantly, just the simple satisfaction of launching the game and hearing the menu music makes me happy again. Please treat yourself and buy this game. I have played, and beat this game on PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC if that tells you anything. (I also have more than 50+ hours of playtime just played with no internet.)"
28414,AMAZING STORY!
28415,"obviously best game duh
"
28416,"I spent 3 hours in the spot where you sneak past or fight the bear, legendary`d sneak 3 times and got to level 34 ish. 10/10 would hit Ralof again"
28417,"An ageless masterpiece that paved the genre while still honoring the memory of good titles that preceded it. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim still offers a very rich and immersive experience. Even with several bugs (some even famous, hehe) this is a title that needs to be in your collection. No wonder mods are created for Skyrim to this day."
28418,"Meeeeh, i don't like it."
28419,"I believe there isn't much left to say about this game now after all these years - however, I would still like to write a few lines regarding this game.

Personally, I couldn't find any other RPG that even matches this game (maybe The Witcher 3 does that, but in a different way). Being able to mod this game, this enables every player to customize it to ones liking. The only thing that stands in its way is that - in my opionion - the basic ressources this game can use (RAM, video card space etc.) limits that. I have found my best way to mod this game that it has a great balance between gameplay and graphics some time ago. back then, one had to decide between 2 things - modding this game heavily on graphics or gameplay. I don't know if there are now mods which fix the issue with the ressources this game can use, but if there are... even better. 

That said, a modded Skyrim will greatly increase the reason not to give up on this game just after some time. Even unmodded, it is great. The story is nice and takes quite some time to finish, there are tons of side quests, locations to explore, characters to find etc. With its DLCs, it gains two more interesting story lines as well as new locations  worthy to be explored and great characters worthy to being met. 

Pros:
-moddable
-great graphics unmodded, even now
-a console to counter some bugs
-great story
-open world
-huge pool of mods available on SkyrimNexus
-moddable (did I already mention that?)

cons:
-runs out of ressources if modded heavily without thinking about what one does -> leading to a ""crash to desktop""
-addictive
-some bugs (which can, as already mentionend, be fixed with the console, so nothing too bad)

I'd give this game anytime 11/10"
28420,it's shit
28421,"Love this game as well as the mods that you can get for FREE!!! It is hard but love that fact that it is an open world game so you can wander around and find little treasures everywhere or go by the quests, it is up to the individual to decide. Just watch out for dragons and giants!"
28422,One of the best games I've ever played.
28423,"It's Skyrim bro, do you really need a review?"
28424,"Excellent game, open world allows unlimited replay value."
28425,"The most shallow rpg I've ever played, oblivion is infinitely better than this piece of shit"
28426,I'm not my game is skyrim anymore...
28427,Great fun to be had installing all the mods.
28428,"Not much more I can add that hasn't already been said from a positive point of view.  One of the greatest games ever developed.  The SE version is reported to be more stable, however I find the LE to work just fine.  Don't hesitate to purchase if your interested in this sort of game.

With the hint of ESVI I can only hope Bethesda will take it to the next level."
28429,its skyrim of course its fuckin good
28430,love this game
28431,"16 times the crashes - Kinda meme kinda true

If you're playing Skyrim just to play Skyrim, SE is generally improved all around due to being more modern.
If you're playing Skyrim to mod, SE now has most of the same features and support with way less innate issues (I.e Skyrim standards memory cap)

Realistically unless you are fairly sure you know what you're doing and what you want to mod, you should be using Special edition. LE may be moddable the same way if done correctly but it'll be harder to achieve the same results than it needs to be."
28432,Eeeehh... yeah
28433,With all the mods available there is always some place new to see and new ways of playing.
28434,Skyrim is the best RPG game. That is all.
28435,mods.
28436,its alright
28437,Play it! Beat it! Mod it! Break it! Fix it! Play it! Mod it again! Love it!
28438,i like it
28439,its a fun game to get lost in. especially if you can mod ect...
28440,"*initial play*
start skyrim
play the main quest
get side tracked
grow too over powered
get bored 
dont play for months
open skyrim
delete save/start new game
rinse and repeat"
28441,"Only been playing for almost 500 hours, and the only downside is that having several dozen mods sometimes makes it crash, especially when they conflict, but 99% sure that's my fault :D Still love this game and would reccommend it to anyone"
28442,"It's still worth playing, and the modding community is still going."
28443,"Amazing open world game that will keep getting you distracted by side quests until the end of time. Nevermind the dragons flying around destroying towns and all that, there's a cave that looks interesting and that clearly takes priority."
28444,good
28445,This game in its vanilla form is absolutely amazing.  It offers hours of game play and a very compelling set of side quests and man story line.   It really shines once you go to the workshop and slap some mods on this bad boy.   I have been playing this game forever an I love it.
28446,have started over many many times the reason for so many hours of game play been playing for years. on and off but i like the world games anyway.
28447,its skyrim... come on you dont need to be told its great although stoning to death is required if you think that it is amzing the 10th playthrough and you still havent added mods...
28448,oh heck yes brother play this damb game.
28449,Fun game
28450,all of it
28451,It's generally okay or something.
28452,lit
28453,
28454,Classic
28455,good game lots of fun get it when on sale
28456,"Skyrim good
"
28457,I've been playing this game since 2015 and believe that you can still have a new experience every time you play. Mods make this game even better however. There are plenty of fun and interesting mods you can download to make this game seem like a completely different game.
28458,nice
28459,Ok just a few mods aaaaaand my game crashed.
28460,"Love this game, all the options and the open world makes it so special. You can chose to do the questline or just playing for fun."
28461,"I mean, it's skyrim."
28462,i like the immersive open world environment and the option to choose which goals i want to pursue and in which order. this game is far superior to those which box you in and force you to follow a narrow channel from start to finish.
28463,"Its a great game, there may be some bugs but the game is great and can become even better with mods. Reccomend to everyone who enjoyed Elder Scrolls 4"
28464,"I love this game! The mods, the ability do whatever you want in the whole world is amazing"
28465,"better than Skyrim SE if you have a bad pc or want mods, it's a shame bethesda hid this version. Difference in score depends on what you're looking for. As someone who doesn't do much modding and doesn't really care about graphics there's not much of a difference. same score for og and se versions.

7.5/10"
28466,"epic
"
28467,Excellent RPG game if aging a bit now.
28468,bit glitchy but can be fixed with mods overall probably my favourite game of all time
28469,"It's a good game and plenty of time can be invested as it is, but if you really want to get the best out of the game download the ""Enderal Forgotten Stories"" Mod for PC! This is a WHOLE WORLD mod! It is a much more beautiful world with completely different and much more immersive characters, story line and quest content Also , though it may have fewer dungeons (some estimate more then 50% of the dungeons in ""Elder Scrolls""Ar not even explored), they are much, MUCH larger (some of them even HUGE), more interesting and much more content."
28470,Great game.
28471,"good god this is quite a romp. there is so much to do! it is physically, mentally, and spiritually impossible to get bored of this game. once you beat it, you didnt really beat it because there is a metric ton's worth of more content to be done, not to mention the variety of choices to be made ingame, each one affecting the story. i know i dont need to preach this game anymore, but i can tell you that this game is an absolute masterpiece.
-"
28472,not bad
28473,always have enjoyed this much better on pc than xbox or playstaion defo recomend to anyone
28474,Skyrim
28475,good
28476,"It's a really immersive experience and worth buying for the replayablity, lore, open world, realistic NPCs (And I mean realistic as far as how they react to your race and actions) story and combat. The gameplay is just amazing and yeah there are some flaws, like no multiplayer option (there's a mod for that) but if you can live with them then overall, it's an amazing game and a classic in my eyes."

28483,BEST GAME EVER CREATED
28484,"I love playing this game. i have been playing for about 4 years. sometimes I play with mods, sometimes I still play without. my husband got me into it, and i bought him the legendary version with all the dlcs, but by then he was playing more fallout, so i started playing that version instead. it is a great stress reliever for me and an escape when i dont feel like sitting down to read a book."
28485,It's Skyrim. Yup. It's Skyrim. Why are you reading this? Go play it!
28486,you have already play this game so why even do it more than that. ok but you are wanting to see more dragon then. yes than play again for another day and waste your day play games on compuiter
28487,great game
28488,"I've had three files on this game, and ALL of them have been awesome. Files 1 and 2 were a Nord and a Khajitt respectively. File 3, which is my PC one, is also a Nord, and I'm Level 27, close to 28.

Anyway, back to reviewing. I love this game, and if you're thinking of playing this, you're gonna be impressed as well."

28491,"la compra vale mucho la pena, no digo mas"
28492,Steath Archer all day every day (24/7/365) and don't let anybody tell you otherwise.
28493,Best game ever. No other game keeps you hooked for so long and doesn't have a monthly sub and such steady flow of content.
28494,"Great game overall, can't get bored very easily (especially with mods and a sip of skooma). 10/10"

28496,Age like wine.
28497,One of the best games i've ever played. Mods can provide great graphics even in 2020.

28499,"yes!
"
28500,"[i]O-o-oh there once was a hero installed million mods, 
and all of them were to make Skyrim look odd...
like anime styled RE genesis with guns and funs 
fighting over the prime evil rock band with bats and light sabers
while dragons are Muchachos and Tom the Trains
and you are... we'll... you are a Master Chief weilding a giant cucumber,
bombarding fresh baguettes from a sky on everyone's heads...[/i] 

I really do not know why i'm writing this review since i'm sure every single one person exist have played The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and competed it at least one thousand times already... and also because it's Skyrim, but... one does not simply walk away when having a chance to discuss this masterpiece of gaming. So, let's jump into it: 

YES! YES! YEAAASSSS! I love Skyrim with all my heart. It is a perfect RPG game in which you can literally spent a third of your life and you still won't cover all of it's content or get enough of it. (!!Please just don't even try to cover all of the workshop's and NEXUS content, since you will simply miss your own funeral). It's too much. It's too many. As for me, well, i've played more than 700+ hours and 200+ of special edition. And yeah, i know it's not that much and i've seen people who played more than 5 thousand hours. Does it mean they are insane? No, this only means they are trying to miss their funeral - a key to immortality is in playing Skyrim and covering all of it's content, i tell you. It's not about the quests. It's about the dungeons and dragons! The treasures and maidens! Why even bother playing all those silly FPS? Can you simultaneosly hunt a dragon, while being attacked by master vampires while being on a quest for finding someone's goat you sold to a giant humanoid after participating in drinking contest with a daedric lord, who is suddenly gone, and you are now chased by all those guys and their arrows and magic and etc, but then you avoid dying after noticing a missing for a recipe of fortifying one-handed attacks flower which is somehow surrounded by two spriggans who are now involved into a fire's and ice's mage's magic duel like all the other guys, so now you have forgotten what you were doing at all and so you notice a butterfly flying by, making you understand you can't miss catching it because you need it's wings for a soup, but all the mess happening won't give you a chance to catch it so you take out your plazma rifle and make all the living desintegrate into oblivion and it all looks majestic with all the mods you've installed making the sunrays and flora shine with it's new 10k textures and effects of lightning echanted... Yes, welcome to Skyrim.

The world of Skyrim is huge. The outdoors are wild and full of creatures, full of unique places, landscapes and things going on. The dungeons are filled with treasures and items, secrets and misteries. The story is complicated and various. If you are into RPG SP games - this one is the only choice. 2019 and it is still very popular among gamers.

Skyrim is perfect in every way it can be. It is a very ballanced game. Ballanced in every school no matter if it's alchemy or enchanting. +1000 dmg to my dragonbone bow - Pfff, no problem! Now how do i sell all these 3 hundred enchanted daggers priced 10k each? Let's just invest into every shop and then get our money back by selling, lol. Dova knows his business, man. At last the game is fixed like f..., all those patches and fixes, now the NPC don't ever care if they sit past the chair or not, they don't give a s... they are perfectly fine with that. Yes sir, it is magic and we all practice it. Dead dragons falling from the sky is natural - even these majestic and powerful creatures can not handle the glorious looks of Skyrim's landscapes and fine weather.They faint like castle ladies hearing swearing and BTW, some say Skyrim's weather is not good for their crops, but i say Skyrims weather is perfect to wear my brand new bikini armor which grants 95% resistance to every elemental magic and runnning speed equals to a speed of lightning. The necklace i just enchanted makes me permanently invisible and grants me a teleportation to any place i need. Now have you seen a horse that can climb vertical mountains clifs? Welcome to Skyrim. This new blaster mod i just attached to my client makes all the SUPERIOR DRAUG OVERLORDS p*ss their NORDIC pants and run to DAGGERFALL. Bless the Arcane.

So yeah. The Skyrim gives you a chance to spent thousands of hours playing even without any crazy mods installed. There are several main stories which can be completed separately or along with others quests. Anytime you can start the game all over trying out new perks, skills and style and etc. [b]There are no class restrictions[/b] - You can be whatever you want to be. A healing archer with summoning skills? - Sure. A blacksmith striking with fire magic? - Sure. Have you completed all the main and side quests? - Check out the workshop or the internet to find more content. If you love this game, you can play it again and again without getting tired of it. There is always something new. That's one of the reasons  i find this game perfect.

28501,Giants should be in every game
28502,Yes
28503,nothing like modding a vagina on alduin
28504,in 4e 23 my argonian slave bit my dick off in a crude imitation of sermon 14 and i got ash in the cut
28505,"one of the best games i've ever played. I strongly recommend it to everyone. Also, try some mods - they make the game infinitely better. Maybe bethesda did f up other projects but skyrim is totally awesome"
28506,m
28507,Too many cheaters
28508,its ok
28509,"Eh, it's not that great story wise, but my god, if you like modding games, you'll have a field day with this one
[spoiler][strike]especially if you like nekkid mods[/strike][/spoiler]"
28510,this is one of the best games i ever played worth buying it <3
28511,"This is the best Skyrim out. The mods are free, and amazing, and the game is incredible. Sadly, I don't think it's still available unless it was bought before the ""special edition""."
28512,d                            r                                 a                            g                         o                       n                      s
28513,One of the best RPG game made of all time.
28514,fun as all get out.
28515,No words except awesome
28516,very good RPG. as of now the graphics are dated by the story is awesome and the world is fun
28517,3
28518,"its skyrim... what is there to dislike?
"
28519,The Mod community for this Game made it awesome to replay
28520,"its good
"
28521,I loke modding this game
28522,"One of the best games ever. Was probably the most influential game of the 2010s other than Minecraft. The mechanics are streamlined compared to its predecessors, the graphics are a huge upgrade from Oblivion, and the voice acting and world design are on point.
Despite this, though, I would highly recommend modding this game until it begins to fall apart at the seams. The modding community around Skyrim is amazing and the mods that are available make this one of the most tailormade experience you can have."
28523,yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
28524,"I mean, if you haven't played this yet, I doubt I'm going to change your mind.  The base game itself is decent, if you're a fan of previous Elder Scrolls games (if you are though, I doubt you're reading this) you might be disappointed in some of the changes, but I personally don't find it that different besides classes, perks, and stuff like that, which mods will fix.

The real beauty of this game is the modding community.  You can find a mod for everything pretty much.  It turns an already fantastic game into an endless adventure.  Buy it if you haven't played it, you deserve to at least check it out"
28525,Very fun to play
28526,Good game.
28527,Everyone knows this game. Get it if you don't have it.
28528,cant stop playing everday
28529,"Have you been to the cloud district? Oh, what am I saying? Of course you haven't."
28530,ㅤ
28531,One of the best free-roaming games created. Seemingly infinite game-play value.
28532,its ight
28533,"If you enjoy nature walks, sightseeing, hunting,fishing,dragon hunting etc etc then skyrim is the way to get away from all the bullshit in your life and live in a fantasy life like world to be honest I myself love to see the sights and explore the entire world of skyrim itself I bet everyone here would agree with me here that skyrim offers a lot in every way."
28534,Hands down the best game of the decade. And if you ever get bored of the main game just mod the hell out of it and get hundreds more hours of gameplay.
28535,yes just yes
28536,Still a fan favorite. The story line is great for the genre.  The playability is really good.  Saving and restarting due to death isn't annoying... and actually helpful to learn how to battle thru a situation.  Not a high learning curve and overall a lot of fun.
28537,"A superb open world game, filled dragons, dungeons, dangers and magic. There are thousands of mods available to allow you to fine tune the game to meet your own vision of what it should be."
28538,"Hands down my favorite game ever purchased, hundreds of hours of gameplay that never gets old"
28539,Its Good
28540,It's good
28541,5/5 star game love playing this
28542,alot of content and with mods becomes godly
28543,Gg
28544,
28545,One word to sum up Skyrim is. Endless.
28546,"This game is awesome, best with mods in my opinion, or should i say mods are a reason i have this game. Have i ever played the vanilla game 100%? no, will i? no, because im literally to deep in mods. Mods are my life now, send help, like really, do it before i get consumed completely into the never ending void that is skyrim moding.





Also, haven't played special edition, but since there are less mods, i think i'll stick around in this one, for atleast another 300 hours

And no Todd, it doesn't just work, it doesn't work at all, without mods : ^)"
28547,Every RPG-loving player has to play this masterpiece! There is nothing more to say...
28548,Solid game.
28549,"Toss a coin to Sven!
O’ Valley of Plenty"
28550,best game ever made if you are born bost 96 no cap
28551,"I feel this new entry from Bethesda has a serious chance of being very successful, buy it now because they sure as hell aren't going to be doing any re-releases. 

--- update from the year 2033, theres still no elder scrolls 6 but bethesda have just released the elder scrolls 5 skyrim ultra amazing definitive 64k HHHHD remaster on the nintendo 69 xoxoxo"
28552,well so you can either go you can either go extreme combat stats or you can do random shit like me maxing out pickpocketing and just pickpocketing a boss's weapons. ive done that before lol
28553,"Huge world with lots to do. Maybe too much...

Only gripe is that the engine is a little buggy, but that seems to be a common problem with most Bethesda games."
28554,It just works (after you mod it enough)
28555,"A lot of possibilities, infinity fun!"
28556,"Good game, not a great RPG, if you're looking for a game with some actual choice, perhaps play New Vegas, or KOTOR 2"
28557,F U N
28558,"I mean, c'mon, it's Skyrim."

Walk trough a massive world as the dragonborn and kill dragons, raid camps and follow the questlines.

28575,It just works.
28576,"fantasy, adventure, rpg, cool game"
28577,don't do it. it's too late.
28578,This game is so good. It never gets old and I'm still stumbling across quests I never did before.
28579,"Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said about Skyrim. It's a buggy mess of pure fun. I have around a 1000 hours across a few platforms and cab safely say this game will go down as a top 100 game of all time on most lists. Huge world to explore, many factions to rise to the top of, so many wheels of cheese to steal, I mean it has it all. It's Skyrim just play it."
28580,"One of the best games ever made! Cant wait for ES: VI

...just as long as its not an MMO or ruined with an open world survival like they tried with Fallout."
28581,cool

28584,good
28585,"This game is about as good as it gets and it's a classic. The gameplay and the story are deep, the world is very flavorvul and immersive, while also leaving the players with tons of options. This really is the gold standard for an rpg."
28586,Its the best waste of time.
28587,its skyrim. its great. i might even finish it someday.
28588,best.game.ever.
28589,"good gam
"
28590,"its skyrim. if u havent played it play it
"
28591,"A bit buggy but in overall it's a really good game
The workshop(+NexusMods) is full of mods if you want to change anything"
28592,"Having gone in with expectations of nothing but a buggy, glitched mess with little interesting or noteworthy gameplay, my first few hours (4 as of writing this review) were quite fun! The controls and settings took some adjustment and there's a few UI nitpicks I have but over all those flaws are fairly trivial.

Skyrim is the kind of game where graphics don't even matter that much. I play this game on the lowest settings so that it can run smoothly on my computer and it works very well, and I don't feel at all taken out of the adventure because of it. 

Again, this is not a perfect game, and there a few more harmless or annoying glitches, bugs or visual errors that I've encountered in the game so far than I would in most other games, but again, it doesn't really detract from it at all.

I'm particularly fond of the preference-oriented difficulty selections, the large number of traits to level up, the semi realistic (but not annoyingly so) crafting, refining and smithing procedures, and in particular the Alchemy procedure. Also, constant, scavenger-esque looting really draws me in as well. Really, if you like open world RPGs and have been putting off Skyrim for a while because of all the negative media attention it's gotten, and the meme status it's become, I'd say try it anyways. Maybe my standards are really low, but for what this is, I find ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" to be a beautiful, if flawed, game."
28593,good gam
28594,Epic
28595,"its skyrim
most things you have heard of are true
its good"
28596,It's great!
28597,apparently ive played for 33 hours felt like 33 mins
28598,"This is the game that brought The Elder Scrolls to the masses. The most polished and refined game in the series, it plays and looks spectacular. There are many ways you can progress your character so anyone can play the way they like. There are so many side quests you can get lost for hours and forget about the main quest. I think just about anyone could pick them game up and have fun with it for hours."
28599,is good
28600,Best game ever made! Period.
28601,"Its Skyrim baby

28618,"fun to wack things
"
28619,It's Skyrim. We will be playing this until the world ends. We also hate it. But we love it.
28620,"This game is never getting old for me.
I highly recommend playing it at least once and, if you enjoy it, you will find hard to stop going back to Skyrim every once in a while. Sometimes just to hear the wind and the music while you walk across its beautiful scenery.

The story is not complex and you will not be satisfied if you expect plot twists and hard decisions to make, but everything has an epic and mythical aura around it."
28621,12321321312
28622,really shallow
28623,"Fun  game, I love the story and I been playing this game for a long time this account does not reflect the true number of hours I have invested into this game.  My only complaint is that the aiming system in this game is kinda poor.  I do wish there was a better fighting/aiming system.  Other than that it is fun and enjoyable."
28624,good game would recomend
28625,This is the staple of modern open-world RPGs. The modding community is one of the biggest of any games ever made. This is a must-play game.
28626,"I've had this game since it was released.  I find myself always coming back and finding things I didn't know about, new quests and the mods are wonderful."
28627,Why are you even here? Either you already own it or you should be buying a copy.

28640,Everything. Even the bugs.
28641,"This is a very huge and expansive game, you could play it for hours and hours and still be enthralled into such a master piece. I highly recommend it and you should recommend it to all your friends and family."

"
28660,"With the ability to mod this game, it can become completely different and  challenging again."
28661,"Fun game, though kids look like flash clones of themselves, kinda creepy children have like the same face, also sometimes it fun to get yeeted by the giants:3 mods definitely add well to the game play, graphics, and story. >3<"
28662,"An amazing game all round.
Well worth a play if you've never experienced the world of Skyrim."
28663,Amazing adventure game that provides multiple ways to play

28672,old time classic an always a favorite
28673,classic and always will be
28674,"I have a bad history with Bethesda since the dawn of times. All their games are bug ridden messes for me, nothing works as its supposed to, dozen of patches and fixes needed just to complete certain quests. And I hated, hated, hated the main story. IT'S BADLY WRITTEN MCGUFFIN HUNT. Badly written, like all the scripts in this game? Oh why yes, the game is this. Sadly, it's a decade defying shit. The reason most of the RPGs are boring mediocrities."
28675,Buy it. Mod it. Enjoy it.
28676,"no one:
not a single soul:
me: I steal potatoes from farms and then sell them to their owners

Ps: It's a crime if you havent played that game yet... IT'S WORTH IT! GIVE IT A GO! 
Easily the best game of the decade for me :D childhood heheheh"
28677,Fantastic game! Endless amount of possibilities. Completed the full game multiple times.

28679,"Прохожу каждый год в течении 7 лет, до сих пор не прошёл половину"
28680,"this game is so freaking good. but u should buy the newer version not this. if u buy this then buy the unlisted dlc hearthfire or something because then you can adopt and stuff. seriously go buy the listed, new version save urself the hassle."
28681,"it's skyrim, of course it's good. also i'm addicted. someone help me."
28682,"One of the best games of the last decade, no doubt on that. The open world is rich of side quests and interesting to explore. I just came back to this game after playing the Souls Series and this game at Master Difficulty is proving itself to be really really hard. Absolutely love this title!"
28683,"what is there to say? this game set yet another benchmark for fantasy RPGs, and while there are some things I wish had carried over from Oblivion and Morrowind, even vanilla, this game will destroy your spare time with no effort, and modding it will make that worse. there's just so much to see and do, you will be lucky if you ever actually get around to finishing the main storylines. if you haven't played it yet, where have you been in the last decade? get on it already!"
28684,"i would write a paragraph about how ridiculously fun this game is, but i'd rather you find out yourself"

28702,"coo
"
28703,"I'm revisiting this game after several years. I have almost 600 hours played on Skyrim, and can confidently say that it is absolutely the best game I have ever played. The modding community is still going strong since Skyrim came out in 2011. There are literally thousands of mods, many of them being incredibly immersive and lore-friendly. The right combination results in an unbelievably magical world to explore, survive in, and learn the tongue of dragons. I'll leave this short and let you find out for yourself!"
28704,Like an abusive boyfriend I'm convinced I can change
28705,"This game is one of the greatest gaming products ever created. I have never been so immersed into a game in my life. If you have not had the chance to playthrough The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, I would highly recommend playing this game. You will never look at games the same after this one."
28706,"Love this game. Some times, I can't decide if I want to do side quests, or just roam the map and dungeon explore."
28707,"Hey you, you're finally awake. You were caught trying to cross the border, like us, and that thief over there.

Honestly if you haven't played this game, pick up either the legendary edition of Skyrim, or the special edition. It's a pretty fun RPG style of game, and if you like RPG's you'll like this game."
28708,"Amazing to play, and a perfect game for entry into the RPG game category. Mods can be added for flavor very easily off the workshop, and has fun (though sometimes annoying) glitches. 10/10"
28709,this game beees da bestest of games joonalln
28710,"One of the greatest games of all time, whether you are a quest completionist or just like like exploring, it has it all."
28711,is goood
28712,Hours and hours of fun game play. Tons of mods and an active community to help keep it fresh
28713,gosh I love Skyrim.
28714,"This game is a classic.  I and my friends have all gone back to replay the entire adventure multiple times (It can be a different adventure each time, and you can be somebody different each time).  It's not perfect, but given that its (at the time of this writing in 2020) 9 years old, and still a very playable and engaging experience, I still say its a one of a kind triumph.  That's my take."
28715,It's Skyrim
28716,THis game is sick as tits

28722,good

Between just playing the vanilla game and always finding new things to explore, and modding the everloving shit out of it, this is just that one game i always find myself revisiting. Just great!"

28750,"everything
"
28751,"I have over a thousand hours and I've never once beaten the main quest, nor downloaded any of the DLC. Every time I come back to the game I explore all over once again with a new playstyle, new character. Never finish any old saves. Just redo redo redo, never gets boring.

Like FNV, more beautiful, only worse."
28752,"Ever since I've played the Elder scrolls 3 Morrowind the elder scrolls series has had me facinated.
Skyrim just adds to the wonder and role-playing fantacies.

28770,I've played it many times and beaten it many times. It has a wonderful modding community with a mod for anyone's taste. I strongly recommend this one!
28771,"Even after a few years play time, still an excellent game. 
Don't kill Cicero."
28772,is good

28774,"I love that this game gives you the option of your life, you can practically anything you can think of.
11/10 would play again!"
28775,ok this is epic
28776,Seriously if you haven't been sold on Skyrim by now I don't know what I can say to convince you.
28777,"What I love about The Skyrim Elder of Scrolls is i  really enjoy the game play and to me my favorite thing to do in this is to be a warrior in other words defeat things that are evil like the Bandits, Trolls, Spiders, Bears, Skeletons, and any others in the game that may stop you from where you are going. Be careful if you find a bounty hunter or collector they don't take kind to you giving them the answer to walk away. That doesn't always work for me, so keep that in mind. Over all Skyrim is a great video game on pc I recommend it for anybody who is interesed in buying this. to me well worth the money."
28778,"Soooo many ways to play... so many options, choices, and ways to play YOUR way, work on the exact skills YOU want, use races that benefit playing one way.. change your mind? OK, another race would let you play another way on the same class... want to be a hero? You have that. Want to be a thief and assassin? You have that too. It's just nuts, and you don't worry about other people interfering, it's all you."

28791,I have a shit ton of hours on my xbox too.... I have put my self in a position where I would rather play skyrim than do anything else.... I HAVE CANCELLED PLANS TO PLAY SKYRIM! buy this game at your own risk its amazing.
28792,"Even 8 years later, still a masterpiece of a game"
28793,this was my first ever game i could buy from a game shop im so happy when i got it when i was i think like 6 to 10 years old
28794,"Hey, you're finally awake
Back in the day, the game was fine 

now it's ruined by a few not so safe for work mods"
28795,"Even in 2020, playing Skyrim feels like going on a fantastic adventure. If you ever feel the urge to fight dragons or scour dungeons for treasure, you’ll have a good time playing it."
28796,"it is the best
"
28797,"Excellent arpg game to be enjoyed how you see fit with fun combat, abilities, and a nice leveling system with many perks to get for multiple different skills."
28798,UNDESCRIBIBLE...just play it....
28799,"Best game I've played.
Only a few annoying points.
- Can't skip long intro
- Magic sucks compared to Oblivion
It's still my favourite game"
28800,"I can never stop playing this game. I always end up revisiting it every year after i think iam done with it. Skyrim has received a lot of criticism and I think that thats ok, but in the end it is the Elderscrolls game that feels just perfect to me and i can recoomend every single one of those.
Probably my favorite single player game"
28801,Solid game
28802,Mods! Mods that can entertain you aaaand protect your virginity for a lifetime.
28803,Played this game ever since release on xbox 360 then made it over to pc and its still one of my favs!
28804,Best game for replayabillity and customization
28805,"Across every format I own this game in (PS3, PC 32-bit, PC 64-bit, PC VR) this is the game I have spent the most hours in at nearly five thousand. Considering the game just passed the eight year old mark and is still actively played, and still actively modded, that should give you some indication of the quality of the game. I keep going back."
28806,"noice geim
"
28807,One of the best RPG for all time.
28808,A Work of Art.PURE PERFECTION
28809,"Best game there ever was.
"
28810,"The game itself would get old pretty fast, but thankfully the modding community is doing the developers' job by fleshing out entire sections of the game Bethesda left unfinished, adding new quests and characters, and keeping up to date pretty much everything. The community keeps alive a game that otherwise would have been dead years ago."
28811,gud gayme
28812,Recommended.
28813,"has skyrim since xbox 360 one of the best games ever created for its time. highly suggest skyrim if you are into adventure, combat, quests and long gameplay."

28827,"Simply Awesome!  I don't get ""caught up"" in games often, and find myself tiring quickly of most that i download.  This game has been planned out so well.  I can't imagine how many man hours went into building it.  Although it is an old game, it's the best RPG i've played. Definitely recommend.  However, watch out, if you have things you need to get done at home."
28828,this is the best game in the world
28829,yes it is a fun
28830,Great Game
28831,fun
28832,Greatly insane game
28833,"Nice replay value, you can put a lot of hours into this game and there's a lot to do, whether you want to focus on one character for extended periods or start over."
28834,i love the whole story line i love every guild/faction it's completely well written and i deeply recommend it to everyone
28835,"Skyrim is great, It takes a while to level up and get your skills in order , but that just makes it more interesting.  Like many others I started with the Original Arena and have played All of them.  This game is in keeping with the Greats like Daggerfall ( buggy but really fun to play) and Oblivion.   I'm not thru with this play thru but I will eventually.  Lots of things to kill yet:)"
28836,The best game!!
28837,"This is one of the rare games that barely ever gets boring. I love playing with my modded companion, Inigo. There is still more to explore. ROund of applause for 400+ hours of my life poured into this game."
28838,outstanding graphics the ability to mod the game to continuously make different versions of the same game.
28839,it's good. you know it's good at this point. it's been a long time since you found out this game is good. go for it.
28840,Loved the open world experience
28841,"You know you have achieved end game, when you start installing NSFW mods into this shit"
28842,Mind blowing game. Especially if you enjoy adding mods to games.
28843,"fun

28844,"Any time, any where. Unbelievable game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

28846,goodd gaem
28847,yehh yeh yeh
28848,good
28849,This is a great game with great graphics. This game has no exploits at all. :)
28850,"A truly large world you can get lost in. Along with mods, this game has really stood the test of time."
28851,`the open world is terrific.  Great clues / interactions and the need for planning your next steps.  Great game.
28852,yes
28853,best game ever bugs are a feature not a problem
28854,"Honestly there isn't really much too say. If you are reading this review you most likely know what Skyrim is and are well aware of its Pros and Cons so taking that into consideration I will just tell you if its worth getting on PC.
Short Answer? Yes
all of my 435 hours on Skyrim PC are modded playthroughs and i'm not talking simple graphical enhancements or gameplay improvement mods or anything like that (although I do have those). Its like over 100 mods which range from New Races to Quest Mods to Gameplay/Graphical improvements. The modding scene for this game basically makes it worth buying again on PC and you don't even have to buy the DLCs. You can just download the ESM files for them and install them onto the game like I did. Skyrim on its own is already a fun time but mods take that fun time and increase it 10 fold."
28855,very good game; would definitely recommend this game.
28856,"Really enjoyable thought i thing the need to stop releasing it. They have it on everything now and its too much but i love the game anyhow
"
28857,good bruh
28858,"great game, reccomend it to anyone who likes fantasy."
28859,One of my favorite games of all time. I've gone back and played time and time again. A classic for me.
28860,just by it dude
28861,"Super great game, clocked over 500 hours, looking to double it."
28862,Its a glitchy mess but I still love the game lol
28863,what's there to say it's fucking skyrim of course it's good
28864,great game
28865,epic
28866,a
28867,=)
28868,"An old game , yes. Still worth playing? YES   With the thousands of mods for this game it never gets old.

28908,open world. engaging story. lots to do.
28909,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's one of the best open world games ever and mods kick it up to 11. If you haven't played this game yet, find a copy and go back to the rock you've been hiding under and play it!"

28923,graphics and game play are among the best I have ever seen.

28926,The community make it worth the coin
28927,"It's a fun game, open map exploration and has thousands of mods you can choose from on their website. Great adventure game, many dungeons and seemingly endless quests. Even after you beat the main quest, the game is not ended. I hope others enjoy it as much as I do. :)"
28928,It's so fun to play trough this adventure! Also Love how you can play the game quite freely.

28948,"This game is amazing, I've received it as a gift but I genuinely wouldn't mind paying for it. It's packed with quests, random encounters, everything. The amount of detail this game goes onto is amazing. This is one of the best games to have ever been released."
28949,This has always been and always will be my favourite game that I have ever played :) It is the most nostalgic thing that is going to remind me of how great my childhood was that I could play this game. 100/10

28954,months since i last played still an awesome game
28955,Skyrim is great. You get to go on nature hikes with your horse and stab things and look at trees and get attacked by dragons when you least expect it. 10/10 would go camping in Skyrim again.
28956,Best Game Ever Made (with mods......skyrim vanilla sucks).

28999,Awesome game.  Great Mods to help tweak it.  Highly recommend.
29000,get it over skyrim special edition
29001,If Steam had an option between thumbs up or down I would give that. Skyrim is a beautiful and perfect piece of unfinished trash. I hate everything about this game and love it so much. I recommend playing with mods.
29002,I liked everything.
29003,"Exactly as legendary as people said this game was. Never played any Skyrim games, this is my first and i already love it."
29004,Nice adventure game full of action and surprises.
29005,"Great RPG, will suck up many hours of your life."
29006,Great game. Easy to get lost playing it. The mods are awesome. Extemely replayable. My only problem is I get so sidetracked doing my own thing that I forget all about the main quest.
29007,Probably the last good game that Bethesda made.
29008,"Awesome story, lore, characters and exploration. You really have to think about choices you make, only the combat could be better."
29009,"Hey, it's Skyrim. Check out Gopher's mod list and Nexus mods and say good bye to your free time."
29010,replay value top marks.417 hours played.starting my 4th replay.

29013,so much fun
29014,The best game i ever played i LOVE it 20 out of 4 IF YOU NOT BUY U ARE RETARD...
29015,¸good game men :DDD
29016,haha elf girl pretty haha nord racist haha please step on me maven
29017,"Pros:
-huge, rich world; lots of NPCs to talk to, places to explore and sidequests to do
-the world looks fairly nice; the graphics have aged pretty well
-the combat is alright, most of the time it's fun, but it can get a bit dull
-the talent tree is fine, a lot of the talents are pretty great, but it's also customizeable late game

Cons:
-the main storylines feel rushed and that's why they're kinda underwhelming
-the crafting is really tedious (but also exploitable, which I find is a good thing)"
29018,Great game all around
29019,"Buggy Bethesda game, but great modding community that makes up for it. Fantastic game I've spent hours and hours playing and replaying"

29043,"Of course I recommend it, it's Skyrim"
29044,Nothing like sucking dragon souls
29045,"Fallout with swords, shield, and magic.

Played this on ps3 multiple times, so total hours might be around 300 hours. With pc being my third playthrough I felt justified in using cheats to unlock the skills i wanted rather than starting from the beginning.

With or without cheats, your character ends up being somewhat of a god. Too bad you don't get to use that power on a grand scale as you're limited fighting the few enemies at a time while exploring the vast world. There's unfortunately no sense of grand army battles to be a part of except maybe the couple of missions where you're participating in the stormcloak/imperial war. And like all open world games, you're just a glorified errand boy even as you're highly leveled.

That being said, a TON of sidequests are available which prolong the game greatly. Adventure always awaits. My criticism of that is on the other side, the 2 big main story quests (involving dragons and the other the stormcloak/imperial war that I previously mentioned) felt so miniscule in comparison.

Replayability is no problem due to character creation and the usual elder scrolls skill system. I would highly recommend this, as PC with mods is the best version of this game. 9.5/10"
29164,"Honestly, one of the best games I every played....
This game can never get you bored, big map with a lot of quest,
a lot of locations for u to investigate, a lot of bugs wich make game

make ur game even prettier so there is not even a point having Special Edition,
some mods just make u like ""I dont even want to comment this one..."" :3
I just love this game ♥"
29165,very good game
29166,"I thought that this game would feel aged, but with a couple graphical mods and other ambient mods, the game is gorgeous. As for the base game's content, the amount of content, characters, places, and quests is mind blowing and it's immensely satisfying to explore the world of Skyrim. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It is a little buggy, but these glitches don't outshine the game's greatness."

29189,"Hands down one of the best games of the decade, I played it when it first came out on the PS3 back on 11/11/11. I have enjoyed every minute since, and purchased it on every platform except the Nintendo Switch. This game marks the peak of Bethesda game making, and while I absolutely love Fallout 4, it is hard to see the redeeming qualities in Bethesda since the burning garbage fire that is Fallout 76. Again great game made by a great company with shitty executives!"

Set foot into Tamriel once again, the legendary province of Skyrim. Birthplace of the nords, slayers of dragons, and some idiot trying to jump up a mountain so he can force shout a goat off of it. Yeah it's a bit ludicrous as far as RPGs go but it's fun!

[b]Controls:[/b]
Mouse and keyboard or controller, both are equally comfortable in first or third person.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Not hard, it's a very dumbed down RPG experience. That's not to say it isn't fun, but you aren't going to be breaking out the spreadsheets for this one folks.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
This older version of the game does need a lot for the graphics and the optimization of those graphics. It runs a lot less smoothly, but I don't know if that makes it any less stable.

[b]Audio:[/b]
The voice acting is pretty lackluster, but the soundtrack, dragons, shouts, and other general effects are really great. I would say using Sounds of Skyrim pushes this even further into perfection territory.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Insanely high with the myriad of mods and alternate stories you now have access to through the Nexus. I'm going to mention Nexus a lot. Because while this game does hold up on its own it is so much more with mods.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
Skyrim continues to permeate internet culture, and there's good reason why. While many berate the game for its numerous bugs and general lack of depth when compared to its sister titles, Skyrim is a fun experience for gamers of all types in its vanilla form. If you're a hardcore gamer, enjoy the delights of breaking the skill system to become a walking god. If you're a softy, just sit back and take in the countryside and cave systems of the Nordic lands.

The game really shines with its huge selection of mods from Nexus and other sources, many of which improve upon the aforementioned bugs and serve to deepen the experience Skyrim can give you. Make Skyrim a survival game if you want, or make it have guns, or even make yourself a chicken. Lots of things are possible with the mods, including enhanced ENB graphics.

[b]What I Don't[/b]
There are far too many rereleases of this game, causing fracture in the modding community. Aside from that, there are (as stated) numerous bugs and issues within the game which really need to be fixed via community patches to get the full pleasure from the game.

[b]Judgement[/b]
While I haven't had a huge amount of time with Skyrim's SE, I spent well over 1,000 hours playing this classic release on console, and then have clocked about 200 more on the LE from Steam. So all-in-all nearly a decade later this title holds up as fun. Buy it."
29211,Without mods it is mediocre at best. However countless legions of mods make it truly fun
29212,Did you erase all DLC? or they where all integrated to the base game?

29252,I'd recommend this game to nursing homes that allowed their elderly the abilities to play the game.  Game make you use your mind and to think in the blink of an eye.  What better way to keep ones mind sharp?

29262,"I've played this game since it first came out. It takes a long time for me to get bored with it, and then I just change up the way I play to make it different or more challenging. Love it. Not a perfect game, but you won't regret playing."

29270,"Ever heard of Skyrim? yea well its still pretty new so im not suprised, you should totally buy it its great!"
29271,The publisher's decision to promote the Special Edition and not discount anymore the original game and DLCs is one of the most atrocious proofs of greed I ever witnessed in the gaming industry.

29288,perhaps the bet game ever made still get the itch to play this 8 years after release
29289,"Imagine Diablo 2 + Final Fantasy 7 + Dungeons and Dragons= Skyrim

Freaking awesome game, lads. Quests and content MUCH better than I was expecting. I will be buying Elder Scrolls 6 next year, no questions about it."
29290,"Workshop
Nexus
Play it"

29294,perrty gud
29295,"It's fun, it has adventures, and you can mod it so it looks better. The story is also long and good too."
29296,"On its own its an average if that game, where this games thrives is its modding community giving you lore friendly and not so lore friendly mods that expand the game play and far more one of if not my favorite games of all time because of the replayability due to mods would recommend to any of you that have not played this

8/10 would play again."
29297,"The Elders Scrolls V is without doubt, one of the most popular games of all time (and one of the greatest), being important still today. It is a very addictive game, although the problems it carries. There's a lot of bugs ( which may affect your gameplay), a poor AI, and a promising main story not well developed (in my opinion). What makes it a masterpiece, is it immersive world background and sidequests, a very simple combat system, easy to grasp in, and tons of things to do, as you will get lost by the stories of the citizens of Skyrim continent. The sidequest are so addicting, that you will know a lot of people who probably never finished the main story. So yes, even though it has problems that i mentioned (and a lot more), it is totally worth your time."
29298,great game
29299,This game wets my whistle
29300,"Simply the best game ever, If you get tires of vanilla gameplay just get some mods from the workshop or other modding sites. Truly the best game of the decade."
29301,ITS REALLY FUKING GOOD. AD MODS FO MO FUNS.

29309,good game
29310,just simply.....is the best adventurous game
29311,It just works (works better with mods)

29313,"Yeah it's cool, but its not as cool as reading the bible"
29314,never never stops
29315,x
29316,fun but needs more editions.
29317,"Gotta love how the original is never on sale, and is hidden away. :P"
29318,Fus Roh Dah
29319,"I love this game.  Quests are interesting, and even make me laugh, or say ""oh wow"" lol.  I don't mod, because I don't want the headache of updating mods etc.  Base game is enough for me.  Many different ways to play, and you can branch out in a lot of different ways.  It's an older game but still stands out in 2020."
29320,"Although the game feels less deep after a few playthrough, and one quickly figures out how to ""game"" the game pretty quickly, Skyrim still remains one of the most iconic gaming experiences of the decade. The enormous modding community keeps this game fresh and enjoyable even 9 years later."
29321,"I think I've spent more time modding skyrim than actually playing it. If you are looking to get DEEP into some questionable skyrim modding I would typically recommend the standard edition of skyrim as it generally has more mod support. However at the time of typing this Special Edition is seeing more and more love from the modding community. If you actually just want to PLAY skyrim I 100% recommend the Special Edition. 

I bought skyrim back in 2011 on release and at the time of writing this review I've finally bought the special edition as I plan on starting a new playthough again soon. Really a World Class sandbox RPG of its time and endless possibilities thanks to modders."
29322,it fun
29323,"It's got some incredible lore behind it, and it's so satisfying to take down a dragon and absorb it's soul."
29324,Great fun to go back and play again as a new toon
29325,Even though it is several years old it somehow is still very good and i always enjoy playing through it time after time.
29326,it gud
29327,JOE
29328,It is Skyrim for the PC...
29329,"Literally one of my favorite games of all time. I've enjoyed Skyrim for years. It obviously has it's strange bits and pieces that throw it off at times, but some of the bugs are charming. Adding a few graphic mods to tune the lighting and textures boosts the immersion vastly. Even without them Skyrim is beautiful."
29330,Good game
29331,10/10
29332,It is a great game with a lot of history to it. It has a lot of mods which can make the RPG aspect of the game even greater and can enhance your experience towards your specificity.
29333,good play
29334,"I remember playing Skyrim on the xbox 360 and having a lot of fun. Shortly after I had gotten Steam, Skyrim went on sale for an extremely low price so I got it, still as good as I remembered."
29335,"Have played multiple builds, prefer Nord warrior but have enjoyed playing all.  That is why I like it so much. Each character plays differently and that provides changes of pace. Also you can pause anytime and not worry about game continuing without you."
29336,"I had this game on PS3, and now that I don't have a PS3 I have it on my laptop. It is one of the greatest games of all time, worth playing through multiple times."
29337,cures my depression
29338,"Bethesda took this off search list EVEN IN YOUR STEAM LIBRARY! 

to find it again in your library just search for skyrim on the search bar. 

DO NOT SUPPORT THE ""SPECIAL ED EDITION"" AND THEIR RETARD SUPPORTERS WHO WILLINGLY PAID $20-60+ MORE FOR THE SAME GAME THEY ALREADY OWN WHO WHINE ABOUT IT ON THE NEXUS ASKING FOR SE MOD SUPPORT ON EVERYTHING!

 ITS THE SAME FUCKING GAME!

SE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DLCS THE ORIGINAL HAS!"
29339,I got caught up in another forty-hour playthrough of this game so I guess I should finally give it a thumbs up.
29340,"Skyrim is game of the decade for me, it has had a massive impact on the way I play games and has been huge inspiration for my writing."
29341,yep.
29342,Always
29343,"In general, a definitive mid-to-low magic fantasy setting. From an outsider's perspective (as my first in the series), a great showing for the Elder Scrolls series. Everything you hear about the game is true. From top to bottom it feels like a full and immersive world of people. I've spent 100 hours in the game, and barely scratched the surface. You can just come back to the game, and get a new playthrough unlike any other.

And holy cats there are a huge amount of mods. Mods for armour. Mods for snow. Mods for grass. Mods for adult themes and kid safe worlds alike. Ride a dragon. Ride a MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE dragon. Ride an MLP pony. Get a light saber. Run naked through Morthal. It's not ""can it be done"", it's ""has it been made yet?""."
29344,"I've got it on numerous platforms since it came out and I still pick it up every now and again. A great game, however, mods make it 100x better"
29345,"its good
"
29346,"I love this game and always will. Even when I'm old and every game functions like the Matrix, I will still laud this game as one of the greats."
29347,"While it can be pretty repetitive and stuff with the quests, overall this is actually a really fun game. I enjoy how in a way, your quests/path changes depending on if your a werewolf, vampire or just a mortal. So I would definitely recommend this game to others."
29348,FUSRODAH
29349,good game
29350,yes
29351,"Classic, love it"
29352,great game
29353,"Amazing just amazing

29354,Good.
29355,nice
29356,a classic game. will never get old.
29357,its skyrim what do you expect
29358,MUST have.
29359,"This is above me.
"
29360,One of if not the best video game RPG in existence as of writing this
29361,Great open world game. So much to do. 244 quests I think
29362,lol
29363,Lydia is best girl XD
29364,"I am really not sure who reads the reviews of Skyrim anymore. Even my grandma knows that Skyrim is one of the greatest games of all time.
But anyway, I would recomend it if you have a few hundred hours to spare."
29365,veri gut
29366,Played a bit of it. Pretty fun game. Will update review once I play a bit more.
29367,Its good
29368,Why are you looking in the reviews you already know Skyrim is a good game
29369,big titty bitches
29370,I mean its skyrim. one of the best games out there. Enough said
29371,Great value due to being able to change vanilla conent and add your own
29372,good game
29373,timeless
29374,Very involving fantasy adventure game.
29375,"This is the story of the Dragonborn.  From humble beginnings you rise to...almost literally whatever you want to be.  Want to be Archmage? Go for it?  Werewolf?  We got you covered.  How about a vampire?  Yup.  Or you can just sneak around the wilderness hunting.  Buy a house.  Get a wife.   Have that wife be a wall-clipping, teleporting maniac who somehow always manages to JUST have enough space to carry that ONE thing you need but nothing else. Where else can you click accidentally on an item on the counter instead of the man you wish to speak to and have to slaughter the entire village guard to escape their provincial justice?  The game (especially with the copious mods) is hands-down one of the best single player rpg's ever."
29376,Its alright
29377,Best Rpg of all time
29378,it's ok
29379,"Probably my favorite game in my Steam collection. Between the large open world, quests, and the endless ways to amuse yourself, I find this game never gets old. I'm 331 hours in, and the only other game that's kept me attached this long is Minecraft."
29380,One of the best games I have played.
29381,It is fun and you can get a ton of hours out of it.
29382,I used to be an adventurer like you until I took an arrow to the knee.
29383,Best game ever made!!
29384,gud game very nice
29385,"fuck u

29386,lots of fun and endlessly moddable

29390,is very gud
29391,"Good game, lots of fun."
29392,"j,mhgkjhg
"
29393,mods
29394,"I very much recommend this game, especially for RPG lovers like me. I will say however, the vanilla game is very buggy; but the quests and lore is amazing. Just like other users, you'll probably want mods to cover up Bethesda's mistakes. DLC is also a great expansion to the game since the vanilla version can get pretty boring sometimes (especially if you've been playing since release). In the end, this game is absolutely one of my favorites and definitely one of the greatest games of the decade.

P.S. Hurry up with Elder Scrolls VI already Bethesda."
29395,good
29396,"its kinda good, especially with mods"

29447,"Bland on its own, but absolutely fantastic with mods.
Hell, even the weird fetish mods make the game more interesting!
In other words, play the game without mods to get a feel for it, then go absolutely fucking crazy with any mods that you find worth your time. 
Soo...
Yeah. Mods make the game, in this instance. You can play the game without them, but you'll be missing some incredible features, stories and other dumb shenanigans without mods."
29448,"Still a great game to play, love it."
29449,"Had this game since it came out got it on all gaming systems so if you want too be a Explorer,Fighter, Magi then this game has it all you can become the stuff of legend!"

29454,It is the best game for newbs and plebs like me.

29462,"(THIS IS FROM MY 9TH GRADE ESSAY SO IF IT SEEMS A BIT LONG AND ONGOING IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT)

    Skyrim has won well over 200 perfect review scores and Game Of The Year Awards. Skyrim is made and released by Bethesda in 2011, and it is the fifth game in a series called ""The Elder Scrolls""; which gives Skyrim the full name of ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"". Skyrim is a lore and story-rich, single-player, open world, rpg game. Skyrim is a great game because of character creation, Immersive experience, and mods.
    From skills to the physical attributes of a character, the character creation in Skyrim gives you an immense amount of options to create your own character suited to the playing style that you want to play. However, with all the options, an inexperienced player that has not researched prior to playing the game could be overwhelmed. There are 10 different playable races, 18 different skill trees, and 20 different dragon shouts, so that could be a bit much. Each race has their own independent racial ability, such as, an Argonian can breathe underwater, whereas a Khajiit has claws that can do +15 unarmed damage. Each race also has their own independent power that they can only use once daily, such as a Bosmer's power can make an animal an ally for 60 seconds, whereas an Orc's power can receive half damage and do double danage for 60 seconds.
    From the sounds of your character striking an enemy to the music that plays when you are peacefully exploring, Skyrim definitely has the aspects of an immersive gameplay experience that makes the player feel like they are actually in the game. There are a total of 273 quests not including the infinite amount of radiant quests. There are also only a few people that have fineshed Skyrim with 100% completion. Sometimes when I am playing Skyrim I get so immersed and focused onto the game that when my parents come in I try to look at them through the game by moving the mouse in real life. When you play Skyrim you are engulfed with the sounds, music, scenery, occasional diseases, and lore that make up the immersive experience.
    There are lots of mods for Skyrim. On nexusmods.com Skyrim has the most amount of mods at 65.6 thousand mods. There are mods to make the game run smoother and be less buggy. There are mods to turn dragons into flying Thomas The Tank Engines, and turn spiders into contortioned Spidermans. Skyrim mods can be made for functionality or just for fun and sometime even both. Mods make the game become your own sort of playground.
    The character creation, immersive experience, and mods are the aspects that make Skyrim a great game. When you are playing Skyrim I would recommend having a tab on your phone or pc of https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim so that when you don't know what or where some things are you have that resource. I would also recommend saving the game alot because sometimes Skyrim will crash at random. Skyrim is a game for people that like to explore and also don't mind having to kill things or NPCs. Although Skyrim lets you make a fork the most powerful weapon in the game, lets your horse climb up a mountain, and many other bugs, Skyrim also has alot of other good qualities that outweigh the bad."

29466,"The best part about this game, is when you get farkas' thicc ass to become your companion"
29467,"I played Dungeons and Dragons a lot as a kid. There was always a term that was thrown around in the game lore that had a much larger meaning than it initially implied: adventurer. See an adventurer in that game was more than just someone who did quest or killed rats in cellars. An adventurer was a collective term for the outcast of society, the criminals, the discriminated and also the opportunist, the people brave enough to plunder a dangerous market or even the people who couldn't stay in one place. It was more than a mercenary or a priest sent out to vanquish evil. Being an adventurer was something liberating but also comforting for people without stability.

Skyrim is one of the few games that captures the feeling of being an adventurer in D&D. You play as a no-name immigrant who gets caught crossing the border into Skyrim during a civil war and fails miserably. That's it. That's all your character's backstory. Everything else is something you make. Maybe you were a bounty hunter tracking your quarry, maybe you were a Wizard looking to plunge the ancient ruins of Elven civilizations, maybe you actually were just a criminal trying to gain access into Skyrim. The beauty of this start is you make your character.

The basic gameplay loop is rather simple: do quest and level up. Your skills level up by usage meaning if you swing a sword enough your sword skill improves. This encourages you to take quest that take advantage of your skills. Some quest even have benefits (The Mage's Guild is the only way to get master spells for example). What's really important here is the amount of options available here. You could join a Warrior's Guild called The Companions after the ancient 500 companions of a famous Skyrim hero, you could opt for a more selfish goal and join the Thieves' Guild or you could even become a vampire. In my playtime I played a kind of craftsmen character who crafted weapons, armors, potions and poisons with the aid of enchantments. I would sell those for a huge profit and then go plundering frozen caves for more ingredients. I played my character as self-serving and cunning and many quest allowed me to be that character. I crashed a ship to loot the wreckage, I stole my way across Skyrim and eventually built a house to settle down in. All of these things felt like the kinds of things I did in D&D back in the day and it was a liberating experience.

Now the game does suffer from some rather serious bugs. From quest items disappearing to certain hats deleting your hair while you wear them. Well good news for you: Modding is easy. See Skyrim has without a doubt the single most dedicated modding community to ever live and there are countless mods to not only fix the problems with this game but add even more to it's already fit-to-bursting pool of content. In my modded playthroughs I've become a Lich, gone to another canon nation, explored alternate dimensions and even completely overhauled the leveling system.

This game is a absolute item for RPG fans and the only reason Bethesda is still in business despite not releasing an original game for nearly 8+ years at one point. I cannot recommend this game enough and highly encourage anyone who hasn't played it to give it a shot."
29468,"Classic stuff, yall"
29469,it is A gud gam
29470,gg
29471,One of the best games ever made imo.
29472,"I love skyrim. The open world concept is amazing. The main story line is TOP NOTCH. Follow it if you want, or not at all. You go through a small beginning scene, and then it poops you out into the open world. Left, right, up, down, backwards, forwards. ANYWHERE you want. That's what I love about this game. Bethesda did an outstanding job. Also, if you are into this; the lore and backstory to this game is crazy detailed! You could spend hours just doing research on the deities, wars, and overall history of Tamriel (the land Skyrim is based in). 10/10 would recommend to ANY gamer, or even as someone's first game."
29473,"break the game
"
29474,<3
29475,always been an amazing game love it
29476,Amazing Best Game Ever!
29477,Me like. Game good.
29478,Great game on its own. Once you get bored you can add mods and be entertained for hours.
29479,Come on. Its Skyrim. Top three games of all time
29480,Liked Everything

So great."

29483,you play it all different way
29484,You know it's the best.
29485,Game stole a lot of time I could've used to sleep
29486,"I've bought and played Skyrim across multiple consoles for many hours with all the dlc and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoy rpg games. Skyrim can keep you busy with its massive world, random events, and massive modding community."
29487,I Love this game I bought it in every platform I play. If you like action rpg in a medieval fantasy world this is your game. The only problem is... you can't stop. I'm already waiting for a remake in 5 years with VR tech established.
29488,"It Just Works- Todd Howard

But ya good game really long and never a dull adventure with a wooden bowl in the inventory"
29489,"everyone knows elderscrolls and fallout series are the best franchises ever . EVER . Do i really need to review?
Endless options with all the mods available for either.  I own this game on xbox and pc . its been worth every penny since day one . If only every developer had the skill these guys do ."
29490,a
29491,"10/10 great game
"
29492,Games alright. Buggy but mods fix it and make it great! Remember not to trust Bethesda anymore.
29493,A fun game from my childhood.
29494,BEST GAME EVER!!!!! In my opinion it's a really good game. The mods you can get with it makes it ten times better too.
29495,"Soundtrack - 8/10
Gameplay -  10/10

29496,I have lost so many days to this game. Everytime I restart its a new adventure love it!

29499,awesome
29500,replay value
29501,"Can play differently each time, worth the price and all DLC is a good but not required. Sadly steam hides this version."
29502,"amazing

29503,I can kill cat people.

I spent so many hours playing this game in the past. Mod it immediately to fix  all the Bethesda  jank"
29507,good game
29508,fun and progress steadly
29509,"Very good game, love it when giants send you to space!"
29510,dsfdv
29511,"It's fun
"
29512,"bought this game on december 2019 and I still loved this game.
The main story and the quest are phenomenal, the map is huge and fun to explore and you´ll probably get hooked on skyrim.
You won´t even notice the old graphics."
29513,cool
29514,yes
29515,"Across multiple systems, I have well over 1000 hours into this game. Very few games have ever reached this point for me. Even with all my complaints and minor issues with this game, I will gladly overlook ever single one of them to spend another 100+ hours roll playing a specific character and giving myself weird challenges. 
"
29516,"Skyrim was my first Elder Scrolls game that I played when it came out. I have loved every minute of playing the game and I have played some different alts on it. The game for it's age now, never gets old and it totally has a lot of replay time. Highly recommend!"
29517,"you can be sent to space by a single hit from a giant.
10/10
"
29518,BUY GAME AGAIN
29519,Is great.
29520,"It just works. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Ps. If you haven't tried the mods already, you're missing a lot of fun content. There's a DLC-like mod called Enderal, just look it up and you'll see what I mean."
29521,Amazing game : variations and modding available with ease using Nexus
29522,"I like the story lines and multiple plot points for each quest. And how depending on which quests you do can actually have an effect on your character. *Spoiler Alert* For example during one of my play through's I fought against Whiterun, burning the whole city to the ground. Though I don't remember which quest lead me to that point. I've been a vampire and burned in the sun. I've been a werewolf and won countless battles with human foe. My point being that the game changes depending on your choice of quests and I like that sense of reality."
29523,ZAJEBISTE
29524,It's a great game to play
29525,Never ending fun.
29526,love the game have it on multiple consoles
29527,"Skyrim is a beautiful and well made game, I have over 400 hours on record for this game due to its insane replayability and its outstanding community who have created tens of thousands of mods both over the steam workshop and the nexus. This game is an example of a bethesda game done right."
29528,There are no words to describe this game. Every person should play it.
29529,Its Skyrim. What more do I need to say
29530,the game itself it is awesome but on the pc it has soo manny bugs i cant play it normally
29531,One of my favorites games!
29532,nothing

29534,YOIT
29535,this is best rpg
29536,nude mods
29537,Very Good Much shouting
29538,pog
29539,All around good fun.  Always new things to do with people constantly adding mods to the game to make it an all around good experience.
29540,The best so far.
29541,"If you've not bought Skyrim, why?"
29542,I had a good time with this when I had played this it's alright
29543,"Modded yes, vanilla not so much"
29544,cant play game due to cart bug in beginning.
29545,very enjoyable
29546,this game does NOT DANG WORK
29547,One of the best games ever made!
29548,"Great game been playing it for years, never get bored of it even after main quests are done you always find more things to do."
29549,I mean c'mon it's Skyrim
29550,mods made this game
29551,very good game if you have not played played it.
29552,Eh its cool I guess.
29553,"Literally the best role-playing RPG game ever to me
"
29554,It's kind of fun.
29555,"The Original. Modding gave it a 2nd, 3rd, etc wind."
29556,everything is great
29557,"yeah, it's aight."
29558,my favorite game
29559,"just do it
"
29560,
29561,4 hours in and im already hooked. its a shame they hid this version of the game off the market to promote their shite with modding
29562,"Very good game as vanilla. Even better game with mods! Hearthfire is neccesary in my opinion. Because having a husband and kids, (and a farm with mods) is so dreamy and calming. I could spend days just wandering the woods of Skyrim. (I switched from PS3 and PS4 to PC. My real gaming time of Skyrim is far over 500 hours, maybe roughly 2000-3000 hours.) Highly recommended."
29563,"Yeah, it's quite good, and the modding community is still active nearly a decade later, giving it continued replayability."
29564,just love the style and interaction and multitude of quests
29565,f
29566,.
29567,"Great game with an expansive storyline and lots of options in how to play. I am a couple of hours from having completed all the quests and collecting all the artifacts, as well as finding every location, but there is a large amount of playtime left, given the number of expansions and rewrites."
29568,good game. nice open world map.
29569,"It's good
"
29570,Unbelievable replayability.
29571,Epic gamer game
29572,it's pretty alright.
29573,"I mean its Skyrim, what more is there to say"
29574,add a few sex mods and you can say goodbye to pornhub
29575,"There isn't much to say about Skyrim that other people haven't already said. The intro is long and slow --- I keep bouncing off, even though I've played several other Elder Scrolls games. There is a huge amount of content, obviously, and I haven't seen any significant percentage of it. But the content I have seen doesn't keep me playing. And, as my daughter emphasizes, the game doesn't have enough screaming goats."
29576,Great game to get sucked into for hours. Best part is being a level 15 and getting stuck on a save with a dragon that is just high enough level that you can't beat it and having to go back two hours of game play because you forgot to save just so you'll stop dying. 10/10.
29577,it never gets boring... with mods of course 10/10 would buy again
29578,best game ever. amazing side quests. huge world. endless fun. cannot recommend enough.
29579,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bethesda kinda homosexual (nohomophobia)
29580,"This is an amazing game, of course its known as one of the best games for its generation and thats completely true"
29581,GOOD GAME
29582,yes
29583,"d_d
"
29584,good
29585,so good
29586,really cool with so much to do
29587,"Hands down one of the best Games of all time. Its not my favorite game, but I have to say its good based on the fact that its the only game I own on pc, ps4, switch, and had on ps3. I haven't bought one thing that many times before."
29588,Skyrim is so intricate and replayable because it's so BIG!So many quests and areas.I've played for 10 years and still find new stuff.It's awesome.
29589,best game of the decade
29590,"expansive and fun, able to play your own way. alot of detail in the world and fun to mess around with once the game is done thanks to mods
"
29591,What can I say about a game that I still want to play so many years after it's release? This one has staying power because you can just keep modding the game for a new experience. Even the base game has secrets that I'm still finding years later. Good stuff.
29592,were you born under a rock its good
29593,Foosh
29594,"it good
"
29595,"Yeah, its an alright game
"
29596,"This is one of the best game of this decade and probalby the best RPG i ever played, the freedom that bethesda gave us is incredible and the modding community is among the finnest in gaming industry."
29597,"Alright game
about 200 hours of actual play time no more
"
29598,"It's been ages since I played Morrowind, but I get the same vive playing Skyrim. Amazing game.
I'm playing it years after it's release and it's still extremely fun. You always want to explore a bit further."
29599,It's Skyrim
29600,"Skyrim is one of the best PC games every made with great character development, first person combat, an open world system, and great mods."
29601,yes
29602,"Buy Todd's game, please, he has my family"
29603,tod what a god
29604,Don't really know what to say other then this game is awesome and it stands the test of time; mods help that as well.
29605,I have a thousand more on my Switch
29606,ITS FUCKIN SKYRIM!!!!!!!!!!
29607,yes
29608,This game is shit
29609,Best game EVER!
29610,This game is an instant classic! My only issue is that it does have some glitches but nothing that stops it from being on my list of top 10 games.
29611,It is still a glorious mess-terpiece.
29612,i'm not still playing this game if that's what you think xD
29613,"yes

29618,"Massively open world, strong story lines & plenty of mods for when the campaign is completed."
29619,"Swords, Dragons and a whole lot-a sloot mod's."
29620,good
29621,"Don't get too greedy, Todd."
29622,"epic win
"
29623,This game literally changed my childhood and my opinion of RPG games. God bless you todd for shoving a new version of this game every few years.
29624,".
"
29625,this is a bethesda game. don't expect anything more and you'll enjoy yourself.
29626,"Eh, it's okay."
29627,"Best rpg ever. I can hardly wait for Elder Scroll VI. Yeah there's a few bugs, but nothing so serious to interfere with game play. There's lots and lots of quests, both along the main story line as well as many others. And there's lots of directions to go while playing."
29628,excellent game with any mods you want to add
29629,fun
29630,gud gaeym
29631,I like how it runs sometimes
29632,Good game
29633,This is the most fun and immersive and BEAUTIFUL game I've ever personally played. I love getting lost in Skyrim!
29634,its a master piece but it gets boring after playing it for over 500 hour on a different account
29635,fun fun fun
29636,10/10
29637,"Even after 500 plus hours of play, I still cant get far enough to say that it's a game for achievement hunters and the like, there's plenty of content and mods that make this game endlessly enjoyable. It'll be that way for a good long time."
29638,"The game is gloriously violent :) !  However the game as a whole is very bare bones without a ton of mods to improve and/or add to it.  There is no minimap like there is in other games.  The quest system just barely exists.  And in order to find every quest you are required to talk to each and every npc in the game :P.  Also mages are completely unusable without mods :(  The only thing that makes this better than Elder Scrolls Online at this point are the violence and the huge number of player mods.  Hopefully Elder Scrolls 6 will be just as violent, allow all player made mods, and have the kind of improvements we saw in Elder Scrolls Online.  It would be cool if the next one had more visible elemental effects ""ie you could set enemies on fire and have them screaming with fire spells, freeze them solid and then shatter them with ice spells, and cause them to twitch uncontrollably and emit steam with electrical spells :)"".  Somewhat randomized  worn gear on enemies would be cool too.  Also I don't see why armor on the chest piece isn't divided into top and bottom ""chest and pants""?  Most importantly, if the next Elder Scrolls isn't as rated M a game as this one I'm giving it a pass."
29639,"i love this game so much i only have a short amount of hours on pc but on xbox ive spent so much time into this game i love it so much
"
29640,Everyone knows Skyrim at this point and how good it is. Just figured I'd chime in
29641,"It's Skyrim. It has more players now then when it came out like 10 years ago. If that doesn't say ""I need to play this"" to you by now, well, you might be beyond help."
29642,tis game great man
29643,good game <3
29644,very good
29645,very awesome when modded
29646,Not ported to enough consoles. 0/10

29649,A classic.
29650,mod the heck out of it

29665,big funny
29666,game is great
29667,"Oh my gosh. What isn't there to love? Definitely prefer PC version over console editions. Just got it again on my Switch and while I love the portability, I really miss the console commands. My headcanon characters were already leveled when they came to Skyrim, so building up the stats from nothing again is really irritating. That being said, I love this game in every one of its incarnations. One of my favorite games ever."
29668,"immersive, never a dull moment, its really replayable, you dont feel like your being forced to do anything"
29669,Good
29670,"Todd Howard has my family, i must like this game or he game ends them. 10/10 would turn nazeem into a cheese wheel again"
29671,Best RPG ever made. Limitless gameplay with realistic graphics and character control. I've played it for years and still find new things to do.

29692,HELL YEAH. I love chopping peoples head off
29693,Great to play while waiting for your dad to get back from buying cigarettes.
29694,Yes
29695,"This game is one of the best I've ever played. It's the sequel of the Elder Scrolls games, but you totally can play it without having ever heard of this series of game, like I did. This RPG has a very unique lore, and once you started learning of something you just can't stop looking for more. The reason why I love this game is because each person who plays it will have a different experience, so I definitly recommend it to anyone who has an interest into RPGs. Even when after several hours, you manage to finish the game, there still are DLCs and mods to play even more."
29696,I loved this game
29697,best game
29698,"Nothing to say, easily one of the best games ever made."
29699,"I definitely recommend this game. The dawnguard DLC is so awesome, tho. 
[spoiler] Being a vampire lord, or even the normal vampire, is really a fun. [spoiler]"
29700,"Skyrim continues to, in my opinion, lead the first person fantasy RPG genre. Though not as polished an experience as games such as CD Projekt Red’s Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the expansive yet tightly-packed game world provides plenty of reasons to return time and time again.

Gameplay is solid, albeit with some classes clearly outweighing others in terms of effectiveness. Combat is easy to pick up but unfortunately doesn’t progress beyond the initial learning curve thereafter. Stealth gameplay is a product of its time, with enemy AI decidedly lacking.

Conversations are varied, despite any “arrow in the knee” jokes suggesting otherwise, and each city feels lived in and full of stories to be told. It is a shame to see most missions devolve into hacking and slashing your way to a solution. Despite the options available to the developers to integrate more intelligent solutions (see The Outer Worlds for an example).

The soundtrack is a triumph, as was predicted from the initial trailer all those years ago. The word is given additional spectacle due to its presence, while the sound design for caves and dungeons add atmosphere to otherwise similar-looking environments.

Overall, Skyrim continues to be a worthwhile purchase for fans of the genre. It is held back by the passing of time, however, with mod support, the game can easily close down some of that gap and give modern day fantasy RPGs a run for their money."
29701,"I have no idea why people still play this, it was unfinished, broken game on release, modders made it into Medieval Sims and Bethesda keeps cashing in on re-releases."
29702,"ive played since the release in 2011, preordered in 2016 and even now im still havin fun with it."

29704,"With mods you can make Skyrim into an epic role-playing story of epic proportions, with epic fights and epic epics! ...or just get some skimpy clothing for your Argonian maid and fight Thomas the Train, that's cool too...I guess."

29716,buggy hell
29717,"Game crashes all the time and I believe it was released way too soon. A game should at least run trouble free out of the box, without having to rely on the players fixing the errors written into the code. I doubt if I personally will be buying any more games from your company unless I hear about a change in practice on your behalf. I have better things to do than fix your stupid mistakes. You asked for my opinion and you have it now. Good Day."
29718,Great game with free roam and plenty of quests for hours of gaming.
29719,game game
29720,awesome game
29721,is good game

29723,10/10
29724,"You nought a nord, but a man of stendarrrrrr"
29725,"This game never gets old. There is a massive amount of things to do, to where you'd need to sink 250 hours to complete the full game. The main quest is strong, but the side quests that bring you through different facets of the gameplay give this game replayablility and strenth."
29726,"I love the open world. I've been a werewolf and a married human. You can do anything in this game. I've played for over 500 hours and only 40% through the achievements.  I get so sidetracked, but man it is a beautiful game with SO MUCH to do!!  Love it!!  I go and play other games but always come back to this one to do more and more."
29727,good game
29728,"YES, I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHER PLAYERS!"
29729,Years after the release I'm still playing it. Can't wait for the sequel
29730,"this game is an absolute masterpiece, ive played it on the xbox 360 when it first came out, pc, then remastered edition on ps4 this always is ok i got bored of talking about this game just trust me its amazing im gonna go play it now"
29731,Worth it :)
29732,"This is one of the games of the century. If you doubt, then press x, but you're missing out on some of the most enjoyable content in modern gaming."
29733,Just an all around wonderful game.
29734,Overall graphics...Storyline...There is nothing bad I can say about it.
29735,"Absolutely love this game, would rate it at the top for it being way ahead of its time. Definitely recommend and heard that the VR version is even better and is also considered one of the top games in VR. You can spend hours in this game whether you're diving into dungeons, battling dragons, or slaying vampires. The reason this game is so unique is because of the freedom you're given to create your character. You can be the hero or the villain whether it's as the dragon slaying god or the shadow walking assassin that killed the emperor. Definitely check this game out or you will be missing an absolute mind blowing experience..."
29736,ot has cool magic
29737,Its okay
29738,good
29739,It is a really fun game.
29740,"Skyrim at it's core is honestly one of the buggiest games I've ever played but it also one of the most influential games I've played (during it's release) The vanilla game is honestly not very good but is greatly enhanced when mods are applied to it. Especially since some bugs are game breaking (certain missions won't start, game crashes)

The game definitely gives you plenty to do in the overworld. I've sunken nearly 3k hours so far (due to playing, downloading mods, creating mods, taking screenshots) and I still find new things that I haven't come across before. The story however is pretty weak in the main game. 
For the DLCs though, I definitely recommend going through Dragonborn. It's packed with a lot of interesting quests to do and has some really nice visuals on the island. 


Combat is bland compared to a lot of games (Dragon's Dogma, Dark Messiah, Witcher 3 to name a few). Melee doesn't really have any sort of skills that you obtain. The stuff that you earn are usually basic actions that any other game has. 

Magic on the other hand can be fun to play but levels abysmally with the character. Mostly with Destruction magic. 
You can't level up Destruction magic AT ALL. The most you are able to do is buy stronger spells which will eventually not work very well against higher level enemies. 


Overall, if you're new to Open World games, this is a pretty laid back game to get into. However for those that are looking for a more quality experience, I feel like this game won't really be for you."
29741,One of my favorite games. Play vanilla first then add mods is my recommendation.
29742,THIS GAME!!!!!!!
29743,We all know why this is good. old but always fun and amazing.
29744,It is gud and mods make my pp hard
29745,Fantastic game. played it for hundreds and hundreds of hours!
29746,good game yes enjoy much many time very nice big roar many dragons
29747,Is gud
29748,Top 10 rpgs of all time
29749,"Been playing and modding Skyrim for years. With the amazing modding community, multiple playthroughs with different characters and mods ensures long term playability. And if you decide to create your own mod and do some extra tweaking to your game adds even more gaming goodness."
29750,buy it. Now. give them your money.
29751,"I know the steam version doesn't have many hours played, but I assure you I played a lot on the Xbox.  I loved the game for the first couple hours.  But the game unfortunately gets too repetitive and the open nature of the game is rather limited in more ways than people would like to admit."
29752,
29753,I don't know what else I can say at this point. It's just a good game and if you haven't played it yet you should.
29754,10/10
29755,yes
29756,Amazing game from Bethesda! Could use better optimization but best Beth game I've ever played. Graphics a bit outdated but a few mods fix that.
29757,"Ive played this game on many different consols over the years and every time i am always sucked in. Its beautiful, and full of many things to do if you get bored of the story,which, i have completed many times. I will never get tired of this game."
29758,just get lost in it :D
29759,it's fun
29760,the mods and the rp
29761,"AMAZING
"
29762,This game is the best game I have ever played. I highly suggest you at least try it.
29763,Very fun and a very large amount of space to explore with many interesting quests
29764,"Years after its release, it's still a pretty fun game despite the well known bugs. Amazing skill-tree, leveling system, etc. The mods for the game are also almost indefinite and can vastly change how you play the game."
29765,Ye
29766,SO much fun to just wander around and do whatever the hek you want
29767,b r u h
29768,skyrim good game

29772,.
29773,play this game
29774,I love the storyline and ability to really create my own adventure in the game.
29775,nice
29776,This game is such a classic. I've played for quite a long time and I love what it has to offer. Something that really adds to the game is all the mods you can get! There's some moments where I get bored so I just add mods and see what I can mess around with. It's pretty fun.
29777,"The best game of the decade 
"
29778,"I mean, as far as TES games go, it's the Second Best game after Morrowind, BUT, it's the best MODERN TES game for sure. Unfortunatly, it's very Nordic, which isn't the most interesting compared to pretty much ANY of the other races of Tamriel. 

It has the best game mechanics, best graphics, and best AI for sure."
29779,"From letherface to plastic dolls, how do you want your characters to look like?"
29780,.
29781,"This game has incredible graphics and gameplay. I've played for several years now and while Im not an avid gamer, this game has something to interest me notmatter how I feel that day. You can fight, bargain, craft, explore, or even just admire the view. My only problem with this game isn't even with the game itself, but with the fact that my computer isn't able to support most games. Regardless, I highly recommend this game to everyone who can use a mouse and keyboard."

29797,Best game ever Created!!!!! If you know what mods to use. Easiest game to get lost in.
29798,"Countless Hours of fun. You can follow the story line and/or take side quests. You can build a few houses, become the leader of multiple guilds and slay a slew of dragons. Good times."
29799,best game
